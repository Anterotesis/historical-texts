            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

needed. But still that Lordly Creature, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> should rule the Creatures being wanting, he was framed more glorious than all Creatures, as not made without mature Counsel and Deliberation, and stamped in the divine Similitude, inspired with the infused Breath of Life<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> beyond what any other Creature durst to boast: The contemplating of which, long since made the Royal <hi>Psalmist</hi> break out into this Rapture, <hi>What is Man that thou art mindful of him and the Son of Man that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the Angels, and hast Crowned him with Glory and Honour.

            </p>
            <p>Thus I say, when God hath created the World, and furnished it with whatsoever seemed good in his sight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and that there was nothing wanting for necessary use, commodity and pleasure, it seemed good to him then, to make one that might use them to his Glory, and take delight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in them. Wherefore, when Natures Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments were all compleat, He brought Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, as into his own Possession; and that he might not be disconsolate nor solitary, gave him a Woman for a Helper and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, infusing into them a source of Love and Desire towards each other, and of procreating their Likeness, having prepared for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:44491:5"/>
a swelling Humour or Spirit, and Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Parts; and that the one through fear of neglect should not be induced to decline the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the other, he added Allurements, and desire of mutual Embracing, that so they might in Procreation, be sweetly affected and delighted by wonderous ways: For unless this was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to all kind of Creatures, they would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless of Posterity and Procreation would cease, whereby Mankind would quickly be lost: and the affairs of Mortals of no continuance. But that this Passionate Desire might strongly operate, as well in Sensual Felicity, as on the Imagination, GOD has firmly impr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssed it in all Creatures subject thereto, both Male and Female; but more especially on Man: And least it should prove unruly in him, and not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily subdued, He has thought it convenient to prescribe him Bounds, and confine him to the Use of the Matrimonial Bed, that so they might not defile themselves with wandring Lust, who want the gift of Continency. Wherefore, so soon as Copulation is finished, and the Woman happens to prove with Child, great is Natures Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in furnishing the <hi>Embryo</hi> with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nutriment, that at the set time, when Nine Months are run over, Man, that Ruler and Ornament of the Sublunary World, may come forth; in relation to which Mystery of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Holy <hi>Job,</hi> in the Tenth Chapter of his

               <p>THAT Marriage is an Honourable State, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, and since Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by our Blessed Saviour, who wrought his first Miracle at a Wedding, I hope none will deny; therefore it is convenient that Parents will take care of their Daughters Chastity; and when they find them incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

and when they find them inclinable to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, not violently to restrain their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but rather to provide for them, if possible, such Husbands as may be for their Advantage, and with whom they may live comfortably in that blessed State, lest being crossed in their purposes, and delayed, they part with their Honour-dishonourable ways.</p>
               <p>The propension and inclination of Maids to marriage, is to be discovered by many Symtoms: For when they arrive to Puber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

External Causes also may promote and incite them to it; for the Spirits being brisk, and in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd when they arrive at this Age, if they eat salt sharp things, Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the Body becomes still more and more heated, than the irration and proneness to Veneral Embroces, is very great, nay, sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most insuparable. And a due use of these Enjoyments being deny'd to Virgins, very often produces very dismal Effects, as Green and Weasel-Colour, short Breathings, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings

of the Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is their eager gazing, and desiring to asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate themselves with Men, a lesser sign that Nature prompts them to desire what she or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their due; of which, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by obdurate Parents debarr'd in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, they break the bounds of Modesty, rather than endure such violent Agitations, and Conflicts within themselves, and so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate their desires in unlawful Love. The same may in all particulars be observed in young brisk Widows, whom Death (that Enemy of sweet Conjugal Love) has sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Bosom of their Husbands.</p>
               <p>At Fourteen years of age, commonly the <hi>Menses</hi> in Virgins begin to flow, and then they are capable of conceiving, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue generally to Forty-four; at what time for the most part, they are no longer capable of Generation, unless such as are exceeding healthful, strong of Body, and have used themselves to Temperance, who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be deliver'd of Children till Fifty five years; but such Prodigies rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, altho' the <hi>Menses</hi> continue longer in some Women than in others; but many times such Eflux proceeds not from any natural

If any ask why a Woman is sooner Barren than a Man</hi>? I answer, <hi>The Cause is the natural Heat, which is more predominant in the latter, than in the former: for since a Woman is more moist than a Man, as her Monthly Purgations do most evidently demonstrate, as also the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her Body; 'tis also apparent, that he doth exceed her in Native heat; and as for that heat, it is the chief thing that concocts the Humours into good and proper Aliment, which the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wanting, grows fat, when a Man, by reason of that heat, melts his fat by degrees, and his Humours are dissolved, but by the benefit thereof they are elaborated into Seed: And this may, for the better Confirmation of what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, be added, That the Woman generally is not so strong as a Man, nor so wise and prudent, nor hath so much reason, nor is so ingenious in contriving her Affairs, whereby the Faculties are hindred in their Operation.</hi> And so I conclude my Assertion:</p>

when Nature and the force of the Womb, by the use of her own inbred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Virtue, makes a manifest mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Conception, so that all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance seems Congealed Flesh and Blood, which happens about the 12 and 14 day after Copulation; and though this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation or Fleshy Mass abound with hot fiery Blood, yet it remains undistinguisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without form of figure, and may be called the rough draught, or <hi>Embryo,</hi> and well likened to Seed which is sown in the Ground, which through kindly Heat and Moisture grows up by degrees, into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect form, either in Plant or Grain; or as when a Potter Fashions a Vessel out of a rude Lump of Clay.</p>

Males for the most part, are perfect by the 30 day, but Females seldom till the 42 or 45 day; and the reason why the one is sooner perfected than the other, is, That the heat of the Womb is greater in producing the <hi>Male</hi> than the <hi>Female</hi>: For heat extends the Humour like soft Wax diffusing and dilating it, and then by its force, Contracting, Framing, and Fashioning it, so Heat and Vigour of the Body, and Alacrity of Nature in the Man, makes the <hi>Male</hi> to move in 3 Months, but the <hi>Female</hi> rarely under 4, at which time, also his Hair and Nails come forth, and <hi>the Child begins to stir, kick, and tumble in the VVomb</hi>; so that the motion is plainly perceived, and the Women are troubled with <hi>Nauseating,</hi> and <hi>Loathing</hi> of their Meat, and oftentimes covet, and greedily long for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44491:13"/>
things contrary to the Nutriment, as Coals, Rubbish, Chalk, Lime, Starch, Oat-meal, raw Flesh and Fish, or the like, which desire proceeds from a former contraction of evil Humours, occasioning impure Blood in their containing Vessel within, and often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions Abortion and Miscarriage; some Women, as it has been noted by divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Credit, have been so extravagant in their longings, that they have coveted <hi>Hob-Nails, Leather, Man's-flesh, Horse-flesh,</hi> and the flesh of divers Ravenous Beasts, for want of which they have cast their Birth untimely, or the Child has continued dead in the Womb for many days, to the eminent hazard of the Woman's Life: But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this great Mystery, I shall unfold by what means the Infant is sustained in the Womb, and the posture it there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in.</p>
               <p>The disputes among both Phylosophers and Physicians, with what, and by what way the <hi>Faetus</hi> is nourished, have been very great; some affirming, by Blood only, from the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vein; others only by Chyle, received in by the Mouth; but the Truth is, it is nourished diversly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different degrees of Perfection, than an <hi>Ovum</hi> or Egg passes from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to a <hi>Faetus</hi> ready for the Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:44491:13"/>But before we proceed; it will not be amiss to explain what we mean by this <hi>Ovam,</hi> or Egg. You must know then, that there are in the Generation of the <hi>Faetus</hi> two Principles, Active and Passive: The Active is the Man's Seed, which is elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Testicles out of the Arterial Blood, and Animal Spirits. The Passive Principle is an <hi>Ovum</hi> or Egg, impregnated by the Man's Seed. For to say that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has true Seed, is false and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But the manner of Conception is thus: The most Spirituous part of Man's Seed, in the Act of Generation, reaching up to the <hi>Ovarium</hi> or Testicles of the Woman (which contain divers Eggs, sometimes more some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fewer) secundates one of them, which being conveyed by the <hi>Ovi-ducts</hi> to the bottom of the Womb, presently begins to swell and grow bigger, and imbibes the moisture that is sent plentifully thither, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner that Seeds in the Ground suck the fertile moisture thereof to make them sprout.</p>
               <p>Then the parts of the <hi>Embryo</hi> begin to be a little more perfect, and the <hi>Chorion</hi> becomes so thick, that the Liquor cannot soak through it, that <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vessels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be formed, and to extend to the side of the <hi>Annios,</hi> which they pass through,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44491:14"/>
and also thro' the <hi>Allanteides</hi> and <hi>Chorion,</hi> and are implanted in the <hi>Placenta,</hi> which gathering upon the <hi>Chorion,</hi> joyns it to the <hi>Uterus.</hi> And now the Arteries that before sent out the nutritious Juice into the <hi>cavity</hi> of the Womb, open by their Orifices into the <hi>Placenta,</hi> where they deposite the said Juice, which is drunk up by the <hi>Umbilical Vein,</hi> and conveyed by it, first by the Liver of the <hi>Faetus,</hi> and then to the Heart, where its more thin and spiritous part is turned into Blood, whilst the grosser part of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending by the <hi>Aorta,</hi> enters the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Arteries, and is discharged into its Cavity, by those Branches of them that run thro' the <hi>Amnios.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Assoon as the <hi>Mouth, Stomach,</hi> and <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> &amp;c. are formed so perfectly that the <hi>Faetus</hi> can swallow, it sucks in some of the grosser <hi>Nutritious Iuice,</hi> that is deposited in the <hi>Amnios,</hi> by the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Arteries, which descending into the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Intestine,</hi> is received by the <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> as in <hi>Adust Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Faetus</hi> being perfected at the times before specified, in all its parts, it lies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ballanced, in the midst of the <hi>Womb</hi> as in the Center, all on a Heap; and being something long, is turned round, so that the Head a little inclines, and it lays its

               <p>THAT if a Woman in the Act of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation afford most Seed, her likeness will have the greater impression upon the Child; but if on the contrary, then will follow the contrary effects; or if a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable quantity proceed from either, then will the Similitude depend upon either.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lanctantius</hi> is of Opinion, That when a Man's Seed falls on the left side of the Womb, a Male Child may be gotten; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is the proper place for a Female, there will be something in it greatly resembling a Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> It will be fairer, whiter, and smoother, not very subject to have Hair on the Body or Chin, long lank Hair on the Head, Voice small and sharp, and the Courage feeble; and arguing yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he says, that a Female may perchance be procreated, if the Seed fall on the right Side; but then thro' extraordinary heat, she will be very large boned, full of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,

indued with a big Voice, and have her Chin and Bosom hairy, not being so clear as others of the Sex; subject to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with their Husband when married, for the Superiority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In case of the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nothing is more powerful than the Imagination of the Mother; for if she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in her Mind, or do by chance fasten her Eyes upon any Object, and imprint it in her Memory, the Child in its outward Parts, frequently has some representation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; so whilst a Man and Woman are in the Act of Copulation, if the Woman earnestly he hold his Countenance, and fix her Mind thereon, without all peradventure, the Child will resemble the Father; nay, so powerful is its Operation, that though a Woman be in unlawful Copulation, yet if fear, or any thing else, causes her to fix her Mind upon her Husband, the Child will resemble him, tho' he never got it. The same effect, according to the Opinion of the Learned, proceeds from Imagination in cause of Warts, Mold spots, Stains, Dashes, and the Figures of strange things, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they sometimes happen thro' frights or extravagant Longings: Many Women there are, that seeing a Hare cross them, when great with Child, will, through the strength of Imagination, bring forth a Child

But as I said on the contrary, when the Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are not in venerious Actions, and do liberally &amp; abundantly employ themselves therein, it oftentimes happens that the Children are of the same desires, manners, and actions of the Mind, with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir Parents. And thus much for the first point, now I shall proceed to the second, which is to shew, what share each of the Parents have in begetting the Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And first we will give the Opinion of the Ancients about it.</p>
               <p>Though it is apparent (say they) that the Seed of Man is the chief efficient and beginning of Action, Motion, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet that the Woman does afford Seed, and effectually contributes in that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44491:17"/>
particular to the Procreation of the Child, is evinced by strong reasons. In the first place, Seminary Vessels had been given them in vain and genital Testicles inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, if the Woman wanted Seminal exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; for being Nature doth nothing in vain, therefore it must be granted, that they were made for the use of Seed and Procreation, and fixed in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both the Testicles and Receptacles of Seed, whose nature and force is to operate, and afford fruitful vertue to the Seed; and to prove this, there needs no stronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (say they) than that, if a Woman do not use Copulation, to eject her Seed, she oftentimes falls into strange Diseases, as appears by young Widows and Virgins. A second reason they urge, that although the Society of a lawful Bed consist not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in these things, yet it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that the Female Sex is not better won<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> than a Man: For since by Nature much Delight accompanies the Ejection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by breaking forth of the swelling Spirit, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ion of the Womans part is double,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44491:18"/>
she suffering both ways, even by ejection and reception, whereby she is more recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and delighted in the Veneral Act.</p>
               <p>Hence it is (say they) that the Child more frequently resembles the Mother than the Father, because the Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the most towards its Generation: And they think it may be further instanced from the great love they bear them; for that besides their contributing Seminal matter, they, during the time they are in the Womb, feed and nourish the Child with the purest Fountain of Blood; which Opinion <hi>Galen</hi> confirms, by allowing the Child to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate more of the Mother than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and refers the difference of the Sex to the influence of menstrual Blood; but the reason of the likeness he attributes to the force of the Seed; for as Plants receive more from fruitful Ground than from the industry of the Husband-man, so the Infant in more abundance receives from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Father; for first, the Seed of both is heaped and fostered in the Womb, and there grows to perfection, being nourished with Blood. And hence they will have it, that Children for the most part effect their Mothers best, for it proceeds from the nearness of Nature, by a natural instinct, because the Mothers forces were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44491:18"/>
most employed about 'em? For 9 Months, and sometimes 10, she nourisheth the Child with her purest Blood, then her love towards it newly born, and the likeliness do clearly demonstrate, that the Woman affordeth Seed, and that Women do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more towards making the Child than Men. But in all this, the <hi>Ancients</hi> were very much in an Error, for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticles (so called) in Women, do not afford any Seed, but are true Eggs, anulogous to those of Fowls, and other Creatures; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any such Office as those of Men, but are indeed <hi>Ovarium,</hi> wherein these Eggs are nourished by the Sanguinary Vessels dispersed through them, and from whence one or more (as they are secunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Man's Seed) separated, and are convey'd into the Womb by the <hi>Ovi duces.</hi> The truth of this is plain; for if you boil them, their Liquor will have the same colour Taste and Consistency, with the white of Birds Eggs, to say that they want shells, is nothing at all; for the Eggs of Fowls, while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hey are in the Ovary, nay, after they have fallen down into the <hi>Uterus,</hi> have no shell, And though when they are laid they have one, yet that is more than a Fence, which Nature has provided them against outward Injuries, while they are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44491:19"/>
hatched without the Body, whereas those of Women, being hatched within the body, need no other fence than the womb, by which they are sufficiently guarded.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the clearing of this point also; and now to the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <hi>viz.</hi> Whence grows the kind, and whether the Man or the Woman is the cause of the Male or Female Infant.</p>
               <p>The primal cause is, as is justly due in this and all other Causes, we must ascribe to God the Ruler and Disposer of all things, yet many things by his high Sufferance, proceed in regular order, by the Rules of Nature, and are carried by their in-bred motion, according to their usual and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Course, without variation, tho' indeed by favour from on high. <hi>Sarah</hi> conceived <hi>Isaac; Hannah Samuel</hi>; and <hi>Elizabeth, Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>; but these were to fulfil the Almighty's Decree; nor since those times have the Prayers of the righteous been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful in obtaining Children; but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing over such Supernatural and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary causes that have their peculiar ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: I shall proceed to speak of things natural and common. The Antient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians and Philosophers say, that since there are two Principles, out of which the Body of Man is made, and which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44491:19"/>
the Child like the Progenitors, and to be of one of the other Sex, <hi>viz.</hi> Seed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both Sex, and menstrual Blood proper to the Woman only; The Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (say they) must needs consist in the force of the Male or Female Seed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so that it pgoves like to the one or the other, as more or less plenty is afforded by either: but that the difference of Sex is not refered to the Seed, but to the menstrual Blood, which is proper to the Woman; for were that force (say they) altogether retained in the Seed, the Mans Seed being of a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quality than the Womans, Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would be superabundant, and none of the other Sex (or very rarely) would be propagated, whereof the kind of the Creature is attributed to the temperament of the active qualities, which consist in heat and cold, and to the substance or nature of the matter under them, that is to the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the menstrual Blood: Now the Seed (say they) affords both force to procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and form the Child, and matter for its Generation, and that in the menstrual Blood there is both matter and force; for as the Seed most helps the material Principles, so likewise the menstrual Blood, the potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seed, is, saith <hi>Galen,</hi> Blood well conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Vessels that contain it, so that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44491:20"/>
Blood is not only the matter of generating the Child, but also Seed, in possibility that menstrual Blood hath both principles, as matter, and faculty of offering. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> say further, that the Seed is the strongest efficient, the matter of it being very little in quantity, but that the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or efficient faculty of it is very feeble: wherefore, if the material part or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Generation, according to which the Sex is made, were only (say they) in the menstrual Blood, then would the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be all, or mostly Females, as if the efficient force was in the Seed, they would be all Males: but that, since both have operation in menstrual Blood, Matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates in quantity, and in the Seed, Force and Vertue. Deservedly, saith <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi> the Child receives its Sex rather from the Mother than from the Father, although his Seed do contribute something to the material Principles though more weakly. But as for similitude, although Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (say the <hi>Ancients</hi>) be of extraordinary force, it is referred rather to the Father, than the Mother, as to the quality of the Seed, at, or for a short time after Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but continues not long so to do, for that the Woman's Seed receiving facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the menstrual Blood, for the space
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44491:20"/>
of Nine Months, over-powers the Man's, as to that particular, because the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strual Blood flowing into the Vessels, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cherishes and augments the one than the other; from which it may be more easily conjectured, that the Woman not only affords Matter to make the Child, but force and vertue to perfect the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though the Womans Seed be fit Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment for the Man's, by reason of the moisture and thinness of it, being more fit to frame, and make up Conception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; for as soft Wax, and moist Clay, the Work-man can frame what he intends, so, (say they) the Man's Seed mixing with the Woman's, as also, with the menstrual Blood, helps effectually to make the form and perfect part of Man; but (with all the respect &amp; deferance imaginable to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Ancients</hi>) we must needs say, that their Ignorance in Anatomy has led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many and great mistakes; and their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> of the formation of the <hi>Embryo,</hi> from a Commixture of Seeds, and the Nutrition of it from the menstruous Blood, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together false, their Opinion in this case must needs be false also.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to conclude this Chapter, we say, that although a strong Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mother may sometimes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

But such frivolous and superstitious Notions are to be rejected by Christians, and those true ones observed, which are both reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and agreeable to humane Capacities; for <hi>Orthodox Divines</hi> conclude in general, that the Soul is given to every Infant by

               <p>And although this day in all cases cannot be perfectly set down, yet <hi>Hypocrates</hi> has undertaken to give his absolute Opinion, when the Child has its perfect form, when it begins to move, and when born, if in due season; for in his Book, of the Nature of Infants, he affirmeth, That if it be a Male, and he be perfect on the thirtieth day, move at the sixtieth, he will come forth at the seventh Month; but if he be perfectly formed on the 35th. day, he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It has caused many disputes amongst the Learned, especially <hi>Philosophers,</hi> in what part of the Body the Soul chooses to reside; and some have given their Opinion, that its residence is in the middle of the Heart, and from thence communicates its self to every part; which <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the Fourth of his <hi>Proverbs,</hi> seems to assert, when he says, <hi>Keep thy Heart with all thy diligence, because Life proceedeth there from</hi>: but many curious Physicians searching the Works of Nature in Man's A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44491:25"/>
are arrived to maturity, yet no Man must imagine that the Soul is an Infant, and grows up with the Child, for then would it again decay; but it suits it self to the weakness of Nature, and the imbecility of Body, wherein it is placed, that it may the better operate. And as the Body is more and more capable of receiving its influence, so it shews its self in its proper lustre, having force and endowments at the time it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the former Child in the Womb, for the substance of it can receive nothing less: and thus much to prove that the Soul comes not from the Parents, but is infused by God. And the next thing now to be handled is its Immortality, and thereby I shall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the certainty of its Resurrection.</p>
               <p>That the Soul of Man is a Divine Ray, infused by God, I have already made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and now come to shew you that whatever immediately proceeds from him, must participate of his Nature, and from thence consequently, be as immortal as its Original; for although all other Creatures are indued with Life and Motion, yet want they a reasonable Soul: and from thence 'tis concluded, that Life is in their Blood, and that being corruptible, they perish, and after their expiring are no more. But Man being indued with a reasonable Soul, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44491:25"/>
stamped with the Divine Image, is of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature; and though his Body be corruptible, yet his Soul cannot perish, but must, when it is expelled its Earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, return to God that gave it, either to receive reward or punishment; now that the Body can sin of it self it is impossible, because wanting the Soul, it cannot act nor proceed to any thing, either good or evil; for could it do so, additional Sins might be accumulated even in the Grave; but 'tis plain, that after Death there is a cessation; <hi>fox as Death leaves us, so Iudgment finds us.</hi> And St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the Fifth Chapter of his Gospel, tells us, <hi>That the hour shall come, that all that are in the Grave shall hear his Voice, and they that have done well shall come forth to the Resurrection of Life; and they that have done evil, to the Resurrection of Condemnation,</hi> And Holy <hi>Iob,</hi> in the 14 and 19 Chapter, speaking to the same purposes, says, <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth: And though after my Skin Worms destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for my self, and mine Eyes shall be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by him, and through him, and to him are all things.</hi> Nay, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Man's Body may be proved by the renewing of many inconsiderable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their returning to Life after they seem dead; nay, some of them thereby also changed; as who hath not observed, that when a Grashopper is grown old, and hath cast his Skin, a lively new shrill insect will come forth of it.

               <head>CHAP. IX. The cause of the Green-sickness in Virgins, with its Symptoms, and Directions for its cure: Together with the chiefest occasion of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Women, and by what means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Cause, and render them fruitful.</head>
               <p>THE former of these ill conveniences, is too apparent in Virgins, especially such as are of a Flegmatick Complexion, evidently shewing it self by discolouring the Face, in making it look green, pale, or of a dusky yellow, which proceeds from raw undigested Humours, nor only doth it appear to the Eye, but sensibly afflicts such as it possesses, with difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pains in the Head, Palpitation of the Heart, unusual beatings, and small throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Arteries in the Temples, Neck, and Back, many times casting them into Fevers, if the humour be very vitious, also loathing of Meat, and the distension of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44491:42"/>
Hypocondriack part, by reason of the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Efflux of Menstrual Blood to the greater Vessels, and by reason of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of humour, the whole Body is often trouble with Swelling, or if not, at least the Thighs, Legs and Ankles all above the Heels. And also there is a weariness of the whole Body, without any reason at all for it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Galenists</hi> say, that this Distemper proceeds chiefly from the obstruction of those Vessels that are about the Womb, occasioned by the abundance of gross, viscid and crude Humours, arising from the several inward causes; but there are also outward causes, which have a share in the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, as taking cold on the Feet, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water, Intemperance in Diet, and also the eating of things which are wholly contrary to Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> raw or burnt Flesh, Ashes, Coals, old Shoes, Chalk, Wax, Nut-shells, Mortar, Lime, Oat meal, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-Pipes, which occasion not only a Suppression of the <hi>Menses,</hi> but likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions thro' the whole Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first thing necessary to eradicate the Cause, is Matrimonial Conjunction, and such Copulation that may prove to the satisfaction of her that is afflicted; for by that means the <hi>Menses</hi> will begin to flow
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44491:42"/>
according to their natural and due course, and the Humourt being diffused and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, will soon waste themselves, and then no more matter being administred to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease them, they will vanish, and a good temperament of Body will return; but in case such a Conjunction cannot be had so soon as necessity requires, then let the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel Blood in the Ankle, and if she be about 16, you may do it likewise in the Arm, though suffer her not to bleed overmuch, especially if the Blood be good. If the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases be of any continuance, then it is to be eradicated by purgation, preparation of the humour being first considered, which may be done by the Virgins drinking, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Guaicum, with Dittany of <hi>Creet:</hi> but the best Purge in this case ought to be made of Aloes, Agrick, Senna, Rhubard: And then for strengthning the Bowels and open obstructions, Chalybeet Medicines are chiefly to be used. The Diet must be moderate and sharp things; as Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be by all means avoided. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sterility proceeds from divers Causes, but most commonly from some defect in the Organs of Generation. Upon the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans part it most commonly happens, from the strict closure of the Mouth of the Womb which will not admit the Seed, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the straitness of the Share-Bone, which denies entrance to the <hi>Penis</hi>: Sometimes also from Ulcers or Excrescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the Neck of the Womb.

               </p>
               <p>In case the Neck of the Womb be so strait that the Yard cannot enter, then is the case to be inquired into, whether it be naturally so, or proceed from some swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or Schirrus either within or without; and if such things appears, it is for the most part incurable; but if it be a natural straitness, then s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

apt to stir up Cholerick, hot Humours in the Body, as Anniseeds, or Carraway-seeds in her Bread, store of Penniroyal in her Broth; let her likewise each Morning for a Week together, make a Posset, in which she must boil the Roots of Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Angelico, Sage, Rosemary, Cinamon, and Burrage: The taking the Male Herb <hi>Mercury,</hi> Dittany, Centaury, Marygolds, Cubebs, Saffron, Mugwort, and Clove-Gilliflowers, of each a handful, boil them in White-Wine, and eject the Concoction by little and little, at sundry times, as the cold or obstruction can be perceived, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing the Belly, and Reins of the Back, one day with Oyl of Cinnamon, next with the Oyl of Nutmeg or Mace, and the third with the Oyl of Myrrh, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to do for a Month together.

               <p>Many there are that conceive Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is frequently caused by Inchantation, but those Opinions are altogether frivolous and vain.</p>
               <p>If the Womb be defective in its Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, Men frequently labour in vain, in such a case the Woman must avoid Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Anger, or much Sleep, Eating new

               <p>Other causes of Barrenness there are, when the Woman grows fat, (as we have said before) so that the Caul swelling, and bearing beyond its bounds with its fatness, obstructs the Passage into the Womb; to prevent which, the Woman must not sleep over-much, especially in the day time, nor feed riotously, but exercise her self in Walking, or moderate Exercises, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten use Purgation and strong Glysters, made of such He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. X. Virginity what it is, in what it consists, and how violated, together with the Opinions of the Learned in the point of mutation of Sexes in the Womb, during the Operation of Nature in framing the Body.</head>
               <p>SEeing many ignorant People have boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Knowledge as to the first particular, und some Virgins have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone hard Censures through the ignorant Determinations of such as have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to discuss the matter, I thought it altogether necessary to clear the Point, that so for the future the Conceited might not be indulged in their vain Opinion, nor by traducing others, prejudice the Female Sex, whose Vertues are frequently such, as do not require our admiration, but imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then since the mysterious Word Virginity has puzzled many to define it, I mean the cause from whence it arises, for the word barely in it self signifies the prime, chief, or best of any thing: But as to the point in hand, the main matter bears the following Construction. It is observed by the curious searchers into Natures Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, that in young Maids or Females, in the <hi>Sinus Pudoris,</hi> or in that place that is by some called the Neck of the Womb, is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44491:50"/>
that pendulous production, vulgarly called the <hi>Hymen,</hi> but more rightly the <hi>Claustrum Virginale,</hi> and in <hi>French</hi> it is termed the <hi>Button de Rose,</hi> or Roses-Bud, for that it much resembles the Bud of a Rose, expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a Clove-Gilliflower, from when it derived the Word <hi>Defloro,</hi> to Deflower, the Deflowering of Virgins, because most are of opinion, that the Virginity is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther annihilated, when this Duplication is fractured and dissipated by violence, and that when it is found perfect and intire, no penetration has been made. Also some Learned Physicians are of opinion, that there is not neither <hi>Hymen</hi> or Skin expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed containing Blood in it, which divers imagine in the first Copulation, flows from the fractured expanse.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Claustrum Virginale,</hi> or Flower, is as it were composed, or consisting of four <hi>Caruncles,</hi> or little Buds like <hi>Myrtle-berries</hi>; which in Virgins are full and plump, but in Women flag, and hang loose; and these are placed in the four Angles of the <hi>Sinus Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> joyned or held together by little Membrains, and Ligatures like Fibres, each of them situate in the Intresticles or Spaces between each <hi>Caruncle,</hi> with which in a manner they are proportionably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stended, which Membranes being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacerated,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44491:50"/>
denote Devirgination, and many curious Coxcombs prying into this Secret the first Night of their Marriage, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Wives defective in this point, have ever after held them in evil esteem, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it happened thro' the effect of Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with some other, who had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in the Chambers of <hi>Venus.</hi> Nay, one I knew that upon this vain fancy took such conceit, that he would never go to Bed with his Wife; when to undeceive such I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dots, it is affirmed by the Learned, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> such fracture may happen divers ways by accidents, as well as Copulation with Man, <hi>viz.</hi> By extrordinary straining, violent coughing, immoderate sneezing, stopping of Urine, and violent motion of the Vessels, inforcibly sending down the humours, which pressing for passage break the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Membrane, so that the intireness or fracture of this thing, commonly taken for the Virginity or Maiden-head, is no absolute sign of dishonesty; though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that in Copulation 'tis more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently broken than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Once at an Assize, held for the County of <hi>Rutland,</hi> a young Man was put upon Trial of Life and Death, which Trial was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon an Indictment, for forcing a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, when after divers questions asked, and

               <p>The Womb hath also two Arteries on both sides, the Spermatick Vessels, and the Hypogasticks, which still attend or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Veins, and besides these there are divers little Nerves knit and intwined in the form of a Net, which extend throughout, even from the bottom to the <hi>Pudenda</hi> themselves, being chiefly placed for sense and pleasure, moving in Sympathy between the Head and Womb.</p>

               <p>As for the Preparatory or Spermatick Vessels in Women, they consist of 2 Veins and 2 Arteries, not differing from those in a Man, but only in their largeness a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of insertion; for, as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As to the Longitude and Latitude of these Vessels, they are narrow, and shorter in Women than in Men; only observe where they are wrinkled or crumpled, they are more wreathed and contorted than in Men, as shrinking together, by reason of their shortness, they may by their looseness be the better stretched out, when occasion

requires it. And these Vitals in Women are carried with an oblique course through the lesser Guts, to the Testicles or Stones, but are in the mid-way divided into two Branches, the greater going to the Stones, constituting the various or windy Body, and wonderful Inoculation; the lesser Branch ending in the Womb, in the side of which it disperseth it self, and chiefly at the higher part of the bottom of the Womb, for the nourishment thereof, and that part of the Courses, may purge through these Vessels; and seeing the Testicles in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are seated near the Womb, for that cause the Vessels fall not from the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> neither make they such Passages as in Men, nor extend themselves to the share-bone.</p>
               <p>The Stones in Women, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Testicles, perform not the same Actions as Men's; they are also different in their scituation, magnitude, temperament, substance, form and covering. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The External Superficies being likewise more unequal, appearing like the composition of a great many knots and kernels, mixed together, there is also another difference in their substance, they being much more soft and plyable, loose, and not so well compacted.</p>
               <p>Their magnitude and temperament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also different, for they are much colder and lesser than those in Men, as for their covering or inclosure, it likewise differs extreamly, for as Men's are wrapped or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in divers Tunicles, by reason they are externally Pendulous, and subject to divers injuries, unless so senced by Nature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The action and use of the Neck of the Womb, is also equal with that of the <hi>Penis, viz.</hi> Erection, occasioned divers ways. First, in case of Copulation, it is erected and made strait for the passage of the <hi>Penis</hi> to the Womb: Secondly, whilst the passage is repleated with Spirit and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Blood, it becomes more strait for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the <hi>Penis,</hi> as for the convenience of Erection it is twofold. First, for as much as if the Neck of the Womb was not erected, the Yard could have no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient passage to the Womb. Secondly, it hinders any hurt or damage that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue through the violent Concussion of the Yard, during the time of Copulation.</p>
               <p>As for the Vessels that pass through the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44491:61"/>
Neck of the Womb, there Office is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it with Blood and Spirit, that still as the moisture consumes by the heat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted there in Copulation, it may by those Vessels be renewed. But their principal business is, to convey Nutriment to the Womb.</p>
               <p>The Womb it self has many Properties attributed to it; as first, Retention of the secundated Egg, which is properly called Conception.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To cherish and nourish it, till by the help of Nature, it has framed the Child, and brought it to perfection. And then it strongly operates in sending forth the Birth when the time of its remaining there is expired, dilating and spreading it self in a wonderful manner: And indeed is the Field of Man's Generation, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for no other purpose, and so aptly removed from the Senses, that nothing of Injury can proceed from thence, retaining in it self a power and strength to operate and cast forth the Birth, unless by accident or the like it be rendered deficient. When to strengthen and enable it, besides the helps of Nature, sundry Remedies are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by skilful hands Direction. For which shall be hereafter mentioned.</p>
               <p>The use of the preparation Vessel is this:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44491:61"/>
The Arteries convey the Blood to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticles, where part of it is spent in the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of them, and the Production of those little Bladders (which do in all things resemble Eggs) through which the <hi>Vasa Preparentia</hi> run, and are obliterated in them. And as for the Veins, their Office is only to bring back what Blood remains from the uses afo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esaid.</p>
               <p>The Vessels in this kind are much short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Women than in Men, by reason of their nearness to the Stone which defect is yet lengthned and made good, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Intricates or Windings, to which those Vessels are subject; for in the middle way they drive themselves into two branches, though different in magnitude, for one being greater than the other, passes to the Stones.</p>
               <p>The Stones in Women are very useful, for they are very defective, Generation is at an end; for although those little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are on their outward Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, contain nothing of Seed, as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hipocrates</hi> did errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously imagine, yet they contain several Eggs, (commonly to the number of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in each Testicle) one of which being impregnated by the most spiritous part of the Man's Seed, in the Act of Coition,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44491:62"/>
descends through the <hi>Ovi-ducts,</hi> into the Womb, and from thence, in process of time, becomes a living Child.</p>
               <p>Their Figure is not exactly round, but flat and depressed on the sides; in their lower part Oval, but in their upper, where the Blood-Vessels enter them more plain, and have but one Membrane to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass them, probably that the heat may have the easier Access.</p>

               <p>At other times they are deceived by Moles, which are two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> The true and a false, the former of which is a fleshly Body, filled with many Vessels, streaked with white, green, or black Lines, not deficient of Membranes, but incompassed with divers, yet without growth, motion, Bones, Bowels, or any Internals, receiving its nourishment thro' certain Vessels; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it lives, as we may say the life of a Plant, without any figure or order, ingendered in the Concavity of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix: It has no Burthen or Navel-string fastened to it, as a Child always has; for as much as the Mole it self adheres to the Womb, by which means it receives Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment from its Vessels.</p>
               <p>The latter of these, <hi>viz.</hi> The false Mole may be divided into four distinctions, as following. First, the windy Mole, being a contraction or conflux of wind. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the watery Mole being a gathering of VVater. Thirdly, the Humourous Mol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> holdeth, that the Mole is bred, when the Man's Seed is weak, barren, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, or in too little quantity; and for the most part choaked through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the menstrous Blood, which is gross and thick, unfit for the framing of a Child; so that instead thereof is bred a lump of Flesh, that by little and little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, being wrapped in his own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which Nature effecteth, as desirous to bring forth any thing rather than be Idle.</p>
               <p>The windy Mole is occasioned through defect of heat in the Womb, and parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, as the Liver and Spleen, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender a polite or windy vapour, which fills the Membranous parts, and puffs up the Concavity of the Matrix.</p>
               <p>The watry Mole is ingendred of divers apt confluences of thin Matter, or watry Efluxes, which passing thro' the Vessels, evacutes into the Womb, having its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the Spleen, Liver, or parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning; or rather it proceeds from the weakness of the Matrix, which cannot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similate the Blood that is brought to non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

it; part whereof is turned into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not being avoided, stayeth in the Womb.</p>
               <p>The Humorous Mole is ingendered by moist attracted Humours, as the Whites, or certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, but the contrary, of a salse one; it is also the sign of a true Conception, if the Child move freely and lively in all parts of the Womb; for although there is a motion in a false Conception, yet it is dull, and not quick nor active in motion, the motion not being in it self, but in the expulsive Faculty of the Mother. And further, if the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man observe, she may perceive it fall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the side she lies on, and she lying on her Back, if her Belly be stroaked down, the burden will descend, and not have, for want of imbred force, power to recover its Station. But what confirms it more is, that nine Months expired, no Travel ensues, but her Belly still increases, whilst all the

rest of the Body grows lean, and out of order.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the windy Mole are divers, as the sudden stretching of the Belly like a Bladder, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The watery Mole is known by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stention of the Belly, and especially when she lies upon her Back, the Sides thereof are more swelled than the middle or the bottom, which grows flatter, by reason the watery humour falls to the sides, moving up and down, as if it were a fluctuation of water, and much to the same purpose as the Symptoms of the Humorous Mole, only with the distinction, that the Flanks and Thighs are more stretched by the watery Mole, than by the other, because the water being thinner than the Humour, or not confined in Cells, flows thither, and that which in case of a watery Mole, comes through Natures conduit is clear, when in case of a humourous Mole, the water is red, are of a bloody colour.</p>

               <p>Other false Conceptions there are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by divers Tumours, which the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant take for Moles, when they are only Rotundies and Swelling the Belly, which are not discovered till the Womb be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then, though the Womb be not all out of order, there does appear at one or both corners thereof, little Bags full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in others there are to be seen a heap of Kernel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that are derived to it, through the Mothers misobservance.</p>
               <p>In the first place, then the Woman with Child ought to choose a Temperate Air, not infected with Fogs, arising from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, Ditches, Ponds, Lakes, or Rivers, and not to go abroad in too hot, nor too cold Weather, nor when the South wind blew strong; for that Wind above all others, disturbs and disorders Women with Child, oftentimes causing Abortion: And next to it the North Wind is hurtful, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Catarrhs, Coughs and Rheums, which opening the Body, causes the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to bring forth before her time.

cautious in chusing such Meats as create wholsom nourishment, all Meats that are moderately dry, being taken so to do; and let her observe not to fast immoderately; for that renders the Child sickly and weak, and often for want of nourishment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains it to be born before its time; nor on the other hand, must she be too glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous, for that again stuffs it, and causes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All Meats, either too hot or too cold, and moist, are to be avoided, as Salads, Spices, Meats, and the extraordinary use of their Meats, which makes the Children come forth, oftentimes without Nails, which is a sign of short Life.

               <p>Her Longings, if extravagant, she must restrain, at least as much as in her lies, not eating any thing that is filthy or contrary to Nourishment, nor let her sleep immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

if she can avoid it; the Night being preferable in such cases, when she may sleep her fill, so it exceed not nine hours.</p>
               <p>Her Exercise ought to be moderate, for violent motion, either in walking or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, molests and disturbs the Womb, Riding in a Coach, especially upon the Stones, or in un-even way (the last three Months are dangerous) as also extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sounds, Noises, and above all, the Ringing of the Bells, and discharging the Guns.</p>
               <p>Laughing, Crying, or immoderate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or any other Passion, is extreamly hurtful; nor in the first four Months after Conception, ought she to lie with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for as much as the Act of Copulation moves and shakes the Womb, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Fruit therein causes the courses to descend. She must likewise in the 6th. and 8th. month abstain, but in the 7th. and 9th. it is not forbidden, but rather to be encouraged, by reason, as Physicians affirm, it opens the Passage, and thereby facilitates the Birth; and the better to help it, the Woman ought to take such things as may keep her Body soluble, as Syrups and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loosening Matters, as may help Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its Operation; especially let her observe when she grows any thing big, to

Motion likewise will cause the

               <p>If her Travel be tedious, to revive her Spirits, she may take any Broth of Chickens or Mutton, and after it a Poach'd Egg, but must not take any thing to excess. As for the Posture, Women are Delivered in, they, are divers; some lying in their Beds, others sitting in a Chair, supported and held by others, or resting upon the side of the Bed or Chair; some again upon the Knees, being supported under their Arms; but the safest and most commodious way is in the Bed, when as the Midwife ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these following Rules.</p>
               <p>Let her see that the Woman be layed upon her Back, her Head a little elevated by the help of a Pillow, having the like help to support her Reins and Buttocks, and that her Rump lie high: for if she lie low, she cannot be well delivered; then let her keep her Knees and Thighs as far asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as she can, her Legs bowed together, her Buttocks, the Soles of her Feet and Heels being fixed upon a little Log of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, placed for that purpose, that she may have the greater force to strain: Now in

                  </gap>e her Back be exceeding weak, a Swath-band may be cast under it, the band being four double, and about 12 Inches broad, and this must be held by two Persons, who with steady Hands and equal motion, must raise her up at the time the pains happen; but if they be not exact in their motion, 'tis better evaded, and at the same time, let two Women hold her Shoulders that she may the better strain out the Birth with more advantage, and the better to facilitate it, let a Woman stroak or press the upper part of her Belly gently, and by degrees. Nor must the Woman her self be faint-hearted, but Couragious, and of a good Heart, forcing her self by straining and stopping her Breath.</p>
               <p>In case of Delivery, the Midwife must wait with patience, till the Child's Head or other Members Burst the Membrane; for through Ignorance, or haste to be gon to other Women, as some has done, the Midwife tear the Membranes with her Nails, she indangers both the Woman and the Child; for it lying dry, and wanting that slipperiness that should facilitate it, its Egress comes forth with greater pain.</p>
               <p>When the Head appears, the Midwife must gently hold it between her two Hands, and draw the Child at such times as the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44491:72"/>
Womans pangs are upon her, and at no other, slipping by degrees her four Fingers under its Arm-pits, not using a rough hand in drawing it forth, lest by such means the Child through its tenderness, receive any Deformity of Body.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Child is taken forth which is commonly with its Face downwards, let it be laid upon its Back, that it may more freely receive External Respiration; then cut the Navel-string with a sharp Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about three Inches from the Body, tying that which adheres to the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly, with a silken string, as near as you can, then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Head and Stomach of the Child well suffering nothing to come upon the Face.</p>
               <p>The Child being thus drawn forth, and in Health, lay it aside, and let the Midwife regard the Patient, in drawing, or causing to come forth the Secundine: And this may be done by wagging and stirring them up and down, and afterwards with a gentle Hand drawing them forth, or if the work be difficult, let the Woman hold Salt in her Hands, shut them close, and breath hard into them, whereby she shall know whether the said Membranes be broken or not: The like may be known by causing a Strain, or Vomitting by putting one Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger down her Throat, by straining or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44491:72"/>
moving her Inferiour parts, being all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be done out of hand. If this fail, she may take a draught of raw Elder-water. or the Yolk of a raw Egg, or smell to a piece of <hi>Assa-Faedita,</hi> especially if she be troubled with the Wind-Cholick, a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for which, I shall hereafter prescribe. If she have taken Cold, it is a great obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the coming down of the Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines; and in such cases the Midwife ought to chafe the Womans B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lly with a gentle Hand, which breaks not only the Wind, but obliges the Secundine to come down. And these proving ineffectual, the Midwife must dilate with her Hand the exterior Orifice of the Womb, and gently draw it forth. Having discoursed of common Births, or such as for the most part are easie, I shall proceed to give Directions in case of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>

               <p>The Woman being in the posture afor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

between whiles, giving the Woman leave to breathe, urging her to strain in helping Nature to perfect the Birth, he may draw it forth, and the better to do it, that his hold may be surer, he must fasten or wrap a Linnen Cloth about the Child's Thighs, observing to bring it into the World with its Face downward.</p>
               <p>In case of a Flux of Blood, if the Neck of the Womb be open, it must then be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely considered, whether the Infant or the Secundines come first, which often the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happening to do, stop the Mouth of the Womb, and hinder the Birth, to the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering both the Woman and Child; in such a case, I say, the Secundine must be removed by a swift turn, and indeed they have by their so coming down, deceived many, who feeling their softness, supposed the Womb was not dilated, and by their being so deceived, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If it appear upon enquiry, that the Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine comes first, let the Woman be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all convenient expedition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44491:74"/>
great flux of Blood will follow, for then the Veins are opened, and upon this account, two things are to be considered. First, the great or lesness of the Secundines advancing; if the former, and the head of the Child appear first, it must be guided and directed towards the Neck of the Womb, as in case of Natural Births; but if there, thro` the weakness of the Child or Mother, appear any difficulty in the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the best way is to search for the Feet, and thereby draw it forth; but if the latter, the Secundines may be put back with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hand, and the Child first taken forth.</p>
               <p>Another matter is note worthy, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Secundine, be far advanced, so that it cannot be put back, and the Child follow it close, then are the Secundines to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth with much care, as swift as may be, and laid aside without cutting the entail that is fastned to them, for by that you may be guided to the Infant, the which, whether alive or dead, must be drawn forth by the Feet with all Expedition, tho' it is not to be acted, unless in case of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, for in other cases the Secundine ought to come last.</p>
               <p>As for a dead Child, in drawing it forth, let these directions be carefully observed by the Chirurgeon, <hi>viz.</hi> if the Child be found
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44491:74"/>
dead with its Head foremost, the danger is the greater, and more difficult will be the Delivery; for it is an apparent sign the Womans strength begins to fail her, and that the Child being dead, and wanting its imbred force, can be no ways affisted to its Delivery; wherefore the most certain and safe way is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

can be, at what time the Chyrurgeon with his <hi>Speculum Matricis,</hi> or his Apertory, may dilate or widen the Womb, and draw out the Child and Secundines together, if it be possible, after which the Womb must be well washed and anointed, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laid in her Bed, comforted there with Spice, pleasant Meats and Cordials: This course must be takon in the Delivery of all dead Children, likewise with Moles, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines, or otherwise false Births, that will not of themselves come forth in due season, or if the Instruments aforesaid, will not sufficiently widen the Womb, then other Instruments, as the Drakes Bill, and long Pincers ought to be used.</p>

what is good, and well digested, breeds good Blood, good Blood creates good Spirits, and when a Man is invigorated with a plentiful Stock of such, he is able to do Miracles. Also when both the Husband and Wife meet with an equal Ardour in their Conjugal Embraces, it is very rare, if it be not attended with Conception. But when that Act is over, all is not done; for that it may have the better Success, the Husband must not presently separate himself from his Wife's Embraces, lest the Air should suddenly strike in, and so prevent the happy issue of their Labours: And when the Man departs, the Woman ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose her self to all the rest and quietness imaginable, and to avoid heavy thoughts of what may cause any disturbance; and especially she ought to avoid both Coughing and Sneezing, both which are two great hindrances to Conception after the Act of Copulation.</p>
