            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>MOſes</hi> telleth that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought a buriall place in <hi>Hebron,</hi> for price of money, and that <hi>Iacob</hi> bought a field in <hi>Sychem</hi> for lambes: and <hi>Iacob</hi> was buried in <hi>Hebro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and the Patriarkes in <hi>Sychem.</hi> Now if a man ſhould ſay that <hi>Iacob</hi> was buried in <hi>Sychem,</hi> he reiecteth <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; all the authoritie of God. Or if he ſay that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought the field which <hi>Iacob</hi> bought, and ſay that <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> bought <hi>Sychems</hi> plot for money, The vntrueth is augmented: yet all this doe our right reverend Fathers. In theſe wordes from Act. 7.16. and 17. as they would make the ſimple to beleeve: <hi>And Iacob deſcended into Egypt, and dyed, both he, and our Fathers, and were caried over into Sychem, and layd in the ſepulchre that Abraham bought for money of the ſonnes of Emor, the ſonne of Sichem.</hi> By this <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould be caried to <hi>Sychem,</hi> and be buried there: and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be the
<pb facs="tcp:7085:3"/>
purchaſer, and for money, and <hi>Iacob</hi> and the Patriarches ſhould be buried together. So the Iewes would ſay that <hi>Machmad</hi> makes no greater madnes in his <hi>Al-koran:</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abrahams</hi> purchaſe was in <hi>Hebron,</hi> &amp; for 400. ſickles: and that of <hi>Sychem</hi> was <hi>Iacobs,</hi> &amp; for an hundreth lambes. And <hi>Iacob</hi> was buried in <hi>Hebron,</hi> as was told, &amp; the twelue ſonnes in <hi>Sychem.</hi> The Biſhops ſawe that this was moſt falſe: &amp; runne from euill to worſe. And thus their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent note ſpeaketh, vpon verſ. 16. For (B) money. <hi>Here appeareth an errour. For Abraham ſeemeth to be put in the text in the ſteed of Iacob.</hi> For <hi>Iacob</hi> bought the ſepulchre of <hi>Emor,</hi> and not <hi>Abraham,</hi> who bought before a field of <hi>Ephron.</hi> Thus we accuſe the holy Ghoſt for giuing vs a corrupted New Teſtament. And our countries heard not that any Greke copy from the firſt to the laſt differed here. So the firſt ſhould be corrupt: &amp; ſo <hi>Machmad</hi> ſhould ſay truely, that we had not a pure N. Teſtament. Alſo the Iewes rule ſhould condemne vs: a comon rule &amp; generall: in <hi>Thalm. Ieruſ. San. fo. 20. Diathece ſe batelah Mikzathah batelah cullah.</hi> A Teſtament which faileth in part, faileth in the whole. This our errour is not firſt ours, but old, and knowen to Iewes: whereby their millions deſpiſe the Goſpell, and hold S. <hi>Stephen</hi> no martyr: as miſſing in <hi>Moſes</hi> plain ſtory. Whereas in trueth S. <hi>Stephen</hi> meant thus: <hi>Iacob</hi> died in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the Patriarkes died in Egypt: Only the Patriarkes were caried to <hi>Sichem: Iacob</hi> and the Patriarkes were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Hebron:</hi> in ground which <hi>Abraham</hi> bought, and bought for money, and not for Lambes: The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes were buried in <hi>Sichem,</hi> in ground which <hi>Iacob,</hi> not <hi>Abraham,</hi> bought, &amp; not for money, but for an hundreth lambes. Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> meant all this: which all, we pervert to cauſe millions of millions to reiect the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:7085:3"/>
and to runne to eternall flames. The rare elegancie of S. <hi>Stephens</hi> wordes would haue made a Iewe know that he ſpake in the Prophets ſtyle, &amp; ſhortnes: but his ſpeech would be harſhe, to one not longe acquainted with the Prophetes maner. To vnderſtand this, three rules muſt be deliuered. One, that <hi>Vau</hi> the Ebrew, is ſometimes, <hi>which:</hi> as in Malach. 3. and Mark cha. 1.1. <hi>which</hi> ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy way: And often in two members ioyned, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongues by, <hi>AND,</hi> it is omitted in the Prophetes, as that in Pſ. 133. Like the dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> which falleth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sion. For, like the dew of <hi>Hermon, AND</hi> that which falleth vpon mount Sion. A third Hebrew matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, hard even for Ebrewes, and often noted by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt among the 848. margent notes, vpon moſt exact text wordes, but worthy of notes: As Hande, for the handes: barre, for the barres: Sonne, for the ſonnes. So, grave, Act. 7. for, The graves: The ſingular being put ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for the plurall. Theſe things being conſidered, Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> will cleare him ſelfe to all learned Iewes admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, thus the Greek, Hebraizing, meant: <hi>Iacob</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he, and our Fathers which were caried to <hi>Sichem.</hi> And they were put in Graue: that which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> bought for price of money: <hi>AND</hi> that from <hi>Emor</hi> the <hi>Sichemite.</hi> Any acquainted with the Ebrew ſtyle would thus vnderſtand Saint Lukes Greeke. And ſo the New Teſtament ſhould be farre from blame, and in high admiration, and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould not be left vnburied in Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> nor buried with the Patriarkes: nor <hi>Abraham</hi> a purchaſer in <hi>Sychem,</hi> nor <hi>Sychem</hi> purchaſe made by money, and not by lambes. This our ignorance muſt be noted, for the thouſands or rather millions of copies diſgracing our ſelues: though in the paynes expected it may be
<pb facs="tcp:7085:4"/>
amended. For copies vnrevocable ſold now 46. yeres, our darknes muſt be hightened: and the ſcripture muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, as pure all, and moſt ſyncere. None that haue any ſparke of grace will envy that, but wiſh it withall might maintayned.</p>

               <head>Of perverting the holy text of the old Test. in 848. places.</head>
               <p>THe old Teſt. in Ebrew hath in the margent words of warning for others in the text 848. times, yet alwayes the text word is exact, and the margent warneth of ſome matter profitable for the depth of Ebrew ſkill, or helpeth in a doubtfull phraſe: or telleth of the like elſwhere vſed with ſome little difference: or in propre names which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue vnfit, layth a fitter to be read: or for brood ſpeeches readeth ciuiller. And both the text is exact, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent profitable. But the margent readings are omitted in many copies: And none without great blame alter the text. Amongeſt Ebrewes <hi>David Kimchi</hi> was found raſh herein in his preface to the booke of <hi>Ioſuah.</hi> But hee was ſharply taken vp by others: yea and he calleth backe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in particulars. <hi>Kimchi</hi> ſaid: that the Bible was corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the margent was a correction. That his opinion is ſhewed to be moſt fooliſh and deadly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods word, by <hi>Elias Levita praef ad Maſſorita.

Alſo <hi>Barbinel</hi> the moſt curious that euer, I trow, handled the tongue, though not the ſoundeſt: yet herein he ſoundly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Kimchi</hi> in his praeface to <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Yet a learned man of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> M. <hi>Edw.

<pb facs="tcp:7085:4"/>
his dealing is extreemely dangerous to the authoritie of Scripture. For if in fiftie two yeares in <hi>Babel</hi> after the Temples fall, Moſes and the Prophetes had ſo many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in longer time more would grow. The learned man dealt here not learnedly. A proſeſſour of Ebrew 30. yeares might haue ſhewed that the text was ſtill moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act: and in many places far the more curious Ebrew: and he ſhould not weaken the glory of Gods providence, whoſe watchfulnes hath preſerved every letter of all the holy Hebrew that his Prophetes wrot for the vſe of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Many booke-prophetes wrote for the vſe of Iſraell, while their tongue, families and townes ſtood: which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes would not profit, when Iſraell periſhed: and heathen ſhould be vexed in ſearching ſtories not plain.</p>
               <p>Thoſe bookes the laſt Prophetes extinguiſhed, and made vp an abſolute pithie ſtorie fit for all ages. And ſo much we muſt defend to every letter. Eccleſiaſticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in a certen libell commendeth M. <hi>Livelies</hi> booke. Biſhops that know Ebrew will not aſſent, nor any who vſe adviſement. Authoritie ſhould make <hi>Lively</hi> recant. This blamer knoweth that he hath read thriſe mo Ebrew auctours then he, and will defend each of the 848. words blamed by M. <hi>Lively.</hi> And a worke titled <hi>Tiphereth Iſrael,</hi> would haue told M. <hi>Lively</hi> more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knoweth for this matter, and much more, to ſpeak better of the holy text. And the right reverend fathers ſhould write of the Bibles pureneſſe firſt, how the text is ſound, before they diſpute of further matter. All thinges muſt be done in order in the Church of God. And if men regard money not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Gods face will be vpon them.</p>

word. The flood deſtroyed all but eight, &amp; of all the men nothing remaineth but ſpirites in priſon, except eight ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Arke. That ſeverity might haue made them all wiſe. Yet <hi>Cham</hi> was not bettered: but his race called out Idolatry and <hi>Babels</hi> Tower for that. wherevpon God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft theſe builders of the tongue that ſpake of hope in the redeemer, that they ſhould no more heare of him, till <hi>Babel</hi> ſhould fall by <hi>Sem</hi> in <hi>Cyrus</hi> and by <hi>Iapheth</hi> in <hi>Darius,</hi> when <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> tooke <hi>Babell.</hi> And amongſt his owne people he reckoned the worldes age to that time, moſt exactly and plainly, yeares 3470. And then his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell telleth <hi>Daniel</hi> for <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and all nations, of the kingdome of Salvation: and nameth the redemer the moſt holy: Meſſias the Governer: Meſſias that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the covenaunt with many: and telleth of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, how it ſhalbe in ſufferings. <hi>Iudah</hi> ſaw the fall of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> kingdome, their hope: and the fall of <hi>Babel</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now firſt experience might teach that the kingdomes of this world vnder the ſun, had nothing but vexation of ſpirit. At that time it was fit to tell all the world of the kingdome of heauen: when Iewes &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſaw all the earth curſed. The Iewes kingdome had fallen: and they were told they ſhould never haue an earthly kingdome more: and Hethen kingdomes were ſhewed to be as ſavage beaſtes coaming out of the great ſea toſſed with many windes. So in that opportunitie an Angel, called <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the mighty man of God, whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> had ſeene before, cometh in the Evening to <hi>Daniel</hi> praying for a return home, for his people to reſtore their religion: and telleth him that his prayer was heard, that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhalbe reſtored, as <hi>Eſaie</hi> foretold <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould do it, that mount <hi>Sion</hi> ſhould haue ſacrifices ſeaven times

the ſpace of ſeaventy yeares captivity, that is, 490. yeres. But exactly then the Son of God would conſecrate him ſelfe to end Moſes and to bring in an Eternall redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and as he had Oxen and ſheepe in ſacrifices for his body, and their blood for the blood of his covenant: hee would confirme a covenaunt for all nations. As the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell recordeth what he hath done, leaving bread for his body in ſeale of covenaunt, and wine for the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his covenant: So at his death he ſhould end Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Lawes, and all Leviticall function: that no Moſaicall ſacrifice ſhould afterwardes be lefull. And the time of all this matter is clearely and ſtrictly ſet downe: that <hi>Cyrus</hi> &amp; <hi>Darius</hi> knew when the ſonne of God would worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: in which hope 49000. Iewes leaue <hi>Babel</hi> for <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſo many of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as had hope of Salvation, thought of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in all countreys where they were ſcattered. Alſo the Sonne of God is called by <hi>Gabriel,</hi> as was ſaid, Meſſias: in ſuch Ebrew as it muſt needes be a propre name: which it is not againe in all the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> for Meſſias cha. 1. and 4. forceth vs to looke vnto the Angells ſpeach: and ſtill the name of <hi>CHRIST</hi> through the new Teſtament: in ſo much that to deny <hi>MESSIAS</hi> here to meane Our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that is nothing els but to deny all the New Teſta. Beſides, for certainty of all: God telleth that by the tenth part of this time exactly, from the leaue to returne, <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhalbe walled, but not without much adoe: ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine yeres are ſet alone, with the ſtories of 4900. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Iewes interlaced, leaſt Heathen lyes ſhould break the trueth of the Chronicle. When God had given <hi>Cyrus</hi> all the kingdomes of the earth, then he maketh a decree to build the Temple: and to giue a ſubſidie throw 120. na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:7085:6"/>
to helpe the Iewes home. Long warres had <hi>Cyrus</hi> afore he became ſo great. <hi>Eſay</hi> did name him by his name, and foretold of his victories. And Heathen doe record them: and <hi>Lucian</hi> recordeth, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> liued 100. yeares: and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that he very yong began warre: ſo his glory might well by <hi>Greekes</hi> begin where ſcripture placeth the <hi>Chaldean:</hi> to whom Heathen <hi>Greekes</hi> giue no ſuperioritie over the <hi>Perſians.</hi> After <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke <hi>Babel,</hi> he reigned three yeares: when <hi>Daniel</hi> faſted becauſe the building of the Temple was hindred by letters written to <hi>Artaxata</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Ezra 4. and called Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Dan. 10. And ſoone <hi>Cyrus</hi> might dye. Otherwiſe <hi>Daniel</hi> would ſtirr him to further his own decree: and <hi>Herodot</hi> bringeth his death neare <hi>Babels</hi> fall, by <hi>Scythian Thamar. Artaxata</hi> or <hi>Cambyſes</hi> had reigned ſo long with his father, that he had put to death all the chief Nobility: By <hi>Lucian</hi> citing <hi>Perſique</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and after his hinderance of the Temple, Chriſt with his eyes, like a flame of fire, Dan. 10. would rewarde him according to his workes: being <hi>Can-byſhes,</hi> a Prince of ſhame: and <hi>Herodot</hi> ſheweth his badnes and quick death after his ſole governement. And as counſellers prevayled al his dayes to hinder the Temple, which counſels hardly could be long vniforme, that record in <hi>Ezra 4.</hi> argueth, that he reigned not long ſole Emperour: though Heathen in <hi>Clemens</hi> giue him 19. yeares, which might be almoſt all vnder his Father. Next cometh the King which maried <hi>Atoſſa Hester</hi> famous in <hi>Hellanicus</hi> for inventing Epiſtles, as he thought. <hi>Mardochai</hi> telleth of her Letters through 127. Provinces for the Iewes ſafety: And of them <hi>Hellanicus</hi> might ſpeake. <hi>Hester</hi> was maried to him in his ſeaventh yeare. So her ſonne <hi>Darius Artaxasta</hi> mentioned <hi>Ezra 6: ver. 14.</hi> might be ſix yeares old in his fathers twelfth, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb facs="tcp:7085:7"/>
by <hi>Mardochai</hi> then actiue, though he were caried to <hi>Babel</hi> with King <hi>Iechonias.</hi> This King <hi>Esters</hi> huſband is called <hi>Darius</hi> in <hi>Herodot,</hi> and <hi>Cteſias:</hi> and he liued by <hi>Cteſias</hi> 43 yeres, and by <hi>Herodotus</hi> he was 20. when <hi>Cyrus</hi> went to <hi>Scythia,</hi> vpon the taking of <hi>Babel:</hi> and dreamed of his Empire. So if <hi>Cambyſes</hi> called <hi>Artaxata</hi> by his Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all name, reigned after <hi>Babels</hi> fall 7. yeares. <hi>Darius</hi> had 16. who by his Imperiall name is <hi>Oxyares, Aſſuerus</hi> or <hi>Xerx.</hi> Two ſonnes he left, who gently ſtrove for the Empire, while neither ſought to defeate the other, as <hi>Iustine</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: and <hi>Herodot</hi> recordeth that <hi>Athoſſaes</hi> ſonne borne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the father was Emperour, prevailed. The wiſedome of <hi>Mardochai</hi> and <hi>Nehemias</hi> and <hi>Ester,</hi> might cauſe that quietneſſe: Seeing <hi>Mardochai</hi> was a chief in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And ſomwhat the yong yeares of <hi>Atoſſaes</hi> ſonne: ten at his fathers death. So the other brother hath his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Imperiall name <hi>Xerx, Est. 10.</hi> by the <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> copy in the <hi>Maſſoreth.</hi> This <hi>Xers</hi> ſix yeares prepared warre for <hi>Grecia,</hi> in his brothers minority. When he was in <hi>Grecia,</hi> then was <hi>Atoſſaes</hi> ſonne 16. and might well licence the building of the Temple: and take the other Imperiall name <hi>Artaxasta,</hi> being king of <hi>Aſſur,</hi> or <hi>Babel:</hi> before he was ſole Emperour, and mention prayer for the Kinges ſonnes: and acknowledge Gods wrath in the overthrow of <hi>Xerx,</hi> for hindering the Temple. And the ſtyle of <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gei</hi> ſheweth that he exhorted the returned whereof ſome had ſene <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, to build before the King gaue leaue: otherwiſe exhortation were cold. And ſeeing <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> in whoſe tribe the Temple was built, <hi>Sems</hi> ſonne by <hi>Elam</hi> and <hi>Arphaxad</hi> was fit to be the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

he authoriſeth the Temple, with great charges for ſacrifice, &amp; with menacies vpon the hinderers: in his ſixt it is built: In his ſeaventh he ſendeth <hi>Ezra</hi> to ſet forward lawes, with great giftes from the <hi>Perſian</hi> worthies: being taught with the King the religion of God.

                  <hi>Chilon</hi> the wiſe, the Old <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> of <hi>Solons</hi> age, was <hi>Ephorus</hi> in <hi>Sparte</hi> in the fiftie ſixt Olympiad: of <hi>Solons</hi> age: and much ancienter then <hi>Cyrus.

By <hi>Pamphyla,</hi> a learned <hi>Romane</hi> woman, which wrote of <hi>Olympiades,</hi> whoſe worke <hi>Photius</hi> honoreth in his Librarie: it was the ſixt Olympiade when this <hi>Chilon</hi> was <hi>Ephorus.</hi> So by Olympiades there is a doubt of 200. yeares (that is 50 Olympiades) when <hi>Chilon</hi> one of the ſeaven ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, floriſhed. Whoſe time without Olympiades helpe, is knowen wel enough. So for the deceaved: theſe Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades, if they be not farre enough out of the way by them ſelues, theſe Olympiades would prick them forward. And it muſt needes be counted a moſt grievous iniurie againſt the Maieſtie of God, to torment all the Byble by them, and to deny the gracious light of Salvation: whiche the holy Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> left as mount Sion that can not be mooved. And as the mountaynes are about <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſo are holy Scriptures about that oration of the holy <hi>Gabriel:</hi> who taught all at <hi>Babels</hi> fall, that 490. yeares after that yeare, the King of Glory ſhould be kild: but death ſhould not holde him, but his iuſtice ſhould appeare by his Reſurrection: that he was kild not for him ſelfe, but to make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſinnes, and to ſeale Viſion &amp; Prophet: and to make Heathen ſyſſoma one body with Iſrael. The Lord knew, that as plain a prefixed time as time could bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed was needfull for all the world. And the holy Angel might not ſpeake deceipt as <hi>Iuppiter</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> by a dreame,

deceaved <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> by the word NOW: ſaying: Now thou ſhalt take <hi>Troy.

Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely</hi> the Angel deceaued all that ever read his wordes: till <hi>M. Liuely</hi> came to teach their right meaning, and he ſhould no more be an holy Angel then <hi>Iuppiters</hi> dreame was a God. Our reverend fathers might haue ſpared the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming ſuch <hi>Agamemnonean</hi> dreames.

This coſinage to check the holy Angel by Olympiades, to turne the prophecy from light to darknes: from trueth to falſhood: from Chriſt his name to prophane Atheiſtes: from his covenaunt in the Lords ſupper: vnto a covenant of <hi>Romane</hi> dogges with as dogged Iewes: from the times beginning certen and cleare to all heartes of ſage, vnto one never knowen afore <hi>M. Liuely</hi> told: and to end not at our Lordes death: to ende Moſes there, but to ende at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> fall: and ſacrifice to be lefull ſo farre: this matcheth <hi>Eves</hi> fall by the Serpent: and paſſeth the building of <hi>Babel.</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> thought and taught, that by <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſhould be built. And ſeeing he gaue them vnder let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patentes leave, to returne to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to builde the Temple, the Decree for City and Temple muſt needes be at that time: and ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> would vnderſtand him: that from that yeare all the world might date their writinges thus: Dated 490. yeares afore the kingdome of Meſſias <hi>Cyri primo:</hi> Dated 460. <hi>Darij Artax.</hi> 20 when <hi>Aggei</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth:

Dated 442. <hi>viceſimo Artax.</hi> before Meſſias king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: when <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was walled. And as Men on a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney knowen, know ſtil how fewer miles they haue to their Inne or reſt: ſo all the world yere by yere, ſince the Angell taught <hi>Daniel,</hi> might know, how neare they were to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the kingdome of heaven by our Lord his moſt holy ſoule going through the veile of his fleſh into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by Saint Paule, into Paradiſe by the Goſpell, into <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> by the Greeke, (but in <hi>Hades</hi> to the Gardens of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not <hi>Tartarus</hi>) to make reconciliation for vs, having found Eternall redemption. Such limites are fitt markes for a Chronicle: The firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Empire, who had revenged <hi>Babel</hi> that oppreſſed Gods children 70. yeares: that yeare which ſaw an Angell tell <hi>Daniel</hi> of an Eternall kingdome, in hope of which 49697. leaue <hi>Babel</hi> for <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſure to be ſtill in affliction: and a Proclamation of the God that made the heavens over ſix ſcore nations: and a willing ſubſidie from ſo many for them that goe to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in this hope: Such noble ſtories ſhould be the mark of a Chronicle for Chriſt: chayned from <hi>Adam</hi> 3470. yeares thither: and thence ſeaven times the captivities length, that is 490. yeares, vntill the King of glory doth open free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for all: when the ſun darkened three houres: when the earth trembleth: when the ſtones burſt: when the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of the Temple rent: as a Draper would part a peece of cloth: when the dead aroſe: when our Lord forty dayes was ſeene of the faithfull, to ſend his ſpirit and a fiery law to teach all nations.

<pb facs="tcp:7085:15"/>
And both they being <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſhould know their owne ſtate: being aliue in that very time. Then began the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> ſuperioritie over <hi>Grecia.

So the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> loſſe of governement being knowen how long it continued, telleth how to ſettle the time of <hi>Leustra</hi> field. Now <hi>Iſocrates</hi> in his epiſtle to K. <hi>Philip,</hi> ſayth: The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> ruled but tenne yeares ouer <hi>Grecia:</hi> that is, after <hi>Lyſander</hi> vnwalled <hi>Athens.</hi> Therefore tenne yeares thence reacheth to <hi>Philip Macedones</hi> reigne. So <hi>Suidas</hi> for <hi>Euripides</hi> life, is ſtrengthened by men of that age: in plain wordes. Many profes herein I ſhewed of old: which I neede not now to repeat. <hi>Philip Macedon</hi> reigned 20. yeares by <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus:</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> his ſonne, ſix before his Monarchie. So by <hi>Greekes</hi> yeares from <hi>Alexan.</hi> the great vnto <hi>Xerxes</hi> warre: and his brothers reigne at home, are not mo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 100.

And even by the perpetuall conſent of Grecians skilfully read, the ſame is proved. So the <hi>Perſians</hi> overrule <hi>Iuda,</hi> but 130 yeares: and <hi>M.

So <hi>Mast. Liuely might</hi> haue ſpared vexing of all the Bible: citing auncientes reiected moſt ſtrongly by both teſtamentes, true old Greekes, and all Churches now. And Learned Chriſtians ſhould bend to finde a concent, not a diſſent in holy ſcriptures: to ſhew light, not lightnes: order, and not diſorder: ioyance, not anoyance: right paſſing rumors, not might of conceited humors, about matters of ſalvation.</p>

Or to his birth 437. without conſideration of Gods counſell none would beleeue the number were ſo great in the yeares. For, the Generations betwixt our L. &amp; <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> are but tenne: to draw mo yeares then 20. aboue did. So we haue much adoe to perſwade that 490. yeares were betwixt the fall of <hi>Balthaſar</hi> the Tyrant, for Satan over the Church: and the fall of Satan by the obedience of our Lord vpon the Croſſe: in anguiſh of his ſoule more then ever all ſoules felt in this world.

His outfacing of the trueth and Chriſtianity drew <hi>Iohn Cant:</hi> to ſubſcribe vnto him. He might with as good learning haue ſubſcribed to the <hi>Alkoram.

                     <head>A Table to make plaine the difficulty that is found in S. Matthew and S. Luke, touching the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and his right ſucceſſour in the kingdome: which deſcription beginneth at David and no hygher, becauſe the difficultie is only in his poſteritie.<note place="margin">FOR better vnderſtanding of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this Table, ye ſhall note, that the Evangeliſts S. Matth. and S. Luke, haue diverſly recited the generation of our Saviour Chriſt, according to the fleſh, and yet tende both to one end: that is, to prooue, that (according to that which is written of him in the propheſies) he is diſcended of the royall blood of David, &amp; rightly ſucceeded him in the kingdome. So the diverſitie of the ſayd recital conſiſteth in this: that Saint Matthew ſetteth forth the ſaid generation deſcending from father to ſonne, and S. Luke aſcending from ſonne to father, which comes all to one end. But to ſhewe the agreement of Saint Luke with Saint Matthew, wee haue here ſeth foorth the generation by him deſcribed, deſcending after the order of Saint Matthew: to the end that the one may bee conferred with the other. Furthermore, Saint Matthew deſcribeth the generation of Ioſeph, though it belong nothing to Ieſus Chriſt, after the fleſh, and Saint Luke, that of the virgin Marie: for it was very neceſſary to recite both, foraſmuch as women were commonly reputed of the line or kinred of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: and ſo aſwell on her huſbands ſide, as on her owne ofſpring, it is manifeſt that ſhe was of the royall line of Dauid.</note>

So herein the right RR.

The ſcope of that booke was to teach the Iewes that <hi>Salomons</hi> glory was not the high bleſſing that <hi>Moſes</hi> propoundeth. But Chriſt was the end of the law. And as by the blood of the Paſcha Lambe or kid, Iſraell was ſaued in <hi>Egypt:</hi> ſo the ſonne of God in the fleſh ſhould ſaue vs by his blood: whom men by ignorance would crucifie, being king of glory: who made Heauen and Earth.

But menacies are added, Leu. 26. that they will fall from God continually: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually they ſhall be beaten: euen till theyr King ſhalbe caryed captiue: and they ſhall be in theyr enemies land ſeauenty yeares. And then God will remember his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: when they pray, as Leu. 26. preſcribeth: confeſſing theyr ſinnes and the ſinnes of theyr fathers: Then God would remember his couenant with <hi>Iacob, Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and how he brought Iſraell from <hi>Egypt.</hi> This the law telleth: and the ſtory ſheweth: that the Kings failed quite from the earth. And prophecies ſhewe, through <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſeauen times repeating the ſame matter, that <hi>Chams</hi> houſe <hi>Sems</hi> houſe, &amp; <hi>Iaphets</hi> Grekes ſhall rule <hi>Iuda</hi> till Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. And that he ſhall giue him ſelfe for the ſinnes of the

The text doeth teach: that the Philistines were afrayd of him 20. yeres after his death: and 20. yeres in his life time: and ſo ariſe, FOVRTY by two ſeverall times.

Seaven Iubiles <hi>Ioſephs</hi> houſe had the Arke, till Sylon loſt it: thence the Philiſtines did cary it: &amp; after ſix monethes Iuda had it in their power.

But will ſay in his heart, <hi>Who can goe vp to Heauen to bring a ſolution of this knot: and who can goe beyond the ſea to fetch a reconciliation of ſuch diſagrement:</hi> whereas the word, as <hi>Moſes</hi> meant, for the peregrination which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Iſraell, which was ſpent in the land of the peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their fathers, as in <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtory it is named, and in Egypt when Iſraell had ended their dwelling there was fourhunderth and thirty yeares to the very exact day.</p>
               <p>And our right Reverend fathers might haue learned ſo much of the Lxxij. tranſlaters, which tranſlated thus: <hi>The peregrination of the children of Iſrael while they and their Fathers dwelt in Egypt, and in the land of Chanaan: they &amp; their Fathers, was four hundreth &amp; thirty yeres.</hi> Here any may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veile that ſo learned men for Latin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſies,<note place="margin">Obiections w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> anſwere.</note> ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reade the Lxx.

And one <hi>Thaddaeus Dunus</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Moſes</hi> text for his fathers yeres might be corrupt. Seeing ſo many haue perverted the text and other Scriptuers: ſo much more dangerous is our learned fathers agreement with them. Whereas they might eaſily be anſweared. The Thalmudiques ieſted: as Heathen, that knew not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> peregrination, would vnderſtand <hi>Moſes:</hi> &amp; <hi>Genebrard</hi> forgate that S.

And <hi>Dunus</hi> blaming of the text would be hatefull to all the Maſſoreth: full of auctority, now 2000. yeres. And our Septuagint in this place, may not be ſuſpected. For the Thalmud Ieruſalemy in Megi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, fol. 71. Col. 4. teſtifieth that the Lxx. tranſlated the text of Ex. 12.40 in this manner. The peregrimation of the children of Iſrael while they dwelt in Egypt and in all lands, was four hundred and thirty yeres. So no colour of obiection can bee rightly brought. And S. Paul muſt be

And nameth him conſecrated <hi>Enoch.</hi> And the event proved his faith. For he walked with God: and in his infants name told when the flood ſhould come. Euen when he ſhould dye.

               <p>THE Lords of <hi>Bearne</hi> in Zuitzerland offred me a good place of profeſſing Ebrew and all my charges for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aunſweres to this Iew: But with this addition. No ſtranger that meaneth not to dye amongſt them, ſhalbe preferred: who afterwards may greue them, in opening of their affayres. That I refuſed: and told of my hope in your Maieſty. Now if it be your highnes will to allow me a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to buy all Hebrew and Thalmudiques helpes, and to hyre comon Ebrew ſetters at <hi>Venice</hi> or <hi>Baſil,</hi> the Bible and the Thalmud ſhalbe opened by Gods help, to the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euen of the Rhomiſts: or if your highnes graunt me but your princely letters of fauour to Germanie Princes, they will deffray my charges. A Prince to whoſe anceſtors all the Iewes of the Empire payd for their dwelling: ſauing them of <hi>Francfurt,</hi> &amp; hath many of them now his tenants, would willingly haue employed me that way. But without your highnes leaue, I could not then reſolue.</p>

And the memory of ſtory we may celebrate, as we hold it convenient But he that ſhall defend S. Luke muſt be circumſpect herein: Iewes haue long examined what to obiect.
