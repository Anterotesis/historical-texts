         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My true Trouts, as ever water wet,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have hungred and thirsted to lift up my voice like a
Trumpet amongst you, and to pour forth my spirit
upon you; for ye are all flesh, and that's frail; but I
must teach your hands to war, and your fingers to
fight: And that you may the better remember my
words, I mean to force them in with a <hi>malin-spike,</hi> e'ne
just as ye splice a Cable. I understand you are very willing already
to undertake this great work; and the better to incourage ye, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to clear your consciences of all scruples that may seem to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your cheerfulnesse in the businesse: Ye know, honest <hi>harb,</hi> I have
been at <hi>New-England,</hi> and am not now to learn the difference between
a dry Cabin, and a great storm; for my own part, I had enough
o'nt: I had cast the platform of this blessed deliverance, which we
now enjoy, in that sanctified soyl, and could not rest till I came
home to put it in practice: Our work is now in the Finishers hands
by Land, and now we must pin our faiths upon your shoulders for
our Sea successe; it behoves you therefore to stand to your tackling,
for ye are to fight against principalities and powers: That Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
RUPERT (to give the Devil his due) is able to fright ye
all into an auger-hole; but bear up your heads stifly, do'nt ye run
away like water-rats, stand to your pease-pottage lustily, there's
pork enough aboard to make brewis till ye eat and split again:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97843:3"/>
'Twould make a mans teeth water to think of your good bouls of
lob-lolly and fat poor-Jack upon fish-daies. But enough of this <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
now to come to ye, as I told ye, having cleared this point, I mean
to handle the second part of my division in the same tune: Ye know
we have been long oppressed with that Arch-Traitor, the King (they
may thank my Councel, or his head had been on to plot mischief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Saints to this day) but I think we are rid of him now, I
was fain to stablish the heart, and strengthen the hand of the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Executioner, or else the Fellow had melted into Malignancy, for
fear of that Scarcrow sentence, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed;</hi> but I hope tis
better his head's of, then that this generation of <hi>Prophets</hi> should have
had any harm. Blades, I think ye are sufficiently instructed in these
state principles, I shall now come to ye in a word of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
I could have spoke a few Latin sentences to ye, that has all
your good qualities stowed in a little room, but those was learnt in
the time of Egyptian bondage, only to have fitted me for a cringing
<hi>Conformist;</hi> and in this time of clear light and liberty, tis a language
as detestable, as hard to be understood: I must therfore tell ye at
length, in words issuing from a meek heart, that I love a tarpauling,
for these four good qualities.</p>
            <p>First, because they pray so fervently when they are in danger,
though they swear as devoutly when the storm's over; and truly
however it appears, they have the gift of the spirit in them, that they
will take so much pains to pray at all.</p>
            <p>Secondarily, as for their <hi>Religion,</hi> so for their honest dealings; for
I never knew any man complain of them without a just cause, only
the Custom-house-waiters have wink'd at many of their pretty pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
between ship and shore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for their ingenuity; for they are commonly as cunning
horsons as can be, and can over-reach the Devil, or a Broker, the
length of a <hi>hawser.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, for their courage; for they'l do more mischief with
one Demi-Culverin, then <hi>Cromwel</hi> can with a whole Troop of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons;</hi>
and one bottle of strong-waters will make a ships gang do
more execution, then 100 fire-locks; they'l fight with all the Turks
in Christendom, if they get them once between wind and water: I
know lads, you cannot chuse but laugh to think what fine sport
there will be betwixt you and the Princes ships, 'twill be bisket and
beverage to you to be together by the ears with them, and then some
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97843:3"/>
of ye may see the wonders of the deep: I could speak nothing but
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and crackers, fireworks and granadoes, murderers and brasse
basses, Cannons and confusion to ye, to make ye in love with the
thoughts of a sea-fight (such a one as I never saw, nor I hope never
shall) but that I know y'had rather hav't<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then hear on't: In the mean
time, consider with your selves, and take comfort in't, 'twill be a
godlier sea-fight then that between your Ancestours and the Spanish
Armado. You have all the pillars of truth to support you in the
Cause, and those are as strong as can be established by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and I hope you have more grace then to build your faith
upon any other foundation; for the Scriptures, if they be not with
us, they shall not seem to be against us; for I believe your Ministers
are not to learn how to stretch them home enough at sea, as well as
at land. Again consider, but what store of brave purchase there wil
be instead of pay for you; for they say the Rebels are richly laden,
and if you can but scape knocks, and come off with credit. I'le get the
<hi>Moderate Intelligencer</hi> to canonize ye for brave fellows; and <hi>Harry Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
shal every Friday write your Admirals names in Hebrew, that
their fames may be read backwards: For my own part, I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to take half a score texts out of the volume of your victories, and
preach whole pulpits ful of fire and smoke against your adversaries,
the wooden horse Cavaliery enough to make a Church stink as bad
as <hi>Paul's</hi> dores of horse pisse. For your Admirals, they are all men
of valour, and love to defie danger as little as you doe; only it wil
not be fit that they should hazard their persons in the face of a fight;
but it wil be more necessaay, that they go to Councel in the Hould,
whilst you bustle above Decks: They are men of as good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as an Ordinance of Parliament can make them, and I hope you'l
say, that can set all things to rights; or else how could we have hit
the way hither? I am confident you cannot but love them for their
sakes that sent them ye, and for my sake that commend them to ye;
and you know I do not use to praise honest men to their faces; they
were begotten by the Army, created by the Parliament, and dub'd by
the right reverend Committee of <hi>Derby-house,</hi> and I think all these
are able to make four <hi>sea guls:</hi> I doubt not but they'l use ye as wel as
as they can find in their hearts; if ye corrupt them to run away with
you, you may chance venture a neck-cracking together, if ere you
be caught again. I think I have perswaded you to obey every body
that I think fit; and when you feel the fruits of my good councel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97843:4"/>
working, I make no question but you'l remember me when you go
down into your Kingdom: Yet know in the times when superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and tyrannie raged like the raving of the waters, your conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were chain'd from flying into your faces, with two inseparable
links of Allegiance and Supremacy, and you groan'd under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
weight of those oppressive burthens: Now ye are at ease, and
have free liberty to swear to be true to no body; for indeed oaths
are profane, and not fit for tender consciences, that can brook any
thing but obedience to their betters; a solemn engagement after
the newest fashion, wil best become men of your reformed tempers,
and that to be done without Book; for I know good letters are too
hard for your discretion, only when they are delivered to you by
word of mouth, you can swallow that wil stick by the ribs; for you
are men of memory, or else how could so many Masters and Mates
chaulk out their observations for a whole voyage, without pen, ink,
or paper? Pray send's news when y'are gone, whether ye sink or
swim. For your Wifes, I hope the Army are resolved to take care
that they shal not catch cold in your absence; and for your goods
that you make prize on, you must consign them to your dear friends
of the Admiralty, who intend to put them out at interest to increase
a common stock against you come to fight with them. Now judge
my Masters, if you have not a gracious Parliament, and a charitable
Army that intend to make the best of you, and your Wifes, that they
can. I shall say no more in this particular, for I suppose you have
faith enough in them to be saved harmlesse by them: I shall only
speak a word or two to the wiser sort amongst ye (which wil be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
a conscience to make ye all run horn-mad to do mischief)
and that's this, Be sure when you meet any of those rogues, that
you tack about, and get to lee-ward of them, and then you may
pepper them with smal shot; I know the advantage of old, for a
good device; for though I am now a fresh-water Chaplain, I can
spit salt-water sentences in your mouths, that will comfort your
stomacks in a morning fresh and fasting, as wel as a dish of burnt
brandy-wine. For your ships, I think they are wel rigged, or the
Devil's in them; y'have as good beer aboard, as ever wet whistle;
Colonel <hi>Pride</hi> can give ye an account of more grains and hops spent
in the brewing on't, then his belly will hold. For pease to your
pork, all the hogs in <hi>England</hi> cannot feed upon better; and I think
you love hogs should feed as wel as you: or else how would ye have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97843:4"/>
pork fat enough to make your mouths ladder on both sides like
a washing-boul? Your beef wil be so tender within this month
you may suck it with a quil, or the murrin was in't; for I am
sure some of the Purvers for the Fleet went over hedge and ditch
to pick and choose good Cattle, and sometimes they found the
Country-men had hid them in ditches and odd corners, and there
they lay as stil as Loaches, for fear of being knockt o'th' head.
For your bread, if there be not store of maggots in't by this time,
<hi>Harry Scobel</hi> shall draw up an Ordinance to set your Baker on the
pillory; for you know the sweetest Bisket wil fil your mouths
ful of sirrop, and fatten your kidneys: I think the Parliament
has took as great care for your temporal food, as for your spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
diet, or else they would ne're have sent me hither to preach
such crums of comfort to ye; I hope you wil love them; if you
cannot love them for Gods sake, love them for my sake; and if
you cannot fight for them for their own sakes, fight for your selves
and be hang'd, so ye do good any way: I am sure ye had never
more need to look about ye, for there's few enough that takes any
care for ye; your own wives are resolved and ye be such Cowards
never to come, they'l ne're cry for ye, and your children wil have
more grace then to own ye for Fathers, without ye prove your
selves <hi>Cromwel's</hi> boyes, and come off gallantly. And now mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caps
steer steady, starboard, for if the Ruffins chase ye out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
they'l make sherks meat on ye; I would have ye pick Ocum
enough, as you go out, for you'l have work enough to stop leaks
if e're ye meet with your matches; and pray when ye lye in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
have your Fore-Castle clear, that ye may cut cable upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occasion, and then blow wind, run ship, one suit of sails wil
do more service then twenty brasse-pieces; I think you cannot
say but I have ballanc't ye wel with good docrements, and caulk'd
ye with good councels; and now 'tis time to turn you a
drift; I have nothing more to say to ye, but charge ye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to pray to the Parliament to prosper your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and I'le give ye one of their last Declarations to use
for a Service-Book; I hope this is Sermon enough for ye as
long as ye live, if ye make a good use on't: And so fare
as well as ye can, for we had as good part here, as in a
worse place; I hope to see ye again, if not in a better place,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97843:5"/>
yet in another world; and so I leave you, I'le have this
Speech printed and sent down to ye very shortly, that ye may
con it as perfect as your compasse, and then I shall be with
you in spirit, though I be absent in the flesh.</p>
