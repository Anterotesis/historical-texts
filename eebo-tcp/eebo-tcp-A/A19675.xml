            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F euer any age hath beene more fertile and abundant then others, in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of writers in all manner of sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, learning and knowledge, truely it is this wherein we liue. But chiefly in Diuinity and the holy mysteries of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the knowledge whereof ought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to bee the chiefe and onely scope of
<pb facs="tcp:22754:3"/>
our Christian endeauours, as being the true mirror wherein wee may fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the true pathway which is able to conduct our pensiue soules vnto those supernal mansions, which are in the house of God the Father, and are prepared for the elect. And among so many learned &amp; godly treatises, of this kinde, which the painefull labours of our Pastours and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue set forth for the comfort of the militant Church, I can finde none that doth more aptly, briefly and learnedly conuince the errors of this crooked and naughty generation of the Romish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, then these Conformities, which are most fit and proper summarily to confound the idle and selfe-pleasing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, fansies, traditions, additions, fractions, diminutions, substractions, and mutations which they haue distilled out of the naughty and corrupted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of their distracted braines, and sowne most cunningly in euery corner of the true Church of God. Which things hauing weighed with my selfe, as likewise the vtilitie and comfort which
<pb facs="tcp:22754:3"/>
might further bee reaped hereof, if the same were translated into our language, namely in these dangerous and latter dayes, in the which Sathan our euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting aduersarie knowing the end of his kingdome to be very neereat hand, doth so subtlely and carefully watch how to entrappeand deuoure vs, I haue hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to expose the same vnto the view of my countrey; not labouring herein to snatch at any parcell of ambitious and vaine glory: but rather to employ the little peece of a Talent which hath beene alotted vnto mee, in some godly and Christian exercise, to the further increase of Gods glory, and subuersion of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. Accept therefore (Madame) these three Conformities, which I haue beene the bolder to offer to your Honour; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering as well your most godly and Christian life and conuersation, together with your feruent zeale and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the truth of the Gospell, as like wise those morall vertues wherewith you are adorned. Which concurring together in your noble person are able (no doubt)
<pb facs="tcp:22754:4"/>
to deserue farremore then euer hath been bestowed on you, or my meane power able to offer vnto you. The world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how Religiously, Noblely, Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, Faithfully, and with what paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and long care my Lord your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and you haue trained vp our most Royall Princesse the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who in her childehood at her first comming into this Kingdome, was by his Maiesty committed to your charge and custodie, after that hee had beene surely informed with what rare gifts and noble parts you were beautified, farre aboue a multitude of your sexe and rancke. And when by the happy coniunction of the Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector Palatine with her Highnesse, it seemed to be no more necessary that your Honours should giue attendance on her Highnesse, and that my Lord and you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing therefore honourably and with his Maiesties fauour and consent giuen ouer the sacred charge of her person, and thinking now at length to haue beene rid of so waighty a burden, and that you might haue liued the rest of your daies in
<pb facs="tcp:22754:4"/>
some secure port of tranquillity. Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little time his Maiesty hauing had so many yeares experience of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours prudent and watchfull care of her Highnesse well and prosperous estate, and knowing that your Honourable presence and attendance on her, were no lesse necessary vnto her now of late, then your painefull care and most vigilant cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie had beene in the time of her tender age, did yet once againe summond your Honour to take vpon you, though not all, yet a great and principall part of your wonted charge? namely to admonish and impart your most wholesome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels vnto her, to the farther increase of all her Royall vertues and qualities, as well in matters of noble conuersation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, as of true piety and deuotion. And although the multitude of your most serious affaires doth afford but small leysure vnto your priuate medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Yet I am sure that this treatise will purchase so much fauour at your hands, as to haue some spare houres spent in the reading thereof, wherein you may

bee not a little refreshed with the most sweete and delectable varietie of these Conformities which are presented to your Honour, hoping that they shall be embraced with no lesse fauour and goodwill, then they are giuen by him, who remaineth</p>

                  <p>I haue often beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that men of so great worth in the eyes of the world (GOD hauing set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them this vniuersall pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the saluation and reparation of mankinde through the preaching of the Gospell) could yet still delight and dally in these errors the abhomination whereof hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beene declared vnto them. And it is strange that this impietie which durst onely whisper in the eare, doth now steppe vp into the Pulpit and there practiseth, that shee may spew forth her blasphemies against the holy Religion of
<pb facs="tcp:22754:6"/>
                     <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> Which not onely our Iesuites doe labour apace to set forward and aduance, but also our Apostates, who thinking to shew that by good reasons they haue beene moued to reuolt, haue so much the more manifested their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or rather foolishnesse, euen in such a time as the veritie is made so cleare, and falshood vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked with so great aduantage. Wherein wee may acknowledge the profound iudgements of God, who neuer hauing fayled to such as sought after his glorie, and hauing at this day manifested him-selfe in his word as much as euer hee did, to the end that hee might make knowne vnto vs the foundation stone of his admirable building of the Church, to wit his sonne <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the greater part of such, as goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cloath themselues with this so honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Title of Christian, not beeing content with this spirituall seede of the regeneration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde hath inuented I know not what word, which they name vnwritten, and in stead of Chusing the true Sion, are well pleased to dwell among those olde ruines of Gentilisme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they haue beautified the mayne part of their seruice. And verily, if wee consider narrowlie this great heape of their ceremonies, and that which they holde to bee the principall hindge of Religion, wee shall perceiue that they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the gouernement of their Church (which ought rather to haue beene the holy habitation of God) vnto. <hi>Numa Pompilius, Pontife</hi> of Rome, or to some olde Law-giuers, which esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<pb facs="tcp:22754:6"/>
certaine Lawes, concerning such things as they reputed sacred, and thought to belong vnto the seruice of their Gods. Behold then the Heathen returned into the world, and that after a triumphing manner, who to the end that they might the better fortifie themselues against <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> haue called great <hi>Caiphas</hi> and the Scribes to assist them, that they may depriue him of his spirituall kingdome: Pharisaisme, that they may restore againe the false doctrine of good workes: and the Marcionists, that of his humanirie they may make onely a fansie. What further? In a word behold Gentilisme, Iudaisme and old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies erected in the sanctuary, where the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory ought to haue beene alone to attend and learne the Oracles of one onely God. But to the end that those against whom wee proceede, may haue no cause to complaine, as if wee had accused them vniustly, I haue vndertaken to declare (though briefly) in these three conformities, how that the Romish Church is very much putrified and corrupted, and that shee is full of diseases. And hauing had no other desseing at the begining of this worke, but for mine owne particular vse, hauing already dedicated my writes vnto a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my closet, yet notwithstanding the aduise of my friends hath made me steppe on a little far ther, and publish the same. And I am so much delighted in the beautie of this subiect, that I haue taken the boldnesse to consecrate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the first Conformitie vnto you: first as an homage for so many good deedes for which I

remaine your debtour: Next because I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies knowne your zeale toward Gods word, whereof not onely your learned writs doe beare record, but also your publick lectures in Diuinity, and other holy exercises of pietie, whereby you are admired and beloued of good people.

                  <head>THE PREFACE, To those of the Romish CHVRCH.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Masters, who would discerne true coyne from that which is adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will not content himselfe with looking on the superscription, the stamp, colour, &amp; round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, but going on a little farther, will come to the triall of the substance of the mettall, will take the touchstone, and draw thereon, to examine the goodnesse or insufficiencie thereof. Euen so to discerne true Religion from false, and to know the Church of Iesus Christ in this confusion of so many, that are like thereunto, we must not be contented with the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, which you call representatiue, but we ought to goe straight on to the onely Scriptures, which are the foundation and pillers of the true cause in matters that concerne Religion. And if we had stayed there, we should not see at this day such horrible confusions in Christendome, neither yet this mixture of cockle with good corne, and there would remaine nothing but pure wheat in the garnar and store-house
<pb facs="tcp:22754:13"/>
of the Church. And would to God that some of the auncient Bishops could haue contented themselues with the marches established by the holy Ghost, the greatest part of the world should not now be wandering in the auncient pathes and footsteps of Gentilisme, against which the Apostles, and many other infinite numbers of the most excellent and worthie men haue foughten and obtained the victorie, through shedding of their bloud. Should not this exquisite ballance, square, and canon of the Scripture, this rule of right and veritie haue beene sufficient to teach vs whatsoeuer belongeth to the whole perfection of our beleefe? We ought not to haue beene ignorant of these beautifull markes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie: That there is no other proofe of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but by the Scriptures, if any controuersie arise where to find the bodie, that is to say, the Church, that it ought not to be sought amongst our words, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his words who is the truth, and knoweth his bodie, to wit, Iesus Christ. It was thither that the Bishops should haue led the Gentils, to teach them to worship one onely God, to make them turne from their old superstitions and idolatrous customes, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence whereof they haue beene forced to worship their false Gods and creatures, and should not haue giuen way to so many things, which are so farre from hauing any warrant in the holy Scriptures, that they are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory thereunto. It is after this manner that it hath seemed good vnto the wisedome of man to iest and play with the high and holy mysteries of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; It is after this manner that thinking onely to winke at things, and that through tolerating of the lesser euill, to eschew greater inconuenience, this holy
<pb facs="tcp:22754:13"/>
spring of Christian pietie hath beene infected by the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie mud of Paganisme, from whence those deludges haue proceeded, which haue ouerwhelmed some fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of our saluation. And would to God that those zealous ones without knowledge had taught their Neophytes to thinke it abhomination, to suffer themselues to be led away by degrees vnto such things as at first seemed pleasant, we should not see at this day such pestilent doctrine, neither yet those superstitions and ridiculous ceremonies, which haue caused as well in times past as in these dayes, so many troubles in Christendome. But this is their reward, who haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to preferre the Church to the Scripture, and man to God, as if it were more expedient to find out the head by the proofe and testimony of the members, then the members by the testimonie of the head. I am exceeding sorie to consider, that when the time of appearing before the tribunall seate of God shall come, the damned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles shall know their markes and liueries on you, and that in great aboundance, as this present table of your conformities vnto their fashions and customes, shall clearely and faithfully beare record. But let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how this filthinesse hath corrupted that beautie that was among you. Those poore Gentils, liuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Empire of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, when the Church of Christ was taking a little breath, and did enioy some peace and rest after so many persecutions and martyrdomes of her children, beganne to enter therein in great throng, and by multitudes. But how? hauing lately renounced the polluted slauerie of their Gods, of Gentilisme, of worshipping of images; and their feete being as yet foule with the dirt of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries.
<pb facs="tcp:22754:14"/>
And that which helped very much to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance those old ragges, was because they began to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christian Religion, being well ripe in yeares, and full of gray haires, which was the cause why they could not so suddainely shake off such customes as they had sucked with their mothers milke. But behold here the very finall accomplishment of euill fortune, to wit, the conniuence of the greater part of the Bishops at such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who not hauing discouered a farre off such daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as might ensue and follow vpon this lenitie, and licence graunted by them, some more some lesse accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their humors, hauing tolerated these abuses, Paganisme tooke its owne place, and Gentilisme passed farre aboue that measure which was prescribed by the Oracles of God. They thought with themselues that they had laboured much for the aduancement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, if at the first they could but onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them from worshipping of their Gods, thereafter to send them vnto such Christian Saints as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased: but this was nothing else but a changing of the name and not of the thing it selfe. They ought in the space of so many ages to haue found out some remedie for this disease: but in stead of abolishing and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these abuses, we see the same daily confirmed, yea, moreouer a farre greater encrease of this dirt and dregs of the Heathen, in lieu of the pure drop of true pietie and Christian simplicitie. Euen so farre are we from any hope to see the same reformed, sith the lesuits haue vndertaken at a set price to defend those errors, and haue published in their writs, that Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may lawfully make vse of the ceremonies of the Gentils, which is as much as if one would say that God
<pb facs="tcp:22754:14"/>
maketh vse of the Deuils lawes for the weale of his people. And thus it is that the Romish Church, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by vnreasonable reasons, aduanceth in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner euen vnto this day, yea, and commaundeth and authoriseth euill customes in place of good lawes, and the reliques of Gentilisme in great plentie, in stead of the puritie of the Gospell. Your opinion was, that the spirituall kingdome of Iesus Christ should haue beene gouerned like the Monarchies of this world, whose ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers beare with many of their subiects faults, to the end that they may haue peace with strangers; but it is not so: for as touching so farre as directly concerneth the true knowledge of God, and of the puritie of his seruice, of the estate of the conscience, of the nature of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, we ought to haue recourse vnto the Canonicall bookes, and not vnto popular abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: they are the precepts of faith that ought to be layd open vnto the people, and not those preiudicate opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, coloured with deuotion, against which the holy Fathers haue foughten so couragiously. In the end, this little Treatise will declare vnto you how that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is borded with those totters and rags of Gentilis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. God graunt you the grace to acknowledge the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie thereof, that you may depart from thence, and enter in league with her which is most beautifull, to wit, the Church wherein we liue, which is well pleased with such ornaments, as her spouse Christ Iesus our Sauiour hath giuen her, to whom be glory and honour for euer.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Purgatorie.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE will speake of Purgatorie, which is the patrimonie of the Romish Clergie, and the chiefe foundation of the Masses for the dead. Our writers haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by their learned writs, that it was vnknown vnder the Law, was without any proofe or likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, let it be neuer so small, either in the old or new Testament. And those of the Romish Church could not in the whole Bible, find out any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their Purgatorie, saue onely in one place of the second of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> an Apocryphall booke. We will not sound the deepenesse of this matter, sith <hi>Purgatory</hi> was not holden or deliuered as an Article of faith, more then 400. yeares after the death of our Sauiour, and S. <hi>Austin</hi> himselfe did hold it onely for a problematicall doctrine, which should not be taught to the people by the <hi>Heralds</hi> of the doctrine of saluation. What <note n="a" place="margin">Who doth not perceiue that Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> hath from thence the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, where he placeth the Purgatorie of some soules in baths, some in the wind vnder leaues of trees, others in the fire.</note> is the ground thereof then, and who hath sowen the first seede thereof? Who but <hi>Plato, Homer, Virgil,</hi> Mahomet and such other Gentiles? And S. <hi>Austin</hi> himselfe findeth such a conformitie betweene the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> and that of the Christians of his time, that he hath termed this decree meerely Platonicall: which the Iesuits with all their subtilities dare not deny. Then Purgatorie is wholly builded after the paterne of the doctrine of the Gentiles, as it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22754:22"/>
may easily be demonstrated. <hi>Eusebius</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>De prepar. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uang. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>ca. vlt.</hi>
                        </note> making mention of the doctrine of <hi>Plato; So soone as the dead are arriued in the place, whereunto they haue bin transported, first of all it is discussed in iudgement who hath liued well or naughtily: and if any seeme to haue liued after a mid-way manner, they are carried along the Acheron to a marish, where they are purged by enduring of heauie punishment, and being deliuered from thence are rewarded with honours according to their merites and good workes.</hi> And this doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on more at length, vsing namely these words, to purge and absolue. And in another place out of <hi>Gorgias</hi> in <hi>Plato: Those that haue sinned,</hi> saith he, <hi>curably, that is to say, easie to be pardoned, are purged by suffering of torments, both while they are liuing here, and in hell after their decease. But as touching those that haue sinned incurably, to such no good can happen, sith they are incurable.</hi> And thus did <hi>Plato</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">

And for these last, I say, he appointeth somtimes burning riuers, and other sorts of punishment for the expiation of their crimes. And to the intent that they may not lie lingering in these torments, as you haue yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Masses for the dead, <note n="d" place="margin">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22754:30"/>

We wish onely that the intention of the testators might haue beene iustly and duely obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which was to comfort, to cause receiue, and maintaine with those goods that they had left, the strangers, the sicke, the distressed, the orphanes, the poore, and to redeeme captines. I will seeke no other witnesses then you, how those goods are managed in your Churches. <hi>Numa</hi> allowed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for the Vestall virgines, out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reuenues. Priuate persons being either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this example, or rather prouoked through a superstitious deuotion, did after the same manner: and the donations whether they were in mouable, orin immoueable goods, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing daily more and more, did enlarge the Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and made them become exceeding rich, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some belonged to the Princes disposition, or to the common wealthes, or else depended of the Colledge of the Pontifes: and the rest belonged to the presentation of some priuate persons, by the right of patronage: as at this day the Emperour, the Kings, the Pope, &amp; others haue this right of be stowing Benefices. And from thence we gather, that the <note n="c" place="margin">Curia Romana non petit ouem sine lana.</note> Offrings, Pledges, Firstfruits, Mortuaties, Anniuersaries, and Legacies, Fines, Confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Condemnations were the ordinarie reuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22754:31"/>
of the auncient Romane Sacrificers. This is verified by the monuments and sepulchers, from whence you haue taken the modell of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the dead, which at this day haue for their pile the doctrine of Purgatorie, notwithstanding that those foundations were laid a great while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For the fifteene Councels which we haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Greeke, speake not one word of them, although they come so far as the eighth hundreth yeare.

All his Legacies tend to the maintenance of the poore. And such as haue written of the antiquities of the Gaulles, doc attribute those donations made for the dead (which smelleth altogether of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme) to the prodigalitie of <hi>Dagobert,</hi> King of <note n="e" place="margin">Du Tillet in his abridged Chron, of the French Kings.</note> Frannce, pretending thereby to obtaine pardon for his sins, after he had liued all his dayes shut vp among women.

Concerning the last; the Popes dispensation is requisite thereto, if any will inioy a pluralitie, which was practised in old times among the Gentiles (and in some cases we denie not to be iust and lawfull among Christians:) for to enioy two Benefices, the dispensation of the soueraigne Romish <hi>Pontife</hi> was requisite, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Historie of <hi>Fabius Maximus.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:22754:31"/>
it is not to day that these contentions, concerning Benefices, haue beene engendered. For during the reigne of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the second of that name, there arose a fierce combat among the Christian Priests, and the Idolaters, vpon the quarrell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning foundations and legacies. And in this age, the whole life of man were not sufficient to learne all the cousining practises, wherewith this Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall subiect is accompanied, and mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And concerning Tithes, the matter cannot be cloaked any longer with the Tithes of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, it is but a wett sacke in time of raine, seeing you doe rather with them maintaine your prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie and pride, then susteine the poore.

They haue their Popes, who censure Kings, euen as hee of Rome doth, and deposeth them, thereafter they cause themselues to be carried vpon mens shoulders. The <hi>Bonzes</hi> are Fryers: the <hi>Tundes</hi> are Bishops, which haue the bestowing of smaller Benefices, commuand fastes, take order for eating of flesh.

there you may contemplate faire Libraries, dining roomes, galleries, and chappels, they liue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montie together, they absteine from mariage, and vse poling. They haue their belles, their claustrall deuotion, their musicke, their canonicall houres. Sometimes they are busie in meditation, and haue certaine houres appointed for their recreation. They haue praying for the dead, and the fire of Purgatory is kindled among them, as it is among you; lights, perfumes, frankincense, and holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are not forgotten, no more then are the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and strings of beades, which they carrie in their hands, to number their prayers with. Bulls and warrants for soules are graunted. In a word, it is all one thing: if there be any difference, it consisteth onely in the names. And as you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the God that is created in your Masse, whom you keepe locked in your prisons farre from any vse, so also haue they their God <hi>Amide,</hi> which is gloriously seated on the altar in the middest of the Temple.

When the throng of the Gentiles was entring into Christianisme, many things were tolerated in them, and some of the Pastours thought that they had gained no small matter, by leauing vnto them the images of Saints, in place of their idols. But in the end, <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of Rome, let all goe loose, and in stead of banding himself against Paganisme, as many good Bishops had done, both before him and in his time, became both a counsellor and an example vnto them, that they might frame themselues vnto their customes.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Masters, we shall be briefe in the description of the harmony, which is betweene your Church and Iudaisme. For if we would search narrowly that great heape of ceremonies, which hath beene transported from the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law into yours, wee should neuer haue done, and the reading thereof might perhaps be tedious, for the prolixitie of the same. And truely if we search well the fountaine of all your cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, whereby the pure seruice of God hath beene made not honourable, but by little and little hath beene disguised and transfigured, and in end conuerted into Idolatry and vngodlinesse; we should finde them to be as many remnants of Iudaisme, if we adde vnto them that which hath beene taken out of the puddle of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilisme, as we haue declared in the conformitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. It is after this manner, that so cunningly you haue mingled together with your deuotions, rules and
<pb facs="tcp:22754:82"/>
ceremonies, not onely the Mythologies of the Pagans, but that also which in old times was appointed for his people, at this time neuerthelesse abolished through the comming of our Sauiour Christ Iesus, who hauing fully executed the charge which the heauenly Father had committed vnto him, hath done all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for deliuering of vs from the second death, and to purchase vnto vs life euerlasting, as it was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto the Fathers, euen when the first sinne was committed, and afterwards figured and shadowed by the Ceremonies of the whole outward seruice of the Church of Israel. Seeing therefore that he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly accomplished all whatsoeuer was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 17.</note> and foretold, as well of his person as of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and that he hath put an end to all the shadowes of the legall ceremonies, wherefore haue you restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the greater part of those types which were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised vnder the Leuiticall gouernement? Those cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall lawes were eyther personall, or were appointed for the daily and ordinary seruice of the Tabernacle, or for the vse of sacrifices, purifications, expiations and such other shadowes of this auncient pedagogie, which God had ordained, as well to separate his chosen people <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 12.</note> from the Idolatrous nations, to hinder them from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto themselues any new seruices at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and following their owne fancies, as to admonish them to nourish and confirme their faith, in looking for the great Messias, who was shadowed by those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. All these things haue ceased; And that those Ceremonies are not acceptable vnto God at this time, it appeareth in this that the Iewish policie is no more, the Arke is lost, the Vrim and Thumim suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb facs="tcp:22754:82"/>
the citie of Hierusalem defaced, and the temple destroyed, so that there is not a stone left vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,: and what licence soeuer the Iewes obtained to reedifie the same, as vnder <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall foe vnto the Christians, who did contribute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thereto, yet could they neuer bring it to passe. But, as the Gentiles themselues of those dayes doe witnesse, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ammian Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. lib.</hi> 23.</note> fires comming out of the earth, and great thundrings from heauen, consumed the workemen, and scattered the workes which they had begunne, with exceeding great pride and cost. And where now is the fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming the holocaustes, the glorie of God among the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> the manifest inspiration of the holy-Spirit vpon the Prophets, the Arke of the couenant, the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which came out of the propitiatory, the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim,</hi> the Royall and Priestly annointing: in a word, all those goodly prerogatiues, wherewith God in old times did beautifie and adorne his people? The whole is no more, and it is certaine that if it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to continue and prolong, as well these things, as the ceremonies of the Law, he had not suffered the Romane Emperour to ouerthrow Ierusalem, to destroy the sanctuary, and abolish the sacrifices throughout the whole earth. And those vtter desolations which haue happened vnto this people through his permission, and were foretold in old times by the propheticall Oracles, doe sufficiently shew the bill of diuorcement which <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</note> God hath sent to those types and shadowes, whereof also we did not stand any more in neede: sith the truth hath beene manifested both vnto their eyes and yours. And since it is so, wherefore haue you set them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? You haue loaded your selues with so heauy a
<pb facs="tcp:22754:83"/>

But doe you not counterfeit Christ Iesus in things, which hee neuer did, to that end that he might be followed and imitated therein?

Others begin the fast, seauen weekes before the feast, although they fast but fifteene dayes, making certaine interualles, and neuerthelesse call that time Lent. And I wonder how all these, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they agree not in the number of the dayes, yet notwithstanding they agree all in one to name it Lent. Some shew a reason for this name, which is of their owne inuention. Some are found to differ, not onely in the number of the dayes, but likewise in the absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meates; some abstaining from all manner of beasts; others from all other beasts saue fishes, others besides fishes doe nourish themselues with those fowles, which (according to</hi> Moyses) <hi>they say were begotten of the waters; others abstaining from all manner of fruits that haue hard shels, and from egges: some others eating nothing but dry bread, and some eating nothing at all. Some there are, who after that they haue fasted till nine of the clock, vse diuers kinds of meates.</hi> Wee haue the rather copied this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at length, that wee may shew how that the historiographer placeth all these without the faith, yea and without the Apostolique tradition, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them indifferent to euery one.

Wherefore then doe you ouerlode the Church with this burden so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?

same manner that S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, That he sacrificeth the Gospell, that the Fathers say that to preach the Gospell is the worke of a Sacrificer. And what say you? As in old times the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> had a sacrifice, which was offered vp euery day: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so you boast your selues, that euery day in your Masse, you offer a propitiatorie sacrifice without bloud, for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead. Verily I confesse that you differ from the Iewes, in so much as you sing not your Masses at night, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be at Christmasse in the mid-night, and in some extraordinarie case, and by the Popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation: But you cannot deny that you haue framed your Masse after the Leuiticall morning and euening sacrifices, and your Sacrificers after the manner of those that were established in the auncient law: although you ought not to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, speaking of Sacrificers as they are taken properly, that among Christians there is none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no more sacrifices according to their proper signification. If by sacrifice we vnderstand <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>WE must returne vnto that which you vse in your Temples. That vaile rent asunder at the death of Christ Iesus, did shew vnto this wretched people of the Iewes, that at this time there is neither sacrifice nor Sacrificer, neither altar, nor temple. And by the renting thereof, he would declare that the elect may search euen into the secrets of Gods councell touching their saluation. And you not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the signification of so excellent a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, haue set the vailes vp againe in your Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall and Collegiat Churches, chiefly in time of Lent, as if the Christian people ought to be letted from beholding of the Sanctuarie, that is to say, from the knowledge of eternall life through <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> And in this doe you not patch together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that vaile which in old times was rent asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the toppe to the bottome? So many Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish ceremonies as you haue brought into Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, are as many vailes sowed and patched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And say now that you are not like vnto those wretches, which in the Apostles time would haue ioyned the vaile together againe, by a coniunction of the Gospell with the regall ceremonies, and of circumcision with Baptisme.

whose number is infinite, those burning lampes and lights, the Chrisme, your annointing with oile, and other infinite abuses that are to be found among you, are as many additions of new vailes and sacraments which you haue inuented.

Truth it is that this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ordained by God, did lead them vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the greatnesse of their sinne, which defileth the conception and birth of the child, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as it defiled the first Parents. This was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely for disciplines cause, and this vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was onely simply ciuill, during which the woman was bound not to come vnto publike as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, whereinto shee was admitted afterward, hauing satisfied the Law, which commaunded to offer a lambe, or a paire of turtle doues, or doues.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:22754:106"/>
You by the contrary thinke that the woman is in the power of Sathan, so long as shee is in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and that shee hath need of tapers, which you terme hallowed, of coniurations and other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for her deliuerie.

It is enough my Masters, and we should neuer haue done, seeing that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of the Iewish ceremonies hath growne so far, that the whole outward seruice of God is changed into a Leuiticall Religion, after such manner that it seemeth that the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, hath yet still the administration and rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the house of God here beneath: an order, I say, which was abolished by <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Sacrificer, who hauing taken on him the charge of his Fathers house, hath really shewed vnto vs the true meaning of all those shadows and figures of the Law, and through offering vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on the Crosse once for all, and neuer to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated againe, hath freed vs from that bondage, and hath made open the passage vnto the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Sanctuarie.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I would not shew my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the writers that abound at this day, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented my selfe in priuate with the reading of the <hi>Orthodoxes,</hi> and contemned such as for the
<pb facs="tcp:22754:109"/>
most part doe nothing but vent their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholies vnto the world. I haue hit on this resolution, because I am a louer of a retired life, and of solitarinesse among my Bookes, taking pleasure to talke with the dead, wherein consisteth the chiefe iewell of my life. This age swarmeth in good Spirits, and as Africke is fertile in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which it produceth daily, so in like manner we may say that it is a wonder and miracle in nature, to contemplate this exquisite knowledge in all sciences and tongues wherwith many are indued, that it appeareth that we haue paragoned that old antiquity: I say in science, not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Who then hath marred this my silence? You, Sir: for as we were reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning heresie (a subiect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the seducers through their false O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and writs haue long agoe beene baiting and hammering on the heads and hearts of their confederates, labouring to perswade them that those of thereformed Religion are defiled therewith) you thought it expedient, that through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie demonstrations, which should be
<pb facs="tcp:22754:109"/>
both solide and true, I should declare to the world that this imputation is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ascribed vnto vs. There is no parish Priest (how raskally soeuer he be) that hath not this word <hi>Heretike</hi> in his mouth. What will those great Masters in mateo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie doe then? If little puppies doe keepe such a yelling, what will be the effect of the barking of these great mastifs? It is the custome of whores to preuent honest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones, and to lay to their charge that, wherewith they are tached themselues. Those Iesuites, the buttresses of the Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Religion, the creame and very quin tessence of Fryers, to speake no worse, doc in like manner. They are scabbie, and would perswade vs to scratch our selues as they doe, although our conscience be not defiled. Those that are attainted and branded by Iustice, desire nothing more then to haue many fellowes both in their iniquity, and their punishment. What shall we do here? Shall we betray our brethren and our soules? Shall we temporise, as if we had some fellowship with this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all brothel-house? This would proue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlinesse
<pb facs="tcp:22754:110"/>
in vs. Wherefore, following your aduise, I haue thought fit to shew vpon the theatre of the world, that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heresies as we are accused of, are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calumnies and lies: and that it is the Romish Church, which is wonderfully disfigured &amp; polluted, as we shall declare, God willing.

                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> placeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the workes of the flesh. It is not to day, that this contagion of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar chusing of opinions, hath corrupted a great number of men. The Churches, both of Israell and primitiue, haue tasted of this cruell poyson. Those wits that made too great account of Philosophie, and are borne among Sophismes, puft vp with pride, pale and deformed through ennie, haue hatched this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and brought forth this Hydra of all mischiefes. No age hath beene free thereof. The histories doe set before our eyes and our eares some lamentable examples, and namely in these latter dayes: which being most fertile in all vices, are likewise fruitfull in producing those
<pb facs="tcp:22754:111"/>
detestable heresies, the effects whereof are to draw away men from the way of truth, to make them become <note place="margin">Effects of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> enemies thereof, as did in old times <hi>Iamnes,</hi> and <hi>Mambres</hi> the aduersaries of <hi>Moyses,</hi> to corrupt them in their vnderstanding, to ioyne them with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and at length to debarre them from the Kingdome of God.

                     </note> returne againe this title vnto you, like a ball in the Tennis-court. Who will beleeue you? Who will beleeue vs? There is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty here: let vs examine the doctrines: let vs search diligently for that which is true. That is true saith a certaine Father <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertul. aduer. Marcion. lib.</hi> 4.</note>, which is the first, that is first which is from the beginning: and that is from the beginning which is from the Apostles. Wee haue this true, this first, this beginning, the doctrine of the Apostles, which is the Anchor of our Faith. There will nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for you therefore, but the last and false, to wit, the dregges of heresie. Yet doe you not cease to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach vnto vs, that we haue renued, and as it were drawne out of hell many old Heresies, which (as you exclaime) we haue broached in these latter times, and haue insinuated them into the beleefe of men for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall doctrines. And to the end that none should thinke that you had spoken idlely and without reason, you set downe their number: and if you might be trusted, there is no scab or sore of the auncient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, whereon we haue not rubbed our selues. It is after this manner that you tickle your selues to make you laugh, and when you haue spent all your force, whether it be in sleight, or eloquence, to rouse <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. cont. heres.</note> vp the implicite faith of your flockes, you thinke it is enough,
<pb facs="tcp:22754:111"/>
and that we haue nothing to reply thereto. Wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the heresies, and haue the register thereof in our memorie, to the intent that we may beware of the same. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> gathereth to the number of <hi>80.</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Ad quod vult Deum.</note> reckoneth eight more. <hi>Philastrius</hi> more yet. And before these <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> made some catalogues. In reading of them we haue found matter enough against you, because we haue learned (and bee not offended) that you are fellowes and fauourers, of those who through their Heresies sought to destroy the Church. How then can it be possible that we are their companions? Thereupon you pay those of your side, not with reason, or with any likelyhood, but with false calumnies against such as withstand you, and to this end you picke out certaine Heresies at your pleasure, which, you say, haue beene as it were renued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe by those great Heralds, the restorers of true piety, which haue gone before vs in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. This little Preface shall declare the contrary, and such Christian soules as are mildely disposed, shall be iudges of our right, and of your wrong. <hi>Ireneus</hi> saith of the <hi>Simonians</hi>

                     </note> whom <hi>Eunomius</hi> hath not gone farre, who (witnesse S. <hi>Austin<hi rend="sup">g</hi>)</hi> did hold the opinion; that men could take no harme by sinne, how great soeuer it were, prouided that their faith had not fayled. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> accuseth <hi>Luther</hi> for consenting to these follies, being followed by <hi>Caluin, Brencius</hi> and others: who verily confessed that good workes were the effects of Faith, but denyed that they could merit life euerlasting. The learned
<pb facs="tcp:22754:112"/>
treatises which haue beene compiled by our writers on this subject, should haue serued for phisicke vnto your eye-sight, and should haue taken the moate out of your eyes, that you might behold the truth against your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate doctrine? Wee will not doe you so much wrong as to debauch them from your companie, that we may draw them to our side. Then let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine still there in a good time, we denounce them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed. Those infamous persons wallowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in all manner of crimes. No thing, as they thought, could hurt them, if they had acknowledged <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to bee the chiefe way vnto saluation. Haue you found any thing in our Churches like vnto this? <hi>Simon</hi> reiected all manner of vertuous and iust workes as superfluous, wee, acknowledge them as necessary, but not as meritorious: for grace can get no entry there where merits haue taken place already. We abhorre <hi>Eumenius</hi> likewise. We confesse <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bernard. sup. cant. serm.</hi> 67.</note> the <note place="margin">Eumenius.</note> separation of faith from good workes, to bee more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, then to separate the beames and light from the Sunne. And what doe you finde worthy to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, whiles we teach that sinne cannot hurt him that hath the act of Faith? You couer your selues with the ambiguity of this word Faith, whereby you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand nothing but a simple knowledge of the doctrine, and a naked insight in Religion, and not this certaine perswasiou that the iust man liues by his Faith. Truth it is that the sinnes, which make vs guilty before God, doe astonish vs: but we say in like manner that they are not imputed vnto vs, and that they are couered through the iustice of the sonne of God and mediator Christ Iesus.

If there were two beginnings, the one might destroy that which the other had wrought, both twaine should possesse each other, and by possessing should also borrow one from the other, as being imperfect. If there be two, which of the two hath made this World? Who hath gouerned it? If the one ruleth, what doth the other? If the one hath made this world, and the other ruleth it, how hath this ruler entered into the house which is none of his?

We are able to proue by the vncontroleable testimonie of the holy antiquity, that the Pelagians taught, that the Gentiles might <note place="margin">Pelagians.</note> know God, and bee saued through Philosophie onely.

It is true indeede that <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife onely transgressed the commandement, which was giuen vnto them concerning the forbidden fruite: yet his posteritie is not a whit the lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued within that malediction.

Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianisme is your doctrine, the arguments of the Pelagians are yours, and let their axioms be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared with yours, they are two drops of water, or two egges that resemble one another. The Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians said that grace faileth not, hath not failed, nor euer will decay in those that doe all that they are able to doe. These bee the same very words which you cry out so lowde in your schooles and pulpits, which is as much as if you had said, that man by doeing what he may, hath nothing to doe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:22754:125"/>
with grace, and that he may be saued without the same. Man, saith the Pelagian, through the will of his naturall strength may make himselfe fit for grace: is not this that naturall facultie and power, which the councell of Trent doth attribute vnto man, that of himselfe he is able to effectuate spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall actions? The Pelagian goeth on, saying that through free will alone one may abstaine from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a new, may fulfill the commandements of the Law, and that he may be perfectly iust: that if at some times he be called vniust, it is by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison made betweene him and God, and to this sence he applieth the sentences of the Scripture: That our righteousnes is like vnto a foule cloath: And that none is good, not so much as one. The proud Iesuites, who would make the crosse of Christ of no auale, doe not beleeue that man after he hath fallen from the estate of innocencie is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the power to fulfill the Law.

And how should they be so, seeing that for the most part they were inuented more then a thousand yeares after the death of the Apostles, such as monasticall rules and others of that sort are. Truly you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, either that they haue beene vnknowne, or else haue beene kept backe for the knowledge of the posteritie, to wit, of you my Masters the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that haue the keys to draw whole bags full of them out of your Councels either generall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall, and out of the determinations of your Sorbonists or Iesuites. Let vs see farther what is the chiefe foundation of your traditions, the most beautifull plants and roses of the garden of the Romish Church. Behold it is here, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles knew not all things: or if they haue knowne
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:22754:132"/>
all things, and none of them hath preached other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the rest did, that they haue not taught all things to all persons. Is not this to accuse those great Stewards of the Church, of ignorance, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlinesse, and that they haue not dealt vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their calling? That they haue not beene faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obseruers of the Couenant or new Testament, whereof the preaching was committed vnto them? The Ambassador hath no power to dispense with his Masters will. It is the dutie of a seruant to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge things faithfully in their fulnesse; and as he hath beene commaunded to doe. In the making of our contracts or testaments, we would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the notarie and witnesses to keepe backe a part thereof, and not to beare ful testimony of our will, vnlesse they would incurre the danger of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and can that be tolerated in a matter of so great moment, to wit, in the Testament which the sonne of God hath ratified by his death? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles hauing declared faithfully the whole will of their maister, and hauing discharged their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse very well, it were sacriledge and an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemie to accuse them, either because they knew not, or were not able, or would not beare witnesse of the kingdome of God, as they were enioyned to doe.

And for this cause, when we goe about to conuict you by the proofes of the Scripture, that we may declare what harmonie and agreement is betweene you and the Marcionists, the Valentinians, the Ebione<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Apellians; by imitating of them you co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your selues with this buchler; to wit, that the Scripture is obscure, and that the truth cannot be

And what manner of things are they which they would haue vs to embrace vnder this pretence? The forbidding of certaine meates on certaine dayes; the forbidding of a certaine order of persons to marrie; Lent, chastitie, and such like things, that belong not to faith, but to a simple cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, which is diuers in diuers places, according to the humour of such as beare rule in the Church. These are the things of so great weight (as you will haue them to be) which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayth, that the Apostles did not preach to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom they ministred simply that which was necessarie and profitable vnto them; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other things, to wit, those weighty matters before mentioned, they taught them apart and in priuate, vnto those that were of greatest vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that therafter they might deliuer them from hand to hand vnto those that should be found most capable of them.

You would make the whole world beleeue, that there is a transubstantiation of wine into blood made in the Chalice, and that you may the more easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue men, and blinde the eyes of the simpler sort, you bring with you sometimes certaine false mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and illusions.

Consider here then, if Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> had more reason for him, then those heretickes had, among whom although there was some that condemned onely second mariages, yet so is it that he hath spoken as much in generall of the first, and of the second, saying, that those that are in the flesh cannot please God (so terming maried persons. Out of all this that hath beene mentioned we may gather that you haue imitated the heretickes, and being vnwilling in this show of holinesse (that is so much applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the common people) to giue place to them in any wayes, you haue thought it more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that married persons should not touch those things, which you name holy.

                     <p>COncerning Fryers, although that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Denys Areopagite</hi> make mention of their consecration through tonsure, yet we haue learned of S. <hi>Hierome</hi>

We haue made mention before of <hi>Celibate,</hi> whereunto they bound themselues by a solemne vow: wherefore we shall only remarke by the way, how that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> the great Arch-Hereticke, the Ebionians, the Apostolicks, the Aerians, the Encratites or Tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Hieracites, the Manicheans<hi rend="sup">c</hi> and others, recommended chastitie aboue all things, would admit none into their companie that were married and liued not chastly, whether it had beene men

or women. And from whence then should Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate haue proceeded but from these good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? In what Idea haue they receiued their forme, those vowes of chastity that are obserued by the Fryers, Iesuits and Priests, but in the schoole of these good men. It is true that Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which the Manicheans had kept back from their elect, was permitted vnto those that were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors onely. And let vs search what <hi>Epiphanius, Philastrius, Austin</hi> and others haue written as well of those antient Hereticks, as of others that haue beene since, such as be the Gnosticks, the Adami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">Gnosticks.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Re you ignorant that the vnction, which you call the last, was a miracle of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church? And of a miracle why do you make a sacrament? We haue protested before that we would not enter into the deepnesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted matters, seeing that our butt is onely to ioyne you in alliance and matrimonie with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes. In this title I find that you are companions with the <hi>Heracleonites</hi>

The greatest displeasure that you can doe to the wiues of sicke persons, is to bring vnto them this manner of wares, which is as much as a commission or packet, that is deliuered to their husbands to carry into another world. Behold death that arriueth, whom the faithfull doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

to be the meane to change all these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series into felicitie. It is the hand of God, that pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs backe from these calamities: it is the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prison, our deliuerie from captiuitie, the issue of our miseries, and the arriuing at the port. And although death doth affoord so many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities vnto vs, yet it is the reward of sinne. And what doe the Pelagians <note n="a" place="margin">Pelagians.</note> speake thereof, with whom you haue more then ten heresies common? That <hi>Adam</hi> had died, although he had not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed Gods commandements. This heresie is not generall among you. But hauing perused your <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> which spared not to censure the old Fathers, and hauing perceiued that there was no order taken for scraping out of that, which <hi>Austin Steuchus</hi>

                        </note> hath written, to wit, that death is a thing naturall, and that sinne is not the cause thereof, seeing that Infants die (sayth he) which are free from sinne: and that <hi>Adam</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his transgression had beene a pray to death, I haue good reason to accuse you of Pelagianisme.</p>
