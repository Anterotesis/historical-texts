            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Wheelers Caſe from
his own Relation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been imployed in <hi>Norfolke, Suffolke,</hi> and ſome
other Countreys, as Engineer for Sea-breaches,
drayning of Fennes, Architecture, Plantations,
&amp;c. I found that the Name of a Traveller, and
the forrein acquiſition of skill did adde that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and repute to Artiſts, which no Native is allowed in his
own Countrey amongſt his own kindred, and acquaintance:
whereupon I took the reſolution to imbarke for <hi>Holland,</hi> and
there either to improve my abilities, or the value of my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by converſing with ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>Being arriv'd there about Chriſtmas, 1638. I ſpent ſome
time in paſſing from place to place, viewing the Mills and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works
of that Countrey, and it ſoon appear'd to me, that
there were great defects therein, which I (God aſſiſting me) by
my own inventions was able to alter, and amend to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
benefit, and profit of the States. By the adviſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and aſſiſtance of Sir <hi>William Boſwell</hi> (to whom I addreſſed
my ſelf firſt, as being His Majeſties Reſident in thoſe parts) I
made Propoſitions to the States Generall with ſome overtures
of my particular Inventions, and did refer the ſame to ocular
demonſtrations, and publick experiments. The Propoſitions
were entertained, and proofs by Plots, and Models were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
but becauſe the benefit of my undertakings would
ariſe to ſo vaſt a revenue, if I could accompliſh them (as was
obvious to every common underſtanding <hi>primâ facie)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was the more diſtruſted. The heads of my Propoſitions
were: To Draine; or to Drowne Lands; to raiſe great waters
to reaſonable heights, from three Foot to ſix, &amp;c. to raiſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
quantities of water to great heights, and both theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:125623:2"/>
cheaper by one half then before, and double in quantities, if
not more. Likewiſe to bore Timber with a wooden Augur,
bigger and cheaper: to put and drive great piles into the
ground without beetles, or the uſuall moliminous Inſtruments
of contuſion. And laſtly, to raiſe, and carrie from place to
place all ponderous weights more eaſie, and cheap, then had
ever been yet diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Within the ſpace of half a yeer ſome ſmall Models were
perfected, and view'd by three of the States Generall at the L.
<hi>Rippedays</hi> Houſe (He being one of the ſaid 3 Commiſſioners
appointed for that purpoſe) and publick approbation was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thereunto. In <hi>June,</hi> 1639. I had a Patent granted by the
States Generall for the putting in execution, and for the ſole
uſage of thoſe my Inventions for twelve yeers: and in <hi>July</hi>
following I obtained an other ſpeciall grant of the ſame from
the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Freiſland.</hi> After this I began to
frame bigger and larger Engines, and in <hi>September</hi> following, I
gave proofs of their efficacie, and operation in publick, at the
<hi>Hague;</hi> and then it was manifeſt, that as the Models did more
then anſwer my promiſes, ſo the Engines did more then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that which was expected from the Models.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> upon a ſight of my Models graced me
with a preſent of 20 guilders to buy me a payre of gloves; and
afterwards when the force of my Engines was openly tryed at
the <hi>Hague,</hi> the States Generall gave me 400 guilders as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their liking, and allowance. My Engines were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
of ſeverall faſhions, and for ſeverall uſes, ſo framed that
they were eaſily portable, and removable from place to place,
readily to be erected any where in a little time. One of theſe
Engines tryed its efficacy upon a Graft or Mote at the <hi>Hague</hi> in
the preſence of divers of the States Generall, as alſo of <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Weſt-Freiſland,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Leydon</hi> having ſeverall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
with them out of ſeverall other Towns, and at that time
it carried a thouſand barrels an houre being moved onely by
the hand of one or 2 men raiſing the water to 2 foot or more,
and greatly ſatisfying all ſpectators.</p>
            <p>For my further encouragement alſo in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1641, my Patents
were renewed from 12 yeers, and a prolongation to 18 was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125623:2"/>
granted; and the words did mention that the Inventions were
new, never before practiſed by any, and that they were of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
benefit, and therupon a greater penalty was added againſt
all ſuch as ſhould treſpaſſe upon me by imitating, or uſing the
ſame to my prejudice without my leave. But preſently upon
this the ſcene began to change with me; for whileſt I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited,
I was below envy, and ſo I found offices of friendſhip
from many, and no ill offices from any; but as ſoon as I had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to any belief, and ſo to eminencie, by abiding the teſt,
both my skill, and the incredible advantages which ſeemed to
attend the ſame, drew upon me infinite enmities, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
This nevertheleſſe I muſt obſerve, that my chiefeſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
were ſuch, as were my own Countreymen, ſuch as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
moſt friendſhip from, ſuch as I had moſt intruſted, or
moſt ingaged (as I thought) by my ſervice, and credence, and
ſo by conſequence had moſt power and opportunitie to undo
me. And that I may not aſperſe any unjuſtly, this ſhall be a
particular account to the world, what Sir <hi>Rob. Honywood,</hi> Sir
<hi>Will. Boſwell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> his Secretary (and ſome others his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants)
what <hi>Palmer</hi> my Sollicitor, <hi>Robinſon</hi> my man, one <hi>Horne</hi>
the Fabrick of Leydon, but of Engliſh extraction; as alſo one
<hi>Saſſe</hi> a game-keeper to the Prince of Aurange, with divers other
under-inſtruments have done to ruine me, hoping to wreſt out
of my hands thereby either the Honor, or the profit of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
            <p>The firſt miſchief which encountred me in the heat of action,
whileſt I was induſtriouſly purſuing my infant contrivances
was this: As I was one Evening going home to my lodging in
the company of Cap. <hi>Lucas,</hi> upon the Spie-bridge I was aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by two of the Prince of <hi>Auranges</hi> ſervants (and ſome others
of his guards) and others about 20 in all, and in this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
fray Cap. <hi>Lucas</hi> had two deep cuts in the head, I had one
ſtob in my body, and by the ſame loſt the uſe of my left arme,
never to be recover'd, both of us were left for dead upon the
place, and for nine dayes after, there was no hopes of life in
me. The aſſaylants fled preſently to <hi>Colenbury</hi> for ſanctuary,
and thoſe of them which were the Princes ſervants, as ſoon as
his Highneſſe had notice thereof by the beating of a Drumme
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125623:3"/>
were ſommon'd home, and very nobly ſatisfaction was orderd
to us; but after 18 moneths ſuite in that cauſe (though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
were condemned both in the <hi>Hagues</hi> Court, and the
Court of <hi>Holland)</hi> and 3000 guilders were particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
for my dammage, yet I could recover nothing, but loſt
my time, ſpent my money, and became daily further intangled
in more and more troubles, and conteſtations. Whileſt I lay in
the greateſt extremitie of my hurts, not able to take any order
for my affairs, the afore-named <hi>Saſſe,</hi> of whom I had rented
ſome roomes for my Engines, and Works, ſent to me for ſuch
an exacted ſumme of money, or elſe to throw my Engines, and
Works out of doore. I was not able at that time to procure the
money, Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell</hi> denied me the loan of 5. li. to prevent
this miſchief, though formerly upon my Bond He had done
greater courteſies, and ſo my Works were broken, thrown out,
and expoſed to the view of all men.</p>
            <p>Theſe troubles alſo brought me into the acquaintance of
<hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and one <hi>Palmer,</hi> who undertook as my Sollicitor, but
ſecretly were Traytors to my proceedings, and ſuch as under
hand wrought my over-throw many ſeverall wayes long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I began to ſuſpect them.</p>
            <p>The next potent adverſary I had to grapple withall, was
<hi>Horn</hi> the Survey or Fabrick of <hi>Leydon;</hi> and He being preſent
at the <hi>Hague</hi> with my Engines were firſt proved before the
Lords of <hi>Leydon,</hi> and many other of the States, and by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
which I had communicated to Him, and by the help of
ſome of my workmen, whom He had inveigled to his ſervice
had moſt opportunitie to ſtand in competition with me; for I
was not onely overcome by his inſinuations at firſt, and won
to ſome confidence in his friendſhip, but alſo I was neceſſitated
to lay my Art the more open to him, and ſome other Fabricks,
upon whoſe judgements the States relied, that by ſatisfying
them, I might convay ſatisfaction to thoſe which imployed
them. I was now therefore put to a vexatious, and expencefull
triall before the Lords of <hi>Leydon,</hi> after all my former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in publick, and my ſeverall Octroys granted thereupon,
to evince again the noveltie, raritie, and commoditie of my
Frames, and Mils: and by this means I was forced to ſend to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125623:3"/>
divers places for atteſtation, and for ſome Forms, and Works,
which at laſt by a double operation viſibly diſproved <hi>Hornes</hi>
pretences, and in the judgement of all gave me the victory.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe <hi>Horne</hi> would not ſo deſiſt at <hi>Leydon,</hi> but in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to my Patents, did make uſe of my Inventions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I brought my Action upon my Octroyes, and at laſt
though with much difficulty, did overthrow him, and get for
damages 1500 li. which <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>binſon</hi> my man compounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my privity and conſent for 300 guilders in part. This pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me above all open attempts, or controverſies in Law, but
the more I was ſecured by publick Juſtice, the more I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied,
and made the mark of treacherous conſpiracies.</p>
            <p>In all places I had quarrels urged upon me, at all times I
found ſnares ſpread for me; eleven ſeverall bargains I had
m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de for the erecting of my Mills in eleven ſeverall places, but
all were fruſtrated by letters ſent from the <hi>Hague,</hi> directed by I
know not whom: and now as theſe diſaſters had brought me
into great wants, ſo my extreme wants ingaged me ſtill further
into many worſe diſaſters.</p>
            <p>One maine diſadvantage that my indigence brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
was the acquaintance of <hi>Robinſon</hi> who by accommodating
me with ſome moneys (yet payed after) in my neceſſities, and
making himſelf officious to me when my fortunes were lowe,
got into my ſervice, and good opinion, and by that means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proved a fatall traytor both to me, and all my deſignes.
This fellow held correſpondence with <hi>Palmer,</hi> &amp; both of them
incited Sir <hi>Willam Boſwell</hi> againſt me, and by the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which they both held with Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell,</hi> and all the
reſt of my enemies I found my ſelf every way ſurrounded, and
cut off from all eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robinſons</hi> part was, to diſcover my Art, to practiſe it himſelf,
to reveal it to others, to grant Licences without my knowledge
to my prejudice, to compound with defaulters without my
leave to my loſſe, to impute his own failings to the imperfection
of my Works, to combine with my greateſt Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palmers</hi> part was, to confound me in matters of Law, to caſt
me in all Courts of Juſtice, and particularly to create new ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell</hi> amongſt the States, and Sir <hi>Rob. Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:125623:4"/>
at the Queen of <hi>Bohemias</hi> Court. He had failed in <hi>England</hi>
of a monopolizing Patent for ſteele, and therefore he depended
now upon his ſhifts beyond the Seas, and was a profeſt Enemy
to all men more ingenious then himſelf.</p>
            <p>One Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> (to my knowledge) made a new Propoſition
in <hi>Holland</hi> for brewing, baking, &amp;c. without ſmoke, and with
leſſe expence of fuell, &amp;c. and had proſpered in his fair, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
deſigne had not this <hi>Palmer</hi> enviouſly quaſh't his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
With the ſame impudence alſo He came to me, and told
me, that I ſought to ingroſſe too vaſt a revenue: and that if I
would admit Him to partake, I ſhould prevail: otherwiſe not.
His jeer was this, Mr. <hi>Wheeler,</hi> I can ſtop your wheels at my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion:
if I ſay to Sir <hi>Will: Boſwell</hi> they ſhall move on, they
ſhall: if I ſay, He ſhall forbid them to move; they ſhall not dare
to ſtir.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Ro. Honywoods</hi> part was, to exclude me of all favour at
Court, and therefore divers times He commanded me to avoid
the preſence, and once He ſet 2 Iriſh Halberdeers of the Queens
guard to fall upon me, who accordingly did not onely deny
me acceſſe, but alſo tore me by the haire of the head, and this
they confeſt they did by Sir <hi>Rob. Honywoods</hi> command. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
alſo an adventurer with <hi>Robinſon</hi> and <hi>Palmer,</hi> and did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe
(as I have heard) 140 li. in aſſayes, and trying to bring
ſome Works (begun by me) to perfection, but all proved fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and ſucceſſeleſſe.</p>
            <p>But the moſt powerfull of all thoſe aſpects which boded ill
to my fortunes was Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell;</hi> and as (I am confident)
without his concurrence all my other oppoſites could not have
ſo far oppreſt me; ſo without their inſtigations, He would not
(I perſwade my ſelf) have entertained any thoughts of ill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me. Howſoever long it was before I could be induced to
think, that Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell</hi> had ends upon me, much leſſe ſuch
extreamly avaritious ends, ſuch as nothing but my utter ruine
could ſatisfie. But my eyes were by degrees opened; for firſt I
perceived He gave too much eare ta my worſt enemies, and
then in the Patent for <hi>England</hi> which He procured for me I ſaw
He had put in his ſervant <hi>Cropleys</hi> name, and that device (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
other competent rewards) coſt me 50 li. to compound. A
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125623:4"/>
Patent likewiſe for <hi>Ireland</hi> was promiſt me, but I have it not,
and I hear tis granted in Sir <hi>Williams</hi> own Name, and reſerved
for his own uſe: laſtly, my Patent for <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> is
ſtill deteined in his own hands. I found moreover that by ſome
dangerous queſtions put to me at ſome-times about my pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
He was not without ſome aymes of having my life at his
mercy by the ſtroke of the Law, if need were. My neceſſities
made me upon an occaſion become a ſuiter to Him for the loan
of ſome moneys, but the conditions propoſed by Him were
ſtrangely rigorous, inſomuch that in a jeſting manner I askt.
Him, if He were good at drilling. Hereupon He grew much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
and cauſing His ſervants to lay violent hands upon me,
He diſarm'd me firſt, and then broke my head to the skull; ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me with his foot, and offered divers other ignoble indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to me in his own Houſe. About that time alſo I was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſo pinching extremities, that for 25 dayes (beſides Gods
infinite mercy) I had no more then 10 Stivers to preſerve me
from famiſhing: and which way ſoever I turned my ſelf for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
I found my way blockt up with difficulties, ſo evill an eye
there was over me, that I was prevented of Truſt, nay my very
pawns were refuſed, and could not be taken. Farre was I now
from proceeding in my Fabricks; thoſe Mils and Frames, which
I had begun, and perfected with great trouble, and expence, I
could not keep: after my goods and materials had been part
broken, part ſtolne, part thrown into the ſtreets by the exaction
of <hi>Saſſe,</hi> when Sir <hi>Wil. Boſwell</hi> refuſed me 5 li. to ſave them, I had
built a place my ſelf in a peece of ground belonging to one of
the Lords in the Town, thinking to ſecure my Engins, &amp; Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils
from further violence, but the place was ſoon broken open,
the boards were taken away, the Mils were ſpoiled, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
could be procured. My fortune was alſo to take two of
the theeves in the manner, whereupon with my ſword in the
ſcabbord I ſtrooke them, not knowing how to bring them to
condigne puniſhment: but they preſently eſcaped from me, and
ſearce any thing ever proved more miſchievous in the event
then this revenge of mine ſo taken upon them: for not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as I was walking in the backſide of the Town, by the Moat
that runs by the Princes garden, being alone and unarm'd, I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:125623:5"/>
was incountred by the ſame two Theeves (as I conceive) and
about 8 more, who with ſpades and ſhovels and other weapons
fell upon me and cruelly wounded me, ſo that to ſave my life
I was inforced to take the Moat and to dive to the bottome for
brickbats to defend my ſelf.</p>
            <p>At my riſing out of the water one of the Princes Fiſhermen
(who had been a ring-leader before in the other fray upon the
Spie-bridge at that time when I was wounded with Cap. <hi>Lucas)</hi>
took hold of my haire and kept me down in the water, under
his boat untill I was almoſt ſpent; and then pluckt me out half
dead, as if He had been courteous in ſaving me. Being drawn
out ſo wet in a cold ſeaſon, and ſo hurt, by the help of <hi>Robinſon,</hi>
who then appear'd, I got home to his houſe not farre diſtant
from the place, and there ſhifted my cloths. But the ſaid <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>
and his wife by that opportunitie got my keyes out of
my pockets, went to my lodging, ranſackt there my trunks,
took away divers Models, and ſecrets of value, together with
ſome atteſtations concerning my buſineſſe, as alſo other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and an ancient pedigree of my Grandfathers, out of
which they eraced divers names. Some of theſe they carried to
Sir <hi>Wil. B<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſwell</hi> (for I have my ſelf ſeen them ſince at his houſe)
the reſt they kept, or diſperſed into divers parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
is knowing that they were proofs to difference my works
from other mens, and to manifeſt the noveltie, and rarity of
my Inventions. For about a fortnight alſo during my abode in
<hi>Robinſons</hi> houſe, whileſt I was weak the houſe was much viſited
by ſome of the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> Trayne, who were very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
often to converſe and drink with me, and I accordingly
did ſeverall times gratifie them with my company.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other conference they invited me to undertake the
charge of an Engineer in the warre againſt the Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
making me beleeve they did expect great and eminent
ſervice from me, if I would accept of imployment: and when
I was not inclining thereunto, they endeavoured to divert me
ſome other way, offering me imployment in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
me alſo much to turn my Religion. Theſe propoſitions
taking no effect with me, I found cauſe to ſuſpect that the cups
wherin I had drunk in their company had been ſecretly mixed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:125623:5"/>
with ſome veneficall or magicall ingredients, for I found my
ſelf ſtrangely driven into fits of Lunacie, and not onely diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
but alſo tortured both in body, and mind. My under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
nevertheleſſe did not wholly depart from me, and
therefore I demanded my keyes of <hi>Robinſon,</hi> but could get no
other anſwer, but that they were delivered to Sir <hi>Wil. Boſwell.</hi>
I deſired then that a new lodging might be taken for me in
ſome place more convenient, quiet, and neerer to my Works
then my former was: wherein <hi>Robinſon</hi> promiſt preſently to
accommodate me.</p>
            <p>Upon this pretence He went forth, and at his return in the
Evening He undertook to wait on me (having an other in his
company) to my new taken chamber: but I ſuſpecting no plot
or treachery in Him was led into a Dulhouſe or Bedlam. As
ſoon as I had entred the chamber <hi>Robinſon</hi> and the other ſtept
ſuddenly out, and the doore was lockt, and bolted upon me,
and I was there left alone incloſed to be treated as a man utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mad, and raving. The place was ſolitary, and far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
of people, and as I had no hopes of any help but by calling
out aloud, ſo my loud calling or hollowing was interpreted as
the ſymptome of my diſtraction. Seeing my ſelf remedileſly thus
loſt to all the world, but ſuch as had conſpired my deſtruction,
I betook my ſelf to God, and ſubmitted my ſelf to be removed
from roome to roome, and to be ordered in my diet, and other
things as they pleaſed, and for nine moneths ſpace the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of my martyrdome was exceeding ſharp, and exquiſite.
Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> with other of Sir <hi>Wil. Boſwels</hi> ſervants, and my man
<hi>Robinſon</hi> came upon viſits often to me pretending to pitie my
Lunacie, and to do charitable offices; but their common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
was to force potions upon me which my nature abhorr'd;
and when I could not chuſe but be reluctant to them, five or ſix
at a time of them fell upon me with clubs, and ſtaves, uſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible
cruelties till I had drunk them off. After I had
drunk their compoſitions I was poſſeſt after an unheard of
manner, but theſe reaſons make me think that what I did and
ſuffered in my fits were not the effects of meer phrenzie, but
ſome diabolicall art, and ſorcerie: for firſt, My ſenſes remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo with me, that I my ſelf ſenſibly condoled my own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and held my ſelf as a ſlave under thoſe commands, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:125623:6"/>
I would fain have diſobeyed, but could not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I was never ſubject to the like ravings before that
time, or ſince.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, my yard did begin to be drawn up into my belly,
my hands, limbes, and whole body was contracted, or benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or ſome way tortured, till I did act, and ſpeak according
to the commands which were upon me: the force thereof broke
out of my fleſh, brought my nails from my fingers, and almoſt
my eyes out of my head, and this is not the operation of that,
which Phyſitions call <hi>laeſa Phantaſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, divers odious ſents almoſt poyſoned the roome to
the taking away of my breath, and leaving me neer ſuffocated;
as alſo divers ſpirits in antick forms appear'd to me in dances,
and one in the likeneſſe of a Cat kept neer my roome, and for
divers moneths removed not till I had acted all thoſe parts
over, as they thought fit. Some things I did as a Playſtrer; ſome
as a Bricklayer, ſome as an other Artiſt or Tradeſman, doing
all things in all Arts whatſoever: ſometimes I was conſtrained
to declare my Religion, ſometimes my affection to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and I could enjoy no quiet at all till I did obey in all.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, theſe charms moſt eſpecially inforced me either to
diſcover the ſecrets of my Profeſſion, and that ability and
knowledge which was requiſite to the finiſhing of my Works:
or elſe to uſe violence to my ſelf, by running my head againſt
the wall, or otherwiſe. But in theſe two the mercy of God moſt
admirably fortified me: ſo that I did conceal my chief skill, as
knowing that then they would no longer let me live: and
whereas they had fixed nayls in the wall purpoſely for me to
beat my head againſt, I did knowingly avoid the ſame.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, ſome things were done by my hand at that time
which no mortall man naturally could do, much leſſe could I
being under lunacie, for when they had ſet paper and pen and
inke beſide me, I wrought half a quire of paper in an houre,
and drew ſome Mathematicall lines without Inſtruments as
exactly as if I had had Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, whereas I was inforced to eat my own dung, and
drink my own water, to ſit ſtark naked in the bittereſt froſty
nights of Winter, and to take ſome purgations when my body
was empty, and ſo could void nothing but blood upwards, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:125623:6"/>
downwards, I yet overcame all theſe things, and came off with
life which (I think) none could have done, that was not mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
preſerved, as well as diabolically tortured.</p>
            <p>Nine wofull Moneths of Martyrdome were now run out, and
yet the faculties of my memory and intellect were not wholly
broken, though much weakned; and now <hi>Robinſon</hi> and <hi>Palmer</hi>
who during my impriſonment had conſpired with Sir <hi>Robert
Honywood</hi> to imitate my Works, and uſurp them as their own,
ſaw their skill failed, and their hopes fruſtrated therein. 140 li.
or thereabouts had been disburſed by them in new aſſayes,
and in trials to perfect ſome Works begun by me, and operate
without me, but all would not do: and therefore t'was thought
fit that I ſhould be again inlarged, and incouraged to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
thoſe things, which they could not. Some things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon my releaſe I did bring to expedition, and ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of my own which were of 100 guilders in their hands, I
did make ſerviceable, and ſold for a thouſand guilders to an
underſtanding Engineer, one Captain <hi>Flood,</hi> but I would not
be induced to aſſiſt <hi>Robinſon</hi> the Traytor in any of his Works,
or ſuch as belonged to his confederates. Being at liberty alſo I
travell'd about in the Countrey to obſerve what imitations of
my Works had been made, and I found that in divers places
they had attempted, but not perfected the ſame, yet at <hi>Leydon</hi>
and ſome other places by my Inventions, and the advantage
of ſome of my Models taken out of my Trunks (as aforeſaid)
they had brought ſome Works to a good perfection, even to a
double improvement of what they had been before. I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
therefore by one addreſſe more to Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell</hi> to
make one further attempt in the reviving of my buſineſſe, and
in order thereunto about <hi>March</hi> 1643. I put my ſelf upon his
friendly aſſiſtance as my utmoſt refuge, and deſired his favour
to procure 10000 guilders for me, but his conditions propoſed
were extreame, and rigorous, and no leſſe then a totall forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all my fortunes was inwrapped in them. Hereupon I
plainly perceived, it was abſolutely impoſſible for me to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with ſo many diſaſters, conſpiracies, injuries, neceſſities in
a ſtrange Countrey, having at Court, in the City, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
every where malicious, ſubtle, perfidious Enemies to cruſh
my hopes: and ſo in <hi>April</hi> following I ſet ſail for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:125623:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Since my arrivall here, I underſtand vaſt debts are in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
charged upon me in <hi>Holland,</hi> the greateſt part whereof
were incurred by my ſickneſſes, or wrongfull impriſonment, or
by <hi>Robinſons</hi> falſe accounts, (skores which He has wrongfully
ſet upon my head) or by other mens unjuſt pretences, wherein
I am condemned without being able to make defence, or wage
Law. And now for theſe debts my Patent (taken from me when
I was in the Dulhouſe) &amp; all my right is by publick Order ſold,
and diſpoſed of as I hear. For a further proſecution alſo of ſo
dejected a helples a man, leſt I ſhould hereafter recover breath,
or ſtrength to riſe again, I am ſtill preſſed by Sir <hi>Wil. Boſwell</hi> in
his letters to Mr. <hi>Bullen</hi> here in Tower-ſtreet, and to others of
his correſpondoes: He ſtill cuts me off from all hopes of future
recrutes by diſabling my credit, vilifying my Works, diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my abilities, and depraving my intentions.</p>
            <p>This being my hard Caſe truly ſtated, and faithfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
and ſince it appears hereby, that as my paſt ſufferings
have been beyond the ſtrength of ſuch a man as I am, ſo my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
oppoſitiones are likely to tranſcend all ordinary reſiſtance:
I make it my moſt humble ſubmiſſive Requeſt to the High and
Mighty States, That they will by a publick, extraordinarie
hand of Juſtice afford me a redreſſe, and ſupport ſuitable to
the nature of my unequall'd grievances. Two things I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to make ſenſibly demonſtrable: 1. That the Water-works
in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have been exceedingly improved to the great
publick advantage of the united Provinces by my diſcoveries,
ſince the publiſhing of my Inventions in 1640. 2. That for the
time to come, if due incouragement and means may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, I will (by Gods aſſiſtance) yet bring to further perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and doubly advance the ſame Water-works as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
improved, and for a further addition alſo make a new
diſcovery of ſome other Works, and Engines which ſhall be of
rare uſe and ſervice to the publick in experiments of an other
nature. If theſe Overtures be thought worthy to be taken into
conſideration, I deſire the Conditions and proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
may be managed with ſufficient caution on both parts:
if theſe things ſeem of light credit, yet thus far I have ſtrived
to be true to my own honor, and to do right to a moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and faire Cauſe.</p>
