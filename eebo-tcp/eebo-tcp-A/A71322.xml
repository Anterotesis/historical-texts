            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

minifested, as the other. Yea the due considerations of these small Creatures, haue brought the wisest <hi>Aegiptians</hi> of the earth into the deepest amazements of Gods power. For the <hi>Philosopher</hi> was more confounded in considering the small body of the Fly, with her partes, then he was by the view of the body of the great Elephant with his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. If this high and mightie Monarch of the earth Man, had no better similitudes then this; to be compared with the Heauens and Earth, yet could not the aduersaries of his estate (in the right respect) so exclayme; for that the thing it selfe is not so loathsome as the cause thereof; which hath turned our glory into shame; and hath caused our best estate to be our chifest reproch. But when we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, in due comparison of our inward part the Soule, vnto God the Creator of all: one that is not circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, (that is the Centure of euery circumference;) and yet not limitted or bound vnto any place: and finde in this principall part of Man, a princely similitude, and perfect image of the aeternall Trinitie; euermore to be adored and worshipped in the Vnitie: not of the person, or trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the God-head, but in the vnitie of the Godhead, and trinitie of the persons. It being a created substaunce inuisible, bodilesse, and immortall, most like vnto God; hauing the image of his creator: being a substaunce capable of reason; apprehending all things created, but not filled therewith: for whatsoeuer is lesse then God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fill it, because it is capable of God: the originall of which is not to be sought for, in the earth; hauing in it selfe nothing that is either mixt or concrete; or what may seeme to be made or fashioned of the earth: nothing moyst, nothing ayrie, nor fierie: for there is nothing in these natures which may haue the force of memorie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb facs="tcp:15627:7"/>
or imagination; which remembreth thinges past, foreseeth things to come, and apprehendeth thinges present. Which thinges are onely diuine; neither can it be found from whence it should proceed, but from God. So that then the being of the soule, there is nothing more certaine then the beginning, (vnto those men which speake not by the suddaine motion) as if they were begirt with the inspiration of the holy Ghost at all instants) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the hidden secrets of nature, with more facilitie may be discouered: Of the which we are bound to speake nothing but reuerently; and of the which all but A thiests are perswaded to the immortalitie. Of the being or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the soule (in which poynt some haue grossely er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) imagining it to be a body, but as sincerely by the wise rejected; nor yet of the immortalitie, which not onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son affirmeth, but experience prooueth) I doe not intend to discourse; but onely of this part, where the soule is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into the bodie, and this will I proue to be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the infant commeth out of his mothers wombe. Which one of reuerend place (but of small partes, and as light regard) affirmed not long since, not to be in the childe vntill it did draw breath from the ayre. Vnto this will I limit the time when: confuting his errour by the consent and iudgements of Poets, Philosophers, Phisitions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue what I affirme not onely by them, but also by the Fathers of the Church, by the lawes Cannon, by reason, and Scripture.

But <hi>Iuuenall</hi> being better instructed by Nature, acknowledging God to be the infuser and creator of the Soule, denieth the conception, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the same to be in our bodyes: but being ignoraunt of this secret (when infused) by the comparison of the soules of Beastes and Men, graunteth vs the principallitie. <hi>Claudian,</hi> he affirmeth that the body could not be a worke of moment, nor halfe so honorable as it is, vnlesse being made a man by vniting the soule; nor the body be at all, without this life: and <hi>Boetius</hi> truely, that God placed the Soule in the body. By which I gather, that as there being an instrument prepared to receaue any thing; that instrument cannot be called <hi>Continens;</hi> an instrument conteyning <hi>sine contento,</hi> without the thing conteyned. So God cannot be sayd to shut the Soule in the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the body be perfected in his members, and so inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed indeed. Now reason sheweth vs, that it is a body in the wombe, and the wombe the prison in which the Soule is imprisoned.

But all these are most certainely in the Infant being in the wombe: For these beeing the proper actions of life, and the Soule being the cause of it;
<pb facs="tcp:15627:11"/>
it cannot be but that the Soule should be in the Infant.

               </gap> to conclude, that it was impossible that the vegita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soule, not the temperature, could fashion a worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship so singuler. Yet for all this, could he not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe, but that the reasonable Soule was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and not immortall. For he seeing (often times by experience) that it is altered so easily by heate, by cold, by moysture, and by drougth; and principally conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the same departes from the Body by ouermuch heate; or when a man giueth himselfe excessiuely to Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuiousnesse, or drinketh Poyson, and such other bodely alterations, which bereaue the life. For if it were bodilesse and spirituall (as <hi>Plato</hi> taught him) heate being a qualitie, could not make the same to loose his powers, nor set his operations in such a garboyle. These reasons brought <hi>Galen</hi> into a confusion: and though he had knowledge of the Euangelicall doctrine, could not receaue it. Yet for all that doubted not to say, <hi>that it was in the body of an Infant;</hi> for that it could not well worke without it: vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing the Soule vigitable, or sensitiue, of any power in so glorious a frame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hipocrates</hi> (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> reports) held that the Soule was sorged of Water and Ayer. How he meanès, I as yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not, by reason he breakes off in the rehearsall of his opinion: yet I am inforced to thinke, that <hi>Hipocrates</hi> indged the Soule to be an Ayerie substaunce: For that <hi>Bartholomeus</hi> in his Booke of Naturall things, sayth: that <hi>the Soule</hi> (taken as the auntient Phisitions did) <hi>is a certaine Substaunce subtile and ayerie;</hi> that by strength of heate multiplying in mans body; and by the Arteries, Veynes, and Pulses, giueth to Beastes breath, life, and working;
<pb facs="tcp:15627:12"/>
and voluntary moouing and strength. By the meanes of Sinewes and Muscles in Bodyes that haue Soules, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by heate, working in the blood, and by turning vnto the Heart, and by moouing and smyting the partes of the Heart, the Spirite is made more pure; and is turned into a more subtile kind; and is called of the Phisitions, <hi>Spiritus vitalis vitale;</hi> or, Liuely facultie. And by the working in the Liuer, it is called <hi>Spiritus naturalis,</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall facultie. And working in the Head, it is <hi>Spiritus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis,</hi> Animall facultie. But we must not thinke this Spirite to be mans reasonable Soule, but to be more truly the Chayre and vpholder of the same, and proper instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For by the nature of such a Spirit, the Soule is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Body: and without the seruice of such a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, the Soule cannot exercise any acte perfectly in the Body: And therefore if the Spirits be deminished or let in any worke, the accord of the Soule and Body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, and the reasonable Soule hindered from her works in the Body. As for example: In Men that be amazed; if the Spirit be comforted, the Soule is comforted: If one infeebled, they be both, touching the ruling of the Body. But to add vnto these, Men of more vnderstanding.</p>

In his 11. Chapter, he saith: That it is a perfection which moueth it selfe in vs: the first mouing of our naturall faculties, the true forme of Man; and that it is vnited vnto the Body, because it giueth life.</p>

               <hi>Wickerus</hi> likewise in his <hi>Sintaxes</hi> 91. Page, sayth: That the Soule is a certaine Deuine substaunce, incorporall, beautifull, simple, impassible, and immortall; infused into mans body: and is seperable by the dissolution and death

               <hi>Chrisostome</hi> in his Booke <hi>De Recuperatione lapsi,</hi> sayth: <hi>Non anima pro corpore, sed corpus pro anima: nec corpus in anima, sed anima in corpore sita est:</hi> That the Soule was
<pb facs="tcp:15627:16"/>
not made for the Body, but the Body for the Soule: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Body placed in the Soule, but the Soule is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Body. So that a man may say, that the Body is a Circumference of the Soules substaunce; which is infused (sayth hee) into the Body before the breath, yet brought out of the wombe with the Body: not dying with the Body, but (the Body being depriued thereof) <hi>reuertens aut glorificabitur aut in perpeticum apud inferos cruciabitur:</hi> returning vnto him that gaue it; it shall be either glorified, or else for euer and euer in Hell be tormented.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Zanchius</hi> in his most deuine worke of the Soule, sayth: That God in the beginning Created the Body of Man: Now the Body is generated by the combination of Man and Woman: But yet the creation of the Soule doth continue as in the first; and is infused (immediatly from God the Creator thereof, without any helpe of the nature of Father or Mother) into the Body, whenas the members are fully finished, while the Childe is in the Mothers belly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brentius</hi> with the rest affirme the reasonable Soule to be in Children in the Wombe: For (sayth hee) else nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ieremie</hi> nor <hi>Iohn Bapiist,</hi> could haue been fanctified in the same: for there is no sanctification or making holy, but after sinne: For that which is sanctified, is holy vnto God and vs, by imputation of righteousnesse vnto
<pb facs="tcp:15627:16"/>
that which before was sinfull: Now there can neither be sinne, nor yet holynesse, without a subiect: And I say the Soule is the subiect of both, and after <hi>a second meaning</hi> is the Body also.</p>
            <p>Children (say the <hi>Sorbonistes)</hi> could not be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and brought foorth in sinne, vnlesse before the birth of the Child the Soule were in the Infant.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Iohn Chappius,</hi> a well nurtured birde of that ill fauoured broode, in his explanation of <hi>Raymun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus summus,</hi> sayth, (not denying the beeing of the Soule, for why then should hee with the rest of that rowt, that attribute so much to inwarde grace vnto the outwarde elelement, affirme? that if any part of the Childe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of the Wombe, and some other part remayne in the same; yet that it ought to be baptized: yea if the part so appearing be but the hand, or heele (in case that the woman be in danger of death, and by hers the child:) And with such asseueration doth he affirme it, as that in no case to be any more Baptized: adding his reason, hee sayth: That because Baptizme is for the Soule, and not the Body: and the Soule is <hi>Tota in toto, et toto in qualibet parte Corporis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Raymundus</hi> himselfe sayth: <hi>Si puer egreditur ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris ventrem moriturus.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Et nequeat nasci totus pars quae patet extra,</l>

            </q>
            <p>Imagining (with the grosse-heads their fellow brethren) that without Baptisme, they could not be saued. So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing

God (whose hand is most plentious in giuing saluation) of all grace, and power: and attributing so much grace vnto the dumbe ellement, as that <hi>Delet omne pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> it abollisheth all sinne: Why then, be Children de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the full fruition of God?</p>
            <p>But this is my fayth and beleefe, That Infants in the Wombe, which die in the birth, shall rise in the last day, and be partakers either of life or death: be either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or Hell.

            <p>More plainely doth he expresse the infusion of the Soule, by the breathing of the <hi>Almightie.</hi> Chap. 32. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise sheweth the misterie or secret of our Conception: and by his wordes of <hi>continuance of time,</hi> hee declareth that the reasonable Soule is not infused so soone as the Seede of man is efused; neither in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixion
<pb facs="tcp:15627:19"/>

            <p>By the motion of the Child in <hi>Elizabeths</hi> wombe, my proposition is most plaine, the euidence most certaine; for that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> acknowledgeth her Babe to haue done it for ioy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affections;</hi> such as Mirth, Sorrow, Ioy, Discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Gladnesse, and Lamentation, cannot be sayd to be in a body, which hath not a reasonable Soule.</p>
            <p>And I may truly say: That as he was sanctified in the wombe, according vnto the word of the Angel; so likwise being a resonable Man, had (by the inspiration of the holy Ghost) some perceauance of <hi>Maries</hi> Salutation; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that her mouth vttered foorth his Prophecie: for shee spake not before he sprang: <hi>Exultat Elizabeth, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes intus impulerat: Glorificat Dominum Mariae: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus intus instruxerat: Elizabeth</hi> reioyseth, but <hi>Iohn</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly inforceth. <hi>Marie</hi> doth glorifie the Lord; but <hi>Christ</hi> (being in her) did inspire her. And therefore doth <hi>Theophilactus</hi> the Breuiarie of <hi>Chrisostome</hi> say: That what socuer <hi>Elizabeth</hi> spake prophettically, not to be the wordes of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but the wordes of the Infant: and he that shewed the people the <hi>Messtas</hi> with his finger, in the world; doth reuerence him; they both being in their Mothers wombe.</p>
            <p>But if any shall say, This is extraordinarie: Then let them looke backe and behold <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> whose
<pb facs="tcp:15627:20"/>
mother with the payne she indured with them being in her wombe, doth not onely acknowledge them to liue, but before they are borne, to be at strife one with another; and there to warre for the supremacie. <hi>Puto iam non animae solummodo probantur infantium, sed et pugna:</hi> I thinke (sayth <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Booke <hi>De Anima)</hi> the Soules of Infantes are not onely prooued, but also their conflictes. So that we may not onely graunt vnto Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the wombe reasonable Soules, but likewise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of gladnesse and sorrow, peace and strife; which is further declared in the birth of <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah:</hi> For <hi>Zarah</hi> at first appeared, and because the Midwife would know the one from the other, tyed a redd Threed about his hand; turneth backe his hand, and <hi>Pharez</hi> is first borne.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Paule</hi> explayneth all this, when he sayth, not the first man <hi>Adam</hi> was made a lyuing Tree, Beast, or Stone; but a Mau, that receiued life from the Soule. The creation of whom, is plainely declared <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. where <hi>Moses</hi> sayth: <hi>That God made Man of the dust of the ground:</hi> Yet marke, <hi>Hee is not a Man, before hee is made;</hi> but is called <hi>Dust:</hi> nor perfectly made, before hee had a <hi>Soule:</hi> And therefore is God sayd, <hi>to breath into his face the breath of life:</hi> and then he is made <hi>a lyuing Soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iunius</hi> in his 20. <hi>Annot.</hi> sayth, That by the power of the aeternall Spirit, without any elementall matter, hee did breath into the elementall Body, that liuely Soule, which is the simple forme of Man; that shee might vse the same Body as an instrument.</p>
            <p>In the first Creation, God hauing finished the Body, like a good Architect, accomplisheth his worke in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="tcp:15627:20"/>
in making it lyuing, <hi>by breathing into it the lyuing Soule.</hi> But now obserue this difference, in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man now; and the Creation of man then: In the Generation now, the Body doth increase in the wombe, and groweth perfect by the power it receiueth from the life of the Parent: and beeing perfected, hath the Soule in the very article of time infused into the Body: and then by the power thereof, it increaseth dayly vntill it may shew foorth the brightnesse thereof. But in the Creation, the Body was onely perfected in members, formed in shape, or instrumentalized a Body of perfect stature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the infusion of the Soule; and increased not after it had receiued it; but was able immediatly to reason, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and know the will of God: which Infants that be borne cannot doe: First, by reason of the sinne of <hi>Adam:</hi> then by reason of the naturall moystnesse, which drowneth the vnderstanding part; the which in time, beeing by little and little dryed vp, attayneth vnto the full measure of vnderstanding and knowledge: Thirdly, because we are not borne such able men, as <hi>Adam</hi> was created; but in time gathering our forces, wee become strong; and with our strength, our vnderstanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth. As in the Creation <hi>Adam</hi> was not called <hi>Man,</hi> vntill he was fully framed, and had his Soule infused: So likewise the Angell, and <hi>Moses,</hi> calleth not that which <hi>Elizaheth, Rebecca,</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> bare in their wombes; a thing without forme, or shape: but a Sonne, a Babe, a Boy, Children, and Brother. Now I giue you further to vnderstand, that those three which are called Soules, are indeed not truely so called; but ought rather to be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Vertues, or Powers of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15627:21"/>
The first vertue is Vegitable; and that giueth life, and no feeling: and this power is in Plants and Rootes. The second, is Sencible: and that giueth life and feeling, but not reason: and that is in beastes. The third is Rationall, and that in my iudgement ought to be so tearmed, onely for that it giueth life, feeling, vnderstanding, and reason; and that is in men onely.</p>
            <p>The vertue Sensible that giueth feeling, is a certaine ayerie substaunce, more subtile and more noble then the vertue Vegitatiue, that giueth life; &amp; lesse noble then the Soule reasonable, that giueth Reason.</p>
            <p>The beginning and the working of the power Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is dependant of the Body that it is in; and maketh it perfect: and therefore when the Body dyeth, the beeing or working thereof dyeth also with the vegitatiue: But whiles they be in a Body, they haue noble vertues and powers: as in Plants to grow and increase: in Beastes to grow, increase, and defende them selues from stormes. But the Soule Rationall, that neither beginneth with the Body, nor dyeth with it, which though it hath his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after, yet not from the Body, nor endes with it; but suruiuing, is immediatly possest either with pleasure or paine: And in the last day, returning vnto her owne Body; they both togither for euer remaine inseperable, either in the one, or other.</p>
            <p>Now it restes that I answere vnto his similie, which came blustering from his weake braine like a Northerne winde: and so I will with few words close vp this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>

               <p>Man is sayd to be impotent, because he is weake, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfast, and as vnconstant as his buildinges; which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times are ouerthrowne more vnwillingly then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. Be the Buildinges neuer so strong, one blast of winde will ouerthrow it: and one stroke of Death proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Mans strength more vaine then vanitie it selfe.</p>
               <p>But God is sayd to be Omnipotent, not for that he buyldeth and pulleth downe, but because he can doe all thinges; and being once done, cannot destroy them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; which in him would rather be noate of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, then Omnipotencie.
