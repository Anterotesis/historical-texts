         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at Dorcheſter the 12. day of Auguſt, after
which Sentence of death pronounced, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, and this honourable Bench, I am here
condemned to dye for a ſeducer of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Subjects. True it is, my actions deſerve
no leſſe, for I have bin carried, and have miſled
others contrary to my conſcience for lucre of reſpect and
ſervice far beyond my deſerts.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, and the reſt of this Honourable Bench,
I have bin in thoſe Weſterne parts ever ſince the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
in Ireland firſt ſprung up, and privately hid in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
houſes, being ſent by command from the whole
company of Ieſuites in the Univerſity of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in
<hi>Flaunders,</hi> for my owne part I never affected the Romiſh
Religion, but having bin ſworne to ſecreſie, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
watches over my carriage, I could not invent without
great danger or hazard of my life to leave thoſe Popiſh
projects, which God hath ſince brought to light.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe this Honourable Bench, there is not ſuch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52608:3"/>
diligent ſearch in this Kingdome as ought to be, nay
there is not one County in this Kingdome according to
the number of Papiſts in that County, but they have of
all Orders to ſerve them according to their abilities;
leſuits, Friars and Seminaries, two ſometimes in one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
houſe by turne to read Maſſe.</p>
            <p>There is too too many in all Shires more like Knights
in habit, and ſwaggerers in their carriage to avoyd ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than bald-pated Prieſts and Ieſuits, and theſe are
the onely Cavaliers of the times, and the cauſers of theſe
preſent diſtempers, and diviſions in the Kingdome; and
if you ſhall find the thoughts of theſe Popiſh Projectors,
full of horrid conſpiracies and treacheries, their mouthes
of falſhoods and lyes, their hands defiled with bloud,
and all their pates tracked with Rebellion: wonder not
at it, for 'tis no new thing, and he muſt needs be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the world that cannot produce multitudes of the
like preſidents before, nay they are ſo barbarous as all
Heathen Turkiſh ſtory is to ſeek for.</p>
            <p>Here is a great motive that ſtir them to be paineful in
their callings, for could they bring the Kingdome under
ſubjection of the Pope, as in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, they
would be in the way of being a Cardinall, if not a Pope,
and if a man ſhould aſke them the reaſon of their conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie,
they will tell you they hope to ſee the King and Q.
have the ſame priviledges &amp; prerogatives as their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
before them, a falſe ſuggeſtion of the divell, it is
rather to root out the Proteſtant Religion and bring in
popery, and great reaſon they have to ſeeke it, they have
for theſe many yeares laid dormant, and as I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them to a hive of Bees, which if a man trouble they
will fly about to ſting him, it is ſo with them, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52608:3"/>
doth daily ſearch out their habitations, and fellows
them ſo cloſe too and fro, that they have not a place to reſt
in, but wander up and down like pilgrimes every where,
and now is their time of prey in ſeeking to ſet his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
and Kingdome at variance.</p>
            <p>There is another motive which moves them to ſow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
amongſt us, for in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdome was wholie in their hands, diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Proteſtants, and made them uncapable of any
Office or place of truſt or profit to the great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
decay of the Proteſtants in their eſtates, education
and learning, and in the ſaid Queenes Reigne, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
were not allowed to have any armes or ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as papiſts, but ſtood like dead men not able to def<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd
themſelves in ſuch deſperate dangers. But God whoſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
time is then to helpe, when all other help and hope
faileth, releeved us with the ſafe comming of a vertuous
Princeſſe Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> whoſe courage and valour
the world adores, whoſe vertue and piety her Subjects
honoured and at her laſt dayes governed her people in a
moſt happy and peaceable union one to another.</p>
            <p>The impudency of the Papiſts &amp; their religion is to be
wondred at, yea their bold aſſertions and preſumptuous
hopes in matters of religion is unſufferable which I will
not now run ſo farre out of the way as to relate it but in
briefe thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt they weare the picture of our Saviour about their
necks, and the meaſure of the wound of the ſide of our
Lord Jeſus (and ſay they) it hath ſuch a vertue that no fire
water, knife or ſword can deſtroy them, nay the divell
cannot hurt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52608:4"/>
Secondly, if they carry this picture or meaſure of the
wound about them, it hath an eſpeciall power againſt the
divel, for they are forced to fly out of the bodies of men,
and whoſoever carrieth this grain about him, needes not
to feare any evil &amp; it hath a moſt powerful ver<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue againſt
wilde fire (fit to be uſed in theſe times) againſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
of the Sea, and againſt all manner of infirmities inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the ſoule and body of man, and eſpecially againſt
the feaver, peſtilence, the temptation of the divell, and
of hereſies, and they have the vertue of the <hi>Agnus Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the 3d did give ſuch vertue unto
this grain, that when you ſhall ſay your Pater-Noſter, you
ſhall redeem a ſoule out of purgatory, and when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and repent your fins on the Sunday, you obtaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of all your unperformed oathes, and if upon
Wedneſday, Friday and Satterday, that then you get re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of all your ſins, or the ſins of any other you pray
for. This graine yee ſee is good for all diſeaſes, preſerves
us from all manner of evill, eſpecially from the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Divell, but yet not their feet from being ſo
ſwift to ſhed innocent blood, their hands from theft,
their tongues from lying and ſuch like, which are neer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
a kin to the Divell.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee this graine is the next dore to Hell,
abſolves you from perjury, and if you have any part or
parcell of thoſe graines about you, you cannot miſcary
divers other wicked practiſes, as whoring, committing
of rapes, and ſuch other laciviouſnes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I omit to relate,
being unfit for any chaſte eare to be defiled with, and yet
all their deſigns forſooth pretends under the cloak of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and religion, which God grant in his goodneſſe to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52608:4"/>
proſper all his Majeſties and Parliaments deſignes, for the
reducing of this and other his Majeſties Kingdomes to
due obedience refining and enlarging of our Church and
the returning to a more ſetled peace to this Kingdome of
<hi>England,</hi> for which to him onely be raiſed a monument of
everlaſting prayſe, and thankſgiving from us and ours,
from one generation to another.</p>
