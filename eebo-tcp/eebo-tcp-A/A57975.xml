         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho doubteth (Christian Reader) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie must be under the courtesie and mercy of malice, and that it is a reall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, to be brought under the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Inquisition of the bloody tongue? Christ, the Prophets and Apostles of our Lord, went to Heaven with the note of Traytors, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and such <hi>as turned the world upside down:</hi> calumnies of treason to <hi>Caesar,</hi> were an ingredient in Christs cup, and therefore the author is the more willing to drink of that cup that touched his lip, who is our glorious forerunner: what if conscience toward <hi>God,</hi> and credit with men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not both go to heaven with the Saints, the author is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the former companion, and is willing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse the other. Truth to Christ, cannot be treason to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and for his choise he judgeth truth to have a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer relation to Christ Jesus, then the transcendent and boundlesse power of a mortall Prince.</p>
            <p>He considered that Popery and defection had made a large step in <hi>Britain,</hi> and that Arbitrary Government had over-swelled all banks of Law, that it was now at the highest float, and that this sea approaching the farthest border of fancied absolutenes, was at the score of ebbing: and the naked truth is, Prelats, a wild and pushing cattle to the lambs and flock of <hi>Christ,</hi> had made a hideous noyse, the wheeles of their chariot did run an equall pace with the blood-thirsty mind of the <hi>Daughter of Babell.</hi> Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <hi>the daughter planted in her mothers blood,</hi> must verifie that word, <hi>As is the mother, so is the daughter:</hi> why, but
<pb facs="tcp:50873:3"/>
do not the Prelates now suffer? True, but their suffrings are not of blood, or kindred, to the calamities of these of whom <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>O quam honesta vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt ate miseri erant.</hi> The causes of their suffring are, 1. Hope of gain and glory, stirring their Helme to a shoare they much affect; even to a Church of Gold, of Purple, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of clay and earth. 2. The lye is more active upon the spirits of men, not because of its own weaknesse, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men are more passive in receiving the impressions of error, then truth; and opinions lying in the worlds fat wombe, are of a conquering nature, what ever notions side with the world, to Prelates and men of their make are very efficacious.</p>
            <p>There is another cause of the sicknesse of our time; <hi>God</hi> plagued Heresie, to beget Atheisme and security, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme and security had begotten Heresie, even as clouds through reciprocation of causes engender rain, rain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate vapours, vapours clouds, and clouds rain, so do sins overspread our sad times in a circular generation.</p>
            <p>And now judgement presseth the kingdoms, and of all the heaviest judgements the sword, and of swords the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill sword, threatneth vastation, yet not, I hope, like the Roman civill sword, of which it was said,
<q>Bella geri placuit nullos habitura triumphos.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope this war shalbe Christs Triumph, Babylons ruine.</p>

            <p>I have not time to examine the P. Prelates Preface, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I give a tast of his gall in this preface, and of a viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent peece, of his <hi>(agnosco stylum et genium Thrasonis)</hi> In

which he laboureth to prove how inconsistent presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall government is with Monarchy, or any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He denyeth that the Crown and Scepter is under any coactive power of Pope, or Presbiterie, or censurable, or dethroneable: to which we say, Presbyteries professe that <hi>Kings</hi> are under the coactive power of <hi>Christs</hi> keyes of discipline, and that <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> as Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Christ,</hi> have the <hi>keyes of the kingdom of God,</hi> to open and let in beleeving Princes, and also to shut them out, if they rebel against <hi>Christ</hi>; the law of <hi>Christ</hi> excepteth none, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.9.18. if the <hi>Kings</hi> sins may be remitted in a ministeriall way, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23, 24. as Prelates and their Priests absolve <hi>Kings</hi>; we think they may be bound by the hand that loosed, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries never dethroned <hi>Kings,</hi> never usurped that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Your father P.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>When sacred Hierarchy, the order instituted by Christ, is overthrown, what is the condition of Soveraignty? Ans.</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then before, when <hi>Prelates</hi> deposed <hi>Kings.</hi> 2. I fear Christ shall never own this order.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>The Mitre cannot suffer, and the Diadem be secured. Ans.</hi> Have <hi>Kings</hi> no pillars to their thrones, but <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> Prelates. Prelates have trampled Diadem and Scepter under their feet, as histories teach us.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Doe they not (Puritans) magisterially determine, that Kings are not of Gods creation by Authoritative Commission; but only by permission, extorted by importunity, and way given, that they may be a scourge to a sinfull people? Ans.</hi> Any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirit from Hell, could not speak a blacker lye, we hold that the <hi>King,</hi> by office, is the <hi>Churches nurse father,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50873:4"/>
a sacred Ordinance, the deputed power of <hi>God</hi>; but by <hi>P. P. his way,</hi> all inferior Judges, and Gods Deputies on earth, who are also our fathers in the fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments stile, are to be obeyed by no Divine law; the <hi>King</hi> misled by <hi>P. Prelates,</hi> shall forbid to obey them, who is, in right-down truth, a mortall civill <hi>Pope,</hi> may loose and liberate subjects from the tye of a Divine law.</p>
            <p n="5">5 His inveying against ruling Elders, and the rooting out of Antichristian Prelacie, without any word of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the contrary, I passe as the extravagancy of a male-content, because he is deservedly excommunicated for <hi>Perjury, Popery, Socinianisme, Tyranny</hi> over mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and invading places of civill dignity, and deserting his calling, and the camp of <hi>Christ, &amp;c.</hi>

Ans.</hi> Pastors are to maintain the rights of people, and a true Church, no lesse then the right of <hi>Kings</hi>; but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Court Parasites, and creatures of the <hi>King,</hi> that are born for the Glory of their <hi>King,</hi> can do no lesse then professe this in words, yet it is true, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> writeth of such, <hi>Hist. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Libentius cum fortuna principis, quam cum principe loquuntur:</hi> and it is true, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath had plenty under <hi>Kings,</hi> not so much, because they were <hi>Kings,</hi> as because they were godly and zealous: except the <hi>P.

In the rest of the Epistle, he extols the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi> with base flattery, from his Loyalty to the <hi>King,</hi> and his more then <hi>Admirable prudence in the Treaty of Cessation with the Rebells</hi>; a woe is due to this false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

the Law of God, 2 Chron. 19.6. then the King, Deut. 17. v. 15. And in an obligation morall of judging righteously, the conscience of the Monarch, and the conscience of the <hi>inferiour Iudges</hi> are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with an immediate subjection under the King of Kings, for there is here a co-ordination of consciences, and no subordination, for it is not in the power of the inferiour Iudge to judge, <hi>Quoad specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> as the King commandeth him, because the judgement is neither the Kings, nor any mortall mans, but the Lords, 2 Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles 19.6, 7.</p>
               <p>Hence all the three formes are from God, but let no man say, if they be all indifferent and equally of God, societies and Kingdomes are left in the dark, and know not which of the three they shall pitch upon, because God hath given to them no speciall direction, for one rather than for another.

If he meane by the <hi>peoples choosing,</hi> nothing but the peoples approbative consent, posterior to <hi>Gods</hi> act of creating a King; let them shew us an act of <hi>God</hi> making Kings, and establishing royall power in such a familie, rather then in such a familie; which is prior to the peoples consent, distinct from the peoples consent, I believe there is none at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> Hence I argue: If there be no calling or title on earth to tie the Crown to such a Familie and Person, but the suffrages of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; then have the line of such a familie, and the persons now, no calling of <hi>God,</hi> no right to the crown, but only by the suffrages of the people, except we say that there be no lawfull Kings on earth now, when Propheticall unction and designation to Crowns are ceased, contrary to expresse Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>But there is no title on earth now to tye crownes to families, to persons, but onely the suffrages of the people: for, 1. Conquest without the consent of the people, is but royall latrocinie, as we shall see. 2. There is no propheticall and immediate calling to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes now. 3. The Lords giving of Regall parts is somewhat; but I hope <hi>Royallists</hi> will not deny but a child young in yeares and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be a lawfull King. 3. Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> his appointing of the Kingly office, doth no more make one man a lawfull <hi>King,</hi> then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: for this were a wide consequence. God hath appointed that <hi>Kings</hi> should be; <hi>ergo, Iohn a Stiles</hi> is a King; yea, <hi>ergo, David</hi> is a <hi>King</hi>: It followeth not.

The second way God giveth Royall Power by moving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts to confer royall power, and this is virtually in the people, formally from God.

It is true, the election of the people conteineth not formally Royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but the Word saith, <hi>they made Saul, they made David King</hi>: so virtually election must conteine it. <hi>Samuels</hi> oyle maketh not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> King, he is a subject after he is anointed; the peoples election at <hi>Hebron</hi> maketh him <hi>King</hi>; 2. differenceth him from his brethren; 3. putteth him in Royall state; yet <hi>God</hi> is the principall agent.

               </p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>We begin with the Law, in which as God by himself pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the essentialls, substantialls, &amp; ceremonies of his pietie &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, gave order for justice &amp; pietie, Deut.</hi> 17.14.15. <hi>the King is here originally &amp; immediately from God, and independent from all others, (set over them)</hi> Them, <hi>is</hi> collective, <hi>that is, all &amp; every one. Scripture knoweth not this State principle</hi>; Rex est singulis major, universis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. <hi>The person is expressed</hi> in concreto, <hi>Whom the Lord thy God shall choose. This peremptorie precept dischargeth the people, all, and every one, diffusively, representatively, or in any imaginable capacity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the appointing of a King, but to leave it entirely and totally to God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Begin with the Law, but end not with Traditions. If God by himselfe prescribed the essentialls of pietie and worship, the other
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50873:32"/>
part of your distinction is, that <hi>God</hi> not by himself, but by his Prelates, appointed the whole Romish Rites, as accidentalls of pietie. This is the Iesuites doctrine. 2. This place is so far from proving the King to be independent, and that it totally is Gods to appoint a King, that it expresly giveth the people power to appoint a King: for the setting of a King over themselves, such a one, and not such a one, makes the people to appoint the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to be lesse and dependent on the people, seeing God intendeth the King for the peoples good, and not the people for the <hi>Kings</hi> good. This text shameth the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who also confessed, <hi>P.</hi> 22. That remotely and unproperly suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, election, and conquest maketh the King, and so its lawfull for men remotely and improperly to invade <hi>Gods</hi> chaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate: Jesuites and Puritans say, it was a priviledge of the Jews that God chose their King. So Suarez, Soto, Navarra.</hi>

Lavater intelligit superiores &amp; inferiores Magistratus, non est potestas nisi a deo, Vatablus consiliarios.</hi> 2. If the people had absolute right, to choose Kings by the Law of <hi>Israel,</hi> they might have chosen ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then either <hi>Adonijah,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> but the Lord expressely, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14. put an expresse Law on them, that they should make no King, but him whom the Lord should chuse: Now the Lord did either by his immediately inspired Prophet, anoint the man, as he anointed <hi>David, Saul, Iehu, &amp;c.</hi> or then he restricted, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed promise, the Royall power to a family, and to the eldest by birth: and therefore the Lord first chose the man, and then the people made him King: birth was not their rule, as is clear, in that they made <hi>Solomon</hi> their King, not <hi>Adonijah</hi> the elder; and this proveth, that God did both ordain Kingly Government to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Israel,</hi> and chose the man, either in his person, or tied it to the first born of the Line. Now we have no Scripture, nor Law of God, to tie Royall dignitie to one man, or to one family; produce a warrant for it in the Word, for that must be a priviledge of the <hi>Iews,</hi> for which we have no Word of God, but we have no immediately inspired <hi>Samuels,</hi> to say, <hi>Make David, or this man King</hi>; and no Word of God to say, <hi>Let the first born of this family, rather then another family sit upon the throne</hi>; Therefore the people must make such a man King, following the rule of Gods Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14. and other rules shewing what sort of men Iudges must be, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.6, 7. 3. It is true, Kings in a speciall manner reign by Christ. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Not by the peoples free election. The P.

It followeth not, 4. None of us teach that Kings reign by Gods anger. We judge a King a great mercy of God to Church, or State: But the Text saith not, <hi>By the Lord, Kings and Iudges do not onely reign and decree justice, but also murther Protestants, by raising against them an Army

A King is a creature of Gods making onely; and what then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> Soveraigntie cannot be taken from him: So God onely made <hi>Aarons</hi> house Priests. 2. <hi>Solomon</hi> had

no Law to depose <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Priest-hood. Possibly the Prelate will grant all; the place, Rom. 13. which he saith hath tortured us, I refer to a fitter place, it will be found to torture Court Parasites.</p>
               <p>I goe on with the Prelate, c. 3. <hi>Sacred Soveraignty is to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Kings are to be prayed for, that we may lead a godly life,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. What then? 1. <hi>All in authority are to be prayed for,</hi> even Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, by that text Pastors are to be prayed for, and without them sound religion cannot well subsist. 2. Is this questioned, but Kings should be prayed for; or are we wanting in this duty? but it followeth not that all dignities to be prayed for are immediatly from God, not from men. <hi>Prelate,</hi> Prov. 8. <hi>Solomon speaketh first of the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government, before he speake of the workes of Creation,</hi> ergo <hi>better not be at all, as be without government. And God fixed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the person of</hi> Adam <hi>before</hi> Evah, <hi>or any else came into the world; and how shall government be, and we enjoy the fruits of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we preserve the Kings sacred Authority inviolable?</hi> Ans. <hi>Moses,</hi> Gen. 1. speaketh of Creation before he speaketh of Kings, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> speaketh, Gen. 3. of <hi>Adams</hi> sins before he speakes of redemption through the blessed seed; <hi>ergo</hi> better never be redeemed at all, as to to be without sin. 2. If <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Adam</hi> a governour before he made <hi>Evah,</hi> and any of Mankind, he was made a father and a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band before he had either sonne or wife. Is this the Prelates Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick? he may prove that two eggs on his fathers Table are three this way. 3. There is no government where soveraignty is not kept invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. It is true, where there is a King, soveraignty must be inviolable, What then? Arbitrary government is not soveraignty. 4. He inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> and the power of Parliaments, which maketh Kings to be nothing but <hi>Anarchie</hi>; for he speaketh here of no government, but Monarchy, <hi>P.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here is a whole Chapter of seven pages for one raw argument ten times before repeated, 1. to Exod. 9.7. <hi>I have raised up</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Paul expoundeth it, Rom. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to prove that King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a <hi>vessell of wrath fitted for destruction,</hi> by Gods absolute Will; and the Prelate following <hi>Arminius,</hi> with treasonable charity, applyeth this to our <hi>King.</hi> Can this man pray for the <hi>King?</hi> 2. <hi>Elisha</hi> anoynted but constituted not <hi>Hazael King,</hi> and foretold he should be <hi>King</hi>; and if he be a <hi>King</hi> of Gods making, who slew his sicke Prince, and invaded the Throne by innocent bloud, judge you. I would not take <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Prelates</hi> making. 3. If <hi>God</hi> give to <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> the same still of the servant of God, given to <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 18.1. &amp; 116.16. and to <hi>Moses,</hi> Ios. 1, 2. all <hi>Kings,</hi> because <hi>Kings</hi> are men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods heart. Why is not royalty then founded on grace? <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was not otherwise his servant, then he was the hammer of the earth, and a tyrannous conquerour of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all the Heathen Kings are called Kings. But how came they to their Thrones for the most part? as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>? but God anointed them not by his Prophets; they came to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes by the peoples election, or by blood and rapine; the latter way is no ground to you to deny <hi>Athaliah</hi> to be a lawfull Princesse, she and <hi>Abim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What, will the Prelate make them independent <hi>Kings</hi> for that? 6. God giveth Kingdomes to whom he will. What then? this will prove Kingdomes to be as independent and immediatly from <hi>God,</hi> as Kings are; for as <hi>God</hi> giveth Kings to Kingdomes, so he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Kingdomes to Kings, and no doubt he giveth Kingdoms to whom he will; so he giveth <hi>Prophets, Apostles, Pastors</hi> to whom he will; and he giveth tyrannous conquests to whom he will: and it is <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> to whom <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh that, from the Lord, and he had no just title to many Kingdomes, especially to the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which yet <hi>God the King of Kings</hi> gave to him, because it was his good pleasure; and if <hi>God</hi> had not commanded them by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> might they not have risen, and with the sword have vindicated themselves and their own liberty, no lesse then they lawfully by the sword vindicated themselves from under <hi>Moab,</hi> Iudges 3. from under <hi>Iabin, Iaakin</hi> King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> who twenty yeares mightily <hi>oppressed the children of Israel,</hi> Iudges. 4.? now this <hi>P. Prelate</hi> by all these instances making Heathen Kings to be Kings by as good a title as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> condemneth the people of <hi>God</hi> as rebells, if being subdued and conquered by the <hi>Turke,</hi> and <hi>Spanish King,</hi> they should by the sword recover their owne liberty, and that <hi>Israel,</hi> and the savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours which <hi>God</hi> raised to them, had not warrant from the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to vindicate themselves to liberty, which was taken from them violently and unjustly by the sword; but from all this it shall well follow that the tyranny of bloudy conquerours is immediatly and only dependent from <hi>God,</hi> no lesse then lawfull soveraignty; for <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezers</hi> soveraignty over the people of <hi>God,</hi> and many other Kingdomes also was revenged of God as tyranny, Ier. 50.6.7. and therefore <hi>the vengeance of the Lord, and the vengeance of his Temple came upon him and his land,</hi> Ier. 50.16, 17.18.28, 29.30. It is true, the people of <hi>God</hi> were commanded of <hi>God</hi> to submit to the <hi>King of Babylon, to serve him, and to pray for him,</hi> and to doe on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was rebellion; but this was not because the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was their <hi>King,</hi> and because the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> had a command of

God, so to bring under his yoak the people of <hi>God.</hi> So Christ had a Commandement to suffer the death of the Crosse, Iohn. 10.18. but had <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> any warrant to crucifie him? none at all. 7. He saith, Royalties even of Heathen Kings are not disposed of <hi>by the composed Contracts of men, but by the immediate hand and worke of God.</hi> But the Contracts of men to give a Kingdome to a person, which a Heathen community may lawfully doe, and so by contract dispose of a Kingdom, is not opposite to the immediate hand of God, appointing <hi>Royalty</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> at his owne blessed liberty. Lastly he saith, God tooke away <hi>Saul</hi> in his wrath; but I pray you did God onely doe it? then had <hi>Saul</hi> because a King, a Patent Royall from God to kill himselfe, for so God tooke him away; and we are rebells by this, if we suffer not the King to kill himselfe.

                     <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag</hi> 41</note> Deut. 17. <hi>is said to set a King over them only, as</hi> 1 Cor. 6. <hi>The Saints are said to judge the world, that is, by consenting to Christs Iudgement. So the people doe not make a King by transferring on him soveraignty, but by accepting, acknowledging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing him as King, whom God hath both constituted and designed King.</hi> Answ. This is said, but not a word proved: for the <hi>Queen of Sheba,</hi> and <hi>Hiram</hi> acknowledged, reverenced and obeyed <hi>Solomon</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> and yet they made him not <hi>King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Soveraigntie not from the people by sole approbation.</note> as the <hi>Princes of Israell</hi> did. 2. Reverence and obedience of the people is relative to the <hi>Kings</hi> lawes, but the peoples making of a <hi>King</hi> is not relative to the laws of a King; for then he should be a King giving laws, and commanding the people, as King, before the people make him King. 3. If the peoples approving and consenting that an elected King be their King, presupposeth that he is a King designed, and constituted by <hi>God,</hi> before the people approve him as King; Let the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> give us an act of <hi>God</hi> now designing a man King: for there are no immediate voyces from heaven, saying to a people, <hi>This is your King,</hi> before the people elect one of sixe to be their King. And this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proveth that <hi>God</hi> designeth one of sixe to be a King, to a people who had no King before, by no other act but by determining the hearts of the States to elect and designe this man King, and passe any of the other five. 4. When God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. forbiddeth them to choose a stranger, he presupposeth they may choose a stranger: for Gods law now given to man in the state of sinne, presupposeth he hath corruption of nature to doe contrary to Gods law: Now if God did hold forth, that their <hi>setting a King over them,</hi> was but the peoples approving the man whom <hi>God</hi> shall both constitute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to be King, then he should presuppose that God was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe a stranger to be the lawfull <hi>King of Israel</hi>; and the people should be interdicted to approve and consent, that the man should be King whom <hi>God</hi> should choose: for it was unpossible that the people should make a stranger King, (God is the only immediate King-creator) the people should only approve and consent that a stranger should be King; yet upon supposall that <hi>God</hi> first constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and designed the stranger King, it was not in the peoples power that the King should be a Brother rather then a stranger; for if the people have no power to make a King, but doe only approve him, or consent to him, when he is both made and designed of <hi>God</hi> to be King, it is not in their power that he be either brother or stranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so God commandeth what is simply impossible. 2. Consider the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50873:36"/>
sense of the command by the Prelates vaine Logick: I <hi>Iehovah, as</hi> I <hi>only create the world of nothing, so</hi> I <hi>only constitute and designe a man, whether Iew, or Nebuchadnezzar a stranger to be your King; yet I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit you under the pain of my curse, that you set any King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To these adde the reasons I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before, that the people by no shadow of reason can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make such a man King, not such a man, if they only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the man made King, but have no action in the making of the King.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>All the acts reall and imaginable, which are necessary for the making of Kings, are ascribed to God: Take the first King as a ruling case,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.13. <hi>Behold the King whom you have chosen and desired, and behold the Lord hath set a King over you. This election of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can be no other but their admittance or acceptance of the King whom God hath chosen and constituted, as the words,</hi> whom ye have chosen, <hi>imply,</hi> 1 Sam. 9.17. 1 Sam. 10.1. <hi>You have Sauls election and constitution, where</hi> Samuel <hi>as Priest and Prophet anointeth him, doing reverence and obeysance to him, and ascribing to God, that he did appoint him supreame and Soveraigne over his inheritance. And the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.13. <hi>The Lord hath set a King over you: which is</hi> Psal. 2.6. <hi>I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. Neither man nor Angel hath any share in any act of constituting Christ King,</hi> Deut. 17. <hi>The Lord vindicateth as proper and peculiar to himselfe, the desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the person. It was not arbitrary to the people to admit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> Saul <hi>so designed; it pleased God to consummate the worke by the acceptation, consent and approbation of the people,</hi> ut suaviore modo, <hi>that by a smoother way he might incourage</hi> Saul <hi>to undergoe the hard charge, and make his people the more heartily, without grumbling and scruple, reverence and obey him. The peoples admittance possibly added something to the solemnitie, to the pompe, but nothing to the essentiall and reall constitution or necessitie; it only puts the subjects</hi> in mala fide, <hi>if they should contraveen, as the intimation of a Law, the coronation of an hereditary King, the inthronization of a Bishop. And,</hi> 1 King. 3.7. <hi>Thou hast made thy servant King,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.1. <hi>I have provided me a King,</hi> Psal. 18.50. <hi>He is Gods King,</hi> Psal. 89.19. <hi>I have exalted one chosen out of the people,</hi> v. 20. <hi>He anointeth them,</hi> 27. <hi>adopteth them.

               <head>QUEST. VII. Whether or no the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> the aforesaid Author doth by force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son evince, that neither constitution nor designation of the King is from the people?</head>
               <p>THe P. Prelate aymeth (but it is an empty ayme) to prove that the people are wholly excluded. I answer only Arguments not pitched on before, as the Prelate saith.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. 1. <hi>To whom can it be more proper to give the rule over men, then to him who is the onely King truely and properly of the whole world?</hi> 2. <hi>God is the immediate Author of all rule and power that is amongst all his creatures, above or below.</hi> 3. <hi>Man before the fall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived dominion, and empire over all the creatures below immediatly, as</hi> Gen. 1.28. Gen. 9.2. ergo <hi>we cannot deny that the most noble go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (to wit Monarchy) must be immediatly from God, without any Contract or compact of men. Ans.</hi> The first reason concludeth not what is in question; for <hi>God</hi> only giveth rule and power to one man over another; <hi>ergo</hi> he giveth it <hi>immediatly,</hi> it followeth not. 2. It shall as well prove that God doth <hi>immediatly</hi> constitute all Iudges, and therefore it shall be unlawfull for a city to appoint a Major, or a shire a Iustice of peace. 3. The second argument is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequent also, because God in creation is the immediat Author of all things,<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Kings maketh them not of Gods only constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> and therefore without consent of the creatures, or any act of the creature, created an Angell a nobler creature then man, and a man then a woman, and men above beasts; because those that are not, can exercise no act at all. But it followeth not; <hi>ergo</hi> all the workes of providence, such as is the government of Kingdomes are done immediatly by God, for in the workes of providence, for the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50873:40"/>
most part in ordinary, God worketh by meanes; it is then as good a consequence as this. God immediatly created man, <hi>ergo</hi> he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his life immediatly also without foode and sleepe. God <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly</hi> created the Sunne, <hi>ergo</hi> God immediatly without the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sunne giveth light to the world. The making of a King is an act of reason, and God hath given a man reason to rule him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and therefore hath given to a society an instinct of reason, to appoint a governour over themselves, but no act of reason goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man be created; <hi>ergo</hi> it is not in his power whether he be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a creature of greater power then a beast or no. 4. God by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave power to a man over the creatures, and so immediatly; but I hope a man cannot say, God by creation hath made a man King over men. 5. The Excellency of <hi>Monarchy</hi> (if it be excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any other government, of which hereafter) is no ground why it should be <hi>immediatly</hi> from God, as well as mans dominion over the creature; for then the worke of mans redemption being more excellent then the raysing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> should have been done <hi>immediatly</hi> without the incarnation, death and satisfaction of Christ (for no act of God without himselfe is comparable to the worke of redemption, 1 Pet. 1.11, 12. Col. 1.18, 19, 20, 21, 22.) and Gods lesse excellent workes, as his creating of beasts and wormes should have been done mediatly, and his creating of man <hi>immediatly.</hi>

               <p>P. P. <hi>They who execute the judgement of God, must needs have the power to judge from God. But Kings are Deputies in the exercises of the Iudgements of God,</hi> ergo, <hi>the proposition is proved.

                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50873:41"/>
scourge his people, and that wicked men have no more hand and action in scourging his people, then the Prelate saith the people h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. We may borrow the Prelates argument: inferiour Iudges exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the judgement of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not the judgement of the <hi>King; ergo,</hi> by the Prelates argument, God doth only by immediate power execute judgement in them, and the inferiour Iudges are not <hi>Gods</hi> ministers executing the judgement of the <hi>Lord.</hi> But the Conclusion is against all truth, and so must the Prelates argument be. And that inferiour Iudges are the immediate substitutes and deputies of God, is hence proved, and shall be hereafter made good, if God will. 3. God is properly <hi>King of Kings,</hi> so is God properly <hi>causa causa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the cause of causes, <hi>the life of lifes, the joy of joyes.</hi> What, shall it then follow, that he worketh nothing in the creatures by their mediation, as causes? Because God is light of lights, doth he not enlighten the earth and aire by the mediation of the Sun? then God communicateth not life mediately by generation, he causeth not his Saints to rejoyce with joy unspeakable and glorious, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening mediation of the Word. These are vaine consequences. <hi>Soueraignty,</hi> and all power and virtue is in God infinitely: And what vertue and power of action is in the creatures, as they are compared with God, are in the creatures equivocally and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in opinion, rather then really. Hence it must follow, 1. that second causes worke none at all, no more then the people hath a hand or action in making the <hi>King,</hi> and that is no hand at all, as the Prelate saith, And God only and immediately worketh all workes in the creatures, because both the power of working and actuall working commeth from God, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in all their working, are Gods instruments: and if the Prelate argue so frequently from power given of God, to prove that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reigning is from God immediately, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.18. The <hi>Lord giveth the power, to get wealth:</hi> will it follow that <hi>Israel</hi> getteth no riches at all, or that God doth not mediately by them and their industrie get them? I thinke not.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. 6 <hi>To whom can it be due to give the Kingly office, but to him only who is able to give the indument and abilitie for the office? now God only and immediately giveth abilitie to be a King, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall anointing proveth,</hi> Josh 3.10. <hi>Othniel is the first Judge after Joshua; and it is said, And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50873:41"/>
and he judged Israel; the like is said of</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> David. <hi>Ans.</hi> God gave royall indowments <hi>immediatly, ergo</hi> he immediatly now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the King. It followeth not, for the species of government is not that which formally constituteth a King, for then <hi>Nero, Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Iulian</hi> should not have been Kings, and those who come to the Crowne by conquest and blood, are essentially Kings, as the <hi>Prelate</hi> saith; but be all these <hi>Othniels, upon whom the spirit of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth?</hi> then they are not essentially <hi>Kings</hi> who are babes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and foolish and destitute of the royall endowments, but it is one thing to have a royall gift, and another thing to be formally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Kingdome, <hi>David</hi> had royall gifts after <hi>Samuel</hi> anoynted him, but if you make him King, before <hi>Sauls</hi> death, <hi>Saul</hi> was both a traytor all the time that he persecuted <hi>David,</hi> and so no King, and also King and Gods anoynted, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth him; and therefore that spirit that came on <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> maketh nothing against the peoples election of a King, as the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is given to Pastors under the new Testament, as <hi>Christ</hi> promised; but it will not follow that the designation of the man who is to be Pastor, should not be from the <hi>Church</hi> and from men, as the <hi>Prelate</hi> denyeth that either the constitution or designation of the King is from the people, but from <hi>God</hi> onely. 2. I beleeve the infusion of the spirit of God upon the Iudges will not prove that Kings are now both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and designed of <hi>God solely, onely,</hi> and <hi>immediatly</hi>; for the Iudges were indeed immediatly and for the most part extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily raised up of God, and God indeed in the time of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was the King of Israel in another manner then he was the <hi>King</hi> of all the nations, and is the <hi>King</hi> of Christian Realmes now, and therefore the peoples despising of <hi>Samuel,</hi> was a refusing that <hi>God</hi> should reigne over them, because God in the Iudges revealed himselfe even in matters of Policy, as what should be done to the man that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sticks on the Sabbath day, and the like, as he doth not now to Kings.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50873:42"/>
then can this majestie and authoritie be derived? Again, where the obligation amongst equals is by contract and compact, violation of the faith, plighted in the contract, cannot in proper termes, be called disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or contempt of authoritie: it is no more but a receding from, and a violation of that which was promised, as it may be in States or Counties confederate. Nature, reason, conscience, scripture, teach, That disobedience to Soveraign power is not onely a violation of Truth, breach of Covenant, but also high disobedience and contempt, as is clear,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.26. <hi>So when</hi> Saul, Chap. 11. <hi>sent a yoak of Oxen, hewed in pieces, to all the Tribes, the fear of the Lord fell on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they came out with one consent,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.17. <hi>so</hi> Job 11.18. <hi>He looseth the bonds of Kings, that is, he looseth their authoritie, and bringeth them in contempt; and he girdeth there loyns with a girdle, that is, he strengthneth their authoritie, and maketh the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence them.

formally or virtually in the people.</hi> So he. It is false, that it is not virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the people: for there be two things in the Iudge, either infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior or supream (for the argument holdeth in the majestie of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, as we shall hear) 1. The gift or grace of Governing (the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian Prelate</hi> will offend at this.) 2. The Authority of governing: 1. The gift is supernaturall, and is not in man naturally, and so not in the King; for he is <hi>physically</hi> but a mortall man, and this is a gift received; for <hi>Salomon</hi> asked it by prayer from <hi>God.</hi> There is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie passive in all individuall men for it: as for the officiall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie it self, it is virtually in all, in whom any of Gods image is remaining, since the fall, as is clear; as may be gathered from, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. yea, the Father, the Master, the Judge, have it by Gods institution in some measure, over son, servant, and subject, though it be more in the supreme Ruler: and for our purpose, it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that authoritative majestie should be in all. (What is in the Father and Husband, I hope to clear) I mean, it needeth not to be formally in all, and so all are born alike and equall: But he who is a <hi>Papist,</hi> a <hi>Socinian,</hi> an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and therefore delivered to Satan by his mother Church, must be the <hi>Sectarie,</hi> for we are where this <hi>Prelate</hi> left us, maintainers of the Protestant Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Confession of Faith, and Nationall Covenant of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when this <hi>Demas</hi> forsook us, and embraced the World. 2. Though not on single man in <hi>Israel</hi> be a Judge, or King by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor have in them formally any ray of Royaltie, or of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straticall Authoritie; yet it followeth not, that <hi>Israel</hi> Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily convened, hath no such authoritie, as to make <hi>Saul</hi> King in <hi>Mizpah,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> King in <hi>Hebron,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.24, 25.<note place="margin">How Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie is in the people, and how not.</note> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.38, 39.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50873:43"/>
these men combined in a Citie, or Societie, have not power in a joynt Politicall body, to chose Inferiour or <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> Rulers. 3. The <hi>P. Prelates</hi> reason is nothing. <hi>All the Contribution</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the compact body to make a King, is onely by a surrender of the native right of every single man, (the whole being onely a voluntary constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)</hi> How then can there be any majestie derived from them? I answer. Very well. For the surrender is so voluntary, that it is also naturall, and founded on the Law of nature, That men must have Governours, either many, or one supreme Ruler: And it is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and dependeth on a positive institution of God, Whether the Government be by one supreme Ruler, as in a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> or in many, as in an <hi>Aristocracie,</hi> according as the necessitie and temper of the Common-wealth do most require. This Constitution is so voluntary, as it hath below it, the Law of nature for its generall foundation; and above it, the supervenient institution of God, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, That there should be such Magistrates, both Kings, and other Iudges, because without such, all humane societies should be dissolved.<note place="margin">A Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not surrender their right and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to their Rulers, so much as their power active to do, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to suffer unjust vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> 4. Individuall persons in creating a Magistrate, doth not properly surrender their right, which can be called a right; for they do but surrender their power of doing violence to these of their fellows in that same Communitie; so as they shall not now have Morall power to do injuries without punishment; and this is not right or libertie properly, but servitude: for a power to do violence and injuries, is not liberty, but serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Prelate talketh of Royaltie, as of meer Tyranny, as if it were a proper Dominion, and servile Empire, that the Prince hath over his people, and not more paternall and fatherly, then lordly, or masterly. 5. He saith, <hi>Violation of faith plighted in a contract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst equals, cannot be called disobedience, but disobedience to the authoritie of the Soveraign is not onely breach of Covenant, but high disobedience and contempt.</hi> But violation of faith amongst equals, as equals, is not properly disobedience; for disobedience is betwixt a superiour and an inferiour: but violation of faith amongst equals, when they make one of their equals their Iudge and Ruler, is not onely violation of truth, but also disobedience. All <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> while he is a private man seeking his fathers Asses, are equals by Covenant obliged one to another; and so any injury done by <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> in that case, is not disobedience, but onely violation of faith; but when all <hi>Israel</hi> maketh <hi>Saul</hi> their King, and sweareth to him obedience, he is not now their equall, and an injury done to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50873:43"/>
him now, is both a violation of their faith, and high disobedience also. Suppose a Citie of Aldermen, all equall amongst themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie and place, take one of their number, and make him their Major and Provost; a wrong done to him now, is not onely against the rules of fraternitie, but disobedience to one placed by God in authoritie over them. 6. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.7. <hi>The fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one consent to obey Saul. Ergo,</hi> God hath placed authority in Kings, which is not in people: It is true, because God hath transferred the scattered authorities that are in all the people, in one Masse; and by vertue of his own Ordinance, hath placed them in one man who is King. What followeth? <hi>Ergo,</hi> God conferreth this authoritie immediately upon the King, without the mediation of any action of the people; yea, the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followeth. 7. <hi>God looseth the bond of Kings</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Gods losing of the bond of Kings, by the mediation of the peoples dispising him, proveth against <hi>P.

But what doth this prove? That God taketh away the majestie and authority of Kings <hi>Immediately</hi>; And therefore God gave to Kings this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <hi>Immediately,</hi> without the peoples conveiance? Yea, I take the Prelates weapon from him. God doth not take the authority of the King from him <hi>immediately,</hi> but <hi>mediately</hi> by the people their hating and dispising him, when they see his wickednesse, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple see <hi>Nero</hi> a Monster, a prodigeous blood-sucker; upon this, all the people contemn him, and dispise him, and so the majesty is taken from <hi>Nero,</hi> and all his Mandates and Laws, when they see him trample upon all Laws divine and humane; and that mediately by the peoples heart, dispising of his majestie, and so they repeat and take again that aw-some authoritie, that they once gave him: And this proveth, that God gave him the authoritie mediately, by the consent of man. 8.

The <hi>Heathen</hi> say, That there is some divinity in Princes, as in <hi>Alexander the great,</hi> toward his enemies, and <hi>Scipio:</hi> But this will prove, That Princes and Kings have a Superiority over those who are not their native Subjects; for something of God is in them, in relation to all men, that are not their Subjects. If this be a ground, strong and good, because God onely, and independently from men, taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this majestie; as God onely, and independently giveth it, then

a King is sacred to all men, subjects, or not subjects; then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to make war against any forraign King and Prince, for in invading him, or resisting him, you resist that divine majestie of God, that is in him; then you may not lawfully flee from a tyrant, no more then you may lawfully flie from God. 10. <hi>Scipio</hi> was not a King. <hi>Ergo,</hi> This divine majestie is in all Iudges of the earth, in a more or lesse measure. <hi>Ergo,</hi> God onely and <hi>immediately,</hi> may take this spark of divine majestie from inferiour Iudges: It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. And Kings certainly cannot infuse any sparkle of a divine majestie, on any inferiour Iudges; for God onely, <hi>immediately</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth it in men. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is unlawfull for Kings to take this divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from Iudges, for they resist God, who resist Parliaments, no lesse then those who resist Kings. <hi>Scipio</hi> hath divinity in him, as well as <hi>Cesar,</hi> and that immediately from God, and not from any King. 10. <hi>Moses</hi> was not a King when he went to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for he had not as yet a people; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the King, and because <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a King, the Divines of <hi>Oxford</hi> must say, His Majestie must not, in words of rebuke, be resisted, more then by deeds. 11. <hi>Moses</hi> his face did shine as a Prophet receiving the Law from God, not as a King: and is this Sunshine of Heaven upon the face of <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Julian?</hi> It must be, if it be a beam of Royall Majestie, if this prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler say right, but 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. this was a majestie typicall, which did adumbrate the glory of the Law of God, and is far from being a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie due to all Heathen Kings. 12. I would our <hi>King</hi> would evidence such a Majestie in breaking the Images and Idols of his Queen, and of Papists about him. 13. The fear of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the regenerated, who are in Covenant with the Beasts of the field, <hi>Job</hi> 5.23. is upon the Beasts of the earth, not by any approbation only, as the people maketh Kings, by the Prelates way; nor yet by free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as the people freely transfer their power to him, who is King. The creatures inferiour to man, have by no act of freewill, chosen man to be their Ruler, and transferred their power to him, because they are by nature inferiour to man, and God by nature hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the creatures to man,<note place="margin">The subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures naturall, not voluntary as is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of people to Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. and so this proveth not, that the King by nature is above the people, I mean the man who is King; and therefore though God had planted in the hearts of all subjects, a fear and reverence toward the King; upon supposall, that they have made him King: It followeth not, That this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and majestie, is <hi>immediately</hi> given by God to the man who is King, without the interveening consent of the people; for there

               <head>QUEST. VIII. Whether the Prelate proveth by force of reason, that the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be capable of any power of Government?</head>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>God and nature giveth no power in vain, and which may not be reduced into action; but an active power, or a power of actuall governing, was never acted by the Communitie; therefore this power cannot be seated in the Communitie as in the prime and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subject; and it cannot be in every individuall person of a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, because Government intrinsecally and essentially includeth a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified distinction of Governours, and some to be governed; and to speak properly, there can no other power be conceived in the Communitie naturally and properly, but only</hi> potestas passiva regiminis, <hi>a capacitie or susceptabilitie to be governed, by one or by moe, just as the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desireth a forme. This obligeth all, by the dictate of Natures law, to submit to actuall government: and as it is in every individuall person, it is not meerly and properly voluntary, because howsoever nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, that government is necessary for the safety of the society, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very singular person, by corruption and selfe-love, hath a naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse and repugnancie to submit to any; every man would be a King himselfe: This universall desire,</hi> appetitus universalis aut natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis, <hi>or universall propension to Government, is like the act of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding assenting to the first undeniable principles of truth, and to the wills generall propension to happines in generall, which propension is not a free act, except our new Statists, as they have changed their faith, so they overturne true reason, it will puzzle them infinitely to make any thing in its kinde passive, really active and collative of positive acts and effects. All know, no man can give what he hath not: an old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher would laugh at him who would say, that a matter perfected and actuated by union, with a forme, could at pleasure shake off its forme, and marrie it selfe to another: they may as well say, every wife hath power to resume her freedome, and marrie another, as that any such power active is in the Communitie, or any power to cast off Monarchie.</hi>

It is true that people through corruption of nature are averse to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Governours, <hi>for conscience sake, and as to the Lord,</hi> because the naturall man remaining in the state of nature can doe nothing that is truely good, but it is false that men have no active Morall power to submit to superiours, but only a passive capacity to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, he quite contradicteth himselfe, for he said before, c. 4. pag. 49. that there is an <hi>innate feare and reverence in the hearts of all men naturally, even in Heathen toward their Severaign</hi>; yea as we have a naturall morall active power to love our Parents and supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours (though it be not Evangelically, or legally in <hi>Gods</hi> Court, good) and so to obey their commandements, only we are averse to penall Lawes of superiours; but this proveth no way, that we have only by nature, a passive capacity to government; for Heathens have by instinct of nature both made Lawes morally good, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, set Kings and Iudges over them; which clearely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that men have an active power of Government by nature:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50873:47"/>
4. yea, what difference maketh the Prelate betwixt men and beasts, for beasts have a capacity to be governed, even <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Tigers</hi>; but here is the matter, if men have any naturall power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> would have it with his brethren <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> to be not naturall, but done by the helpe of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall grace, for so doe they confound nature and grace. But it is certaine our power to submit to Rulers and Kings as to rectors, and guides and fathers, is naturall, to submit to Tyrants in doing ills of sinne, is naturall, but in suffering ills of punishment its not naturall. 5. <hi>No man can give that which he hath not,</hi> is true, but that people have no power to make their Governours, is that which is in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and denyed by us. 6. This argument doth prove that people hath no power to appoint <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> Rulers more then Kings, and sothe <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> and <hi>Democraticall</hi> Rulers are all inviolable and sacred, as the King. 2. by this the people may not resume their freedome if they turne tyrants and oppressors; this the Prelate shall deny, for he averreth, p. 96. out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the people may without sin change a corrupt <hi>Democracy</hi> into a <hi>Monarchy.</hi>

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is still subjected to policie by Prelates and Caveliers, not by us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who sought nothing but Reformation of Religion, of Laws, so far as they serve Religion, as our Supplications, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, and the event proveth. 4. We have no new Calves, new Altars, new Feasts, but professe, and really do hazard life and estate, to put away the <hi>Prelates Calves, Images, Tree-worship, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-worship, Saints Feast-dayes, Idolatry, Masses</hi>; and nothing is said here but <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and <hi>Cananites,</hi> and <hi>Baalites,</hi> might say, (though falsly) against the Reformation of <hi>Iosiah</hi>: Trueth and purity of worship this yeer, is new in relation to Idolatry the last yeer, but it is <hi>simpliciter</hi> older. 5.

Every action of Christ, such as his walking on the Sea, is not our instruction in that sense, that Christs <hi>refusing a Kingdom, is directly our instruction</hi>: And did Christ refuse to be a King, because the people would have made him a King? that is, <hi>non causa pro causa</hi>; he refused it, because his Kingdom was not in this world, and he came to suffer for men, not to reign over man. 7. The Prelate and others who were Lords of Session, and would be Iudges of mens Inheritances, and would usurpe the sword by being Lords of Counsell, and Parliament, have refused to be instructed <hi>by every Action of Christ,</hi> who would <hi>not judge betwixt brother and brother.</hi>

But this is but that which he said before.

In <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> it is the three Estates of Parliament, in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions some other Iudges or Peeres of the Land.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50873:50"/>
for this, then to all the Common-wealths on earth, because all have not Parliaments, as <hi>Scotland</hi> hath; all have not Constables, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, and Churchmen, Barons, Lords of Councell, Parliaments, &amp;c. as <hi>England</hi> had.

And, if they reteine some of it, <hi>habitu,</hi> in habit, and in their power? I am not now unseasonably, according to the Prelates order, to dispute of the power of lawfull defence against tyranny; but I lay down this maxime of Divinitie; <hi>Tyranny being a worke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, is not from God,</hi> because sinne either habituall or actuall, is not from God; the <hi>power that is, must be from God</hi>; the <hi>Magistrate</hi> as <hi>Magistrate,</hi> is good, in nature of office, and the intrinsecall end of his office, Rom. 13.4. <hi>for he is the Minister of God for thy good</hi>; and therefore a power ethicall, politick, or morall, to oppresse, is not from <hi>God,</hi> and is not a power, but a licentious deviation of a power, and is no more from <hi>God,</hi> but from sinfull nature, and the old serpent, then a license to sinne: <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> giveth pardons of sinne; but the <hi>Pope,</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> giveth dispensations to sinne. 2. To this adde, If for nature to defend it selfe be lawfull, no Communitie, without sin, hath power to alienate and give away this power: for as no power given to man to murther his brother, is of <hi>God,</hi> so no power to suffer his brother to be murthered, is of <hi>God</hi>; and no power to suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>(à fortiori)</hi> far lesse can be from <hi>God.</hi> Here I speake not of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall power, for if free will be the creature of <hi>God,</hi> a physicall power to acts which in relation to <hi>Gods</hi> law are sinfull, must be from <hi>God.</hi>

There is not like reason to grant so much to the <hi>King,</hi> as to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> because certainly Parliaments who make <hi>Kings</hi> under <hi>God,</hi> or above any one man, and they must have more authority and wisedome then any one <hi>King,</hi> except <hi>Solomon</hi> (as base flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers say) should returne to the thrones of the earth.<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath more power then the King.</note> And as the power to make just Lawes is all in the Parliament, only the people have power to resist <hi>tyrannicall Lawes,</hi> the power of all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was never given to the <hi>King,</hi> by God, the Parliament are as essentially Iudges as the <hi>King,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Kings</hi> deed may well be revoked, because he acteth nothing as <hi>King</hi>; but united with his great or lesser Councell, no more then the eye can see, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing separated from the body.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Whether the King and the under Magistrate differ essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, we shall see. The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> saith all Polititians grant it,<note place="margin">Iudges and Kings differ.</note> but he saith untruth; he bringeth <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Iudges,</hi> their power to prove the power of Kings; and so either the Iudges of Israel and the Kings differ not essentially, or then the Prelate must correct the spirit of God tearming one booke of Scripture <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50873:52"/>
Law, and the King not so. God</hi> moulded the first <hi>King,</hi> Deut. 17.18. <hi>when he sitteth judging on his Throne,</hi> to looke <hi>to a written Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the Law of God,</hi> as his rule. Now a power to follow <hi>Gods Law</hi> is better then a power to follow mans sinfull will: so the Prelate putteth the King in a worse condition then the Magistrate, not we, who will have the <hi>King</hi> to judge according to just statutes and lawes. 3. Whether the King be censurable and deposable by the multitude, he cannot determine out of our writings. 4. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities law is the law of nature, not their arbitrary lust. 5. The Prelates treasonable raylings, I cannot follow; he first saith, that <hi>we agree not ten of us to a positive faith,</hi> and that our faith is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but his faith is <hi>Privative, Popish, Socinian, Arminian, Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and worse, for he was once of that same faith that we are of. 2. Our Confession of Faith is positive, as the confession of all the reformed Churches, but I judge he thinketh the Protestant Faith of all the reformed Churches but negative. 3. The incommodities of Government before our reformation were not fancied, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Authority, all the body of Popery was printed, and avowed as the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of Scotland and England,</hi> as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author, and my much respected brother evidenceth in his <hi>Ludensium, <gap reason="foreign">

And because <hi>Extremis morbis extrema re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media</hi> in an extraordinary exigent, when <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iezabell</hi> did undoe the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and Tyrannize over both the bodies and consciences of <hi>Priest, Prophet, and people, Elias</hi> procured the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the States, and <hi>Elias</hi> with the peoples helpe killed all <hi>Baals Priests,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> looking on, and no question, against his heart. In this case I thinke its more then evident that the people resumed their power. 4. We teach not that people should supply all defects in Government, nor that they should use their power when any thing is done amisse by the <hi>King,</hi> no more then the King is to cut off the whole people of <hi>God,</hi> when they refuse an Idolatrous service obtruded upon them against all Law; the people is to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much before they resume their power, but this Court slave will have the people to doe what he did not himselfe, for when King and Parliament summoned him, was he not obliged to appeare? <hi>Non-compearance</hi> when lawfull, royall, and Parliamentory power summoneth, is no lesse resistance, then taking of Forts and Castles.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>Then this super-intending power in people, may call a King to accompt, and punish him for any misdemeanour, or act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice. Why might not the people of Israels Peeres, or Sanedrin have convented</hi> David <hi>before them, judged and punished him for his Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with</hi> Bathsheba, <hi>and his murther of</hi> Uriah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>but it is holden by all, that Tyranny should be an intended universall, totall, manifest destruction of the whole Common-wealth, which cannot fall in the thoughts of any but a mad man. What is recorded in the Story of</hi> Nero <hi>his wish in this kind, may be rather judged the expression of transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted passion, then a fixed resolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> contrary to the scope of his booke, which is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50873:53"/>
all for the subject and seat of Soveraigne power, against all order hath plunged himselfe in the deep of Defensive armes, and yet hath no new thing. 1. Our law of <hi>Scotland</hi> will warrant any subject, if the King take from him his heritage, or invade his possession against Law, to resist the invaders, and to summon the Kings intrudors before the Lords of Session for that act of injustice: Is this against <hi>Gods</hi> Word, or Conscience? 2. The <hi>Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> did not punish <hi>David; Ergo,</hi> it is not lawfull to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a <hi>King</hi> for any one act of injustice: from the practice of the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> to conclude a thing lawfull or unlawfull, is logick; we may resist. 3. By the <hi>P. Prelates</hi> doctrine, the law might not put <hi>Bathshebah</hi> to death, nor yet <hi>Joab</hi> the neerest agent of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of innocent <hi>Vriah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edrim puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed not <hi>David, Bathsheba, Ioab,</hi> proveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in law, as a fact or non fact is not law.</note> because <hi>Bathshebaes</hi> adulterie was the Kings adulterie, she did it in obedience to King <hi>David: Ioabs</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Royall murther, as the murther of all the <hi>Cavaliers</hi>; for he had the <hi>Kings hand-writing</hi> for it. Murther is Murther, and the murtherer is to dye, though the <hi>King</hi> by a secret <hi>Let alone,</hi> a private and illegall warrant command it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> might have taken <hi>Bathshebaes</hi> life, and <hi>Joabs</hi> head also: and consequently the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> if they be Judges (as I conceive <hi>God</hi> and the Law of that ancient and renowned Kingdome maketh them) may take the head of many <hi>Joabs</hi> and <hi>Jermines,</hi> for murther; for the command of a <hi>King</hi> cannot legitimate murther. 4. <hi>David</hi> himselfe, as <hi>King,</hi> speaketh more for us then for the Prelate, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. And <hi>Davids</hi> anger was greatly kindled against the man, (the man was himselfe, v. 7. <hi>Thou art the man</hi>) and he said to <hi>Nathan, as the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this, shall surely dye.</hi> 5. Every act of injustice doth not <hi>un-King</hi> a Prince before <hi>God,</hi> as every act of uncleannesse doth not make a wife no wife before <hi>God.</hi> 6. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late excuseth <hi>Nero,</hi> and would not have him resisted, if all <hi>Rome were one neck, that he might cut it off with one stroke</hi> (I read it of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>; If the Prelate see more in Historie then I doe, I yield.) 7. He saith, the thoughts of totall eversion of a Kingdome, must only fall on a mad man. The <hi>King of Britaine</hi> was not mad, when he declared the <hi>Scots</hi> Traytors, because they resisted the service of the Masse; and raised an Army of Prelaticall cut-throats to destroy them, if all the Kingdome should resist Idolatry, (as all are obliged.) The King sleeped upon this Prelaticall resolution many moneths: passions in fervor have not a dayes raigne upon a man. And this was not so

                  </gap>, <hi>Whether or not Kingdomes be proper patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies derived from the father to the sonne?</hi> 2. I take, there is a large difference betwixt a thing transmittable by birth from the father to the sonne, and a thing not transmittable. 3. I conceive, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is chosen to be a King over a people, so a familie or house may be chosen, and a Kingdome at first choosing a person to be their <hi>King,</hi> may also tye themselves to choose the first borne of his body: but as they transferre their power to the father, 1. for their owne safetie and peace, (not if he use the power they give him, to their destruction) the same way they tye themselves to his first borne, as to their <hi>King.</hi> 2. As they chose the father not as a man, but a man gifted with Royall grace, and a Princely facultie for government; so they can but tye themselves to his first borne, as to one graced with a facultie of governing: and if his first borne shall be borne an idiot and a foole, they are not obliged to make him King; for the obligation to the sonne can be no greater then the obligation to the father, which first obligation is the ground, measure and cause of all posterior obligations. If Tutors be appointed to governe such an one, the Tutors have the Royall power, not the Idiot; nor can he governe others, who cannot governe himselfe. That <hi>Kings</hi> goe not as heritage from the father to the sonne, I prove; 1. <hi>God,</hi> Deut. 17. could not command them to choose such a one for the <hi>King,</hi> and such a one <hi>who sitting on his throne</hi> shall follow the direction of <hi>God</hi> speaking in his word, if birth were that which gave him Gods title and right to the Crowne; for that were as much as such a man should be heire to his fathers inheritance, and the sonne not heire to his fathers crown, except he were such a man: But <hi>God</hi> in all the Law morall or judiciall, never required that the heire should be thus and thus qualified, else he should not be heire: but he requireth that a man, and so that a familie should be thus and thus qualified, else they should not be <hi>Kings</hi>: and I confirme it thus: The first <hi>King</hi> of divine institution must be the rule, paterne and measure of all the rest of the Kings, as <hi>Christ</hi> maketh the first Mariage,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50873:55"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. a paterne to all others, and <hi>Paul</hi> reduceth the right administration of the Supper to <hi>Christs</hi> first institution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. now the first King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15. is not a man qualified by naked birth, for then the Lord in describing the manner of the <hi>King</hi> and his due qualifications, should seeke no other but this; <hi>You shall choose onely the first borne, or the lawfull sonne of the former King.</hi> But seeing the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> first moulding is a <hi>King</hi> by election, and what <hi>God</hi> did after by promises and free grace give to <hi>David</hi> and his seed, even a throne till the <hi>Mesiah</hi> should come,<note place="margin">The Throne by speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, made to <hi>David</hi> and his seed, Ps. 89. no ground to make birth <hi>in foro dei</hi> a iust title to the Crowne.</note> and did promise to some <hi>Kings,</hi> if they would walke in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; that their sonnes, and sonnes sonne should sit upon the Throne, in my judgement is not an obliging Law, that sole birth should be as just a title, <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> (for I now dispute the question in point of conscience) as royall unction. 2. If by divine institution <hi>God</hi> have impawned in the peoples hand a subordinate power to the most High, who giveth Kingdomes to whom he will, to make and create Kings, then is not sole birth a just title to the Crowne. But the former is true; both by precept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.1. and God expresly saith, <hi>Thou shalt choose him King, whom the Lord shall choose.</hi> And if it had not been the peoples power to create their own Kings, how doth <hi>God</hi> after he had designed <hi>Saul</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> yet expresly 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. inspire <hi>Samuel</hi> 17. to call the people before the Lord at Mizpeh, to make <hi>Saul King?</hi> and how doth the Lord v. 22. expresly shew to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the people, the man that they might make him <hi>King?</hi> and because all consented not that <hi>Saul</hi> should be <hi>King, God</hi> will have his Coronation renewed, v. 14. <hi>Then said</hi> Samuel <hi>to the people, Come, and let us goe to Gilgall, and renew the Kingdome there.</hi> 15. <hi>And all the people went to Gilgall, and there they made</hi> Saul <hi>King before the Lord in Gilgall.</hi> And how is it that <hi>David</hi> anoynted by <hi>God</hi> is yet no King, but a private subject, <hi>while all Israel make him King at Hebron?</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Title to a Crown by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest must be unlawfull if truth be Gods just Title to a Crowne.</note> that he is no lawfull <hi>King,</hi> but the conquerour is the lawfull King. <hi>Gods</hi> revealed Will should be contradictory to himselfe, and birth should speake it is <hi>Gods</hi> Will, that the Heire of the former <hi>King</hi> be <hi>King,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest being also Gods revealed Will, should also speake that that Heire should not be King. 2.

If <hi>Royalists</hi> say, <hi>God the King of Kings who immediately maketh Kings, may, and doth transferre Kingdomes to whom he will, and when he putteth the sword in</hi> Nebuchadnezers <hi>hand, to conquer the King and Kingdome of</hi> Iudah, <hi>then</hi> Zedikiah <hi>or his sonne is not King of Iudah, but</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer <hi>is King, and God being above his Law, speaketh in that case his Will by conquests, as before he spake his Will by birth; this is all</hi> can be said. <hi>Ans.</hi> They answer black treason in saying so, for if <hi>Ieremiah</hi> from the <hi>Lord</hi> had not commanded expresly, that both the <hi>King and Kingdome of Judah</hi> should submit to the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50873:56"/>
to a conquerour, and so as that conquerour now hath as just right, as the <hi>King of Britaine</hi> had by birth. This cannot be taken off by the wit of any, who 1. maintaine that conquest is a lawfull title to a Crowne, and 2. that royall birth without the peoples election speaketh Gods regulating Will in his Word, that the first borne of a King is a lawfull King by birth; for God now a daies doth not say the contrary of what he revealed in his Word. If birth be Gods regulating Will, that the Heire of the King is in Gods Court a King, no act of the conquerour can anull that Word of God to us, and the people may not lawfully, though they were ten times subdued, sweare homage and allegiance to a conquerour, against the due right of birth, which by Royalists Doctrine revealeth to us the plaine contradictory Will of God. It is, I grant, often Gods <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree revealed by the event,</hi> that a conquerour be on the Throne, but this Will is not our rule, and the people are to sweare no Oath of Allegiance contrary to Gods <hi>Voluntas signi,</hi> which is his revealed Will in his Word regulating us.</p>

I now speake in point of conscience. 3. The externall lawfull title, before men come to a Crowne must be Gods Will, revealed by such an externall signe, as by Gods appointment and warrant is to regulate our will, but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50873:57"/>
according to Scripture nothing regulateth our will, and leadeth the people now that they cannot erre, following Gods rule in making a King, but the free suffrages of the States choosing a man whom they conceive God hath endued with these royall gifts required in the <hi>King</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> holdeth forth to them in his Word, Deut. 17. now there be but these to regulate the people, or to be a rule to any man to ascend lawfully (<hi>in foro Dei</hi>) in <hi>Gods</hi> Court to the Throne; 1. <hi>Gods</hi> immediate designation of a man by Propheticall and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspired <hi>unction,</hi>

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, seeing it is an act of violence, and Gods revenging Justice for the sinnes of a people, cannot give in Gods Court such a just title to the Throne, as the people are to submit their consciences unto, except <hi>God</hi> reveale his regulating will by some immediate voice from Heaven, as he commanded <hi>Iudah</hi> to submit to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> as to their <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>mouth</hi> of <hi>Ieremiah</hi>; now this is not a rule to us, for then, if the <hi>Spanish King</hi> should invade this <hi>Iland,</hi> and as <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did, deface the Temple, and instruments and meanes of <hi>Gods Worship,</hi> and abolish the true worship of <hi>God,</hi> it should be unlawfull to resist him, after he had once conquered the <hi>Iland,</hi> neither <hi>Gods</hi> Word, nor the Law of nature could permit this; I suppose even by grant of adversaries, now no act of violence done to a people, though in <hi>Gods Court</hi> they have deserved it, can be a testification to us of <hi>Gods regulating Will</hi>; except it have some warrant from the Law and testimony, it is no rule to our conscience to acknowledge him a lawfull <hi>Magistrate,</hi> whose sole law to the Throne is an act of the bloody instrument of divine wrath, I meane the sword. That therefore <hi>Iudah</hi> was to submit, according to Gods Word, to <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> whose conscience and best warranted calling to the Kingdome of <hi>Judah</hi> was his bloody sword, even if we suppose <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had not commanded them to submit to the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50873:57"/>
that <hi>David</hi> had to the Throne, then royall birth, because it is but equivalent only to divine unction, not superiour to divine unction, it cannot have more force to make a <hi>King,</hi> then divine unction.

I prove the Proposition, because where conquerours are wanting, and there is no King for the present, but the people governing, and so much confusion aboundeth, they cannot lawfully appoint a <hi>King,</hi> for his lawfull title before <hi>God</hi> must either be conquest, which to me is no title, (and here, and in this case there is no conquest) or if the title must be a Propheticall word immediatly inspired by <hi>God,</hi> but this is now ceased; or thirdly the title must be royal birth, but here there is no royall birth, because the government is popular; except you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that the society is obliged in conscience to goe and seek the sonne of a forraine <hi>King</hi> to be their <hi>King.</hi> But I hope that such a royall birth should not be a just title before <hi>God</hi> to make him King of that society, to which he had no relation at all, but is a meere stranger. Hence in this case no title could be given to any man to make him King, but onely the peoples election; which is that which we say.

A Kingdom is not the Princes own so, as it is unjustice to take it from him, as to take a mans purse from him; the Lords Church (in a Christian Kingdom) is Gods heritage, and the King onely a shepheard, and the sheep in the court of conscience, are not his. 3. Royall unction is not an indeleble Character; for neither <hi>Saul</hi> nor <hi>David</hi> were all their dayes Kings thereby, but lived many dayes private men after divine unction, while the people anointed them Kings, except you say, 1.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is proper onely to Jesus Christ to be born a King, sure I am, No man bringeth out of the womb with him a Scepter, and a Crown on his head. Divine unction giveth a right infallibly to a Crown; but birth doth not so, for one may be born here to a Crown, as was hopefull Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and yet never live to be King. The eldest son of a King, if he attempt to kill his father, as <hi>Absolom</hi> did, and raise forces against the lawfull Prince, I conceive he may be killed in battell, without any unjustice. 2. If in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers time he be the Lords anointed, there be two Kings, and the heir may have a son, and so there shall be three Kings, possibly four; all Kings by divine right.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We read in the Word of God, That the people made <hi>Solomon</hi> King, not that <hi>David,</hi> or any King can leave in his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Kingdom to his son. 2. He saith, <hi>The son hath not the right of reigning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The heir of a Crown hath the Crown as the patrimony of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not of the King his father.</note> 
                  <hi>as the patrimony of the people, but as a proprietie, given by the Law of the Kingdom, by his parents</hi>: Now this is all one, as if he said, <hi>The son hath not the right of the Kingdom, as the patrimony of the people, but as the patrimony of the people,</hi> which is good non-sense; For the proprietie of reigning, given from father to son, <hi>by the Law of the Kingdom,</hi> is nothing but a right to reign, given by the Law of the people, and the very gift and patrimony of the people, for <hi>Lex regni,</hi> This Law of the Kingdom is the Law of the people, tying the Crown to such a Royall Family; and this Law of the people is prior and ancienter then the King, or the right of reigning in the King, or which the King is supposed to have from his Royall father, because it made the first father, the first King of the Royall Line. For I demand, How doth the son succeed to his fathers Crown, and Throne? Not by any promise of a divine Covenant, that the Lord maketh to the father, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, <hi>that Davids seed should sit on his throne,</hi> till the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come: this, as I conceive, is vanished with the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Iews, nor can we now finde any immediate divine constitution, tying the Crown now to such a race: nor can we say, this cometh from the will of the father King, making his son King: For 1. there is no Scripture can warrant us to say,<note place="margin">The choice of a family to the Crown, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth upon the free election of the people, as on the fountain-cause.</note> 
                  <hi>The King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a King,</hi> but the Scripture holdeth forth, that the people made <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> Kings. 2. This may prove, That the father is some way a cause, why this son succeedeth King; but he is not the cause of the Royaltie conferred upon the whole Line; because the question is, Who made the first father a King? Not himself; nor doth God now immediately by Prophets anoint men to be Kings, then need force, the people choose the first man, then must the peoples election of a King, be prior and more ancient then the birth-law to a Crown: And election must be a better right then birth. 2. The question is, Whence cometh it that not onely the first father should be chosen King; but also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hence is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is in the peoples freewill to make the succession of Kings go by free election, as it is in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Pol</hi>; yet the people doth freely choose, not only the first man to be King, but also the whole race of the first born of this mans Family to be Kings. All here
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50873:59"/>
must be resolved in the free will of the Communitie; now since we have no immediate and propheticall enthroning of men: it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That the lineall deduction of the Crown from father to son, through the whole line, is from the people, not from the parent.</p>
               <p>Hence I adde this, as my sixth Argument,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Argum.</hi>
                  </note> That which taketh away that naturall aptitude, and natures birth-right, in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie given to them by God and nature, to provide the most effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and prevalent mean for their own preservation and peace in the fittest Government, that is not to be holden, but to make birth the best title to the Crown, and better then free election, taketh away and impedeth that naturall aptitude, and natures birth-right of chosing, not simply a Governour, but the best, the justest, the more righteous, and tyeth, and fettereth their choice to one of a house, whether he be a wise man, and righteous, and just, or a fool and an unjust man; therefore to make birth the best title to the Crown, is not to be holden.</p>
               <p>It is objected: <hi>That parents may binde their after Generations, to choose one of such a line; But by this Argument, their naturall birth-right of a free choice, to elect the best and fittest, is abridged and clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and so the posterity shall not be tyed to a King of the Royall Line, to which the Ancestors did swear.</hi> See for this, the learned Author,<note place="margin">

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally: So the first born, <hi>ceteris paribus,</hi> be qualified, and have an head to sit at the helm. 2.

The <hi>Parisian Doctors</hi> prove, That <hi>the precept of having a Pope is affirmative,</hi> and so tyeth not the Church, <hi>ad semper,</hi> for ever; and so the Church is the body of Christ without the Pope; and all oaths to things of their nature indifferent, and to things, the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is lawfull, and may be expedient and necessary, lay on a tie onely conditionally, in so far, as they conduce to the end. If the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> had risen in <hi>Joshuaes</hi> dayes, to cut off the people of God, I think no wise man can think, that <hi>Joshua</hi> and the people were tyed by the oath of God, not to cut off the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> in that case: For to preserve them alive as enemies, was against the intent of the oath, which was to preserve them alive, as friends demanding, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating peace, and submitting. The assumption is clear If a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seeth that <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> Government is better then <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, hic &amp; nunc:</hi> That the sequels of such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> is bloody, destructive, tyrannous, that the <hi>Monarchy</hi> compelleth the free subjects to <hi>Turcisme,</hi> to grosse Idolatry, they cannot by the divine bond of any oath captive their naturall freedom, which is to choose a Government, and Governours, for their safetie, for a peaceable and godly life; or fetter and chain the wisdom of the posterity unalterably to a Government, or a Royall Line, which <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> contrary to the intention of their oath, proveth destructive, and bloody. And in this case, even the King, though tyed by an oath to govern, is obliged to the practices of the Emperour <hi>Otho.</hi> And as <hi>Speed</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

leave in legacie, by oath, any chaines of the best gold to fetter the after-wits of posteritie to a choice destructive to peace and true Godlinesse.</p>
               <p>To these adde; 8. That 1. an heritor may defraud his first borne of his heritage, because of his dominion he hath over his heritage: A King cannot defraud his first-borne of the Crown. 2. An heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may divide his heritage equally amongst his twelve sonnes: A King cannot divide his Royall Dominions in twelve parts, and give a part to every sonne; for so he might turne a Monarchie into an <hi>Aristocracie,</hi> and put twelve men in the place of one King. 3. Any heritor taken captive, may lawfully oppignorate, yea and give all his inheritance as a ransome for his liberty; for a man is better then his inheritance: but no King may give his Subjects as a price or ransome.</p>
               <p>Yet I shall not be against the succession of <hi>Kings</hi> by birth, with good limitations; and shall agree, that through the corruption of mans nature, it may be in so far profitable, as it is peaceable, and preventeth bloody tumults, which are the bane of humane societies.

The first King ordained by <hi>Gods</hi> positive law, must be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all Kings, and more principally the <hi>King,</hi> then he who is such by derivation.

And this I say, not because I think sole birth is a just title to the Crown, but because it designeth him who indeed virtually was chosen, when the first King of the race was chosen. 4. Because there is no dominion of either Royalty, or any other way by nature, no more then an <hi>Eagle</hi> is born <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Eagles,</hi> a <hi>Lyon, King</hi> of <hi>Lyons</hi>; neither is a man by nature, born King of men: and therefore, he who is made King by suffrages of the people, must be more principally King, then he who hath no title, but the womb of his mother.</p>

If it be said, that the Divine impulsion stirring up a man to make a bloody conquest, that the ire and just indignation of God in Iustice may be declared on a wicked Nation, is an extraordinary impulsion of God, who is above a Law, and therefore no man may resist it.

And truly they deserve no wages, who thus defend the Kings Prerogative royall: for if the sword be a lawfull title to the crown, suppose the two Generals of both Kingdomes should conquer the most and the chiefest of the Kingdome now when they have so many forces in the field, by this wicked reason the one should have a lawfull call of God to be King of <hi>England,</hi> and the other to be King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; which is absurd. 6. Either conquest, as conquest, is a just title to the crown,<note place="margin">6 <hi>Arg.</hi>
                  </note> or as a just conquest. If as Conquest, then all conquests are just titles to a Crown; then the <hi>Ammonites, Zidonians, Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50873:66"/>
the Law of nature, the other to wit, Royall power on a meere posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law. The 2. degree or order of subjection naturall, is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in respect of gifts, or age: so <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 1 <hi>Polit. cap.</hi> 3. saith, <hi>that some are by nature servants:</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Shew a law of nature, that the father might inslave his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by a Divine positive law presupposing sin, the father might doe that, and yet I thinke that may be questioned, whether it was not a permission rather then a law, as was the Bill of devorce, but a law of nature it was not. 2. The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> can see no Law but the law of nature here, but it is because he is blind or will not see; his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, it was not by mutuall and voluntary contract of children and fathers, <hi>ergo</hi> it was by the law of nature; so he that cursed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to dye by Gods Law. This law was not made by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consent betwixt the Father and the Sonne, <hi>ergo</hi> it was a law of inature, the Prelate will see no better. Nature will teach a man to inslave hmselfe to redeeme himselfe from death, but that it is a Dictate of nature that a man should inslave his sonne, I conceive not. 3. What can this prove, but that if the sonne may by the law of nature, be inslaved for the father, but that the sonne of a slave is by nature under subjection to slavery, &amp; that by natures law, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof he spake in the page preceding, and in this same page.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Asser.</hi> 1. There is an Oath betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and his people, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, by reciprocation of bands, mutuall civill obligation upon the King to the people, and the people to the King, 2 Sam. 5.3 <hi>So all the Elders of Israel came to the King to Hebron, and King</hi> David <hi>made a Covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord, and they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted</hi> David <hi>King over Israel,</hi> 1 Chron. 11.3. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>made a covenant with them before the Lord, and they annoynted</hi> David <hi>King over Israel, according to the Word of the Lord by</hi> Samuel, 2 Chron. 23.2. <hi>And they went about in Iudah and gathered the Levites out of all the Cities of Iudah, and the chiefe of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Ierusalem.</hi> 3. <hi>And all the congregation made a covenant with the King</hi> Ioash <hi>in the house of God,</hi> 2 King. 11.17. <hi>and Jehoiada made a covenant betwixt the Lord and the King, and the people that they should be the Lords people, between the King also and his people,</hi> Eccles. 8.2. <hi>I counsell thee to keepe the Kings commandement, and that in regard of the Oath of God</hi>; then it is evident there was a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the people. 2. That was not a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that did tye the <hi>King to God</hi> onely, and not to the people, 1. because the covenant betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the people is clearly differenced from the <hi>Kings</hi> covenant with the <hi>Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.17. 2. there were no necessity that this covenant should be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly before the people, if the King did not in the covenant tye and oblige himselfe to the people; nor needed it be made solemnly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Lord</hi> is the House of <hi>God.</hi> 3. It is expresly a covenant, that was between <hi>Ioash the King</hi> and his people, and <hi>David</hi> made a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50873:69"/>
covenant at his Coronation with the Princes and <hi>Elders of Israel</hi>; therefore the people give the Crown to <hi>David</hi> Covenant-wise, and upon condition that he should performe such and such duties to them; and this is cleare by all Covenants in the Word of <hi>God,</hi> even the Covenant between <hi>God and man</hi> is so mutuall; <hi>I will be your God, and yee shall be my people.</hi> The covenant is so mutuall, that if the people breake the covenant, <hi>God</hi> is loosed from his part of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. v. 10.2. The covenant giveth to the beleever a sort of action of Law, and <hi>jus quoddam,</hi> to plead with God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his fidelity to stand to that covenant that bindeth him by reason of his fidelity, <hi>Esay</hi> 43.26. <hi>Es.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.4, 5. and farre more a covenant giveth ground of a civill action and claime to a people and the free estates against a King, seduced by wicked counsell to make war against the Land, whereas he did sweare by the most high God, that he should be a father and protector of the <hi>Church of God.</hi> 2. All covenants and contracts between man and man, yea all solemne promises bring the covenanters under a Law, and a claime before men, if the Oath of <hi>God</hi> be broken as the Covenant betwixt <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 21.27. <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.3. the spies professe to <hi>Rahab</hi> in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that they made with him, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 2. v. 20. <hi>And if thou utter this our businesse</hi> (say they) <hi>we will be quit of thine Oath, which thou hast made us to swear.</hi> There be no mutuall contract made upon certain conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but if the conditions be not fulfilled, the party injured is loosed from the contract. <hi>Barclay</hi> saith,<note place="margin">If the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without the which one of the parties would never have entered in covenant, be not performed, that person is loosed from the covenant. <hi>Arnis. de an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorit. prin. c.</hi> 1 <hi>n.</hi> 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>That this covenant obligeth the King to God, but not the King to the people. Ans.</hi> It is a vaine thing to say that the people and the King make a covenant, and that <hi>David</hi> made a covenant with the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Princes of Israel</hi>; for if he be obliged to <hi>God</hi> only, and not to the people by a covenant made with the people, it is not made with the people at all, nay, it is no more made with the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> nor with the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> for it bindeth <hi>David</hi> no more to Israel, nor to <hi>Chaldea,</hi> as a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with men. <hi>Arnisaeus</hi> saith, <hi>when two parties contract, if one performe the duty, the other is acquitted. Sect.</hi> Ex hujusmod ubi vult just. de duob. reis, l. 3. F. <hi>because every one of them are obliged fully.</hi> Sect. 1. Iust. eod. <hi>to God, to whom the Oath is made (for that is his meaning) and if either the people performe what is sworne to the Lord, or the King, yet one of the parties remaineth still under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and neither doth the peoples obedience exempt the King from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50873:70"/>
if he faile, nor the Kings obedience exempt the people, if they faile, but every one beareth the punishment of his owne sin; and there is no mutuall power in the parties to compell one another to performe the promised duty, because that belongeth to the Pretor or Magistrate, before whom the contract was made. The King hath jurisdiction over the people, if they violate their Oath, but the people hath no power over the Prince, and the ground that</hi> Arnisaeus <hi>layeth downe is that,</hi> 1. <hi>The King is not a party contracting with the people, as if there were mutuall obligations betwixt the King and the people, and a mutuall coactive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer on either side.</hi> 2. <hi>That the care of Religion belongeth not to the people, for that hath no warrant in the Word</hi> (saith he) 2. <hi>We read not that the people was to command and compell the Priests and the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Religion and abolish Idolatry, as it must follow, if the covenant be mutuall.</hi> 3. Iehoiada, 2 King. 11. <hi>obligeth himselfe and the King, and the people, by a like law to serve God, and here be not two parts, but three; the high Priest, the King, the People, if this example prove any thing.</hi> 4. <hi>Both King and people shall finde the revenging hand of God against them, if they faile in the breach of their Oath; but with this difference, and every one of the two, King and people by the Oath stand obliged to God, the King for himselfe, and the people for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but with this difference, the King oweth to God proper and due obedience as any of the subjects, and also to governe the people accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods true religion,</hi> Deut. 17. 2 Chro. 29. <hi>and in this the Kings ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation differeth from the peoples obligation, the people, as they would be saved must serve God, and the King for the same cause,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. <hi>But besides this, the King is obliged to rule and governe the people, and keepe them in obedience to God; but the people is not obliged to governe the King, and keepe him in obedience to God, for then the people should have as great power of jurisdiction over the King, as the King hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the people, which is against the Word of God, and the examples of the Kings of</hi> Iudah; <hi>but this commeth not from any promise or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that the King hath made with the people, but from a peculiar obligation whereby he is obliged to God as a man, not as a King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the mystery of the businesse, but I oppose this in these Assertions.<note place="margin">The people &amp; Princes in their place are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to maintain Religion and Iustice, no lesse then the King.</note>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Assert.</hi> As the King is obliged to <hi>God</hi> for the maintenance of true Religion, so are the people and Princes no lesse in their place obliged to maintaine true Religion, for 1. the people are rebuked because they burnt Incense in all high places, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.11.

2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.17. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.13. And the reason why the high places are not taken away, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.33. is given, for as yet the people <hi>had not prepared their heart unto the God of their fathers</hi>; but you will reply, elicite acts of maintenance of true Religion are commanded to the people, and that the places prove; but the question is <hi>De actibus imperatis,</hi> of commanded acts of Religion, sure none but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is to command others to worship <hi>God</hi> according to his Word. I answer, in ordinary only, Magistrates (not the King on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) but all the Princes of the Land, and Iudges are to maintaine Religion by their commandements, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.10.11. and to take care of Religion; but when the Iudges decline from Gods way, and corrupt the Law, we finde the people punished and rebuked for it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.4. <hi>And I will cause them to be removed to all Kingdomes of the earth, because of</hi> Manasseh <hi>the sonne of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah King of Iudah, for that which he did in Ierusalem,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.24. <hi>only feare the Lord</hi> —25. <hi>But if yee doe still wickedly, yee shall be consumed, both yee and your King.</hi> And this case I grant is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, yet so as <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> proveth well and strongly, that Religion is not given only to the King, that he only should keepe it, but to all the inferiour Iudges and people also in their kind; but because the estates never gave the King power to corrupt Religion,<note place="margin">In so far as the King presseth a false Religion on the people, <hi>catenus,</hi> in so far they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not to have a Kingly power.</note> and presse a false and Idolatrous worship upon them, therefore when the <hi>King</hi> defendeth not true Religion, but presseth upon the people a false and Idolatrous Religion, in that they are not under the <hi>King,</hi> but are presumed to have no King <hi>catenus</hi> so farre, and are presumed to have the power in themselves, as if they had not appointed any King at all: as if we presume the body had given to the right hand a power to ward off strokes, and to defend the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if the right hand should by a Palsie, or some other disease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impotent, and be withered up; when ill is comming on the body, it is presumed that the power of defence is recurred to the left hand, and to the rest of the body to defend it selfe, in this case as if the body had no right hand, and had never communicated any power to the right hand at all. So if an incorporation accused of Treason, and in danger of the sentence of death, shall appoint a Lawyer to Advocate their cause, and to give in their just defences to the Iudge; if their Advocate be stricken with dumbnesse, because they have losed their legall and representative tongue, none can say that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50873:71"/>
this incorporation hath loosed the tongues that Nature hath given them, so as by Natures law they may not plead in their own just &amp; lawfull defence, as if they had never appointed the foresaid lawyer to plead for them. The <hi>King,</hi> as a man, is not more obliged to the publick and regall defence of the true Religion, then any other man of the land; but he is made by God and the people <hi>King,</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> and people of <hi>God</hi>'s sake, that he may defend true Religion, for the behalfe and salvation of all. If therefore he defend not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the salvation of the soules of all in his publick and royall way, it is presumed as undeniable, that the people of <hi>God,</hi> who by the law of nature are to care for their own soule, are to defend in their way, true Religion, which so nearly concerneth them and their eternall happinesse.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Assert.</hi> When the covenant is betwixt God, on the one part, and the King, Priests, and people on the other part, it is true, if the one performe for his part to God, the whole duty, the other is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted; as if two men be indebted to one man ten thousand pounds, if the one pay the whole summe, the other is acquitted: but the King and People are not so, contracting parties in covenant with <hi>God,</hi> as that they are both indebted to <hi>God</hi> for one and the same sum of compleat obedience, so as if the King pay the whole summe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>God,</hi> the people is acquitted; and if the People pay the whole summe, the King is acquitted: for every one standeth obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>God</hi> for himselfe; for the people must doe all that is their part, in acquitting the King from his <hi>Royall duty,</hi> that they may free him and themselves both from punishment, if he disobey the <hi>King of Kings:</hi> Nor doth the Kings obedience acquit the people from their duty.

                  <hi>who is above both King and People, to compell each of them; the King to performe his part of the covenant to the people, and the people to performe their part of the covenant to the King. Now there is no Ruler but God, above both King and People. But let me answer: The consequence is not needfull, no more then when the King of Iudah and the King of Israel make a covenant to perform</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:50873:71"/>
mutuall duties one to another: no more then it is necessarie that there should be a King and superior Ruler above the <hi>King of Israel</hi> and the <hi>King of Iudah,</hi> who should compell each one to doe a duty to his <hi>fellow King</hi>; for the King and People are each of them above, and below others in divers respects: The People, because they cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the man <hi>King,</hi> they are so above the <hi>King,</hi> and have a virtuall power to compell him to doe his duty: and the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> hath an authoritative power above the People, because Royaltie is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally in him, and originally and virtually only in the People; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may he compell them to their duty, as we shall heare anon; and therefore there is no need of an earthly Ruler higher then both, to compell both.</p>

He saith, by covenant the <hi>King</hi> is bound to <hi>God</hi> as a Man, not as a <hi>King.</hi> But so the man will have the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> under no law of <hi>God,</hi> and so he must either be above <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> or coequall with <hi>God</hi>; which are manifest blasphemies: for I thought ever, the Royalists had not denyed, but the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> had been obliged to keep his oath to his subjects, in relation to God, and in regard of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall obligation; so as he sinneth before God, if he breake his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with his people:<note place="margin">The covenant tyeth the King to the People politically as well as to God naturally or religiously.</note> though they deny that he is obliged to keep his covenant in relation to his Subjects, and in regard of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique or civill obligation to men. Sure I am, this the <hi>Royalists</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly teach. 3. He would have this covenant so made with men, as it obligeth not the <hi>King</hi> to men, but to God. But the contrary is true. Beside the King and the Peoples covenant with the <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:50873:72"/>
King <hi>Joash</hi> made another covenant with the People, and <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Priest was only a witnesse, or one who in Gods name performed the rite of annointing, otherwise he was a subject on the peoples side, obliged to keep allegiance to <hi>Joash,</hi> as to his Soveraigne and Master. But certainly, who ever maketh a covenant with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, promising to governe them according to Gods word, and upon that condition and these termes receiveth a throne and crown from the people, he is obliged to what he promiseth to the people, <hi>Omnis promittens facit alteri, cui promissio facta est, jus in promittentem</hi>; Who ever maketh a promise to another, giveth to that other a sort of right or jurisdiction to challenge the promise. The covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> were a shadow, if it tye the people to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to <hi>David</hi> as their <hi>King,</hi> and if it tye not <hi>David</hi> as <hi>King</hi> to govern them in righteousnesse; but leave <hi>David</hi> loose to the people, and only tye him to <hi>God</hi>; then it is a covenant betwixt <hi>David</hi> and <hi>God</hi> only: But the Text saith, It is a covenant betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> 2 King. 11.17. 2 Sam. 5.3.</p>
               <p>Hence our second Argument. He who is made a minister of <hi>God,</hi> not simply,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Arg.</hi>
                  </note> but for the good of the subject; and so he take heed to walk in Gods law as a <hi>King,</hi> and governe according to Gods will, he is in so far only made King by <hi>God,</hi> as he fulfilleth the condition; and in so far as he is a minister for evill to the subject, and ruleth not according to that which the book of the Law commandeth him as King, in so far he is not by God appointed <hi>King</hi> and Ruler, and so must be made a King by <hi>God</hi> conditionally: But so hath <hi>God</hi> made Kings and Rulers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Ps.</hi> 89.30, 31. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.7, 8, 9. This argument is not brought to prove that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> or <hi>Saul</hi> leave off to be Kings, when they faile in some part of the condition; or as if they were not <hi>Gods Vicegerents</hi> to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed in things lawfull, after they have gone on in wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: For, the People consenting to make <hi>Saul</hi> King, they give him the Crown, <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> at his entry, <hi>absolutely</hi>: there is no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required in him before they make him <hi>King,</hi> but only that he covenant with them to rule according to Gods law: The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be performed, are consequent, and posterior to his actuall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, and his sitting on the Throne. But the argument presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that which the Lords word teacheth, to wit, that the Lord and the people giveth a crown by one and the same action; for <hi>God</hi> formally maketh <hi>David</hi> a <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Elders of Israels</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50873:72"/>

to him, and he, <hi>solo Deo minor,</hi> only next and immediate to God, the people can have no <hi>jus,</hi> no law over him by vertue of any covenant.

Because this is as much against the King as the people, and more; for if the first <hi>King</hi> cannot bring forth his written and authentick tables to prove that the Crown was given to him and his heires, and his successors absolutely and without any conditions, so as his will shall be a law, <hi>cadit causa,</hi> he loseth his cause (say they) The King is in possession of the Royall power <hi>absolutely,</hi> without any condition, and you must put him from his possession by a law. I answer, this is most false; 1. Though he were in <hi>mala fide,</hi> and in unjust possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the law of Nature will warrant the people to repeal their right, and plead for it, in a matter which concerneth their heads, lives, and soules. 2. The <hi>Parliaments</hi> of both Kingdomes standing in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a nomothetick power to make lawes, proveth cleerely that the King is in no possession of any Royall dignitie conferred <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> and without any condition upon him: and therefore it is the Kings part by law to put the Estates out of possession. And so
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50873:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though there were no written covenant, the standing law and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of many hundreth acts of Parliament, is equivalent to a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the people appointeth any to be their <hi>King,</hi> the voyce of Nature exponeth their deed, though there be no vocall or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten covenant; For that fact of making a King, is a morall lawfull act warranted by the word of <hi>God,</hi> Deut. 17.15, 16. Rom. 13.1.2. and the law of Nature: and therefore they having made such a man their King, they have given him power to be their father, feeder, healer, protector; and so must only have made him King <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> so he be a father, a feeder, and tutor. Now if this deed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a King, must be exponed to be an investing with an absolute, and not a conditionall power; this fact shall be contrary to Scripture, and to the law of Nature: for if they have given him Royall power absolutely, and without any condition,<note place="margin">If the King be made King absolutely, he is made such an one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the word of God and nature of his office.</note> they must have given to him power to be a father, protector, tutor, and to be a tyrant, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, a bloody lyon to waste and destroy the people of God.</p>

               <p>For the 4th. if it stand, then must the people give to their first elected King a power to wast and destroy themselves, so as they may never controle it, but only leave it to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon together, but so the condition is a Chimera (<hi>We give you a Throne, upon condition you swear by him who made heaven and earth, that you will govern us according to Gods Law; and you shall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to God only, not to us, whether you keep the covenant you make with us, or violate it;</hi>) but how a covenant can be made with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the <hi>King</hi> obliged to <hi>God,</hi> not to the people, I conceive not. 2. This presupposeth that the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King</hi> cannot doe any sin, or commit any act of tyranny against the people, but against <hi>God</hi> only; because if he be obliged to <hi>God</hi> only as a <hi>King</hi> by vertue of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: How can he faile against an obligation where there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation? but as a <hi>King</hi> he owe no obligation of duty to the people, and indeed so doe our good men expound that <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Against thee, thee only have I sinned,</hi> not against <hi>Vriah</hi>; for if he sinned not as <hi>King</hi> against <hi>Vriah,</hi> whose life he was obliged to conserve as a

                  <hi>King,</hi> he was not obliged as a <hi>King</hi> by any royall duty to conserve his life.

By this the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King</hi> is loosed from all duties of the second Table, being once made a <hi>King,</hi> he is above all obligation to love his neighbour as himselfe, for he is above all his neighbours, and above all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and only lesse then <hi>God.</hi>

their subjects from violence and the sword, and fighting the Lords battells for them, and counselling them. If therefore Royalists argue rightly, <hi>A King is essentially a father, and, fatherly power and royall power are of the same essence and nature; As therefore he who is once a father, is ever a father, and his children cannot take up armes against him to resist him, for that is unnaturall, &amp; repugnant to the</hi> 5. <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: So he who is once a King, is evermore a King, and it is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the fifth Commandement to resist him with armes.</hi> It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that the Argument presupposeth that Royall power, and Fatherly power is one and the same in nature, whereas they differ in nature, and are only one by <hi>analogie</hi> and proportion: for so Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of the Word are called <hi>fathers,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that once a Pastor, evermore a Pastor; and that if therefore Pastors turne wolves, and by hereticall doctrine corrupt the flock, they cannot be cast out of the Church. 3.

person surrogated, hath all the Priviledges that he hath, in whose place he succeedeth, he who succeedeth to the place, succeedeth to the right; the adopted sonne, or the bastard who is legittimated, and commeth in the place of the lawfull borne sonne, commeth also in the priviledges of the lawfull borne sonne; a Prince elected commeth to the full possession of the Majesty of a naturall Prince and Father, for</hi> Modus acquirendi non tollit naturale jus possidendi (<hi>saith Arnisaeus,</hi> more fully then the <hi>poore Plagiarius) the manner of acquiring any thing taketh not away the naturall possession, for how ever things be acquired, if the title be just, possession is the Law of Nations; then when the King is chosen in place of the father, as the father hath a divine right by nature, so must the King have that same: and seeing the right proprietor</hi> (saith the Pamphleting Prelate) <hi>had his right by God, by nature, how can it be, but howsoever the designation of the person is from the disordered com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, yet the collation of the power is from God immediatly, and from his sacred and inviolable ordinance. And what can be said against the way by which any one elected obtained his right, for seeing God doth not now send</hi> Samuells <hi>or</hi> Elisha's <hi>to anoynt or declare Kings, we are in his ordinary providence to conceive the designation of the person is the manifestation of Gods Will, called</hi> Voluntas signi, <hi>as the Schooles speake, just so as when the Church designeth one to sacred orders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. 1. <hi>He that is surrogated in the place of another, due to him,</hi> by a positive Law of man, <hi>he hath Law to all the priviledges that he hath in whose place he is surrogated,</hi> that is true. He who is made Assignee to an Obligation for a summe of money, hath all the rights that the principall party to whom the Bond or Obligation was made, he who commeth in the place of a Major of a City, of a Captaine in an Army, of a Pilot in a ship, of a Pope, hath all the priviledges and Rights that his predecessors had by Law. <hi>Jus succedit juri, persona jure predita personae jure preditae.</hi> So the Law, so far as my reading can reach, who professe my selfe a Divine; but that <hi>he who succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the place of a father, by nature, should injoy all the naturall Rights and Priviledges of the person to whom he succeedeth</hi>; I beleeve the Law never dreamed it, for then the adopted sonne comming in place of the naturall sonne, hath right to the naturall affection of the father; if any should adopt <hi>Maxwell</hi> the Prelate, should he love him as the Pursevant of <hi>Craile, Maxwell</hi> his father loved him? I conceive not; hath the adopted sonne his life, his being, the figure bodily, the manners of the sonne in whose place he is adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50873:79"/>
or doth he naturally resemble the father as the naturall sonne doth? The Prelate did not read this Law in any approved <hi>Iurist,</hi> though he did steale the argument from <hi>Arnisaeus,</hi> and stole the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> out of him, with a little Metathesis: A naturall sonne is not made a sonne by the consent of Parents, but he is a sonne by generation, so must the adopted sonne be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without the free consent and grace of the father adopting:<note place="margin">See <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, <hi>Eth.</hi> 8.10. pol. 1. c. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

                  </note> so here the King commeth in the place of a naturall father, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Law saith not that the elected King is a King without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the subjects, as the naturall father is a father without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of his sonnes. 2. Nor is it a Law true, as <hi>once a father alwaies a father,</hi> so once an elected King, alwaies a King, though he sell his subjects, being induced thereunto by wicked Counsellors. 3. If the King have no priviledges, but what the naturall father hath in whose place he commeth, then as the naturall father in a free King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath not power of life and death over his sonnes, neither hath the <hi>King</hi> power of life and death over his subjects, this is no Law. 4 This maxime should prove good, if the <hi>King</hi> were essentially a father, by generation and naturall propagation, but he is onely a father <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> and by a <hi>borrowed speech.</hi> A father <hi>non gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando, sed politicò alendo, tuendo, regendo,</hi> therefore an elected Prince commeth not in the full possession of all the naturall power and rights of a naturall father. 2. The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> speaketh disgracefully of the Church of God, calling it a <hi>disorderly community,</hi> as if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe were borne of Kings, where as God calleth the King their Shepheard, and the people, <hi>Gods stocke, inheritance and people</hi>; and they are not a disorderly body by nature, but by sin; in which sense the Prelate may call King, Priest and people, a company of Heires of Gods wrath, except he be an Arminian still, as once he was. 3. If we are in ordinary providence now, because we have not <hi>Samuels,</hi> and Prophets to anoynt Kings, to hold the designation of a person to be King, to be the manifestation of Gods Will, called <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> is Treason, for if <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> should designe <hi>Maxwell</hi> in the place of King <hi>Charles</hi> our native Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne (an odious comparison) <hi>Maxwell</hi> should be lawfull King for what is done by Gods Will, called by our Divines (they have it not from Schoolemen, as the Prelate ignorantly saith) his <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied will</hi> which is our rule, is done lawfully, there can be no greater treason put in print then this.</p>

               <p>And the Reasons why private men are just Lords and proprietors of their own Goods, are, 1.

Maritall and husbandly power is naturall, though it be not naturall, but from free election that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is <hi>Ana's</hi> Husband, and should have been, though man had never sinned: but <hi>Royall Power</hi> is a politick constitution, and the world might have subsisted, though <hi>Aristocracy</hi> or <hi>Democracy</hi> had been the only and perpetuall governments. So let the Prelate glory in his borrowed Logick, he had it from <hi>Barclay. It is not in the power of the Wife to repudiat her Husband, though never so wicked, she is tyed to him for ever, and may not give to him a bill of Divorcement, as by Law the Husband might give to her; if therefore the people sweare loyalty to him, they must keep, though to their hurt.</hi> Ps. 15. <hi>Ans.</hi> There's

nothing here said, except <hi>Barclay</hi> and the <hi>Plagiarie</hi> prove, that the Kings Power is properly a Husbands power, which they cannot prove, but from a Simile that crooketh; but a King elected upon conditions, that if he sell his people, he shall lose his Crown, is as essentially a King, as <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Evahs</hi> Husband, and yet by grant of parties, the people may devorce from such a <hi>King,</hi> and dethrone him, if he sell his people; but a Wife may never devorce from her Husband, as the Argument saith.

                  <hi>Assert.</hi> 3. The King is more properly a sort of Patron, to defend the people, and therefore hath no power given either by God or man to hurt the people, and a Minister or publick and honourable servant, Rom. 13.4. for he is the Minister of <hi>God to thee for good</hi>; he is the Common-wealths servant <hi>objectively,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King an honourable servant.</note> because all the Kings service, as he is <hi>King,</hi> is for the good, safety, peace and salvation of the people, and in this he is a servant. 2.

It followeth not, because all the service the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King</hi> performeth to <hi>God,</hi> they are acts of Royalty, and acts of Royall service, as terminated on the people; or acts of their Soveraigne Lord, and this proveth that to be their Soveraigne, is to be their servant,<note place="margin">Royall power only from God, and only from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in divers respects.</note> and watch-man.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>God maketh a King only, and the Kingly power is in him only, not in the people.</hi> Ans. <hi>The Royall power is only from God, immediatly,</hi> Immediatione simplicis constitutionis, &amp; solum a Deo solitudine primae causae, by the immediation of simple constitution, none but God appointed there should be Kings; but 2.

               <p>Object. 3. <hi>Though Royall power were given to the people, it is not given to the people, as if it were the Royal power of the people, and not the Royall power of God, neither is it any other waies bestowed on the people but as on a beame, a channell, an instrument, by which it is derived

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>King</hi> head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie only metaphorically</note> by a borrowed speech, in a politique sense, because he ruleth, commandeth, directeth the whole politique body in all their operations and functions. But he is not univocally and essentially the head of the Commonwealth. 1. The same very life in number that is in the head, is in the members: there be divers distinct soules and lives in the King, and in his Subjects. 2. The head naturall is not made an head by the free election and consent of armes, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, leggs, toes, fingers, &amp;c. The <hi>King</hi> is made <hi>King</hi> only by the free election of his people. 3. The naturall head, so long as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son liveth, is ever the head, and cannot cease to be a head while it is seated on the shoulders: The <hi>King,</hi> if he sell his people, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and soules, may leave off to be a King and Head. 4. The head and members live together, and dye together: the King &amp; the people are not so; the King may dye, and the People live. 5. The naturall head cannot destroy the members, and preserve it selfe: but <hi>King Nero</hi> may waste and destroy his people. <hi>D. Ferne, M. Simmons,</hi> the <hi>P.

But <hi>the members of a Politique body</hi> may resist the Politique head. 2. This or that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50873:86"/>
                  <hi>King</hi> is not the adequate and totall Politique head of the Common-wealth: and therefore though you cut off a <hi>Politique head,</hi> there's nothing done against nature. If you cut off all Kings of the Royall line, and all Governors <hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> both King and Parliament, this were against nature; And a Common-wealth which would cut off all Governors, and all Heads, should goe against nature, and run to ruine quickly. I conceive a societie of reasonable men cannot want Governours. 6. The naturall head communicateth life, sense, and motion to the members, and is the seat of externall and internall senses: the <hi>King</hi> is not so.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Assert.</hi> 5. the King is not properly the head of a family,<note place="margin">The King but metaphorically only Lord of the familie.</note> for, 1. (as <hi>Tholossa</hi> saith well <hi>de Rep. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) Nature hath one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in making the thumbe, another intention in making the whole hand, another in forming the body: so there is one intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the God of nature in governing of one man, another in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Familie, another in governing a Citie: nor is the thumbe King of all the members: so domestick government is not Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall properly. 1. The mother hath a parentall power as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.5. &amp; 10.3. &amp; 31.17. so the 5. Command saith, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy father and thy mother.</hi> 2. <hi>Domestick</hi> government is naturall, <hi>Monarchicall</hi> politique. 3. <hi>Domestick</hi> is necessary, <hi>Monarchicall</hi> is not necessary, other governments may be as well as it. 4. <hi>Domestick</hi> is universall, <hi>Monarchicall</hi> not so. 5. <hi>Domesticall</hi> hath its rise from naturall instinct without any farther instruction: a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall</hi> government is not, but from election, choosing one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not another.</p>
               <p>Hence that is a fiduciarie power, or a power of trust,<note place="margin">The King not heire nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of the Kingdome.</note> wherein 1. the thing put in trust is not his own proper either heritage or gift, so as he may dispose of it as he pleaseth, as men dispose of their goods or heritage.

Because both the Iudge and the King was from <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> gave <hi>Moses</hi> a lawfull calling to be a Iudge, so did he to <hi>Eli,</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.15. the King is a lawfull Ordinance of God: If then the <hi>Judge</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> be both lawfull Ordinances, and if they differ essentially, as <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> saith; then that specifice forme which distinguisheth the one from the other, to wit, Domination and a power to destroy the subject, must be from God, which is blasphemous; for God can give no morall power to do wickedly; for that is licence, and a power to sin against a Law of God, which is absolutely inconsistent with the holinesse of God; for so the Lord might deny himself, and dispence with sin (God avert such blasphemies.) Now if the kingly power be from God, That which essentially and specifically constituteth a King, must be from God, as the Office it self is from God: And <note n="(d)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Barclay</hi> saith expressely; That the kingly power is from God, and that same which is the specifice form, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituteth a King, must be that which essentially separateth the King from the Iudge, if they be essentially different, as <hi>Barclay</hi> dreameth.

He speaketh of such a power, as is answerable to the Acts here spoken of; but the Acts here spoken of, are Acts of meere tyranny, Vers. 11. <hi>And this will be the manner of your King, that shall reign over you, he will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his Chariots, and to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his Chariots:</hi> Now to make slaves of their sons, was an Act of <hi>Tyranny.</hi> 2. To take their <hi>fields and vineyards, and oliveyards</hi> from them, and give them to his servants, was no better then <hi>Ahabs</hi> taking <hi>Naboths vineyard</hi> from him, which by <hi>Gods law</hi> he might not lawfully sell, except in the case of extreme povertie, and then in the yeer of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> he might redeem his own inheritance. 3. Verse 15, 16. To put the <hi>people of God</hi> to bondage and make them servants, was to deal with them, as the Tyrant <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did. 4. He speaketh of such a law, the execution whereof should make <hi>them cry out to the Lord, because of their King</hi>: but the execution of the just Law of the King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. is a blessing, and not a bondage which should make the people cry out of the bitternesse of their spirit. 5.

                  <hi>An ill King is a punishment of God, for the sins of the people, and there is no remedy but patient suffering. Ans.</hi> Truely it is a silly Argument. The <hi>Assyrians</hi> comming against the people of <hi>God,</hi> for their sins, is a punishment of <hi>God,</hi> Esa. 10.5.12.13. But doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that it is unlawfull, for <hi>Israel</hi> to fight and resist the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and that they had warrant to doe no other thing, but lay downe Armes, and pray to God, and fight none at all? Is there no lawfull resisting of ills of punishment, but meere prayers and patience? The <hi>Amalikites</hi> came out against <hi>Israel</hi> for their sinnes, <hi>Senahkerib</hi> against <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> for the sins of the people. <hi>Asa</hi> his enemies fought against him for his sins, and the peoples sins; shall <hi>Moses</hi> and the people, <hi>Hezekiah, Asa,</hi> do then nothing but pray and suffer? Is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull with the sword to resist them? I beleeve not, Famine is often a punishment of God in a Land, <hi>Amos.</hi> 4.7, 8. is it therefore in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, unlawfull to till the earth, and seeke bread by our industry and are we to doe nothing but to pray for daily bread? It is a vaine Argument.</p>
               <p>Observe therefore the wickednesse of <hi>Barclay, contra Monarch. l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 56. for he would prove, that <hi>a power of doing ill, and that without any punishment to be inflicted by man, is from God; because our Lawes punish not perjurie, but leaveth it to be punished of God, l.</hi> 2. <hi>l. de Reb. cred. Cujacius, l.</hi> 2. <hi>obs. c.</hi> 19. <hi>And the husband in Moses his law, had power to give a bill of divorce to his wife, and send her away; and the husband was not to be punished. And also Stewes and work-houses for harlots, and to take usurie, are tolerated in many Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and yet these are all sorts of murthers, by the confession of Heathen: Ergo,</hi> (saith <hi>Barclaius) God may give a power for Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous acts to Kings, so as they shall be under no punishment to be inflicted by men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> All this is an argument from fact. 1. A wicked Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie may permit perjurie and lying in the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">The Law of the King not a permissive law as was the law of devorcement</note> and that without punishment; and some Christian Commonweales, he meaneth his own <hi>Synagogue of Rome, spirituall Sodome, a cage of uncleane birds,</hi> suffereth Harlotrie by Law, and the whores pay so many thousands yearely to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and are free of all punishment by Law, to eschew homicides, adulteries of Romish Priests, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50873:90"/>
greater sinnes: Therefore <hi>God</hi> hath given power to a King to play the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> without any feare of punishment to be inflicted by man. But 1. if this be a good argument, The Magistrate to whom <hi>God</hi> hath committed the sword <hi>to take vengeance on evill doers, Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. such as are perjured persons, professed whores and harlots, hath a lawfull power from <hi>God</hi> to connive at sinnes and grosse scandals in the Commonwealth, as they dreame that the <hi>King</hi> hath power given from <hi>God</hi> to exercise all acts of Tyranny without any resistance. But, 1. this was a grievous sinne in <hi>Eli,</hi> that he being a father and a Iudge, punished not his sonnes for their uncleannesse, and his house, in Gods heavy displeasure, was cut off from the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood therefore. Then <hi>God</hi> hath given no such power to the Iudge. 2. The contrary duty is lying on the Iudge, <hi>To execute judgement for the oppressed,</hi> Iob 29.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Ier. 22.15, 16. and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of judgement, and conniving at the heynous sinnes of the wicked, is condemned, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.31, 32. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.42, 43. <hi>Esa.</hi> 1.17. &amp; 10.1. &amp; 5.23. and therefore <hi>God</hi> hath given no power to a Iudge to permit wicked men to commit grievous crimes, without any punishment. As for the <hi>Law of Divorce,</hi> it was indeed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive law, whereby the husband might give the wife a <hi>bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,</hi> and be free of punishment before men, but not free of sinne and guiltinesse before <hi>God,</hi> for it was contrary to Gods institution of Mariage at the beginning, as <hi>Christ</hi> saith: and the Prophet saith, that the <hi>Lord hateth putting away.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.</note> But that <hi>God</hi> hath given any such permissive power to the <hi>King,</hi> that he may doe what he pleaseth, and cannot be resisted: This is in question. 3. The Law spoken of in the Text, is by <hi>Royalists</hi> called, not a <hi>consuetude of Tranny,</hi> but the <hi>divine law of God, whereby the King is formally and essentially distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Judge in Israel:</hi> Now if so, a power to sinne, and a power to commit acts of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> yea, and a power in the Kings Sergeants and bloody Emissaries to waste and destroy the people of God, must be a lawfull power given of <hi>God:</hi> for a lawfull power it must be, if it commeth from God, whether it be from the <hi>King</hi> in his own person, or from his servants at his commandement, and by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put forth in acts, as the power of a bill of Divorce was a power from <hi>God,</hi> exempting either the husband from punishment before men, or freeing the servant, who at the husbands command, should write it, and put it in the hands of the woman. I cannot beleeve that <hi>God</hi> hath given a power, and that by Law, to one Man to command
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50873:91"/>
twenty thousand Cut-throats to kill and destroy all the Children of <hi>God,</hi> and that he hath commanded his Children to give their necks and heads to <hi>Babels sonnes</hi> without resistance. This I am sure is another matter then a Law for a bill of Divorce to one woman, maried by free election of a humorous and unconstant man. But sure I am, <hi>God</hi> gave no permissive law from heaven, like the law of Divorce, for the hardnesse of the heart, not of the Iewes only, but also of the whole Christian and Heathen Kingdomes under a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; that one Emperour may, by such a Law of God, as the Law of Divorce, kill, by bloody Cut-throats, such as the Irish Rebels are, all the Nations that call on Gods name, men, women, and sucking infants. And if Providence impede the Catholike issue, and dry up the seas of Blood, it is good: but <hi>God</hi> hath given a law, such as the law of Divorce, to the King, whereby he, and all his, may without resistance, by a legall power given of <hi>God,</hi> who giveth Kings to be fathers, nurses, protectors, guides, yea the breath of nostrils of his <hi>Church,</hi> as speciall mercies and blessings to his people, he may (I say) by a law of <hi>God,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.9, 11. cut off Nations, as that Lyon of the world, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did.

King by office is obliged to expend his life for the safety of the people of God; he is obliged to fight the Lords battels for them, to goe betwixt the Flock and death, as <hi>Paul</hi> was willing to be spent for the <hi>Church.</hi> It may be objected, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> gave himselfe a Ransome for his <hi>Church,</hi> and his life for the life of the World, and was a gift given to the world, Ioh. 3.16. &amp; 4.10. and he was a meane to save us: And so what arguments we have before produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to prove that the King must be inferior to the people, because he is a ransome, a meane, a gift; are not concludent. I answer:<note place="margin">A meane is considered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplicatively and formally as a meane, and materially, as the thing which is the mean: in this latter sense the mean may be of more worth then the end, but not so in the former sense.</note> Consider a meane reduplicatively, and <hi>formaliter,</hi> as a meane, and secondly, as a meane materially, that is, the thing which is a meane. 2. Consider that which is only a mean, and ransome, and gift, and no more; and that which, beside that it is a meane, is of a higher nature also. So Christ formally as a meane, giving, 1. his temporall life; 2. for a time; 3. according to the flesh: For, 1. the eternall life; 2. of all the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> to be glorified eternally; 3. not his blessed Godhead and glorie, which, as God, he had with the Father from eternitie. In that respect <hi>Christ</hi> hath the relation of a servant, ransome, gift, and some inferioritie in comparison of the <hi>Church of God:</hi> and his Fathers glory, as a meane, is inferior to the end, but <hi>Christ</hi> materially, <hi>in concreto: Christ</hi> is not only a meane to save his <hi>Church,</hi> but as <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A meane may be considered as a meane on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as more then a meane.</note> (in which consideration he was the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Lord of life) he was more then a meane, even the author, efficient and Creator of heaven and earth: and so there is no ground to say that he is inferiour to the <hi>Church</hi>; but the absolute head, King, the chiefe of ten thousand, more in excellencie and worth then ten thousand millions of possible worlds of men and Angels. But such a consideration cannot befall any mortall <hi>King</hi>; because, consider the King materially as a mortall man, he must be inferior to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> for he is but one, and so of lesse worth then the whole Church, as the thumbe, though the strongest of the fingers, yet it is inferior to the hand, and far more to the whole body, as any part is inferior to the whole. 2. Consider the King <hi>reduplicative,</hi> and formally as King, and by the officiall relation he hath, he is no more then but a Royall servant, an officiall meane, tending, <hi>ex officio,</hi> to this end, to preserve the people, to rule and governe them; and a gift of God, given, by vertue of his office, to rule the people of God: and so any way inferiour to the people.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is false that the people doth, or can by the Law of nature resigne their whole liberty in the hand of a King, 1. they cannot resigne to others that which they have not in themselves, <hi>Nemo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test dare quod non habet,</hi> but the people hath not an absolute power in themselves to destroy themselves, or to exercise those tyrannous acts spoken of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, &amp;c. for neither God, nor Natures Law hath given any such power. 2. He who constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himselfe a slave is supposed to be compelled to that unnaturall fact of alienation of that liberty, which he hath from his Maker, from the wombe, by violence, constraint, or extreame necessity, and so is inferiour to all free men, but the people doth not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves slaves when they constitute a <hi>King</hi> over themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God giving to a people a <hi>King,</hi> the best and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest Governour on earth, giveth a blessing and speciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four, <hi>Esay</hi> 1.26. <hi>Hosea</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Esay</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>Ps.</hi> 79.70, 71, 72. but to lay upon his people the state of slaverie, in which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their whole libertie, is a curse of <hi>God,</hi> Gen. 9.25.

If the servant give his libertie to his master, <hi>ergo,</hi> he had that libertie in him; and in that act, libertie must be in a more excellent way in the servant, as in the Fountaine, then it is in the master: and so this libertie must be purer in the people then in the King: and therefore in that, both the servant is above the master, and the People worthier then the King: and when the people give themselves conditionally and Covenant-wise to the <hi>King,</hi> as to a Publique servant, and Patron, and Tutour, as the <hi>Governour of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> out of his humour, gave himselfe to <hi>King Edward</hi>; there is even here a note of superioritie; Every giver of a benefit, as a giver, is superior to him to whom the gift is given; though after the servant hath given away his gift of libertie, by which he was superiour, he cannot be a superior, because by his gift he hath made himselfe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. 3. The People constituteth a <hi>King</hi> above themselves, I distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, <hi>supra se, above</hi> themselves, according to the fountaine power of Royaltie, that is false; for the fountaine-power remaineth most eminently in the people, 1. because they give it to the King, <hi>ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum recipientis,</hi> and with limitations, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is unlimited in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bounded and limited in the King, and so lesse in the King then in the people. 2. If the <hi>King</hi> turne distracted, and an <hi>ill spirit from the Lord come upon Saul,</hi> so as reason be taken from a <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> it is certaine the people may put Curators and Tutors over him, who hath the Royall power. 3. If the King be absent, and taken captive, the People may give the <hi>Royall power</hi> to one, or to some few to exercise it as <hi>custodes regni.</hi> And 4. if he die, and the Crown goe by election, they may create another with more or lesse power: all which evinceth, that they never constituted over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a <hi>King,</hi> in regard of <hi>fountaine-power</hi>; for if they give away the fountaine, as a slave selleth his libertie, they could not make use of it. Indeed they set a King above them, <hi>quoad potestatem legum executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi> in regard of a power of executing lawes and actuall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                  <hi>The end is worthier then the meane lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the end, because it is ordained for the end. These meanes,</hi> saith he, <hi>which referre their whole nature to the end, and have all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie from the end, and have excellencie from no other thing but from the end, are lesse excellent then the end; that is true, such an end as medicine is for health.</hi> And <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> l. 1. c. 3. n. 8. <hi>Those meanes which are only for the end, &amp; for the good of the end, and are not for their own good, also are of lesse excellencie, and inferior to the end. But so the assumption is false. But those meanes which beside their relation to the end, have an excellencie of nature in themselves, are not alwayes infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the end. The Disciple, as he is instituted, is inferior to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; but as he is the sonne of a Prince, he is above the Master. But by this reason, the shepherd should be inferior to bruit beasts, to sheep. And the master of the familie is for the familie, and referreth all that he hath for the entertaining of the familie: but it followeth not therefore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie is above him. The forme is for the action, therefore the action is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50873:97"/>
more excellent then the forme, and an accident then the subject or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> saith; <hi>Every government is not for the good of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but some for its own good, as the government of a master over the servant, and the husband over the wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I take the answer thus: <hi>Those who are meere meanes, and only meanes referred to the end, they are inferior to the end: but the King as King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King; as King, a meane and inferior to the people.</note> 
                  <hi>hath all his officiall and relative goodnesse in the world, as relative to the end.</hi> All that you can imagine to be in a <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> is all relative to the safety and good of the people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He is a minister for thy good.</hi> He should not, as <hi>King,</hi> make himselfe, or his own gaine and honour, his end. I grant, the <hi>King,</hi> as a man, shall dye as another man, and so he may secondarily intend his own good; and what excellencie he hath as a man, is the excellencie of one mortall man, and cannot make him amount in dignitie, and in the absolute consideration of the excellencie of a man, to be above many men and a whole Kingdome: for the moe good things there be, the better they are, so the good things be multiplicable, as a hundred men are better then one: Otherwise, if the good be such as cannot be multiplied,<note place="margin">The King both as a man, and as a King inferior to the people.</note> as <hi>one God,</hi> the multiplication maketh them worse, as <hi>many Gods</hi> are inferiour to <hi>one God.</hi> Now if <hi>Royalists</hi> can shew us any more in the <hi>King</hi> then these two, we shall be obliged to them; and in both, he is inferiour to the whole.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prelate</hi> and his followers would have the Maxime to lose credit; for then (say they) <hi>the shepherd should be inferior to the sheep:</hi> But in this the <hi>Maxime</hi> faileth indeed. 1. Because the shepherd is a reasonable man, and the sheep bruit beasts, and so must be excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all the flocks of the world. Now as he is a reasonable man, he is not a shepherd, nor in that relation referred to the sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ep and their preservation, as a mean to the end; but he is a shepherd by accident, for the unrulinesse of the creatures, for mans sinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themselves from that naturall dominion that man had over the creatures, before the fall of man: in that relation of a meane to the end, and so by accident, is this officiall relation put on him; and according to that officiall relation, and by accident, man is put to be a servant to the bruitish creature, and a meane to so base an end. But all this proveth him, through mans sinne, and by accident, to be under the officiall relation of a meane, to baser creatures then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as to the end, but not as a reasonable man. But the King, as King, is an officiall and Royall meane to this end, that the people

may <hi>lead a godly and peaceable life under him.</hi> And this <hi>officiall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> being an accident, is of lesse worth then the whole people, as they are to be governed. And I grant, the <hi>Kings</hi> sonne, in relation to blood and birth, is more excellent then his Teachers: but as he is taught, he is inferiour to his Teacher: but in both considerations the <hi>King</hi> is inferior to the people; for though he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the people, and so have an <hi>executive power</hi> of law above them, yet have they a <hi>fountain power</hi> above him, because they made him King, and in Gods intention he is given as King for their good, according to that, <hi>Thou shalt feed my people Israel:</hi> &amp; that, <hi>I gave him for a leader of my people.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a begging of the question: for it is denyed that the people can absolutely make away their whole power to the King: It dependeth on the people that they be not destroyed. They give to the King a politique power for their own safetie, and they keepe a naturall power to themselves, which they must conserve, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give away; and they doe not breake their covenant, when they put in act that naturall power to conserve themselves; for though the people should give away that power, and sweare, though the King should kill them all, they should not resist, nor defend their own lives; yet that being an oath against the sixth Command, which enjoyneth naturall selfe-preservation, it should not oblige the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; for it should be intrinsecally sinfull; and it's all one to sweare to non-self-preservation, as to sweare to selfe-murther.</p>

                  <hi>That which maketh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such, is farre more such it selfe; if the people give Royall Power to the King, then farre more is the Royall Power in the people.

                  <hi>That which maketh another such, it is it selfe more such. It is true,</hi> De principio formali effectivo (<hi>as I learned in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity) of such an Agent as is formally such in it selfe, as is the effect produced. Next, it is such as is effective and productive of it selfe, as when fire heateth cold water, so the quality must be formally inherent in the Agent, as Wine maketh drunke, it followeth not, Wine is more drunke because Drunkennesse is not inherent in the Wine, nor is it capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of drunkennesse; and therefore</hi> Aristotle <hi>qualifieth the Maxime with this,</hi> Quod efficit tale est magis tale, modo utrique insit. <hi>And it holdeth not in Agents, who operate by donation, if the right of the King be transferred from the people to the King. The donation devest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people totally of it, except the King have it by way of loane, which to my thinking, never yet any spoke— Soveraignty never was, never can be in the Community; Soveraignty hath power of life and death, which none hath over himselfe, and the community conceived without government, all as equall, endowed with Natures and native liberty, of that community can have no power over the life of another. And so the Argument may be turned home, if the people be not</hi> tales, <hi>such by nature (as hath formally Royall power, he should say) they cannot give the King Royall Power. Also none hath power of life and death either eminenter or formally, the people either singly or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively have not power over their owne life, much lesse over their neighbours.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Prelate would make the maxime true of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cause, and this he learned in the University of St. <hi>Andrewes,</hi>

                  <hi>ergo</hi> whitenesse is more white by the Prelates learning; never such thing was taught in that learned University. 2. <hi>Principium formale effectivum</hi> is as good Logick, as <hi>principium effectivum materiale, formale, finale.</hi> The Prelate is in his acuracy of Logick now, he yet maketh the causality of the formall cause all one with the causality of the efficient, but he is weake in his Logicks. 3. He confoundeth a <hi>cause equivocall,</hi> and a <hi>cause univocall,</hi> and in that case the <hi>Maxime</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not. Nor is it necessary to make true the maxime, that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be inherent in the cause, the same way. For a City maketh a <hi>Major,</hi> but to be a <hi>Major</hi> is one way in the City, and another way in him who is created <hi>Major</hi>; and the Prelates <hi>Maxime</hi> would helpe him, if we reasoned thus: <hi>The people maketh the King,</hi> ergo <hi>the people is more a King, and more formally a Soveraigne then the King.</hi> But that is no more our Argument, then the simile that <hi>Maxwell</hi> used, as neere heart and mouth both. Wine maketh drunk the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, <hi>ergo</hi> Wine is more drunk. But we reason this, the Fountaine-power of making six Kings is in the people, <hi>ergo</hi> there is more fountain-power of Royalty in the people then in any one King; for we read that <hi>Israel</hi> made <hi>Saul King,</hi> and made <hi>David King,</hi> and made <hi>Abimelech King</hi>; but never that <hi>King Saul</hi> made another <hi>King,</hi> or that an earthly <hi>King</hi> made another <hi>Absolute King.</hi> 4. The Prelate will have the Maxime false, <hi>where the Agent worketh by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> which yet holdeth true by his owne grant, c. 9. pag. 98. The <hi>King</hi> giveth power to a Deputy, <hi>ergo</hi> there is more power in the King. 5. He supposeth that which is the Basis and foundation of all the question, that people devesteth themselves totally of their <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine power,</hi> which is most false. 6. <hi>Either they must devest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves totally</hi> (saith he) <hi>of their power, or the</hi> King <hi>hath power from the people, by way of loane, which to my thinking never any yet spake.</hi> But the <hi>P. Prelates</hi> thinking is short, and no rule to Divines and Lawyers, for to the thinking of the learnedst Jurists <hi>this power of the King is but fiduciary,</hi> and that is (whether the Prelate thinke it, or thinke it not) a sort of power by trust, pawn'd or loane. <hi>Rex di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector Regni, non proprietarius,</hi>

Prelate.<note place="margin">Soveraigntie how in the Communitie, how not.</note>) Truly it neither is, nor can be, more then ten, or a thousand, or a thousand thousands, or a whole Kingdome can be one man; for Soveraigntie is the abstract, the Soveraigne is the concrete: Many cannot be one <hi>King</hi> or one <hi>Soveraigne:</hi> a Soveraigne must be essentially one; and a multitude cannot be one: but what then? may not the Soveraigne power be <hi>eminently, fontaliter; originally</hi> and <hi>radically</hi> in the people? I thinke it may, and must be. A <hi>King</hi> is not an under-Iudge, he is not a Lord of Councell or Session formally, because he is more: The people is not <hi>King</hi> formally, because the people is eminently more then the <hi>King</hi>; for they make <hi>David</hi> King, and <hi>Saul</hi> King. And the power to make a Lord of Councell and Session, is in the <hi>King</hi> (say <hi>Royalists.</hi>) 8. <hi>A Communitie hath not power of life and death. A King hath power of life and death,</hi> (saith the <hi>Prelate</hi>) What then? <hi>ergo,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie is not <hi>King.</hi> I grant all. But (poore man!) <hi>Ergo,</hi> the power of making a King, who hath power of life and death, is not in the people. It is like Prelates logick. <hi>Samuel</hi> is not a King; <hi>ergo,</hi> he cannot make <hi>David</hi> a King. It followeth not, by the Prelates ground.<note place="margin">Power of life and death, how in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie.</note> So the <hi>King</hi> is not an in inferiour Iudge: What? <hi>ergo,</hi> he cannot make an inferiour Iudge. 9. The power of life and death is <hi>eminently</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi> in the people, collectively taken, though not formally. And though no man can take away his own life, or hath power over his own life formally; yet a man, and a body of men hath power over their own lives, <hi>radically</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi>; in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50873:100"/>
respect they may render themselves to a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and to Lawes, which if they violate, they must be in hazard of their lives, and so they virtually have power of their own lives, by putting them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of good lawes for the peace and safety of the whole. 10. This is a weake consequence: None hath power of his owne life, <hi>Ergo,</hi> far lesse of his neighbours (saith the Prelate.) I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the consequence. The King hath not power of his own life, that is, according to the Prelates mind, he can neither by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor by any Civill law. kill himselfe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King hath far lesse power to kill another. It followeth not: for the Iudge hath more power over his neighbours life, then over his own. 11. But, saith the P. Prelate, <hi>The Communitie conceived without government,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it selfe, wanting Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, is a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique body, and how.</note> 
                  <hi>all as equall, endowed with natures and native libertie, hath no power of life and death,</hi> because all are borne free, and so none is borne with dominion and power over his neighbours life. Yea but so, Mr. <hi>P. Prelate,</hi> a King considered without government, and as born a free man, hath not power of any mans life, more then a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie hath: for <hi>King</hi> and Begger are borne both alike free. But a Communitie in this consideration, as they come from the wombe, have no Politique consideration at all. If you consider them as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all policie, you cannot consider them as invested with policie: yea if you consider them so as they are by nature, voyd of all poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, they cannot so much as adde their after-consent and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to such a man to be their <hi>King,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> immediately from heaven maketh a <hi>King</hi>: for to adde such an after-consent, is an act of government. Now as they are conceived to want all government, they cannot performe any act of government. And this is as much against himselfe, as against us.</p>

               <head>QUEST. XX. Whether or no inferiour Judges be univocally and essentially Judges, and the immediate Vicars of God, no lesse then the King, or if they be onely the Deputies and Vicars of the King?</head>
               <p>IT is certain that in one and the same Kingdom, the power of the King is more in extension, then the power of any inferiour Iudge: but if these powers of the King, and the inferiour Iudges differ <hi>intensivè</hi> and in <hi>spece,</hi> and nature, is the question, though it be not all the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Assert.</hi> Inferiour Iudges are no lesse essentially Iudges, and the immediate Vicars of God, then the King.<note place="margin">Inferiour Iudges no lesse Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Vicars then the King.</note> 1. These who judge in the room of God, and exercise the judgement of God, are essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iudges, and the Deputies of God, as well as the King: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Iudges are such. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The proposition is clear, the formall reason, why the King is univocally and essentially a Iudge is, because the Kings throne is the Lords throne, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.23. And <hi>Solomon sate on the throne of the Lord, as King, instead of David his father,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.13. It is called <hi>Davids</hi> throne, because the King is the Deputy of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and the judgement is the Lords: I prove the assumption. Inferiour Iudges appointed by King <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> have this place, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.6. <hi>The King said to the Iudges, Take heed what ye do, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord:</hi> then they were Deputies in the place of the Lord, and not the Kings Deputies in the formall and officiall acts of judging. 7. <hi>Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, or taking of gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence I argue, If the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in this good <hi>King,</hi> forbid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judges <hi>wresting of judgement, respecting of persons, and taking of gifts,</hi> because the <hi>judgement is the Lords</hi>; and if the <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self were on the Bench, he would not respect persons, nor take gifts; then he presumeth, that inferiour Iudges are in the stead and place of <hi>Jehovah</hi>: and that when these inferiour Iudges should take gifts, they make (as it were) the Lord, whose place they represent, to take gifts, and to do iniquitie, and to respect persons: but that the holy Lord cannot do. 2. If the inferiour Iudges in the act of judging, were the Vicars, and Deputies of King <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> he would have said, <hi>Judge righteous judgement; Why? For the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50873:102"/>

The <hi>Iudges</hi> were raised up in an extraordinary manner, out of any Tribe, to defend the people, and vindicate their libertie, <hi>God</hi> remaining their <hi>King</hi>: the <hi>King</hi> by the Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was tyed, after <hi>Saul,</hi> to the Royall tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> till the Messiahs comming. God tooke his own blessed libertie to set up a succession in the ten tribes. 2. The Iudges were not by succession from father to sonne: the Kings were, as I conceive, for the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call eternitie of the Messiahs throne, presignified to stand from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation. 3. Whether the Iudges were appointed by the election of the people, or no, some doubt, because <hi>Iepthah</hi> was so made Iudge: but I thinke it was not a law in Israel that it should be so: but the first mould of a King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. is by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that God gave power of domineering, that is, of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing, to a King, so as he cannot be resisted, which he gave not to a Iudge, I thinke no Scripture can make good: For by what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can Royalists warrant to us that the people might rise in armes to defend themselves against <hi>Moses, Gideon, Eli, Samuel,</hi> and other Iudges, if they should have tyrannized over the people: and that it is unlawfull to resist the most Tyrannous King in Israel and Iudah?
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50873:106"/>
Yet <hi>Barclay</hi> and others must say this, if they be true to that principle of Tyranny, That the <hi>jus Regis,</hi> the law or manner of the King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.9, 11. &amp; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.25, doth essentially difference betwixt the <hi>Kings of Israel,</hi> and <hi>the Iudges of Israel</hi>: but we thinke <hi>God</hi> gave never any power of Tyranny to either Iudge or King of Israel; and domination in that sense was by <hi>God</hi> given to none of them. 2. <hi>Arnisaeus</hi> hath as little for him, to say the inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate may be resisted, because we may appeale from him: but the <hi>King</hi> cannot be resisted, <hi>quia sanctitas Majestatis id non permittit,</hi> the sanctitie of Royall majestie will not permit us to resist the King. <hi>Ans.</hi> That is not <hi>Pauls</hi> argument, to prove it unlawfull to resist <hi>Kings,</hi> as <hi>Kings,</hi> and doing their office, because of the sanctitie of their Majestie, that is, as the man intendeth, because of the supreme absolute and illimited power that God hath given him. But this is a begging of the question, and all one as to say, <hi>the King may not be resisted, because he may not be resisted:</hi> for sanctitie of Majestie, if we beleeve <hi>Royalists,</hi> includeth essentially an absolute supremacie of power, whereby they are above the reach of all thrones, lawes, powers, or resistance on Earth.

And first that the Kings absolute Will maketh not inferiour Iudges, is cleare, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Moses</hi> might not follow his owne will in making inferiour Iudges whom he pleased: <hi>God</hi> tyed him to a Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v. 13. that he should <hi>take wise men, known amongst the people, and fearing God, and hating covetousnesse.</hi> And these qualifications were not from <hi>Moses,</hi> but from <hi>God</hi>; and no lesse immediatly from <hi>God</hi> then the inward qualification of a King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and therefore it is not Gods Law that the King may make inferiour Iudges only, <hi>Durante beneplacito,</hi> during his absolute will; for if these Divine qualifications remaine in the seventy Elders, <hi>Moses</hi> at his will could not remove them from their places. 2. That the King can make heritable Iudges more then he can communicate faculties and parts of judging, I doubt, <hi>riches are of fathers,</hi> but not promotion, which is from God,<note place="margin">No heritable Iudges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Word.</note> and neither from the East, nor the West. That our Nobles are borne Lords of Parliament, and Iudges by blood, is a positive Law. 3. It seemeth to me from <hi>Esay</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. that the inferiour Iudge is made by consent of the people, nor can it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a wronging of the King, that all cities and Burroughs of <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:50873:107"/>
and <hi>England,</hi> have power to choose their owne <hi>Provests, Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Majors.</hi> 4. If it be warranted by <hi>God,</hi> that the lawfull Call of <hi>God</hi> to the Throne, be the election of the people, the call of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iudges must also be from the people, mediatly or immediatly: So I see no ground to say that, the inferiour Iudge is the Kings Vicegerent, or that he is in respect of the King, or in relation to supreme Authority, only a private man.</p>
               <p n="12">12. These Iudges cannot but be univocally and essentially Iudges, no lesse then the King, without which in a Kingdome Iustice is Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically unpossible: and <hi>Anarchie</hi> and violence and confusion must follow, if they be wanting in the Kingdome.

               <p>Now this Argument is more considerable, that without inferiour Iudges, though there be a King in a Kingdome, Iustice and safety are unpossible, and if there be inferiour Iudges, though there be no King, as in <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> and when the King is dead, and another not Crowned, or the King is Minor, or absent, or a captive in the enemies Land, yet justice is possible, and the Kingdome preserved; the Medium of the Argument is grounded upon Gods Word, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.14, 15. when <hi>Moses</hi> is unable alone to judge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>seventy Elders</hi> re-joyned with him,<note place="margin">Inferiour Iudges more necessary in a large Kingdom then the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The end naturall of Iudges hath been indigence and weaknesse, because men could not in a society defend themselves from violence, therefore by the light of nature they gave their power to one, or more, and made a Iudge, or Iudges to obtaine the end of selfe preservation. But <hi>Nature</hi> useth the most efficacious meanes to obtaine its end, but in a great society and Kingdome the end is more easily attained by many Governours, then by one only; for where there is but one, he cannot minister Iustice to all, and the farther that the children are removed from their father and tutor, they are the nearer to violence and unjustice.

Because when <hi>Moses,</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> rule, hath appointed seventie men to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Iudges in the Land, <hi>Moses</hi> upon his sole pleasure and will, hath not power to restraine them in the exercise of judgment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them of <hi>God:</hi>

It is objected, <hi>That the Estates are not Iudges ordinary and habitually, but only Iudges at some certaine occasions, when the King, for cogent and weighty causes, calleth them, and calleth them not to judge, but to give him advise and counsell how to judge. Ans.</hi> 1. They are no lesse Iudges habitually then the King, when the common affaires of the whole Kingdome necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth these Publique Watchmen to come together: for even the King
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50873:109"/>
judgeth not actually, but upon occasion. 2. This is to beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to say that the Estates are not Iudges, but when the King cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, at such and such occasions: for the Elders, Princes and Heads of families and Tribes, were Iudges ordinarie, because they made the King. And 2. the Kingdome, by <hi>God,</hi> yea, and <hi>Church,</hi> Iustice and Religion, so far as they concerne the whole Kingdome, are committed not to the keeping of the King only, but to all the <hi>Iudges, Elders, and Princes of the Land:</hi> And they are rebuked as <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening wolves, lyons, oppressors,</hi> Ezech. 22.27.

But when <hi>David, Salomon, Asa, Ezekiah, Iehosaphat, Achas</hi> convened Parliaments, they convened Parliaments as <hi>Kings,</hi> and so <hi>Ex debito &amp; virtute officii,</hi> out of debt and Royall Obligation, and if the <hi>King</hi> as the <hi>King,</hi> be <hi>Lex animata, a breathing and living Law,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King</hi> must doe by obligation of Law, what he doth as <hi>King,</hi> and not from spontaneous and Arbitrary grace. 2. If the Scripture holds forth to us a <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Jsrael,</hi> and two <hi>Princés and Elders</hi> who made the <hi>King,</hi> and had power of life and death, as we have seene; then is there in Israel <hi>Monarchy</hi> tempered with <hi>Aristocracy</hi>; and if there were Elders and Rulers in every City, as the Scripture saith, here was also <hi>Aristocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy.</hi> And for the warrant of the power of the Estates I appeale to Iurists, and to approved Authors.

               <p>Obj. <hi>The King after a more noble way representeth the people, then the Estates doth; for the Princes and Commissioners of Parliament have all their power from the people, and the peoples power is concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated in the King.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Estates taken collectively doe represent the people both in respect of Office, and of persons, because they stand Iudges for them; for many represent many, <hi>ratione numeri &amp; officii,</hi> better then one doeth. The <hi>King</hi> doth unproperly represent the people,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50873:111"/>
though the power for actuall execution of Lawes, be more in the King, yet a legislative power is more in the Estates. Neither will it follow, that if the Estates of a Kingdome doe any thing but counsell a King, they must then command him; for a legall and judiciall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice hath influence in the effect to make it a Law, not on the Kings Will, to cause him give the being of a Law to that, which without his Will is no Law, for this supponeth that he is only Iudge.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> What power the people reserveth, they reserve it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>in unitate,</hi> as united in a Parliament; and therefore what they doe out of a Parliament is tumultous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I deny the consequence, they reserve the power of selfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation out of a Parliament, and a power of convening in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that effect, that they may by Common Counsell defend themselves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Here is another absolute power disclaimed to be in the King, he hath not such a masterly and absolute liberty as the Turke hath. Why? <hi>Iohn P. P.</hi> in such a tender and high point as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth soule and body of subjects in three Christian Kingdomes, you should have taught us 1. What bonds and fetters any covenant or paction betwixt the King and people layeth upon the <hi>King,</hi> why he hath not as <hi>King</hi> the power of the great <hi>Turke.</hi> I will tell you. The <hi>Great Turke</hi> may command any of his subjects to leape into a mountaine of fire, and burne himselfe quick, in conscience of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Law. And what if the subject disobey the <hi>Great Turk</hi>? if the <hi>Great Turke</hi> be a lawfull Prince, as you will not deny. And if the <hi>King of Spaine</hi> should command forraine conquered slaves to doe the like. By your Doctrine neither the one, nor the other were obliged to resist by violence,<note place="margin">No resisting of the most Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Tyran by the Royalists way.</note> but to pray, or fly, which both were to speake to stones, and were like the man, who in case of ship-wrack, made his devotion of praying to the waves of the sea, not to enter the place of his bed and drowne him. But a Christian <hi>King</hi> hath not this power; Why, and a Christian <hi>King</hi> (by Royalists doctrine) hath a greater power then the Turke (if greater can be) he hath power to command his subjects to cast themselves into Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire; that is, to presse on them a service wherein it is written. <hi>(Adore the worke of mens hands in the place of the living God)</hi> and this is worse then the Turkes commandement of bodily burning quick. And what is left to the Christian Subjects, in this case, is the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50873:112"/>
very same, and no other then is left to the Turkish and forraigne Spanish subject; Either flee, or make prayers: There is no more left to us. 2. Many <hi>Royalists</hi> maintaine, that <hi>England</hi> is a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Nation. Why then, see what power, by law of Conquest,<note place="margin">An absolute King more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute then the Great Turke, by Royalists way.</note> the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath over his slaves, the same must the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have over his subjects. For, to <hi>Royalists,</hi> a title by Conquest to a Crown, is as lawfull as a title by birth or election. For lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in relation to Gods law, is placed in an indivisible point, if we regard the essence of lawfulnesse: And therefore there is nothing left to <hi>England,</hi> but that all Protestants who take the oath of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant King, to defend the true Protestant Religion, should, after prayers, conveyed to the King through the fingers of Prelates and Papists; leave the Kingdome empty to <hi>Papists, Prelates</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. All power restrained,<note place="margin">No law at all, by Royalists way, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede a King from a super-inundation of overflowing Tyranny.</note> that it cannot arise from ten degrees to foureteen, from the Kingly power of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.9, 11. to the Kingly power of the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> to fourteen; 1. must either be restrained by Gods law; 2. or by Mans law; or 3. by the innate goodnes and grace of the Prince; or 4. by the providence of God. A restraint from Gods law is vaine: for it is no question between us and <hi>Royalists,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> hath laid a morall restraint on <hi>Kings,</hi> and all men, that they have not morall power to sinne against <hi>God.</hi> 2. Is the restraint laid on by mans law? What law of man? 1. The <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alist</hi> saith, 1. The <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> is above all law of man. Then (say I) no law of man can hinder the Kings power of ten, to arise to the <hi>Turkish</hi> power of foureteen. 2. All law of man, as it is mans law, is seconded either with Ecclesiasticall and spirituall coaction, such as Excommunication;, or with Civill and temporall coaction, such as is the Sword, if it be violated. But <hi>Royalists</hi> deny, that either the sword of the Church in Excommunication, or the Civill sword, should be drawn against the <hi>King.</hi> 3. This law of man should be produced by this profound Iurist, the <hi>P. Prelate,</hi> who mocketh at all the Statists and Lawyers of <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is not a covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> at his Coronation: for though there were any such covenant, yet the breach of it doth binde before <hi>God,</hi> but not before man: nor can I see, or any man else, how a law of man can lay a restraint on the Kings power of two degrees, to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell it within a Law, more then on a power of ten, or fourteene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. If the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the lawfull Soveraigne of those <hi>over-European</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:50873:113"/>
people, (as <hi>Royalists</hi> say) have a power of foureteene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees over those conquered Subjects, as a <hi>King</hi>; I see not how he hath not the like power over his own Subjects of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to wit, even of Foureteen: for what agreeth to a <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> (and <hi>Kingly</hi> power from God he hath as <hi>King</hi>) he hath it in relation to all Subjects, except it be taken from him in relation to some Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cts, and given by some law of God; or in relation to some other Subjects. Now, no man can produce any such law. 4. The nature of the goodnesse and grace of the Prince, cannot lay bonds on the <hi>King,</hi> to cancell his power, that he should not usurpe the power of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> toward his <hi>over-Europeans.</hi> 1. <hi>Royalists</hi> plead for a power due to the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> and that from God; such as <hi>Saul</hi> had, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.9, 11. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.25. But this power should be a power of grace and goodnesse in the King, <hi>as a good man</hi>; not in the King, <hi>as a King,</hi> and due to him by law: And so the <hi>King</hi> should have his Legall power from God, to be a Tyrant. But if he were not a Tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but should lay limits on his own power, through the goodnesse of his own nature; No thankes to <hi>Royalists</hi> that he is not a Tyrant: For, <hi>actu primo,</hi> and as he is a <hi>King,</hi> (as they say) he is a Tyrant, having from God a Tyrannous power of ten degrees, as <hi>Saul</hi> had, 1 Sam. 8. and why not of foureteen degrees, as well as the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> or the <hi>King of Spaine?</hi> if he use it not, it is his own personall goodnesse, not his officiall and Royall power. 4. The rastraint of Providence laid by God upon any power to doe ill, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth only the exercise of the power not to breake forth in as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous acts as ever the <hi>King of Spaine,</hi> or the <hi>great Turke</hi> can exercise toward any. Yea, <hi>Providence</hi> layeth Physicall restraint, and possibly morall, sometimes, upon the exercise of that power that <hi>Devils,</hi> and the most wicked men of the world hath: but <hi>Royalists</hi> must shew us that Providence hath laid bounds on the <hi>Kings</hi> power, and made it fatherlie, and not masterly; so that if it the power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed bounds of fatherly power, and passe over to the dispoticall and masterly power, it may be resisted by the Subjects. But that they will not say. 4. This paternall and fatherly power that God hath given to Kings, as Royalists teach, <hi>it trencheth not upon the libertie of the Subjects, and propertie of their goods; but in, and by lawfull and just acts of Jurisdiction</hi> (saith the <hi>P. Prelate:</hi>) Well; Then it may trench upon the libertie of soule and body of the Subjects; but <hi>in, and by lawfull and just acts of of jurisdiction:</hi> But none are to judge
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50873:113"/>
of these acts of Iurisdiction, whether they be <hi>just</hi> or not <hi>just,</hi> but the <hi>King,</hi> the only Iudge of supreme and absolute authoritie and power. And if the <hi>King</hi> command the idolatrous service in the obtruded Service-booke, it is a lawfull and a just <hi>act of jurisdiction:</hi> For to <hi>Royalists,</hi> who make the Kings power absolute, all acts are so just to the Subject, though he command Idolatrie and Turcisme, that we are to suffer only, and not to resist. 5. The Prelate presumeth that Fatherly power is absolute: But so if a father murther his childe, he is not comptable to the Magistrate therefore; but being absolute over his children, only the Judge of the World, not any power on earth can punish him. 6. We have proved that the <hi>Kings</hi> power is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall or fatherly only, by analogie, and improperly. 7. What is this Prerogative Royall, we shall heare by and by, 8. There is no restraint on Earth, laid upon this fatherly power of the King, but Gods law, which is a morall restraint. If then the King challenge as great a power as the Turke hath, he o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be a power above law, such as none on earth may resist it; it is no matter whether it be above law of two degrees, or of twenty, even to the <hi>Great Turkes</hi> power.</p>

If all were innocent persons, and could doe no violence one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Law would rule all, and all men would put the Law in execution, <hi>agendo sponte,</hi> by doing right of their own accord; and there should be no need of a <hi>King</hi> to compell men to do right. But now, because men are, by nature, averse to good lawes, therefore there was need of a Ruler, who by office should reduce the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to practice: and so is the <hi>King</hi> the Law reduced in practice. 2. The Law is <hi>ratio five mens,</hi> the reason or minde, free from all perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of anger, lust, hatred, and cannot be tempted to ill; and the <hi>King,</hi> as a man, may be tempted by his own passions; and therefore as <hi>King,</hi> he commeth by office out of himselfe to reason and law; and so much as he hath of Law, so much of a <hi>King</hi>; and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest distance from Law and Reason, he is a Tyrant. 3. <hi>Abstracta concretis sunt puriora &amp; perfectiora.</hi> Iustice is perfecter then a just man, Whitenes perfecter then the white wall: so the neerer the <hi>King</hi> comes to a Law, for the which he is a <hi>King,</hi> the neerer to a <hi>King; Propter quod unumquodque tale, id ipsum magis tale.</hi> Therefore Kings throwing lawes to themselves, as men, whereas they should have conformed themselves to the Law, have erred. <hi>Cambyses</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because he loved his own sister, would have <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the brother with the sister, lawfull.

What ever Morall power is from God, the exercises of that power, and the acts thereof must be from God, and so these acts must be Morally good and just; for if the Morall power be of God, as the Author, so must the acts be.

That the major may be clear, It is evident to have a King, is a blessing of God, because to have no King is a judgement, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Every man doth what seemeth good in his own eyes, Judg.</hi> 18.1. and 19.1. and 21.25. 2.

war, at home or abroad. For the assumption, it is evident. An ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and Arbitrary power is a King-law, such as <hi>Royalists</hi> say God gave to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.9, 11. and 10.25. to play the Tyrant, and this power Arbitrary and unlimited above all Laws, is that which 1. Is given of God. 2. Distinguisheth essentially the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> from the Iudge, saith <hi>Barclay, Grotius, Arnisaeus.</hi> 3. A constitutive form of a King, therefore it must be <hi>actu primo</hi> a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and a blessing of God: but if God hath given any such power absolute to a King, as 1. His will must be a law, either to do or suffer all the Tyranny and cruelty of a <hi>Tyger, Leopard,</hi> or a <hi>Nero,</hi> and a <hi>Julian,</hi> then hath God given <hi>actu primo,</hi> a power to a King as King, to inslave the people and flock of God, redeemed by the blood of God, as the slaves among the Romans and Iews, who were so under their masters, as their bondage was a plague of God, and the lives of the people of God under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who compelled them to work in brick and clay. 2. Though he cut the throats of the people of God, as the Lionnesse Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did, and command an Army of souldiers to come and burn the Cities of the Land, and kill man, wife, and children; yet in so doing, he doth the part of a King, so as you cannot resist him as a man, and obey him as a King, but must give your necks to him, upon this ground, because this absolute power of his <hi>is ordained of God</hi>; and there is no power, even to kill, and destroy the innocent, but it is of God, so saith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. If we beleeve <hi>Court-Prophets,</hi> or rather <hi>Lying-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> who perswade the <hi>King of Britain,</hi> to make war against his three Dominions. Now it is clear, that the distinction of bound and free, continued in <hi>Israel</hi> even under the most tyrannous Kings, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.1. yea, even when the Iews were captives under <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus, Esther</hi> 7.4.

               <p n="2">2. A Prerogative Royall must be a power of doing good to the people, and grounded upon some reason or law: but this is but a branch of an ordinarie limited power, and no prerogative above or beside law. Yea, any power not grounded on a reason different from meere will or absolute pleasure, is an irrationall and brutish power; and therefore it may well be <hi>jus personae,</hi> the power of the man who is <hi>King</hi>; it cannot be <hi>jus coronae,</hi>

To dispute this question,<note place="margin">The question touching Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, vaine.</note> Whether such a Prerogative agree to any <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King</hi>; is to dispute whether <hi>God</hi> hath made all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Monarch, slaves, by their own consent: which is a vaine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. 2. Those who hold such a Prerogative, must say, the King is so absolute and illimited a <hi>God</hi> on earth, that either by law, or his sole pleasure beside law, he may regularly and rationally move all wheeles in Policie; and his uncontrolled will shall be the axeltree on which all the wheeles are turned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which is the garland and proper flower of the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> as he is absolute above his creatures, and not tyed to any law,<note place="margin">Prerogative Royall of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists, Gods due.</note> without himselfe, that regulateth his will; That must be given to no mortall man, or <hi>King,</hi> except we would communicate that which is <hi>Gods</hi> proper due, to a sinfull man; which must be idolatrie. But to doe Royall acts out of an absolute power above Law and Reason, is such a power as agreeth to <hi>God,</hi> as is evident in positive lawes, and in acts of Gods meere pleasure, where we see no reason with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Almightie, for the one side, rather than for the other; as Gods forbidding the <hi>eating of the tree of knowledge,</hi> maketh the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, sinne, and contrary to reason;<note place="margin">Acts founded upon the sole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleasure of the Agent, proper to God.</note> but there is no reason in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: for if <hi>God</hi> should command eating of that tree, not to eat, should be also sinne.

There is something which may be called a Prerogative by way of dispensation.<note place="margin">A threefold dispensation.</note> There is a threefold dispensation; one of power, another of justice, and a third of grace. A dispensation of power, is, when the will of the Law-giver maketh that act to be no sinne, which without that will would have been sinne: As if <hi>Gods</hi> commanding Will had not interveened, the <hi>Israelites</hi> borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eare-rings and jewels of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and not restoring them, had been a breach of the 8 Commandement: and in this sense no <hi>King</hi> hath a Prerogative to dispence with a Law.</p>

                     </gap>ustice, 3. of grace.</note>2. There is a dispensation of law and justice, not flowing from any Prerogative, but from the true intent of the Law. And thus the <hi>King,</hi> yea the inferiour Judge, is not to take the life of a man, whom the letter of the Law would condemne; because the Justice of the Law, is the intent and life of the Law: and where nothing is done against the intent of the Law, there is no breach of any Law.</p>
               <p>The Third is not unlike unto the Second, when the <hi>King</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Law by Grace:<note place="margin">A twofold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning of the Law by grace.</note> and this is twofold; 1.

Now this they call a power of Grace; but it is not a power of meere Grace.</p>
               <p>But, 1. Though Princes may doe some things of Grace, yet not of meere Grace: because, what <hi>Kings</hi> doe, as <hi>Kings,</hi> and by vertue

As for example: Some Kings, out of their pretended prerogative, have given foure pardons to one man, for foure murthers: Now this the <hi>King</hi> might have left undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne; But of meere grace he pardoned the murtherer, who killed foure men.

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50873:122"/>
their absolutenesse by the <hi>Chaldean Lawes</hi> was to command murther, Idolatry, <hi>Daniel</hi> 3.4, 5. and to make wicked Lawes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. v. 7, 8.

                  </gap>eares, and only to suffer? and was it against the Oath of God to defend themselves by Armes? I beleeve the Oath did not oblige to such absolute subjection, and though they had taken Armes in their owne lawfull defence, according to the Law of Nature, they had not broken the Oath of God. The Oath was not a tye to an absolute subjection of all and every one, either to worship Idols, or then to sly, or suffer death. Now the Service-booke commanded in the Kings absolute authority all <hi>Scotland</hi> to commit grosser Idolatry, in the intention of the work, if not in the intention of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then was in <hi>Babylon.</hi> (We read not that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> pressed the consciences of Gods people to Idolatry) or that all should either sly the Kingdome, and leave their inheritances to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> or then come under the mercy of the sword of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> by sea or land. 3. <hi>God</hi> may command against the Law of Nature; and <hi>Gods</hi> Commandement maketh subjection lawfull; so as men may not now, being under the Law of God, defend themselves. What then? <hi>Ergo</hi> we owe subjection to absolute Princes, and their power must be a lawfull power, it no waies is consequent. Gods Commandement by <hi>Ieremiah</hi> made the subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iudah lawfull, and without that Commandement they might have taken Armes against the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as they did against the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and Gods Commandement maketh the Oath law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. As suppone <hi>Ireland</hi> would all rise in Armes, and come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> leading, then we were by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument not to resist. 4. It is denyed, that the power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, is Gods ordinance. And I deny utterly that <hi>Christ</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did sweare non-resistence absolute to the Roman Emperour.</p>

where the Monarches Will is a Law, and in this case some power must judge. Now in an absolute Monarchy all judgement resolveth in the Will of the Monarch, as the supreame Law: and if Ancestors have submitted themselves by Oath, there is no repeale, or redresment.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Who ever was the Author of this Treatise, he is a bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the defensive warres in <hi>England,</hi> for all the lawfulnesse of warres then must depend on this. 1. Whether <hi>England</hi> be a conquered Nation at the beginning? 2. If the Law-will of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Monarch,</hi> or a <hi>Nero</hi> be a reasonable Will, to which we must submit in suffering ill, I see not but we must submit to a reasonable will; if it be reasonable will in doing ill, no lesse then in suffering ill. 3. Absolute Will in absolute <hi>Monarches</hi> is no Iudge <hi>De jure,</hi> but an unlawfull and a usurping Iudge. 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19. Servants are not commanded simply to suffer (I can prove suffering formally not to fall under any Law of <hi>God,</hi> but only patient suffering. I except <hi>Christ,</hi> who was under a peculiar commandement to suffer.) But servants,<note place="margin">Servants are not by 1 Pet. 2.18, 19. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited of selfe-defence.</note> upon supposition that they are servants, and buffeted unjustly by their Masters, are by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter</hi> commanded, v. 20. <hi>to suffer patiently.</hi> But it doth not bind up a servants hand, to defend his owne life with weapons, if his Master invade him, without cause to kill him: otherwise if <hi>God</hi> call him to suffer, he is to suffer in the manner and way as <hi>Christ</hi> did, <hi>not reviling, not threatning.</hi> 4. To be a King and an absolute Master, to me are contradictory; a <hi>King</hi> essentially is a living Law. An absolute man is a creature, that they call a Tyrant, and no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>King</hi>; yet doe I not meane, that any that is a <hi>King,</hi> and usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth absolutenesse, leaveth off to be a King: but in so far as he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, he is no more a King, then in so far as he is a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> But further, the King of <hi>England</hi> saith in a Declaration.<note place="margin">Declar. at New Market, Mar. 9. 1641.</note> 1. <hi>The Law is the measure of the Kings Power.</hi> 2.

Certainly a King being a sinfull man, and having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint on his power, but reason, he may thinke it reason to allow rebells to kill, drowne, hang, torture to death an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Protestants, men, women, infants in the wombe, and sucking babes, as is clere in <hi>Pharaoh, Manasseh</hi> and other Princes.</p>

In case of open Tyranny, though the States had not time to conveen in Parliament, if he bring on his people an hoast of <hi>Spaniards</hi> or forraine <hi>Rebells,</hi> his owne conscience is above him, and the conscience of the people farre more, called <hi>conscientia terrae,</hi> may judge him in so farre, as they may rise up and defend themselves.</p>

To weaken the head, is to distemper the whole body, if any good Prince or his Royall Antecessors be cheated of their sacred right by fraud or force, he may at his fittest opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, resume it.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Aristocracy</hi> is no lesse an ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> then Royalty, for <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. All in Authority are to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as Gods Vice-gerents, the Senate, the Consuls as well as the Emperour: And so one ordinance of God cannot weaken another, nor can any but by a lawlesse Animall say, <hi>Aristocracy bordereth with confusion</hi>; but he must say, Order and Light are sister Germanes to confusion and darknesse. 2, Though <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> a man voyd of <hi>God,</hi> were over-awed with his Nobles, and so could not help <hi>Ieremiah</hi>; it followeth not, that because Kings may not do this and this good, therefore they are to be invested with power to doe all ill: if they doe all the good that they have power to doe, they'l finde way to helpe the oppressed <hi>Jeremiahes:</hi> and because power to doe both good and evill is given by the Divell to our <hi>Scottish Witches,</hi> its a poore consequent, that the States should give to the King power absolute to be a Tyrant.<note place="margin">Princes are not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with power to all Tyranny, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they cannot do good, except they have also absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do evil.</note> 3. A State must give a King more power then ordinary, especially to execute Laws, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth singular wisdom, when a Prince cannot alwayes have his great Councell about with him to advise him. But, 1. That is power borrowed, and by loan, and not properly his own; and therefore, it is no sacriledge in the States, to resume what the King hath by a fiduciary Title, and borrowed from them. 2. This power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to do good, not evill. <hi>David</hi> had power over <hi>Joab,</hi> to punish him for his murther, but he executed it not upon carnall fears, and abused his power to kill innocent <hi>Vriah,</hi> which power neither God nor the States gave him. But how proveth he the States took power from <hi>David,</hi> or that <hi>Ioab</hi> took power from <hi>David,</hi> to put to death a murtherer, that I see not. 3.

                  <hi>P. Prelate. It is a poor shift to acknowledge no more for the Royall Prerogative, then the Municipall Law hath determined, as some smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers in the Law say. They cannot distinguish betwixt a Statute Declarative, and a Statute Constitutive: but the Statutes of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do declare onely, what is the Prerogative Royall, but do not constitute or make it, God Almightie hath by himself constituted it: It is laughter to say, the Decalogue was not a Law, till God wrote it.</hi>

In what Scripture hath God Almightie spoken of a fancied Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royall?</p>

God formeth Being, and morall Aptitude to the end in all Laws, to wit, the safetie of the people; and the Kings will is neither the measure, nor the cause of the goodnesse of things.</p>

His Will as King, or his Royall Will is reason, conscience, Law. 3. This Will is politickly present (when his person is absent) in all Parliaments, Courts, and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iudicatures. 4. The King as King cannot doe wrong or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to any. 5. Amongst the <hi>Romanes</hi> the name <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Tyrant</hi> were common to one thing. 1. Because <hi>de facto,</hi> some of their Kings were Tyrants, in respect of their Dominion, rather then Kings. 2. Because he who was a Tyrant <hi>De facto,</hi> should have been, and was a King too <hi>de jure.</hi> 6. It is not lawfull to either disobey or resist a King as a <hi>King,</hi> no more then it is lawfull to disobey a good Law. 7. What violence, what unjustice, and excesse of passion the <hi>King</hi> mixeth in, with his Acts of Government, are meerely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall to a <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King</hi>! for because men by their owne innate goodnesse will not, yea Morally cannot doe that which is lawfull, and just one to another, and doe naturally, since the fall of man,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50873:128"/>
violence one to another; therefore, if there had not been sin, there should not have been need of a <hi>King,</hi> more then there should have beene need of a Tutor to defend the child, whose father is not dead, or of a Physitian to cure sicknesse where there is health; for remove sinne, and there is neither death nor sicknesse, but because sinne is entered into the world, <hi>God</hi> devised, as a remedy of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and unjustice, a living, rationall breathing Law called a King,<note place="margin">The King as an erring man no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Anarchy.</note> a Iudge, a Father: now the aberrations, violence, and oppression of this thing which is the living, rationall, breathing Law is no <hi>Medium,</hi> no meane intended by <hi>God,</hi> and nature to remove vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. How shall violence remove violence? Therefore an unjust <hi>King,</hi> as unjust, is not that genuine ordinance of God, appointed to remove unjustice, but accidentall to a <hi>King.</hi> So we may resist the unjustice of the <hi>King,</hi> and not resist the <hi>King.</hi> 8, If then any cast off the nature of a King, and become habitually a Tyrant, in so farre he is not <hi>from God,</hi> nor any ordinance which <hi>God</hi> doth owne: If the Office of a Tyrant (to speake so) be contrary to a <hi>Kings</hi> Offices, it is not from <hi>God,</hi> and so neither is the power from <hi>God.</hi> 9. Yea Lawes (which are no lesse from <hi>God,</hi> then the Kings are) when they begin to be hurtfull, <hi>Cessant materialiter,</hi> they leave off to be Lawes; because they oblige <hi>Non secundum vim verborum, sed in vim sensus,</hi> not according to the force of words, but according to sense, l. <hi>Non figura literarum F. de actione &amp; obligatione, l. ita sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulatus.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a Court of necessity,<note place="margin">A Court of necessity, and a Court of Iustice.</note> no lesse then a Court of Justice; and 2. The fundamentall Lawes must then speake, and it is with the people in this extremity, as if they had no Ruler.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>But if the Law be doubtsome, as all humane, all Civill, all municipall Lawes may endure great dispute, the peremptory person exponing, the Law must be the supreame Iudge. This cannot be the people,</hi> ergo, <hi>it must be the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As the Scriptures in all fundamentalls are cleare,<note place="margin">Humane Laws not so obscure as Tyranny is legible.</note> and expone themselves, and <hi>Actu primo</hi> condemne Heresies, so all Lawes of men in their fundamentals, which are the Law of Nature, and of Nations are cleare.

If a King bring in upon his native subjects twenty thousand <hi>Turks</hi> armed, and the King
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50873:129"/>
lead them. It is evident, they come not to make a friendly visite to salute the Kingdom, and depart in peace: the people have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall throne of policie in their conscience to give warning, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially sentence against the King, as a Tyrant, and so by nature are to defend themselves: Where Tyranny is more obscure, and the thred small, that it escape the eye of men, the King keepeth possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I deny that Tyranny can be obscure long.</p>

A King may not, or cannot easily alter the frame of fundamentall Laws, he may make some actuall invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in some transient, and not fixed acts; and it is safer to bear these, then to raise a civill Warre of the Body, against the Head.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If the King as King, may alter any one wholesome Law, by that same reason he may alter all. 2. You give short wings to an Arbitrary Prince,<note place="margin">It is ridiculous to say, a King cannot be so void of reason, as to destroy his people.</note> if he cannot over flie all Laws to the subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fundamentalls of a State, if you make him as you do. 1. One who hath the sole Legislative power, who allanerly by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, maketh Laws, and his Parliament and Councell are onely to give him advice, which by Law he may as easily reject, as they can speak words to him. He may in one transient act (and it is but one) cancell all Laws made against idlolatry and Popery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, through bad Counsell, in all his Dominions; the Pope to be acknowledged as Christs Vicar, and all his doctrine to be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the <hi>Catholike true Religion.</hi> It is but one transient act to seal a pardon to the shedding of the blood of two hundred thousand, killed by Papists. 2. You make him a King, who may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in any case; and though he subvert all Fundamentall Laws, he is countable to God onely, his people have no remedy, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or flight.</p>

                  <hi>for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dissolution of the State, but onely a legall restraining power; and if such a restraining power be in the subjects, by reservation, then it must be expressed in the constitution of the Government, and in the Covenant betwixt the Monarch and his people: but such a condition is unlawfull, which will not have the Soveraign power secured, is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for King, and people; a seminary for seditions and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I understand not a difference betwixt <hi>forceable restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>legall restraining</hi>: For he must mean by (legall) mans Law,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50873:129"/>
because he saith, It is a Law in the Covenant betwixt the Monarch, and his people. Now if this be not forceable, and physicall,<note place="margin">If there be a civill restraint from mans Law, laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, it must be forceable.</note> it is onely Morall in the conscience of the King, and a Cypher, and a meer vanitie, for God, not the people putteth a restraint of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science on the King, that he may not oppresse his poor subjects; but he shall sin against God, that is a poor restraint: the goodnesse of the King a sinfull man inclined from the womb to all sin, and so to Tyranny, is no restraint. 2. There's no necessitie, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve be expressed in the Covenant between King, and people, more then in contract of marriage between a husband and a wife, beside her joynter; you should set down this clause in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, that if the husband attempt to kill the wife, or the wife the husband, in that case it shall be lawfull to either of them to part companies: For Doct. <hi>Ferne</hi> saith, <hi>That personall defence is lawfull in the people, if the Kings assault be</hi> 1. <hi>Suddain.</hi> 2. <hi>Without colour of Law.</hi> 3. <hi>Inevitable</hi>: Yet the reserve of this power of defence, is not necessarily to be expressed in the contract, betwixt King and people. Exigences of the Law of nature cannot be set down in positive Covenants, they are presupposed. 3. He saith, <hi>A reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of power, whereby soveraigntie is not secured, is unlawfull.</hi> Lend me this Argument: The giving away of a power of defence, and a making the King absolute, is unlawfull, because by it the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not secured;<note place="margin">Its more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, the people, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Church, be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, then one man.</note> but one man hath thereby the <hi>sword of God</hi> put in his hand, whereby <hi>ex officio,</hi> he may as King cut the throats of thousands, and be countable to none therefore, but to God onely: now if the non-securing of the King, make a condition unlawfull, the non-securing of a Kingdom and Church, yea, of the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (which are infinitely in worth above one single man) may far more make the condition unlawfull. 4. A legall restraint on a King, is no more unprofitable, and a seminary of jealousies between King and people, then a legall restraint upon people; for the King out of a non-restraint, as out of seed, may more easily educe tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and subversion of religion: If outlandish women tempt even a <hi>Solomon to idolatry,</hi> as people may educe sedition out of a legall restraint laid upon a King, to say nothing, that Tyranny is a more dangerous sin, then sedition; by how much more the lives of many, and true religion, are to be preferred to the safetie of one, and a false peace.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>An absolute Monarch is free from all forceable restraint,</hi>

                  <hi>and so far, as he is absolute from all legall restraint of positive Laws: now in a limited Monarch there is onely sought a legall restraint, and limitation cannot infer a forceable restraint, for an absolute Monarch is limited also, not by civill compact, but by the Law of nature and nations, which he cannot justly transgresse; if therefore an absolute Monarch being exorbitant, may not be resisted, because he transgresseth the Law of nature; how shall we think a limited Monarch may be resisted, for transgressing the bounds set by civill agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A <hi>legall restraint</hi> on the people, is a <hi>forceable restraint:</hi> For if Law be not backed with force, it is onely a Law of reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weldoing, which is no restraint, but an incouragement to do evil. If then there be a legall restraint upon the King, without any force, it is no restraint, but onely such a request as this, <hi>Be a just Prince, and we will give your Majestie two Subsidies in one yeer.</hi> 2. I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny, that God ever ordained such an irrationall creature, as an absolute Monarch. If a people unjustly, and against natures dictates make away, irrevocably, their own libertie, and the libertie of their posteritie, which is not their's to dispose off, and set over themselves, as base slaves, a sinning creature with absolute power, he is their King, but not as he is absolute, and that he may not be forceably resisted;<note place="margin">To swear to an absolute Prince, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, is an oath <hi>Eatenus,</hi> in so far, not obligatory.</note> notwithstanding, the subjects did swear to his absolute power (which oath in the point of absolutenesse, is unlawfull, and so not obligatory) I utterly deny. 3. <hi>An absolute Monarch</hi> (saith he) <hi>is limited, but by Law of nature:</hi> That is, Master <hi>Doctor,</hi> he is not limited as a Monarch, not as an absolute Monarch, but as a son of <hi>Adam,</hi> he is under the limites of the Law of nature, which he should have been under, though he had never been a King, all his dayes, but a slave. But what then? Therefore he cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted. Yes, <hi>Doctor,</hi> by your own grant he can be resisted: If he invade an innocent subject (say you) 1. <hi>Suddenly.</hi> 2. <hi>Without colour of Law.</hi> 3. <hi>Inevitably:</hi> And that because he transgresseth the Law of nature. 4. You say, a limited Monarch can lesse be resisted for transgressing the bounds set by civill agreement. But, 1. What if the thus limited Monarch transgresse the Law of nature, and subvert Fundamentall Lawes, he is then, you seem to say, to be resisted; it is not for simple transgression of a civill agreement, that he is to be resisted. 2. The limited Monarch is as essentially the Lords anointed, and the power ordained of God, as the absolute Monarch. Now resistance by all your grounds, is unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

And it beseemeth the King to proportion his lawes for their good; and it becommeth the People to proportion all their obedience, actions and endeavours, for the safetie, honour, and happinesse of the King.

The question is, For what end is a <hi>King</hi> made so happy, as to be exalted King? The Prelate answereth; He is made happy, that he may be happy; and made a <hi>King,</hi> that he may be made a <hi>King.</hi> Now is the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> to intend this halfe end? that is, Whether or no accepteth he the burden of setting his head and shoulders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Crowne, for this end, that he may not only make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy, but also that he may make himselfe rich and honorable above his brethren, and enrich himselfe? I beleeve not: but that he <hi>feed the people of God.</hi> For if he intend himselfe, and his own honour, it is the intention of the man who is <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>intentio operantis</hi>; but it is not the intention of the <hi>King,</hi> as the King, or <hi>intentio operis.</hi> The <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> is formally and essentially the <hi>Minister of God for our good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. 1 Tim. 2.2. and cannot come under any notion as a <hi>King,</hi> but as a mean, not as an end, nor as that which he is, to seeke himselfe. I conceive, <hi>God</hi> did forbid this, in the mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the first King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 26. He is a minister by office, and one who receiveth honour and wages for this worke, that <hi>ex officio,</hi> he may feed his people. But the <hi>Prelate</hi> saith, the people are to intend his riches and honour. I cannot say but the people may intend to honour the <hi>King:</hi> but that is not the question, whether the people be to referre the King and his government as a meane to honour the King? I conceive not. But that end which the people in obeying the King in being ruled by him, may intend, is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. That under him they may lead a <hi>quiet and a peaceable life, in all Godlinesse and honestie.</hi> And Gods end in giving a King, is the good and safetie of his people.</p>

Prelate. <hi>To reason from the one part and end of Monarchicall government, The safetie of the Subjects; to the destruction and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the other part of the end of the power of Soveraigntie, and the Royall prerogative: is a caption</hi> à divisis. <hi>If the King be not happy, and invested with the full power of a Head, the Body cannot be well. By Anti-Monarchists; The people at the beginning were necessitated to commit themselves, lives and fortunes to the government of a King, because of themselves they had not wisedome and power enough to doe it: and therefore they enabled him with honour and power, without which he could not doe this, being assured that he could not choose but most earnestly and carefully endeavour this end, to wit, his own, and the peoples happines. Ergo, the safetie of the people issueth from the safetie of the King, as the life of the naturall body from the soule. Weake Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is neare to Anarchie. Puritans will not say,</hi> Quovis modo esse, etiam poenale, <hi>is better then</hi> non esse: <hi>The Scripture saith the contrary; It were better for some never to have been borne, then to be. Tyranny is better then no Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. He knowes not Sophismes of Logick, who calleth this Argument, à <hi>divisis:</hi> for the <hi>Kings</hi> Honour is not the end of the <hi>Kings</hi> Government: He should seeke the safetie of State and Church, not himself; Himselfe is a private end, and a step to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Prelate</hi> lyeth, when he maketh us to <hi>reason from the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Subject to the destruction of the King. Ferne, Barclay, Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> taught the hungry Scholler to reason so. Where read he this? The People must be saved; That is the Supreme law: <hi>Ergo,</hi> destroy the <hi>King.</hi> The Devill and the <hi>Prelate</hi> both, shall not fasten this on us. But thus we reason: When the man who is the King, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the end of his Royall place, but, through bad counsell, the subversion of Lawes, Religion, and bondage of the Kingdome; The free Estates are to joyne with him for that end of Safetie, according as God hath made them heads of Tribes, and Princes of the people: And if the King refuse to joyne with them, and will not doe his dutie; I see not how they are in conscience liberated, before God, from doing their part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> call resisting the <hi>King</hi> by lawfull defensive wars, the destruction of the Head; He speaketh with the mouth of one excommunicated, and delivered up to <hi>Sathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We endeavour nothing more then the safetie and happinesse
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50873:132"/>
of the King, as King: but his happinesse is not to suffer him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his Subjects, subvert Religion, arme Papists, who have slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered above two hundred thousand innocent Protestants, only for the profession of that true Religion which the King hath sworne to maintaine. Not to rise in armes to helpe the King against these, were to gratifie him as a Man, but to be accessarie to his soules destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a King.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Royall Prerogative is the end of a Monarchie ordained by God; neither Scripture, Law, nor Reason can admit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The people are to intend the safetie of other Iudges, as well as the Kings. If <hi>Parliaments</hi> be destroyed, whose it is to make Lawes and Kings; the People can neither be safe, free to serve <hi>Christ,</hi> nor happy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is a lie, that people were necessitated, at the beginning, to commit themselves to a <hi>King:</hi> for we read of no King, while <hi>Nimrod</hi> arose: Fathers of families (who were not Kings) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did governe till then.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It was not want of wisedome, (for in many, and in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there must be more wisdome then in one man:) but rather cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, and reciprocation of injuries, that created Kings, and other Iudges.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The King shall better compasse his end, to wit, the safetie of the people, with limited power, <hi>(placent mediocria)</hi> and with other Iudges added to helpe him, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.14, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 15. then to put in one mans hand absolute power: for a sinfull mans head cannot beare so much new wine, such as exorbitant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He is a base flatterer, who saith, The King <hi>cannot choose but earnestly and carefully endeavour his own, and the peoples happinesse:</hi> that is, the King is an <hi>Angel,</hi> and cannot sinne, and decline from the duties of a King. Of the many Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chose this? All the good Kings that have been, may be written in a gold ring.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The peoples safetie dependeth indeed on the King, as a King and a happy Governour; but the people shall never be fattened to eat the winde of an imaginarie Prerogative Royall.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Weake Government, that is, a <hi>King</hi> with a limited power, who hath more power about his head, nor within his head; is a

But the Prelate behoved to goe out of his way to salute and gratifie, a proclaimed enemy of free Grace <hi>Arminius,</hi> and hence he would inferre, That the King wanting his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royall, and fulnesse of absolute power to doe wickedly, is in a penall and miserable condition, and that it were better for the <hi>King</hi> to be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> with absolute liberty to destroy, and save alive at his pleasure, as is said of a Tyrant, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. v. 19. then to be no King at all.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The question is not of the Wisedome, but of the Power of the King, if it should be bounded by no Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The flatterer may know, there be more foolish Kings in the world then wise, and that Kings misled with Idolatrous <hi>Queenes,</hi> and by name <hi>Achab</hi> ruined himselfe, and his posterity and Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The salvation and happinesse of men standing in the exalting of Christs Throne and the Gospell, <hi>ergo</hi> every King, and every man will exalt the Throne, and so let them have an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable power without constraint of Law, to doe what they list, and let no bounds be set to Kings over subjects; by this Argument their owne wisedome is a law to leade them to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not <hi>Absoloms</hi> mad Male-contents in <hi>Britane,</hi> but there were really no justice to Protestants, all indulgence to Papists, Popery, Arminianisme, Idolatry printed, Preached, professed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by Authority, Parliaments, and Church Assemblies, the Bulwarkes of Iustice and Religion were denyed, dissolved, crushed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That by a King he understandeth a <hi>Monarch,</hi> Iudg. 17. and that such a one, as <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>Absolute power,</hi> and not a Iudge, cannot be proved, for there were no Kings in Israel in the Iudges daies, the Government not being changed till neare the end of <hi>Samuels</hi> Government.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And that they had no Iudges, he saith, It is not imaginable, but I rather beleeve God then the Prelate, <hi>Every one did what was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50873:134"/>
right in his owne eyes,</hi> because there was none to put ill doers to shame. Possible the Estates of Israel governed some way for meere necessity, but wanting a supreme Iudge which they should have, they were loose: but this was not because where there is no King, as <hi>P. P.</hi> would insinuate, there was no Government, as is cleare.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Of tempered and limited Monarchy, I thinke as honourably as the Prelate, but that absolute and unlimited Monarchy is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter then Aristocracy, I shall then beleeve when <hi>Royalists</hi> shall prove such a Government, in so farre it is absolute, to be of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That <hi>Aristocracy</hi> was now weakened I beleeve not, seeing God so highly commendeth it, and calleth it his own <hi>reigning over his people,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.7. The weakening of it through abuse, is not to a purpose, more then the abuse of <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>The safety of the people is the supreme Law,</hi> ergo <hi>the King is bound in duty to promote all and every one of his subjects to all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> The <hi>Observator</hi> hath no such inference, the King is bound to promote some of his subjects even as King, to a Gallowes, especially <hi>Irish</hi> Rebells, and many bloudy Malignants. But the Prelate will needs have <hi>God</hi> rigorous (hallowed be his name) if it be so, for it is unpossible to the tenderest-hearted father to doe so: actuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of all is unpossible, that the King intend it of all his subjects,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50873:134"/>
as good subjects, by a Throne established on righteousnesse and judgement, is that which the <hi>worthy Observator</hi> meaneth; other things here are answered.</p>
               <p>The summe of his second answer is, a repetition of what he hath said; I give my word in a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> of one hundred ninety and foure pages, I never saw more idle repetitions, of one thing twenty times before said. But page one hundred sixty and eight, he saith, <hi>The safety of the King and his subjects in the Morall notion may be esteemed Morally the same, no lesse then the soule and the body make one personall subsistence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is strange Logick, the <hi>King</hi> and his subjects are <hi>Ens per aggregationem</hi>; and the King as King hath one Morall subsistence, and the people another. Hath the Father and the sonne, the Master and the servant one Morall subsistence? but the man speaketh of their well being: and then he must meane that our Kings Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was not long agoe, and is yet, to wit, the Popery, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme, Idolatry, cutting of mens eares, and noses, banishing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, for speaking against Popery, arming of Papists to slay Protestants, pardoning the bloud of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I feare, shall not be soone taken away, &amp;c. are identically the same with the life, safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and happinesse of Protestants, then life and death, justice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, Idolatry and sincere worship are identically one, as the soule of the Prelate and his body are one.</p>
               <p>The third is but a repitition.<note place="margin">The subjects may gratifie the King for doing what he is obliged to doe by his office.</note> 
                  <hi>The Acts of Royaltie (saith the</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator) <hi>are Acts of dutie and obligation</hi>; Ergo, <hi>not acts of grace properly so called. Ergo,</hi> We may not thank the King for a courtesie. This is no consequence. What fathers do to children, are acts of naturall dutie, and of naturall grace; and yet children owe grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to parents, and subjects to good Kings, in a legall sense. No, but in way of courtesie onely. The <hi>Observator</hi> said, The King is not a father to the whole collective body, and its well said, he is son to them, and they his maker. Who made the King?

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> True indeed, If the King had Royalty by immediate trust, and infusion by God, as <hi>Elias</hi> had the spirit of prophecie, that he cannot make away: Royalists dream that God immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from heaven, now infuseth facultie and right to Crowns, without any word of God. Its enough to make an <hi>Euthysiast</hi> leap up to the Throne, and kill Kings. Judge if these Fanaticks be favourers of Kings: But if the King have Royaltie mediately by the peoples free consent from God, there is no reason, but people give as much power even by ounce weights (for power is strong Wine, and a great mocker) as they know a weak mans head will bear, and no more; power is not an immediate inheritance from heaven: But a birth-right of the people borrowed from them, they may let it out for their good, and resume it when a man is drunk with it. 2. The man will have it conscience on the King to fight and destroy his three Kingdoms, for a dream, his prerogative above Law. But the truth is, <hi>Prelates</hi> do engage the King, his house, honour, subjects, Church, for their cursed Mytres.</p>

                  <hi>and the sense is, The Kingdome is really some time in such a case, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne must exercise an Arbitrary Power, and not stand upon private mens interests, or transgressing of Lawes, made for the private good of individualls, but for the preservation of it selfe, and the publicke, may break through all Lawes. This he may, in the case when suddaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine invasion threatneth ruine inevitably to</hi> King <hi>and Kingdome; a Physitian may rather cut a Gangreened member, then suffer the whole body to perish. The Dictator in case of extreame dangers (as</hi> Livie <hi>and</hi> Dion. Halicarnass. <hi>shew us) had power according to his owne Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had a soveraigne Commission in peace and war of life, death, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp;c. not co-ordinate, not subordinate to any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not an Arbitrary power, but naturally tyed and fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this same supreame Law, <hi>Salus populi,</hi> the safety of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that a King breake through, not the Law, but the letter of the Law for the safety of the people; as the Chyrurgion, not by any prerogative that he hath above the Art of Chyrurgery,<note place="margin">A King may though we should deny all Prerogative, breake through the letter of a Law, for the safety of the whole Land.</note> but by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, cutteth off a Gangreened member, thus its not Arbitrary to the King to save his people from ruine, but by the strong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Law of the peoples safety he doth it; for if he did it not, he were a murtherer of his people. 2. He is to stand upon transgression of Lawes according to their genuine sense of the peoples safety, for good Lawes are not contrary one to another, though when he breaketh through the letter to the Law, yet he breaketh not the Law, for if twenty thousand Rebells invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all to rise, though the formality of a Parliament cannot be had to indict the war, as our Law provideth; but the King doth not command all to rise, and defend themselves by a Prerogative Royall, proper to him as King, and incommunicable to any but to himselfe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no such dinne and noise to be made for a King, and his incommunicable Prerogative, for though the King were not at all, yea though he command the contrary (as he did when he came
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50873:136"/>
against <hi>Scotland</hi> with an English Army) the law of Nature teacheth all to rise without the King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the King command this as King, it is not a particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law; but he doth it as a man, and a member of the Kingdom; The law of Nature, (which knoweth no dreame of such a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) forceth him to it, as every member is, by Natures indictment, to care for the whole.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is poore hungry skill in this New Statist, (for so he nameth all <hi>Scotland</hi>) to say, that <hi>any Lawes are made for private interests, and the good of some individuals.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Kings supposed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the lives and blood of so many thousands as are killed in England and Ireland.</note> Lawes are not Lawes, if they be not made for the safetie of the people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is false, that the King in a publike danger is to care for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as a man, with the ruine and losse of any: Yea, in a publike ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, a good <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> is to desire he may die, that the Publique may bee saved, 2 <hi>Samuel,</hi> 24.17. <hi>Exodus</hi> 32.32. It is commended of all, that the Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> yea and <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. of <hi>England,</hi> as M. <hi>Speed</hi> saith, <hi>Hist. of England, p.</hi> 757. resigned their Kingdomes to eschew the effusion of blood. The <hi>Prelate</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth the King to passe over all lawes of Nature, and slay thousands of innocents, and destroy Church and State of three Kingdomes, for a straw, and <hi>supposed Prerogative Royall.</hi> Now certainly, Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and Absolutenes to doe good and ill, must be inferior to a Law, the end whereof is the safetie of the People. For <hi>David</hi> willeth the pestilence may take him away, and so his Prerogative, that the People may be saved, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. for Prerogative is <hi>cumulative,</hi> to doe good, not <hi>privative</hi> to doe ill; and so is but a meane to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend both the Law and the People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prerogative is either a power to doe good, or ill, or both: If the first be said, it must be limited by the End, and Law, for which it is ordained. A meane is no farther a meane, but in so far as it conduceth to the end; the safetie of all. If the second be admitted, it is Licence and Tyrannie, not power from <hi>God.</hi> If the third be said, both reasons plead against this, that Prerogative should be the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> end in the present warres.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prerogative being a power given by the mediation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yea, suppose (which is false) that it were given immediately of <hi>God</hi>; yet it not a thing for which the <hi>King</hi> should raise war against his Subjects: for God will aske no more of the <hi>King,</hi> then he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to him: <hi>The Lord reapeth not, where he soweth not.</hi> If the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>

and other things, be ordered hitherto for the holding off Irish and Spanish invasion by Sea, and so for the good of the Land, seeing the King, in his own person, cannot make use of the <hi>Militia</hi>; he is to rejoyce that his Subjects are defended. The King cannot answer to God for the justice of warre on his part: It is not a case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that the King should shed blood for, to wit, because the under-Officers are such men, and not others of his choosing; seeing the Kingdome is defended sufficiently, except where Cavaliers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it. And to me, this is an unanswerable argument, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers destroy not the Kingdomes for this Prerogative Royall, as the principall ground; but for a deeper designe, even for that which was working by Prelates and Malignants, before the late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in both Kingdomes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>King</hi> is to intend the safetie of his People; and the safety of the <hi>King,</hi> as a Governour, but not as this <hi>King,</hi> and this man, <hi>Charles:</hi> that is a selfe end: a King <hi>David</hi> is not to looke to that: for when the people was seeking his life and crown, he saith, <hi>Ps.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Thy blessing upon thy People.</hi> He may care for, and intend that the <hi>King</hi> and Government be safe: for if the Kingdome be destroyed, there cannot be a new Kingdome and Church on earth againe to serve God, in that generation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.47. but they may easily have a new King againe: and so the safetie of the one, cannot in reason be intended, as a collaterall end, with the safetie of the other: for there is no imaginable comparison betwixt one man, with all his accidents of Prerogative and Absolutenesse, and three Nationall Churches and Kingdomes: Better the King weep for a Childish trifle of a Prerogative, than Poperie be erected, and three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes be destroyed by Cavaliers, for their own ends.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Pope giveth to every Societie, Politick power to make away a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or hereticall King, and to un-king him, by his brethren the Jesuites way. And observe, how Papists (of which number I could easily prove the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> to be, by the Popish doctrine that he delivered, while the iniquitie of time, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prelates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> advanced him, against all worth of true learning and holinesse, to be a Preacher in <hi>Edinborough</hi>) and <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> agree, as the builders of <hi>Babylon.</hi> It is the purpose of <hi>God</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This answer shall inferre, that the <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> Governors of any free State, and that the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Senate there, is above all Law, and cannot be resisted, because without their Heads they are a disorderly Rout.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Politicall societie, as by Natures instinct, they may appoint a Head, or Heads to themselves: so also if their Head, or Heads become ravenous Wolves, the <hi>God</hi> of Nature hath not left a perfect Societie remedilesse; but they may both resist, and punish the Head or Heads, to whom they gave all the power that they have, for their good, not for their destruction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are as orderly a body Politique, to unmake a Tyrannous Commander, as they were to make a just Governour. The <hi>Prelate</hi> saith, <hi>It is alike to conceive a Politique body without a Governour, as to conceive the naturall body without a Head.</hi> He meaneth, None of them can be conceivable. I am not of his minde. When <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, Israel was a perfect Politique body: and the <hi>Prelate,</hi> if he be not very obtuse in his head, (as this hungry peece stollen from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, sheweth him to be) may conceive a visible Politicall societie performing a Politicall action, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. making <hi>David</hi> King
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50873:141"/>
at a visible and conceivable place, at <hi>Hebron</hi>; and making a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him. And that they wanted not all Governors, is nothing to make them Chymera's unconceivable: For when so many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies before <hi>Nimrod,</hi> were governed only by fathers of families, and they agreed to make either a King, or other Governors, a Head, or Heads over themselves: though the severall families had govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet these consociated families had no government; and yet so conceivable a Politique body, as if <hi>Maxwell</hi> would have compeared amongst them, and called them a <hi>disorderly rout,</hi> or an unconceivable <hi>Chymera,</hi> they should have made the Prelate know, that <hi>Chymera's</hi> can knock down <hi>Prelates.</hi> Neither is a <hi>King</hi> the <hi>life of a Politique body, as the soule is of the naturall body:</hi> The body createth not the soule: but Israel created <hi>Saul</hi> King; and when he was dead, they made <hi>David</hi> King, and so, under <hi>God,</hi> many <hi>Kings,</hi> as they succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, till the <hi>Messiah</hi> came. No naturall body can make soules to it selfe by succession; Nor can Seas create new <hi>Prelates</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>Jesuites and Puritans differ infinitely; We are hopefull God shall cast down this Babel. The Iesuites, for ought I know, seat the superintendent power in the Communitie: Some Sectaries follow them, and warrant any individuall person to make away a King in case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and the worke is to be rewarded as when one killeth a ravenous Wolfe. Some will have it in a collective body, but how? not met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by warrant, or writ of Soveraigne Authoritie, but when fancie of reforming Church and State calleth them. Some will have the power in the Nobles and Peeres; some in the three Estates assembled by the Kings Writ; some in the inferior Iudges. I know not where this power to curbe Soveraigntie is, but in Almighty God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> differ infinitely: true. Jesuites deny the Pope to be Antichrist, hold all Arminian doctrine, Christs locall descension to hell: all which the Prelate did preach. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We hope also the Lord shall destroy the <hi>Jesuites Babel</hi>; the suburbs whereof, and more, are the Popish Prelates in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="4">4. If these be all the differences, it is not much, the Community is the remote and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. A true cause of convening Parliaments the prelate maketh a <hi>Fancie</hi> at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is as if the theeves and robbers should say a Iustice Court were a fancie; but if the Prelate might compeare before the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> (to which he is an out-law, like his father, 2 <hi>Thess:</hi> 2.4.) such a fancie I conceive should hang him, and that deservedly.</p>

                  </hi> The consequence is nought, no more then the King the absolute independent is infallible. 2. It is sure the people are in lesse hazard of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and selfe destruction, then the King is to subvert Lawes, and make himselfe absolute, and for that cause there must be a superintendent power above the King; and God Almighty also must be above all.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>The Parliament may erre, then God hath left the state remedilesse except the King remedy it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There's no consequence here, except the King be impecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 2. Posteriour Parliaments may correct the former. 3. A State is not remedilesse, because <hi>Gods</hi> remedies, in sinfull mens hands may miscarry. But the question is now, whether God hath given power to one man to destroy men, subvert Lawes, and Religion, without any power above him to coerce, restraine or punish.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>If when the Parliament erreth, the remedy is left to the Wisedome of God,</hi>

               <p>Prelate. <hi>It is infidelitie, to thinke that God cannot helpe us; and impatience, that we will not wait on God.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I see nothing but what <hi>D. Ferne, Grotius, Barclay, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> have said before, with some colour of proving the consequence.

But it is indeed the triviall Argument of all <hi>Royalists,</hi> especially of <hi>Barclay,</hi> obvious in his 3. Booke. If Arbitrarie and Tyrannicall power above any Law that the lawfull Magistrate commandeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paine of death, <hi>(Thou shalt not murther one man) (Thou shalt not take away the vineyard of one Naboth violently)</hi> be lawfull and warrantable by Gods word; then an Arbitrarie power above all Divine lawes, is given to the keeping of the Civill Magistrate. And it is no lesse lawfull Arbitrarie, or rather Tyrannicall power, for <hi>David</hi> to kill all his Subjects, and to plunder all <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> (as I beleeve, Prelates, and Malignants, and Papists would serve the three Kingdomes, if the King should command them) then to kill one <hi>Vriah,</hi> or for <hi>Achab</hi> to spoile one <hi>Naboth.</hi> The essence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What if the King command not his people to serve God; or, What if he forbid <hi>Daniel</hi> to pray to God? Shall the people in that case serve the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> onely at the nod, and Royall command of an earthly King?

The Pope and <hi>Romish Church</hi> cannot put on the Scripture, <hi>Ex plenitudine potestatis,</hi> what ever meaning they will, no more then they can, out of absolute power, make Canonicke Scripture.

               <p>The state of the question is much perverted, for these be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent questions, Whether the <hi>Kingdom</hi> may dethrone a wicked and <hi>Tyrannous Prince?</hi> And whether may the <hi>Kingdom</hi> take up arms against the man who is the <hi>King,</hi> in their own innocent defence: For the former is an Act offensive, and of punishing, the latter is an Act of Defence.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

So the man will have it lawfull to resist the limited Prince, not the absolute Prince; by the contrary, it is more lawfull to me to resist the absolute Prince, then the limited, in as much, as we may with safer consciences resist the Tyrant, and the Lyon, then the just Prince and the Lamb.

The Authoritie, and Gods ordinances can never doe wrong; for it commandeth that Vice and wicked men be punished, and Vertue, with vertuous men and just. be maintained: But the corrupt Person placed in this Authoritie, may offend, and most commonly doe contrary to this Authoritie: and is then the corruption of Man to be followed, by reason that it is clothed with the name of Authoritie?</hi> And they give instance in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Saul, who were lawfall Kings, and yet corrupt Men.</hi> And certainly, the Man, and the Divine authoritie, differ as the Subject and the Accident; as that which is under a Law, and can offend <hi>God</hi>; and that which is neither capable of Law, nor sinne. 13.

And here our <hi>Prelate</hi> is blind, if he see not the cleare difference between the <hi>Kings</hi> Person, and the Office as he is <hi>King,</hi> and between his <hi>private Will,</hi> and his publicke and <hi>Royall Will.</hi> 3. The Angels may be named Thrones and Dominions <hi>in abstracto,</hi> and yet created, <hi>in concreto,</hi> and we may say the Angell and his power are both created at once; but <hi>David</hi> was not both borne the Son of <hi>Iesse,</hi> and a <hi>King</hi> at once: and the <hi>P.

A <hi>power from God.</hi> 2. <hi>An ordinance of God.</hi> 3. That in these, he was the <hi>Minister of God for the good of the Common-wealth.</hi> Because some beleeved Christians were free from the yoake of Magistracy, and that the dignity it selfe was unlawfull.

It is an ignorant speech, to ask, <hi>Is Authoritie subjected solely in the Kings Law, and no whit in his Person?</hi> for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hath all its power by Law, not from the Mans person; The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie hath nothing from the Person, but a naked inherencie in the Person, as in the subject: and the Person is to be honored for the Authoritie, not the Authoritie for the Person. 3. Authoritie is not so separable from the person, as that for every act of lawlesse Will, the King loseth his Royall authoritie, and ceaseth to be <hi>King:</hi> no, but every act of a <hi>King,</hi> in so far can claime subjection of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, as the act of commanding and ruling, hath law for it; and in so far as it is lawlesse, the Person in that act repugnant to Law, loseth all due claime of actuall subjection in that act, and in that act, power actuall is losed, as is cleare, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. &amp; 5.29. The <hi>Apostles</hi> say to Rulers, It is safer to obey <hi>God than Men.</hi> What? were not these Rulers lawfull Magistrates, armed with power from <hi>God?</hi> I answer, habitually they were Rulers, and more then <hi>men,</hi> and to obey them in things lawfull, is to obey <hi>God:</hi> But actually in these unlawfull commandements, especially being commanded to speake no more in the name of Iesus; the Apostles doe acknowledge them to be no more but <hi>Men:</hi> and so their actuall authoritie is as separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the person, <hi>as pride and folly from men.</hi>

                  <hi>and as Men: because their authoritie is only sacred, and addeth veneration to their persons; and is separable from the person; The Man may live, when his Authoritie is extinguished: but it holdeth not in Kings.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If this be true, <hi>Manasseh,</hi> a King, did not shed innocent blood, and use <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but as a <hi>King. Salomon</hi> played the Apostate as a <hi>King,</hi> not as a <hi>man</hi>: if so, the man must make the <hi>King</hi> more infallible then the Pope; for the Pope, as a man, can erre; as a Pope he cannot erre, say Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. But Prophets, in their persons, were anoynted of <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were: then must we say, <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not as men, because their persons were sacred and anointed: and they erred not as Prophets, sure; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they erred not all. A <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> is an holy Ordinance of God, and so cannot doe injustice, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they must doe acts of Iustice, as men. 2. The inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Iudge is a Power from <hi>God.</hi> 2. To resist him, is to resist an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>God.</hi> 3. He is not a terrour to good workes, but to evill. 4. He is the <hi>minister of God</hi> for good. 5. He is Gods Sword-bearer; his officiall power to rule, may by as good right come by birth, as the Crown: and the Kings person is sacred only for his office, and is annointed only for his office. For then the Chaldeans dishonored not inferior Iudges, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.12. when they <hi>hanged the Prince, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored not the faces of Elders.</hi> It is in questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if the Kings actual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be not as separable fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, as the actuall authority of the Iudge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symmons,</hi> p. 24. <hi>The King himselfe may use this distinction. As a Christian, he may forgive any that offendeth against his person: but as a Iudge, he must punish, in regard of his office. Ans.</hi> Well then, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers will grant the distinction, when the <hi>King</hi> doth good, and pardoneth the blood of Protestants, shed by bloody Rebels: But when the King doth acts of injustice, he is neither man, nor King, but some independent absolute God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symmons,</hi> p. 27. <hi>Gods Word tyeth me to every one of his personall commandements, as well as his legall commandements: nor doe I obey the Kings law, because it is established, or because of its known penaltie; nor yet the King himselfe, because he ruleth according to Law. But I obey the Kings law, because I obey the King: and I obey the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I obey God: I obey the King, and his Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because I obey God and his Law. Better obey the Command, for a reverent regard to the Prince, then for a penaltie. Ans.</hi> It is hard to answer a sick man. It is blasphemie, to seek this distinction of Person and Office, in the King of Kings; because by <hi>(Person)</hi> in a mortall King, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a Man that can sinne. 1. I am not obliged to obey his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall commandement, except I were his domestick: nor his unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full personall commandements, because they are sinfull. 2. It is false that <hi>you obey the Kings Law, because you obey the King:</hi> for then you say but this, <hi>I obey the King, because I obey the King.</hi> The truth is,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50873:161"/>
Obedience is not formally terminated on the person of the King; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is relative to a precept: and it is Men-service, to obey a Law, not because it is good and just; but upon this formall motive, because it is the will of a mortall man to command it. And Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Love, Feare, being acts of the Affection, are not terminated on a Law, but properly on the Person of the Iudge: and they are modifications, or laudable qualifications of acts of obedience; not motives, not the formall reason why I obey, but the manner how I obey. And the Apostle maketh expresly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4. feare of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a motive of obedience, while he saith, <hi>He beareth not the sword in vaine; Ergo,</hi> Be subject to the <hi>King.</hi> And this hindreth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall resistance to unjust commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symmons,</hi> p. 27, 28, 29. <hi>You say, To obey the Princes Personall commandement against his Legall will, is to obey himselfe against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. So say I, To obey his Legall will against his Personall will, is to obey himselfe against himselfe: for I take his Person to be himselfe</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To obey the Kings personall will, when it is sinfull, (as we now suppose) against his legall will, is a sinne, and a disobedience to <hi>God,</hi> and the King also, seeing the Law is the <hi>Kings will, as King:</hi> but to obey his Legall will against his sinfull personall will (as it must be sinfull, if contrary to a just Law) is obedience to the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> and so obedience to God. 2. You take the Kings person to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but you take <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> for his person here, you must take not <hi>Physically</hi> for his suppost of soul and body; but morally, it is the King, as a sinning man doing his worst will, against the Law which is his just and best will, and the rule of the Subjects: and the Kings personall will is so far just, and to regulate the Subjects, in so far, as it agreeth with his legall Will, or his Law, and this will can sinne, and therefore may be crossed without breach of the fifth Commandement: but his Legall Will cannot be crossed without disobedience both to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symmons,</hi> p. 28. <hi>The Kings Personall will doth not alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppone passion: and if it be attended with passion, yet we must beare it for conscience sake. Ans.</hi> We are to obey the Kings Personall will, when the thing commanded, is not sinne; but his Subjects as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have little to do with his personall will in that notion. It concerneth his domestick servant, and is the Kings will as he is the master of servants, not as he is King in relation to Subjects; but we speak of the Kings personall will, as repugnant to Law, and contrary to the Kings will as King, and so contrary to the fifth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50873:161"/>
Commandment; and this is attended often, not onely with Passion, but also with prejudice; and we owe no subjection to prejudice, and Passions, or to Actions commanded, by these misordered powers, because they are not from God, nor his Ordinances, but from men, and the flesh, and we owe no subjection to the flesh.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>Ferne, Sect.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 58. <hi>The distinction of personall and legall will, hath place in evill actions, but not in resistance, where we cannot sever the person, and the dignitie, or authority, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resist the power, but we must resist the person who hath the power.</hi> Saul <hi>had lawfully the command of Arms, but that power he useth unjustly, against innocent</hi> David. <hi>I ask when these Emperours took away lives and goods at their pleasure; was that a power ordained of God? No, but an Illegall will, a Tyranny, but they might not resist: nay, but they cannot resist: for that power and soveraigntie imployed to compasse these illegall commandments, was ordained and settled in them. When</hi> Pilate <hi>condemned our Saviour, it was an illegall will, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> our Saviour acknowledgeth in it</hi> Pilates <hi>power, that was given him from above. Answ.</hi> 1. Here we have the distinction, denyed by <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists,</hi> granted by D. <hi>Fern</hi>; but if when the King commands us to do wickednesse, we may resist that personall will, and when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to suffer unjustly we cannot resist his will, but we must resist also his Royall person. What? Is it not still the King, and his person sacred, as his power is sacred, when he commandeth the subjects to do unjustly, as when he commandeth them to suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly? It were fearfull to say, when Kings command any one act of idolatry, they are no longer Kings; if for conscience I am to suffer unjustly, when <hi>Nero</hi> commandeth unjust punishment, because <hi>Nero</hi> commanding so, remaineth Gods Minister. Why? But when <hi>Nero</hi> commandeth me to worship an Heathen God, I am upon the same ground to obey that unjust will in doing ill: For <hi>Nero</hi> in commanding Idolatry, remaineth the Lords Minister, his person is sacred in the one commandment of doing ill, as in inflicting ill of punishment. And do I not resist his person in the one, as in the other? His power and his person are unseparably conjoyned by God in the one, as in the other, 2. In bodily thrusting out of <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi> from the Temple, these fourscore valiant men did resist the Kings person, by bodily violence, as well as his power. 3. If the power of killing the Martyrs in <hi>Nero,</hi> was no power ordained of God, then the resisting of <hi>Nero,</hi> in his taking away the lives of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> was but the resisting of Tyranny: And certainly, if that

power in <hi>Nero</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a power ordained of <hi>God,</hi> and not to be resisted, as the place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. is alleaged by <hi>Royalists,</hi> then it must be a lawfull power, and no Tyranny; and if it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, because <hi>it was a power ordained and settled in him,</hi> it is either setled by God, and so not Tyranny; except God be the Author of Tyranny, or then settled by the devill, and so may well be resisted; but the Text speaketh of no power, but <hi>of that which is of God.</hi> 4. We are not to be subject to all powers <hi>in concreto,</hi> by the Text; for we are not to be subject to powers lawfull, yet commanding active obedience to things unlawfull. Now subjection includeth active obedience of honour, love, fear, paying tribute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of need force, some powers must be excepted. 5. <hi>Pilates</hi> power is meerly a power by <hi>divine permission,</hi> not a <hi>power ordained of God,</hi> as are the powers spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Gregori. mor. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly saith, <hi>This was Satans power given to Pilate, against Christ.

                  <hi>John</hi> 19.10. <hi>Knowest thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee?</hi> This was an untruth. <hi>Pilate</hi> had a command to worship him, and beleeve in him; and whereas <hi>Ferne</hi> saith, <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 59. <hi>Pilate had power to judge any accused before him:</hi> It is true, but he being obliged to beleeve in Christ, he was obliged to be perswaded of Christs innocency; and so neither to judge, nor receive accusation against him: and the power he saith, he had to crucifie, was a <hi>Law-power</hi> in <hi>Pilates</hi> meaning, but not in very deed any Law-power; because a Law-power is from Gods regulating will in the fifth Commandment; but no creature hath a lawfull or a Law-power to crucifie Christ. 2. A Law-power is for good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>A power to crucifie Christ,</hi> is for ill. 3. A Law-power is a terrour to ill works, and a praise to good. <hi>Pilates</hi> power to <hi>crucifie Christ,</hi> was the contrary. 4. A Law-power is to execute wrath on ill-doing, a power to crucifie Christ is no such. 5. A Law-power conciliateth honour, fear, and veneration to the person of the Judge, a power to crucifie Christ, conciliateth no such thing, but a disgrace to <hi>Pilate.</hi> 6. The Genuine Acts of a lawfull power, are lawfull Acts; for such as is the Fountain-power, such are the Acts flowing therefrom; good Acts slow not from bad powers, neither hath God given a power to sin, except by way of permission.</p>

The forced Damsell was commanded to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50873:172"/>
cry for help, and not the Magistrate onely, but the neerest private man or woman was to come, by an obligation of a divine Law of the seventh Commandement, to rescue the Damsell with violence; even as a man is to save his enemies Oxe or his Asse out of a pit: And if a private man may inflict bodily punishment of two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to preserve the life and chastity of his neighbour, far rather then suffer his life and chastity to be taken away, then he may inflict violence of foure degrees even to killing, for his life, and much more for his owne life. So when a Robber, with deadly weapons invadeth an innocent traveller to kill him, for his goods, upon the supposition that if the Robber be not killed, the innocent shall be killed; Now the question is, which of the two, by Gods morall Law and revealed will in point of conscience, ought to be killed by his fellow; for we speake not now of Gods eternall decree of permitting evill, according to the which murtherers may crucifie the innocent Lord of glory: by no morall Law of God, should the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If any say, by Gods morall Law not one should kill his fellow; and it is a sin against the morall Law in either to kill other; I answer: If a third shall come in when the robber and the innocent are invading each other for his life, all acknowledge by the sixt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the third may cut off the robbers arme to save the innocent; but by what Law of God he may cut off his arme, he may take his life also to save the other; for it is murther to wound unjustly, and to dismember a man by private authority, as it is to take away his life: If therefore the third may take away the robbers member, then also his life, so hee doe it without malice or appetite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and if he may doe it out of this principle, <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe</hi>; because a man is obliged more to love his owne flesh, then his neighbours, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.28. and so more to defend himselfe, then to defend his neighbour,<note place="margin">How many wayes a man may preferre the safety of his owne life to the safety of his brother.</note> then may he oppose violence to the robber; As two men drowning in a water, the one is not obliged by Gods Law, to expose himselfe to drowning to save his neighbour; but by the contrary, hee is obliged rather to save himselfe, though it were with the losse of his neighbours life: As in war, if souldiers in a strait passage be pursued on their life, nature teacheth them to flee; if one fall, his fellow in that exigence is not onely not obliged to lift him up, but he and the rest flying,

               </p>
               <p>Ans. 1. He contradicteth the text, it was not a resistance by words, for the text saith <hi>they withstood him, and they thrust him out violently.</hi> 2. He yeeldeth the cause, for to withdraw the holy things of God, by corporall violence, and violently to pull the censer out of his hand, that he should not provoke Gods wrath, by offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to the Lord is resistance, and the like violence may, by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, be used, when the <hi>King</hi> useth the <hi>sword</hi> and the <hi>Militia</hi> to bring in an enemy to destroy the kingdom: it is no lesse in justice against the second table, that the <hi>King</hi> useth the sword to destroy the innocent, then to usurpe the censor against the first table. But Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> yeeldeth that the censor may be pulled out of his hand, lest he provoke God to wrath. <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the same very reason, <hi>à fortiore,</hi> the <hi>Sword,</hi> the Castles, the Sea-ports, the <hi>Militia</hi> may be violently pulled out of his hand, for if there was an expresse Law that the leper should be put out of the congregation, and therefore the <hi>King</hi> also should be subject to his <hi>Church-censor,</hi> then he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the <hi>King</hi> to a punishment to be inflicted by the subjects, upon the King, <hi>Ergo</hi> the King is obnoxious to the coactive power of the law. 2. <hi>Ergo,</hi> subjects may judge him and punish him. 3. <hi>Ergo</hi> he is to be subject to all Church-censors, no lesse then the people. 4. There is an expresse law that the leper should be put out of the congregation. What then? flattering court Divines say <hi>the King is above all these lawes,</hi> for there is an expresse law of God as expresse as that ceremoniall on touching lepers, and a more binding law, <hi>that the murtherer should die the death.</hi> Will Royalists put no exception upon a ceremoniall law of expelling the leper, and yet put an exception upon a Divine morall law, concerning the punishing of murtherers given before the law on <hi>Mount Sinai. Gen.</hi> 6.9. They so declare that they <hi>accept the persons of men.</hi> 5. If
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50873:180"/>
a leper King could not actually sit upon the throne, but must be cut off <hi>from the house of the Lord,</hi> because of an expresse law of God, these being inconsistent, that a King remaining amongst Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ruling and raigning, should keep company with the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and yet be a leper who was to be cut off, by a Divine law from the Church, now I perswade my self that far lesse can he actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raigne in the full use of the power of the sword, if he use the sword to cut off thousands of innocent people, because murthering the innocent and fatherles, and Royall governing in Righteousnesse and Godlinesse are more inconsistent, by Gods law, being morally opposite, then remaining a governour of the people, and the disease of leprosie, are incompatible. 6.

But some may say, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria, If a people totally resigne their power, and swear non-resistance to a Conqueror, by compact, they cannot resist.</hi> I answer, neither doth this follow, because it is an unlawfull compact, and none is obliged to what is unlawfull. For 1. it is no more lawfull for me to resigne to another my power of naturall self-defence, then I can resigne my power to defend <hi>the innocent drawne to death,</hi> and

the wives, children and posterity that God hath tyed me unto. 2. The people can no more resigne power of self-defence, which Nature hath given them, then they can be guilty of <hi>self-murther,</hi> and be wanting in the lawfull defence of Kingdome and Religion. 3. Though you make one their King with absolutenesse of power, yet when he use that transcendent power, not for the safety, but for the destruction of the State, it is knowne they could not resigne to another that power which neither God nor nature gave them, to wit, a power to destroy themselves. 2.

Is not this a punishment inflicted by inferiours upon a superiour, according to the way of Royalists? Now it is clear a worshipping of bread and the Masse commanded, and against law obtruded upon Scotland, by influence of the counsell of known Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, is to us, and in it self as abominable as the worshiping of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon or the Sydonian Gods, and when the Kingdom of Scotland did but conveen, supplicat, and protest against that obtruded Idolatry, they were first declared rebels by the King, and then an army raised against them, by Prelates and Malignants, inspired with the spirit of Anti-christ, to destroy the whole land, if they should not submit soul and conscience to that wicked service.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not much to other men what is spoken to any mans conscience by Phrase and customes; for by this no States where there be no Kings, but government by the best, or the people, as in <hi>Holland,</hi> or in other Nations, can have power of war, for what time of yeare shall Kings goe to war who are not Kings? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ saith, <hi>A certaine housholder delivered talents to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> will this infer to any conscience, that none but a housholder may take usurie? And when he saith, <hi>If the good man of the house knew at what houre the thiefe would come, he would watch</hi>; shall it follow, the sonne or servant may not watch the house, but onely the good man?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This may well be retorted, the Politique Head cannot then move, but upon politique reasons; and so the King cannot move to wars, but by the Law, and that is by consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no Law can principle the head to destroy the members. 2. If an Armie of cut-throats rise to destroy the Kingdome, because the King is in lacking, in his place, to doe his duty, how can the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges, the States and Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shall the inferiour Judges be guilty of innocent blood, because the King will not doe his duty? 3. The politique body ceaseth no more to renounce the principles of sinlesse nature, in self-defence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a politique body, and subject to a King, then it can leave off to sleep, eat and drink; and there is more need of politique prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the one, then the other. 4. The Parliaments and Estates of both Kingdoms move in these wars by the Kings Lawes, and are a formall politique body in themselves.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. <hi>The ground of the present wars against the King</hi> (saith D. <hi>Ferne,</hi> sect. 4. pag. 13.) <hi>is false, to wit, that the Parliament is coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate with the King, but so the King shall not be supreme, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments consent is required to an act of supremacie, but not to a denyall of that act. And there can no more</hi> (saith <hi>Arnisaeus de jure majestatis, c.</hi> 3. <hi>in quo consistat essen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> majest. c.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 1. <hi>and c.</hi> 2. <hi>an jur. majest. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. &amp;c. n.</hi> 2.) <hi>be two equall and coordinate supreme powers, then

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If we consider the fountaine-power,<note place="margin">Parliamentary power a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the King.</note> the King is subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Parliament, and not coordinate; for the constituent is above that which is constituted. If we regard the derived and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power in Parliamentarie acts, they make but a totall and compleat soveraigne power, yet so as the soveraigne power of the Parliament being habitually and underived, a prime and fountaine power, (for I doe not here separate people and Parliament) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without the King, for all Parliamentarie acts, as is cleare, in that the Parliament make Kings. 2. Make Lawes, raise Armies, when either the King is minor, captived, tyrannous, or dead, but Royall power Parliamentarie without the Parliament is null, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is essentially but a part of the Parliament, and can work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing separated from the Parliament, no more then a hand cut off from the body, can write; and so here we see two supremes coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate: Amongst infinite things there cannot be two, because it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volveth a contradiction, that an infinite thing can be created, for then should it be finite; but a royall power is essentially a derived and created power and supreme, <hi>secundum quid,</hi> onely in relation to single men, but not in relation to the Communitie; it is alwayes a creature of the communitie with leave of the Royalist. 2. It is false, that to an act of Parliamentarie supremacie the consent of the King is required, for it is repugnant that there can be any Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie judiciall act without the Parliament, but there may be without the King. 3. More false it is, that the King hath a negative voice in Parliament, then he shall be sole Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Parliament, the Kings Creator and Constituent, shall be a cypher.</p>

The question may be, which of these governments be most agreeable to nature? that is, either to nature in it selfe, as it agreeth, <hi>communiter,</hi> to all natures of elements, birds, beasts, Angels, Men, to lead them, as a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour doth, to their last end, or which government is most agreeable to men, to sinfull men, to sinfull men of this, or this Nation; for some Nations are more ambitious, some more factious; some are better ruled by one, some better ruled by many, some by most and by the people. 4. The question may be in regard of the facility or difficulty of loving, fearing, obeying and serving; and so it may be thought easier to love, feare and obey one Monarch then many Rulers, in respect that our Lord saith, it is difficult to serve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and possibly more difficult to serve twenty or an hundred. 5.

of the justice and equity of commanding; hence from this last I shall set downe the first Thesis.</p>

Though therefore the King should stand simply superiour to his kingdom and estates (which I shall never grant) yet if the King come under covenant with his kingdom, as I have proved at length c. 13. he must, by that same, come under some coactive power to fulfill his covenant, for <hi>omne promissum</hi> (saith the Law) <hi>cadit in debitum.</hi> What any doth promise falleth under debt, if the covenant be politique and civil, as is the covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>David</hi> and all <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. and between King <hi>Iehoash and the people,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.17, 18.<note place="margin">A promise lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a politique obligation on the promiser, and giveth law to him to whom the promise is made, to presse performance, or punish vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, when the promises are betwixt man and man.</note> Then the King must come under a civil obligation to performe the covenant, and though their be none superiour to King, and the people on earth to compell them both to performe what they have promised, yet <hi>de jure,</hi> by the Law of Nations, each may compell the other to mutuall perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:50873:206"/>
because nature teacheth to repel violence by violence, so it be done without desire of revenge and malice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is proved from the nature of a promise or covenant, for <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.1. <hi>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</hi> 2. <hi>Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, &amp; art taken with the words of thy mouth.</hi> But whence is it that a man free is now snared as a beast in a gin or trap? Certainly <hi>Solomon</hi> saith it is by a <hi>word</hi> and <hi>striking of hands,</hi> by a word of promise and covenant. Now the Creditor hath coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power, though he be an equall or an inferiour to the man who is surety, even by Law to force him to pay, and the Judge is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give his coactive power to the Creditor, that he may force the surety to pay. Hence it is cleare that a Covenant maketh a free man under the coactive power of law to an equall and to weaker, and the stronger is by the law of fraternity to help the weaker, with his coactive power, to cause the superiour fulfill his covenant. If then the King (giving, and not granting, he were superiour to his whole Kingdome) come under a covenant to them, to seek their good, not his owne, to defend true Protestant Religion, they have power to compell him to keep his covenant, and <hi>Scotland</hi> (if the King be stronger then <hi>England,</hi> and break his covenant to them.) is obliged by Gods law, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.11. to adde their forces and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power to help their brethren of <hi>England.</hi>

Now that a covenant bringeth the King under a politique obligation, as well as an oath is already proved, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Though it be a mans testament or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant no man disanulleth and addeth thereunto</hi>; No man even by mans law can anull a confirmed covenant, and therefore the man that made the covenant bringeth himself under law to fulfill his own covenant; and so must the King put himself under mens law, by a covenant at his Coronation. Yea and <hi>David</hi> is reputed by Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, an absolute Prince, yet he cometh under a covenant before he be
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:50873:207"/>
made King. 3. It is but a weak reason to say, <hi>that an oath is needlesse, where no action of law can be against the King who sweareth,</hi> if it have any strength of reason. I retort it, a legall and solemne promise then is needlesse also, for there is no action of law against a King (as Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists teach) if he violate his promise. So then King <hi>David</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly made a Covenant with the people at his Coronation; for though <hi>David</hi> should turne as bloody an enemie to the Church as <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Iulian,</hi> the people have no Law-action against <hi>David</hi>; and why then did <hi>Ieremiah</hi> seek an oath of the <hi>King of Iudah,</hi> that he <hi>would not kill him, nor deliver him into the hands of his enemies?</hi> and why did <hi>David</hi> seek an oath of <hi>Ionathan?</hi> It is not like <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Dav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id</hi> could have law-action against a King and a Kings son, if they should violate the oath of God.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Calumniator in the next words belieth himself, when he saith, <hi>We presuppose, that these with whom we are to enter in Lists, do willingly grant, That Government is not onely lawfull and just, but necessary both for Church and Common-wealth:</hi> then we fancie no such thing as he imputeth to us.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>Some said, that the right of Dominion is founded on grace; whether the</hi> Waldenses <hi>and</hi> Hus, <hi>held any such Tenet, I cannot now insist to prove, or disprove.</hi> Gerson <hi>and others held, that there must be a new Title and Right to what men possesse: Too many too confidently hold these, or the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That Dominion is founded upon Grace, as its essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Pillar; so as wicked men be no Magistrates, because they are in mortall sin, was falsly imputed to ancient Protestants, the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses, Wickcliff,</hi> and <hi>Hus,</hi> by <hi>Papists</hi>; and this day by <hi>Iesuites, Suarez, Bellarmine, Becan.</hi> The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> will leave them under this Calumny, that he may offend Papists and Iesuites as little as he can, but he would lay it on us; but if the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> think, that Dominion is not founded on Grace, <hi>de jure,</hi> that Rulers should have that spirit that God put on the seventy Elders for their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that they ought not to be <hi>men fearing God, and hating covetousnesse,</hi> as <hi>Gerson</hi> and others did, he belieth the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no errour of <hi>Gerson,</hi> that beleevers have a spirituall Right to their civill possessions, but by Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.7.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>The Iesuites are ashamed of the errour of Casuists, who hold that,</hi> directum imperium, <hi>the direct and primary power, Supreme, Civill, and Ecclesiasticall, is in the Pope; and therefore, they give an indirect directive, and coercive power to him, over Kings and States,</hi> in ordine ad spiritualia: <hi>So may he King and un-King Princes at his pleasure. Our Presbyterians, if they run not fully this way, are very neer to it.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Windy man would seem versed in <hi>School-men,</hi> he should have named some <hi>Casuists,</hi> who hold any like thing.</p>

How will this black mouthed Calumniator, make Presbyterians to dethrone <hi>Kings?</hi> He hath written a Pamphlet of the inconsistency of Monarchie and Presbyterian Government, consisting of lies, invented Calumnies of his Church, in which he was baptized. But the truth is, all his Arguments prove the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencie of Monarchs and Parliaments, and transform any King in a most absolute Tyrant; for which Treason he deserveth to suffer as a Traytor.</p>

no wayes the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> for a lawfull <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Pastor</hi> at all: But this <hi>Popish Prelate</hi> doth acknowledge him, for he hath these words, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 58. <hi>It is high presumption in the Pope, to challenge to himself, the Title or Right of Christs universall Vicar on earth, by Divine right. The Pope, the Bishop of Rome, hath no more by Divine right, (what he may have by positive Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call right, is not pertinent for us now to examine and discusse) no higher priviledge (except it be in extent) then the meanest Bishop of the world in his Diocesse.</hi> And amongst all proofes, he passing by Scriptures, which should prove, or improve a Divine right, he will content himselfe with one proofe of <hi>Cyprian, de unitat.

They make good that he is a Papist: for, 1. <hi>It is presumption in the Pope to challenge to himselfe, that he is Christs Vniversall Vicar on Earth by Divine right.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The P.

               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Popes supremacie,</hi> by Papists, is expresly reckoned amongst unwritten Traditions, and so there is no necessitie that the right of it be proved from Scripture.</p>

And in extent the Pope hath by Divine right more then other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have. Now what is the Pope of Rome his extent? All knowes it is the whole Catholike visible Church on earth.

the grounds of <hi>Suarez</hi> and other Iesuites, that <hi>our Religion is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> they doe soundly collect this consequence, <hi>That no King can be Lord of the consciences of their subjects, to compell them to an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Religion.</hi> We teach that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath no power over the consciences of Protestant Subjects, to force them to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and that their soules are not his subjects, but only their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and <hi>in the Lord.</hi> 2.

As the King maketh a Lieutenant in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>not to denude himselfe of his Royall power, but to put him in trust for his service. If this be their mind, the King is in a poore case. The principal authority is in the Deligate, and so the people is still Iudge, and the King their Deputy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>P. Prelate</hi> taketh on him to write he knoweth not what, this is not our opinion. The <hi>King</hi> is <hi>King,</hi> and hath the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples power not as their Deputy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the people is not principall Iudge, and the <hi>King</hi> subordinate. The <hi>King</hi> in the executive power of Lawes, is really a Soveraigne above the people, a Deputy is not so.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The people have irrevocably made over to the <hi>King,</hi> their power of governing, defending, and protecting themselves, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the power of selfe preservation, which people can no more make away, it being sinlesse natures birth-right then the liberty of eating, drinking, sleeping; and this the people cannot resume, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in case of the <hi>Kings Tyranny,</hi> there is no power by the <hi>King</hi> so irrevocably resigned to his Servant or Deputy, but he may use it himselfe.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Who speaketh so the <hi>P.

               <p n="4">4. Are they only <hi>possible and accidentall?</hi> but make a Monarch absolute, as the <hi>P.

               <p>
                  <hi>P. Prelate, They inferre,</hi> 1. <hi>They cannot without violation of a Divine ordinance, and breach of faith resume the authority, they have placed in the King.</hi> 2. It <hi>were high sin to rob authority of its essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials.</hi> 3. <hi>This ordinance is not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and hath urgent reasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. These namelesse Authors cannot inferre that an Oath is broken, which is made conditionally; all authority given by the people to the King is conditionall, that he use it for the safety of the people, if it be used for their distruction, they breake no faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it, for they never made faith to give up their power to the King upon such tearmes, and so they <hi>cannot be said to resume what they never gave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. So the <hi>P. Prelate</hi> maketh power to act all the former mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, the <hi>essentialls of a King. Balaam</hi> he is not worthy his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for Prophecying thus, that the Kings essentialls is a power of blood, and destructive to people, Law, Religion and liberties of Church and State, for otherwise we teach not, that people may resume from the King Authority and power of disarme Papists, to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:50873:216"/>
roote out the <hi>bloody Irish,</hi> and in justice serve them, as they have served us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ordinance of the people giving lawfull power to a King, for the governing of the people in peace and godlinesse, <hi>is Gods good pleasure, and hath just reasons and causes.</hi> But that the people make over a power to one man, to act all the inconveniences above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I mean the bloody and destructive inconveniences, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God, or reason in it.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>The reasons of this opinion are.</hi> 1. <hi>If Power soveraigne were not in one, he could not have strength enough to act all necessary parts and acts of government.</hi> 2. <hi>Nor to prevent divisions which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend multitudes, or many indowed with equall power; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors say, They must part with their native right entirely, for a greater good, and to prevent greater evills.</hi> 3. <hi>To resume any part of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, of which the people have totally devested themselves, or to limit it, is to disable Soveraignty from government, loose the sinewes of all society, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I know none for this opinion,<note place="margin">Soveraigne power in the King, but not power of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</note> but the P. Prelate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The first Reason may be made rhyme, but never reason: for though there be not absolute power to good and ill, there may be strength of limited power in abundance in the <hi>King,</hi> and sufficient for all acts of just Government, and the adequate end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is, <hi>salus populi,</hi> the safetie of the people. But the <hi>Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi> will have strength to be a Tyrant, and act all the Tyrannicall and bloody inconveniences of which we spake, <hi>an essentiall part of the power of a King</hi>; As if weaknesse were essentiall to strength; and a <hi>King</hi> could not be powerfull as a <hi>King,</hi> to doe good, and save and protect, except he had power also as a <hi>Tyrant</hi> to doe evill, and to destroy and waste his people, This power is weaknesse, and no part of the image of the greatnesse of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> whom a <hi>King</hi> representeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Reason condemneth <hi>Democracie</hi> and <hi>Aristocracie,</hi> as unlawfull, and maketh Monarchie the only Physick to <hi>cure</hi> these; as if there were no Government an ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> save only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarchie, which indeed is no ordinance of <hi>God</hi> at all, but contrary to the nature of a lawfull <hi>King,</hi> Deut. 17.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That people <hi>must part with their native right totally,</hi> to make an absolute Monarch; is, as if the whole members of the Body would part with their whole nutritive power, to cause the Milt to swell;
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:50873:217"/>
which would be the destruction of the Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The people cannot divest themselves of power of defensive Warres, more then they can part with Nature, and put themselves in a condition inferior to a slave, who, if his master, who hath power to sell him, invade him unjustly, to take away his life, may oppose violence to unjust violence. And the other Consequences are null.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We give a reason why <hi>God</hi> hath a Lieutenant, as <hi>God</hi>; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Kings are Gods, bearing the sword of vengeance against se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and bloody Prelates, and other ill-doers. But <hi>Christ, God-Man,</hi> the Mediator and <hi>Head of the body the Church,</hi> hath neither <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>King</hi> to be head under him.

But we place no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie in Presbyteries, but a meere ministeriall power of servants, who doe not take on them to make Lawes and Religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as Prelates doe, who indeed make themselves Kings and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers in Gods house.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> You declare hereby, that the <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>ministeriall Head</hi> of the Church, under the head <hi>Christ.</hi> All our Divines disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Popes headship, say, No mortall man hath shoulders for

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.

his Vicegerents, yea and all the damned men and Devils, and Death and Hell are his Vicegerents: for <hi>Christ,</hi> as Mediator, hath <hi>all power</hi> given to him, as <hi>King of the Church,</hi> and so power Kingly over all his enemies, <hi>to reigne while he make them his footstoole,</hi> Ps. 110.1.2. <hi>to break them with a rod of iron,</hi> Ps. 2.9. 1 Cor. 15.24, 25, 26, 27.

The Prelate degradeth
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:50873:218"/>
the King here, to make him onely keep, or preserve the Prelates Masse-Clothes: they intended indeed to make the <hi>King</hi> but the Popes servant, for all they say and do for him now.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the <hi>King be vicegerent of Christ</hi> in prescribing Laws for the externall ordering of the worship, and all their decent symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Ceremonies: What more doth the Pope, and the Prelate in that kinde? He may, with as good warrant Preach and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>Kings have the sign of the Crosse on their Crowns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Baculus est in angulo.</hi> Prelates have put a crosse in the Kings heart, and crossed Crown and Throne to Really. Some Knights, some Ships, some Cities and Burroughes, do carry a crosse; are they made <hi>Christs vice-gerents</hi> of late? By what antiquity doth the Crosse signifie Christ? Of old it was a badge of Christians, no Religious Ceremony; and is this all. The <hi>King</hi> is the vicegerent of <hi>Christians.</hi> The Prelates we know, adore the Crosse with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship: so must they adore the Crown.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>Grant that the Pope were the Vicar of Christ in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, it followeth not:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Kings Crowns are subject to the Pope; for Papists teach, that all power that was in Christ, as man, as power to work miracles, to institute Sacraments, was not transmitted to</hi> Peter <hi>and his successors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a base consequence, Make the Pope head of the Church: the King, if he be a mixed person, that is, half a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Christs Vice-gerent; both he and Prelates must be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the head. Papists teach, that all in Christ as man, cannot be transmitted to <hi>Peter,</hi> but a Ministeriall Catholike Headship (say <hi>Batcanus</hi> and his fellows) was transmitted from <hi>Christ</hi> as man, and visible head, to <hi>Peter</hi> and the Pope.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>I wish the Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The P. Prelate prayeth for the Pope.</note> 
                  <hi>who claimeth so neer alliance with Christ, would learn of him to be meek and humble in heart; so should he finde rest to his own soul, to Church and State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The same was the wish of <hi>Gerson, Occam,</hi> the Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> the fathers of the Concels of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi>; yet all make him <hi>head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Excommunicate Prelate is turned Chaplain to Preach to the Pope: the <hi>Soul-rest</hi> that Protestants wish to the Pope is, <hi>That the Lord would destroy him by the Spirit of his mouth,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.8. But <hi>P. Prelates,</hi> This wish is a Reformation of accidents,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:50873:219"/>
with the safety of the subject, the Pope, and is as good as a wish, That the Devill remaining a Devill, may finde rest for his soul, all we are to pray for; as having place in the Church, are supposed members of the Church. The Prelate would not pray so for the Presbytery, by which he was ordained a Pastour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. though he be now an Apostate: It is gratitude to pray for his lucky father the Pope. What ever the Prelate wish, we pray for, and beleeve, that desolation shall be his Soul-rest, and that the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Lord, and of his Temple, shall fall upon him, and the Prelates his sons.</p>
               <p>P. Prelate. <hi>That which they purpose, by denying Kings to be Christs Vice-gerents, is to set up a Soveraignty Ecclesiasticall in Presbyteries, to constrain Kings, repeal his Laws, correct his Satutes, reverse his Judgements, to cite, convent, and censure Kings; and if there be not power to execute, what Presbyteries decrees, they may call and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the help of the people, in whom is the underived Majstie; and promise, and swear, and covenant to defend their fancies, against all mortall men, with their Goods, Lands, Fortunes, to admit no divisive motion; and this Soveraign Association maketh every private man an armed Magistrate.</hi>

                  </note>3. For reversing of Laws made for the establishing of Popery, we think the Church of Christ did well to declare all these unjust grievous decrees; and that woe is due to the Iudges, even the Queen, if they should not repent, as <hi>Isai.</hi> 10.1. And this P. must shew his teeth in this, against our Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:50873:219"/>
he once commended in Pulpit, as a glorious work of Gods right arm. And the Assemble of <hi>Glaskow,</hi> 1637. declared, That Bishops though established by Acts of Parliament, procured by Prelates onely, Commissioners, and Agents, for the Church, who betrayed their trust, were unlawfull, and did supplicate, That the ensuing Parliament would annull these wicked Acts. They think God pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledgeth neither King, nor others from Church-Censures: the <hi>P. Prelates</hi> imprisoned, and silenced the Ministers of Christ, who preached against the publike sins, the blood, oppressions, unjustice, open swearing, and blasphemy of the holy Name of God, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in King and Court.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They did never sought the help of the people, against the most unjust standing Law of authority.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They never swear and covenant, to defend their own fancies,</hi> For the Confession and Covenant of the Protestant Religion, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Latin to all the Protestants in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> being termed a fancie, is a clear evidence, That this <hi>P. Prelate</hi> was justly excommunicated for Popery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Covenant was sworn by King <hi>James,</hi> and his house, by the whole Land, by the Prelates themselves. And to this fancy, this <hi>P. Prelate</hi> by the Law of our Land was obliged to swear, when he received degrees in the Universitie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is reason our Covenant should provide <hi>against divisive motions.</hi> The Prelates moved the King to command all the Land to swear our Covenant, in the Prelaticall sense, against the intent thereof, and onely to devide, and so command. Iudge what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Prelates are of, who will have the Name of God prophaned by a whole Nation, by swearing fancies.</p>

                  <hi>Answ. Vzzah</hi> did not burn Incense, <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> as if he had been a Priest, but because he was a King, and Gods anointed. Prelates sit not in Councell and Parliament, <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lords. The Pope is no temporall Monarch, <hi>ex vi ordinis</hi>; yet
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:50873:220"/>
all are intruders. So the P. P. <hi>will licence Kings</hi> to administer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, so they doe it not <hi>Ex vi ordinis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.P. Men in sacred Orders in things intrinsecally spirituall, have immediatly a directive and authoritative power, in order, to all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, although ministeriall only, as related to Christ; but that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them no coercive civill power over the Prince,</hi> per se, <hi>or</hi> per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens, <hi>directly or indirectly, that either the one way or the other, any or many in sacred Order, Pope, or Presbytery, can cite and censure Kings, associate, Covenant or sweare to resist him, and force him to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Scepter of Christ. This power over man God Almighty useth not, much lesse hath he given it to man,</hi> Ps. 110. <hi>His people are a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling people,</hi> Suadenda non cogenda religio.</p>

So here a Lordly power Pastors have over <hi>Kings,</hi> by the <hi>P. P.</hi> way. We teach it is ministeriall in relation to all, because Ministers can make no Lawes as Kings can doe, but only as <hi>Heralds,</hi> declare <hi>Christs Lawes.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. None of us give any coercive Civill power to the Church, over either <hi>Kings,</hi> or any other, it is Ecclesiasticall; a power to rebuke and censure was never civill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A religious Covenant to sweare to resist that is, to defend our selves is one thing, and a lawfull Oath, as is cleare in those of <hi>Israel,</hi> that did sweare <hi>Asa's</hi> Covenant, without the authority of their owne King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.9, 10, 11, 12. and to sweare to force the King to submit to <hi>Christs</hi> Scepter is another thing; the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery never did sweare or covenant any such thing: nor doe we take Sacrament upon it, to force the <hi>King.</hi> Prelates have made the King sweare, and take his Sacrament upon it, that he shall roote out Puritanes, that is Protestants, whereas he did sweare at his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to roote out Heretickes; that is, (if Prelates were not traiterous in administring the Oath) <hi>Arminians and Papists,</hi> such as this P. P. is knowne to be; but I hold that the Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> have power to punish the <hi>King,</hi> if he labour to subvert Religion and Lawes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If this Argument, that Religion <hi>is to be perswaded, not forced, which</hi>

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:50873:221"/>
The King is priviledged from all Church power. Let the P.P. see to it; I see no inconvenience for reciprocations of subjections in two Supremes; and that they may mutually censure and judge one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Not in the same cause; that is impossible. If the King say Masse, shall the Church judge and censure the King for intrusion? and because the King is also Soveraigne and Supreme in his kinde, he may judge and punish the Church for their act of judging and censuring the King; it being an intrusion on his prerogative, that any should judge the highest Judge.</hi>

But the former is an evident truth, by our Acts of Parliament; <hi>ergo,</hi> so is the latter. The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is confirmed; 1. Because what ever Law enjoyneth passive obedience no way but by Lawes; that must injoyne also the King actively to command no other way but by Law: for to be governed by Law, essentially includeth, to be governed by the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, only by Law. 2. An act of Regall governing, is an act of Law, and essentially an act of Law; an act of absolute Prerogative is no act of Law, but an act above Law, or of pleasure loosed from
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:50873:223"/>
Law; and so they are opposed as acts of Law, and non acts of Law. If the Subjects, by command of the King and Parliament, cannot be governed but by Law; How can the <hi>King</hi> but be under his own, and the Parliaments Law, to governe only by Law?

               <p n="5">5. The former Act of Parliament ratifieth the true Religion, according to the Word of God, then could it never have been the intent of our Parliament, to ratifie an Absolute supremacy, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, a King might govern his people, as a Tyrannous Lion, contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. And 'tis true: The 18.

               </p>
               <p>These two Acts, for my part I acknowledge, spoken rather in <hi>Court-expressions,</hi> then in <hi>Law-termes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Because personall vertues cannot advance a limited Prince (such as the Kings of <hi>Scotland, Post hominum memoriam,</hi> ever were) to be an Absolute Prince: Personall graces make not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> absolutely <hi>supreme Judge over all persons and causes</hi>; nor can King <hi>James,</hi> advanced to be King of <hi>England,</hi> be for that, made more King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and more supreme Iudge, then he was, while he was onely King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> A wicked Prince is as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially supreme Iudge, as a godly King.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:50873:224"/>2. If this Parliamentary figure of speech which is to be imputed to the times, exalted King <hi>James</hi> to be Absolute in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for his personall indowments, there was no ground to put the same on King <hi>Charls.</hi> Personall vertues are not alway Hereditary, though to me the present King be the best.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is not any Absolutenesse above Law in the Act. 1. The Parliament must be more absolute themselves. King <hi>James</hi> 6. had been divers yeers before this 18. Parl. King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; then if they gave him by Law an Absolutenesse, which he had not before, then they were more Absolute. These who can adde Absolutenesse, must have it in themselves, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> if it be said, <hi>King James had that before the Act, the Parliament legally declared it to be his power, which before the Declaration, was his power.</hi> I answer, All he had before this Declaration was, to <hi>govern the people according to Law and Conscience,</hi> and no more; and if they declare no other Prerogative Royall to be due to him, there is an end, we grant all. But then this which they call <hi>Prerogative Royall</hi> is no more, then, a power to govern according to Law, and so you adde nothing to King <hi>James,</hi> upon the ground of his personall vertues, onely you make an oration to his praise in the <hi>Acts of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If this Absolutenesse of Prerogative, be given to the <hi>King,</hi> the subjects swearing obedience, swear, That he hath power from themselves, to destroy themselves: this is neither a lawfull oath, nor though they should swear it, doth it oblige them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Supreme Iudge, is a supreme father of all his children, and all their causes; and to be a supreme Father, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a supreme Iudge: but contrary it must be, if this supremacy make over to the Prince, a power of devouring as a Lyon, and that by a regall priviledge, and by office, whereas he should be a father to save; or if a Iudge kill an ill-doer, though that be an act destructive to one man, yet is it an act of a father to the Common-wealth. An act of supreme and absolute <hi>Royaltie</hi> is often an act of destruction to one particular man, and to the whole Common-wealth. For example, when the King out of his Absolute Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, pardoneth a murtherer, and he killeth another innocent man, and out of the same ground, the King pardoneth him again, and so till he kill twenty (for by what reason the Prerogative giveth one pardon, he may give twenty, there is a like reason above Law for all.) This act of Absolute <hi>Royaltie,</hi> is such an act of murther, as if
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:50873:224"/>
a shepherd would keep a Woolf in the fold with the sheep, he were guilty of the losse of these sheep. Now an act of destroying, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an act of judging, far lesse of a supreme Iudge, but of a supreme Murtherer; 7. Whereas he is called <hi>Absolute Prince, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge, in all Causes, Ecclesiasticall and Civill.</hi> It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, 1. That the Estates professe in these acts,<note place="margin">How the King is supreme Iudge in all Causes.</note> not to give any new Prerogative, but onely to continue the old power, and that onely with that amplitude, and freedom, which the King and his Predecessors did enjoy and exerce of before: the extent whereof, is best known from the Acts of Parliament, Histories of the time, and the Oaths of the Kings of <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2. That he is called Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince, not in any relation <hi>of freedom, from Law, or Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive above Law</hi>; whereunto as unto the <hi>norma, regula, ac mensura potestatis suae, ac subjectionis meae,</hi> He is tyed by the Fundamentall Law, and his own Oath, but in opposition to all forraign Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or principalitie above him, as is evident, by the Oath of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> set down, for acknowledging of his power in the first Act of Parliament 21. K. <hi>Iam.</hi> 6. 3. They are but the same expressions, giving onely the same power before acknowledged in the 129. Act. <hi>Parl.</hi> 8. K. <hi>Iam.</hi> 6. And that onely over Persons or Estates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered <hi>Separatim,</hi> and over Causes; but neither at all over the Laws, nor over the Estates, taken <hi>Conjunctim,</hi> and as convened in Parliament, as is clear, both by the two immediately subsequent Acts of that Parliament 8.

The very termes of <hi>Supreme Iudge, and in all Causes,</hi> according to the nature of Correlates, presupposeth Courts, and judiciall Proceedings and Laws, as the ground work and rule of all, not a freedom from them. 5. The sixth Act of the twenty Parliament, K. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. Cleerly interpreteth what is meant by the Kings Iurisdiction <hi>in all Spirituall and Ecclesiastick Causes</hi>: to wit, to be onely in the Consistoriall Causes of <hi>Matrimony, Testaments, Bastardy, Adulteries,</hi> abusively called Spirituall Causes, because

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Supreame Iudge in all causes,</hi> cannot be taken <hi>Quoad actus elicitos,</hi> as if the <hi>King</hi> were to judge between two Sea-men, or two Husband-men, or two Trades-men, in that which is proper to their Art; or between two Painters: certainly the <hi>King</hi> is not to Iudge which of the two draweth the fairest Picture, but which of the two wasteth most gold on his Picture, and so doth interest most of the Common-wealth. So the <hi>King</hi> cannot judge in all Ecclesiasticall Causes, that is, he cannot, <hi>Quoad actos elicitos,</hi> prescribe this Worship: for example, the <hi>Masse,</hi> not the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> Therefore the <hi>King</hi> hath but <hi>Actus imperatos,</hi> some Royall Politicall Acts about the Worship of God to command <hi>God</hi> to be Worshipped according to his Word, to punish the superstitions or neglectors of Divine Worship; therefore cannot the King be sole Iudge in matters that belong to the Colledge of Iudges by the Lawes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lords of Session onely may judge these maters. K. Iames, 1. Parl. 2. Act. 45. K. Iames 3. Par. 8. Act 62. K. Iames 3. Par. 4. Act. 105. K. I. 1. Parl. 6. Act. 83. K. I. 1. Par. 6 Act. 86. K. I. 5. Par. 7. Act. 104. and that only according to Law, without any remedy of appellation to <hi>King</hi> or the Parliament, Act 62, and 63. Par. 14. K. I. 2. And the King is <hi>by Act of Parliament inhibited to send any private letter to stay the Acts of Iustice; or if any such letter be procured, the Iudges are not to acknowledge it, as the Kings Will, for they are to proceed unpartially according to Iustice,</hi> and are to make the Law, which is the <hi>King and Parliaments</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick revealed will, their rule, King I. 5. Parl. 5. Act. 68. K. Ia. 6. Part. 8. Act. 139. and K. I. 6. Par. 6. Act. 92. most lawfull.

Act 47. and so if the Kings Will or desire, as he is a man, be opposite to his Law, and his Will as <hi>King,</hi> it is not to be regarded. This is a strong Argument, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments never made the King supreame Iudge, <hi>Quoad actus elicitos,</hi> in all causes, nay not if the King have a Cause of his owne that concerneth Lands of the Crowne; farre lesse can the King have a will of Prerogative above the Law by our Lawes of <hi>Scotland</hi>:

And therefore, when in the eighth Parliament King <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. the Kings Royall Power is established in the first Act, the very next act immediatly subjoyned thereunto declareth the authority of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Court of Parliament continued past all memory of man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day, and constitute of the free voices of the three estates of this ancient <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which in the Parliament 1606. is called, <hi>The ancient and fundamentall policy of this Kingdome</hi>; and so fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as if it should be innovate, such confusion would ensue, as it could no more be a free Monarchy, as is exprest in the Parliaments printed Commission, 1604. by whom the same under <hi>God</hi> hath been upholden, rebellious and traiterous subjects punished, the good and faithfull preserved and maintained, and the Lawes and Acts of Parliament (by which all men are governed) made and established, and appointeth the Honour, Authority, and Dignity of the Estates of Parliament to stand in their owne integrity, according to the ancient and laudable custome by past, without alteration or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, and therefore dischargeth any to presume or take in hand, <hi>To impugne the dignity, and the authority of the said Estates, or to seeke, or procure the innovation, or diminution of their power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under the paine of Treason</hi>: and therefore in the next Act, they discharge all Iurisdictions, or Judicatories (albeit appointed by the <hi>Kings Majesty,</hi> as the High Commission was,) <hi>without their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and approbation</hi>; and that as <hi>contrary to the fundamentall Laws,</hi> above titled, 48.

to sweare and make their faithfull Covenant to the true Kirk of God, that they shall maintaine, defend, and set forward the true Religion confessed and established within this Realme; even as they are obliged and astricted by the Law of God, aswell in</hi> Deuteronomie, <hi>as in the</hi> 11 chap. of the 2. book of the Kings; <hi>and as they crave obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their subjects.</hi> So that the bond and contract shall be mutuall and reciprocall, in all time comming, between the Prince and the People, according to the Word of God; as is fully exprest in the Register of the convention of Estates, <hi>Iuly</hi> 1567.</p>

But to goe on, and leave some high mysteries unto a rejoynder.</p>
               <p>And to the end I may make good, that nothing is here taught, in this Treatise, but the very Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I desire that the Reader may take notice of the <hi>larger Confession of the Church of Scotland,</hi> printed with the Syntagme and body of the Confessions, at <hi>Geneva, anno</hi> MDCXII. and authorized by King <hi>Iames</hi> the 6. and the three Estates in Parliament; and printed in our Acts of Parliament, <hi>Parl.</hi> 15. <hi>K. Iames</hi> 6. <hi>An.</hi> 1567. Amongst good works of the Second Table, saith our Confession, <hi>art.</hi> 14. are these: <hi>To honour Father, Mother, Princes, Rulers, and superiour Powers: To love them, to support them, yea to obey their Charge, (not repugning to the commandement of God) to save the lives of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, to represse Tyrannie, to defend the oppressed, to keep our bodies cleane and holy, &amp;c.</hi> The contrary whereof is, <hi>To disobey or resist any that God hath placed in Authoritie, (while they passe not over the bounds of their office) to murther, or to consent thereunto, to beare ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or to let innocent blood be shed, if we may withstand it, &amp;c.</hi> Now the <hi>Confession</hi> citeth in the margin, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.1.7. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. where it is evident, by the name of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:50873:226"/>
all inferiour Iudges as well as the <hi>King,</hi> and especially the <hi>Princes, Rulers, and Lords of Parliament are understood.</hi> 2. Ezek. 22. The bloody City is to be judged, because they releeved <hi>not the oppressed out of the hand of bloody Princes, v.</hi> 6. <hi>who every one of them were to their power to shed innocent blood.</hi> 3. To resist superiour powers, and so the Estates of Parliament, as the <hi>Cavaliers of Scotland</hi> doe, is resistance forbidden, <hi>Romans</hi> 13.1. the <hi>place is also cited in the confession.</hi> And the Confession exponeth the place, <hi>Romans</hi> 13. according to the interpretation of all sound Expositers; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in these words, Art. 24. <hi>And therefore we confesse and avouch, that such as resist the supreame power, doing that thing which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to his charge, doe resist Gods ordinance, and therefore cannot be guiltlesse. And further we affirme, that whosoever denyeth unto them aide, their counsell and comfort, while as the Princes and Rulers vigilantly travell in execution of their Office, that the same men deny their helpe, support and counsell to God, who by the presence of his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant craves it of them.</hi> From which words we have cleare:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That to <hi>resist the King</hi> or Parliament, is to resist them, <hi>while as they</hi> are <hi>doing the thing that appertaineth to their charge, and while they vigilantly travell in the execution of their office.</hi> But while King and Parliament doe acts of Tyranny against Gods Law, and all good Lawes of men, they doe not the things that <hi>appertaine to their charge and the execution of their Office</hi>; ergo by our confession, to resist them in Tyrannicall acts is, not to resist the ordinance of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>resist Princes and Rulers, and so inferiour Iudges, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them counsell and comfort, is to deny helpe, counsell, and comfort to God.</hi> Let then <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> and such as refuse to helpe the Princes of the Land against <hi>Papists, Prelates,</hi> and <hi>Malignants</hi> know, that they resist <hi>Gods ordinance,</hi> which rebellion they unjustly impute to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas it is added in our Confession, that <hi>God by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Lieutenant craveth support and counsell of the people.</hi> It is not so to be taken, as if then only we are to ayde and helpe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iudges and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> when the <hi>King</hi> personally requireth it, and not other waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>King</hi> requireth helpe, when by his Office he is obliged to require our helpe and counsell against Papists and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, though as misled, he should command the contrary: so if the Law require our helpe, the <hi>King</hi> requireth it <hi>ex officio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This should expresly contradict our confession, if none were
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:50873:227"/>
obliged to give helpe and counsell to the <hi>Parliament</hi> and Estates, except the <hi>King</hi> in his own person should require it, because Art. 14. it is expresly said, That to <hi>save the lives of innocents, or represse Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, to defend the oppressed, —not to suffer innocent blood to be shed</hi>; or <hi>workes pleasing to God, which he rewardeth.</hi> Now we are not to thinke in reason, if the <hi>King</hi> shall be induced by wicked Counsell, to doe tyrannicall workes, and to raise Papists in Armes against Protestants, that <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>by him as</hi> by his Lieutenant, require our helpe, comfort and counsell, in assisting the <hi>King</hi> in acts of Tyranny, and in oppression, and in shedding innocent blood; yea our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession tyeth us to deny helpe and comfort to the King in these wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked acts, and therefore our helpe must be in the things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to his Royall Office, and duty only; otherwise we are to <hi>represse all tyranny,</hi> art 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>To save the lives of innocents, to represse Tyranny, to defend the oppressed,</hi> are by our confession good workes, well pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> and so is this a good worke, <hi>not to suffer innocent blood to be shed, if we may withstand it.</hi> Hence it is cleare as the Sunne, that our confession according to the Word of <hi>God,</hi> to which <hi>King Charles</hi> did sweare at his Coronation, doth oblige and tye us in the <hi>presence of God, and his holy Angels to</hi> rise in Armes, <hi>to save the innocent, to represse Tyranny, to defend the oppressed.</hi> When the King induced by ill counsell sent Armies by Sea and Land, to kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the whole Kingdome who should refuse such a Service-booke, as they could not in conscience receive, except they would disobey God, renounce the confession of Faith, which the King and they had sworne unto, and prove perfidious Apostates to Christ and his Church, what could we doe, and that the same Confession, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our bonds to our deare Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> layeth bonds on us, to this as a good worke also, not <hi>to suffer their innocent blood to be shed,</hi> but to defend them; when they against all Law of God, of men, to State, of Nations, are destroyed and killed. For my part, I judge, it had been a guiltinesse of blood upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> if we had not helped them, and risen in Armes to defend our selves, and our innocent brethren against bloody Cavaliers. Adde to this what is in the 24. Article of the same Confession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We confesse—whosoever goeth about to take away, or to confound the whole state of Civill Polity, now long established; we affirme the same men, not only to be enemies to mankind, but also wickedly to fight
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:50873:227"/>
against Gods Will.</hi> But these who have taken Armes against the Estates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Princes and Rulers of the Land, have laboured to take away Parliaments, and the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, <hi>ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Confession addeth, 16. <hi>We farther confesse and acknowledge, that such persons as are placed in authority, are to be loved, honoured, feared, and holden in most reverent estimation; because that they are Lieutenants of God, in whose Sessions God himselfe doth sit and Iudge: yea even the Iudges and Princes themselves, to whom by God is given the sword, to the praise and defence of good men, and to revenge and punish all open malefactors. Ergo</hi> the Parliament, and Princes, and Rulers of the Land are Gods Lieutenants on earth, no lesse then the King by our Confession of Faith, and those who resist them, resist the ordinance of God. <hi>Royalists</hi> say, They are but the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the King, and when they doe contrary to his Royall Will, they may be resisted, yea and killed, for in so farre they are private men, though they are to be honoured as Iudges, when they act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Kings Will whose Deputies they are. But I answer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a wonder that inferiour Judges should be formally Iudges, in so far as they act conforme to the will of a mortall King, and not in so far as they act conforme to the will of the King of Kings, seeing the judgement they execute is the King of Kings, and not the Iudgement of a mortall King, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Royalists</hi> cannot indure the former distinction as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the King, but they receive it with both hands, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to inferiour Iudges; and yet certaine it is, that it is as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for a King being a sinfull man, to act sometimes as the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of God, and sometimes as an erring and misinformed man, no lesse then the inferiour Iudge acteth sometimes according to the Kings will and Law, and sometimes according to his owne private way; and if we are to obey the inferiour Iudge as the Deputy of the King, what shall become of his Person, when Cavaliers may kill him at some <hi>Edge-hill?</hi> for so they mock this distinction, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the King in regard of his Person, and of his Royall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and for this point our Confession citeth in the Margin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.1. which places doe clearely prove: 1. That inferiour Magistrates are: 1. Gods ordinances. 2. Gods on earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 3. Such as beare the Lords sword. 4. <hi>That they are not only (as the Confession saith) appointed for Civill
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:50873:228"/>
policie, but also for maintenance of true Religion, and for suppressing of idolatrie and superstition.</hi> Then it is evident, to resist inferior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, is to resist God himselfe, and to labour to throw the sword out of Gods hands. 5, Our Confession useth the same Scriptures cited by <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> to wit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and Ier. 22.3. where we are, no lesse then the Iewes, commanded to <hi>execute judgement and righteousnesse, and deliver the spoyled out of the hands of the oppressour.</hi> For both the Law of God, and the Civill Law saith, <hi>Qui non impedit homicidium, quum potest, is homicidii reus est.</hi> I will cast in a word of other Confessions, lest we seeme to be Iesuites alone.</p>
               <p>The Confession of <hi>Helvetia</hi> saith, <hi>c.</hi> 30. <hi>de Magistratu.—Viduas, pupillos, afflictos asserat:</hi> Every <hi>Magistrate</hi> is to defend the widow, the orphan, and the oppressed. The French Confession saith, <hi>art.</hi> 40. <hi>Affirmamus ergo parendumesse Legibus &amp; Statutis, solvenda Tributa, subjectionis denique jugum voluntariè tolerandum, etiamsi infideles fuerint Magistratus, dummodo Dei summum imperium integrum &amp; illibatum maneat.</hi> So cleare it is, that all active obedience, is due to all <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and that that yoake of passive obedience is to be tolerated, but conditionally, with a <hi>dummodo,</hi> so as the <hi>Magistrate</hi> violate not the supreme commandement of the <hi>King of Kings.</hi> And we know accordingly,<note place="margin">

               <p>The 37. Art. of the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Confession, is so far from erecting an absolute power in the King, that they expresly bring down the Royall Prerogative from the high seat and transcendent superlative power above the Law; and expone the <hi>Prerogative</hi> to be nothing but <hi>meere Law-power. We only</hi> (say they) <hi>ascribe that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to the King, which the Scripture doth ascribe to all Godly Princes, that is, that they cause all committed to their trust, whether Ecclesiasticall or Civill persons, doe their duty; and punish with the Civill sword, all disobedient offenders.</hi> In syntag.

                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:50873:228"/>So the 36.

For, shall it be a good plea in the day of Christ, to say, <hi>Lord Iesus, we would have used thy sword against bloody Murtherers, if thy Anoynted, the King, had not commanded us to obey a mortall King rather than the King of ages; and to execute no judgement for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, because he judged them faithfull Catholike subjects.</hi> Let all <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and <hi>Cavalier Doctors</hi> in the three Kingdomes, satisfie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men in this, that inferior Iudges are to obey a Divine Law, with a <hi>proviso,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> command them so to doe; and otherwise they are to obey <hi>Men rather then God.</hi> This is evidently holden forth in the <hi>Argentine Confession,</hi> exhibited by foure Cities to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, <hi>An.</hi> M.D.XXX. in the same very cause of innocent Defence, that we are now in, in the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>The paper found in <hi>William Lauds</hi> Studie, touching feares and hopes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>

                     <hi>W. Laud</hi> and other Prelates enemies to Parliaments.</note> evidenceth that Cavaliers hate the Supreme seat of Iustice, and would it were not in the World; which is the highest rebellion and resistance made against superior Powers.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What ever ungrate Courtier had hand in the death of King <hi>Iames,</hi> deserved to come under Tryall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He feareth they sacrifice some man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If Parliaments have not power to cut off Rebels, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Iudges, the root of their being is undone. 2. If they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Courts, none needeth feare them, but the guilty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He feareth <hi>their Consultations be long, and the supply must be present.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then Cavaliers intend <hi>Parliaments</hi> for Subsidies to the <hi>King,</hi> to foment, and promote the warre against <hi>Scotland,</hi> not for Iustice. 2. He that feareth long and serious consultations, to rip up and launce the wounds of <hi>Church</hi> and State, is affraid that the wounds be cured.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He feareth they deny Subsidies, which are due by the Law of God, Nature, and Nations, whereas Parliaments have but their deliberation and consent for the manner of giving, otherwise this is to sell Subsidies, not to give them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Tribute, and the standing Revenues of the <hi>King,</hi> are due <hi>by the Law of God and Nations</hi>; but Subsidies are occasionall Rents, given upon occasion of Warre, or some extraordinary necessity; and they are not given to the <hi>King</hi> as Tribute, and standing Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, which the <hi>King</hi> may bestow for his House, Family, and Royall Honour, but they are given by the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> rather to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then to the King for the present warre, or some other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the Kingdome, and therefore are not due to the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King, by any Law of Nature or Nations,</hi> and so should not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but by deliberation and judiciall sentence, of the States; and they are not sold to the <hi>King,</hi> but given out by the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> by Statute of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to be bestowed on the Kingdome, and the King should sell no Acts of Justice for Subsidies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He dare not <hi>speake of the consequences, if the King grant Bills of Grace, and part with the flowers of the Crowne.</hi> Ans. He dare not say, The people shall vindicate their liberty by selling Subsidies, to buy branches of the Prerogative Royall, and diminishing the Kings fancied absolutenesse: so would Prelates have the King absolute, that they may ride over the soules, purses, persons, estates, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of men upon the horse of pretended absolutenesse.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He feareth <hi>the Parliament fall upon Church businesse; but</hi> 1. <hi>The Church is too weake already, if it had more power, the King

might have more, both obedience and service.</hi> 2. <hi>The Houses can be no competent Iudges in point of Doctrine.</hi> 3. <hi>For the King, Clergy, and Convocation are Iudges in all causes Ecclesiasticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This striketh at the root of all Parliamentary power, 1. The <hi>P. P.</hi> giveth them but a poore <hi>deliberative power in Subsidies,</hi> and that is, to make the Kings Will a Law, in taking all the subjects goods from them, to foment warre against the subjects. 2. He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all jurisdiction from them <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ver Persons,</hi> though they were as black Traitors as breathe. 3. And spoileth them of all power in <hi>Church matters,</hi> to make all Iudges, yea and the King himselfe yield blind obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelate,</hi> and their illuminated Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. Sure I am, <hi>P. Maxwell</hi> imputeth this, but most unjustly, to <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> What essentiall and fundamentall priviledges are left to Parliaments? <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament of Israel</hi> are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Iudges in the matter of <hi>bringing home the Ark of God.</hi> And for the Churches weaknesse, that is, the weaknesse of the <hi>damned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> shall this be the Kings weaknesse? Yes, the P.P. must make it true, <hi>No Bishop, no King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. He feareth, <hi>factious spirits will take heart to themselves, if the King yield to them without any submission of theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Princes and Iudges of the Land are a company of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and so no <hi>Parliament,</hi> no Court, but at best some good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visers of a <hi>King</hi> to breake up the Parliament, because they refuse Subsidies, that he may be a lawlesse way extort Subsidies.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He desireth <hi>the Parliament may sit a short time, that they may not well understand one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> He loveth short, or no justice from the Parliament, he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth they reforme Gods house, and execute justice on men like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But I returne to the <hi>Scotish Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Assert.</hi> 2. The Parliament is to regulate the power of the <hi>King.</hi> The heritable Sheriffes complaine,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, limit, and set bounds to the Kings power.</note> that the <hi>King</hi> granteth Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to others, in cases perteining to their office.

               <p>It is to be considered, that King <hi>Iames</hi> in his <hi>Basilicon Doron,</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down an unsound ground, that <hi>Fergus</hi> the first father of 107 <hi>Kings of Scotland,</hi> conquered this Kingdom. The contrary whereof

               <p>All Polititians say, The King is a limited Prince, not absolute; where the King giveth out Lawes, not in his own name, but in the name of himselfe, and the Estates judicially conveened.</p>

               <p>QUest. 1. <hi>Whether all Governments be but broken Governments, and deviations from Monarchie?] Answ.</hi> It is denyed; There is no lesse somewhat of <hi>Gods</hi> authoritie in Government, by many, or some of the choisest of the People, than in <hi>Monarchie:</hi> nor can we judge any <hi>Ordinance of Man</hi> unlawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are to be <hi>subject to all, for the Lords sake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13.

                  <note place="margin">How Royaltie is the first and naturall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note>Quest. 2. <hi>Whether is Royaltie an immediate issue and spring of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?] Answ.</hi> No; For man, fallen in sinne, knowing naturally he hath need of a Law and a Government, could have, by reason, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised Governors, one or moe; and the supervenient institution of <hi>God,</hi> comming upon this Ordinance, doth more fully assure us, that <hi>God,</hi> for mans good, hath appointed Governours: but if we consult with Nature, many Iudges and Governors, to fallen Nature, seeme nearer of blood, to Nature, then one only: for two, because of mans weaknesse, are better then one. Now Nature seemeth, to me, not to teach, that one onely sinfull man should be the sole and onely Ruler
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:50873:233"/>
of a whole Kingdome. <hi>God,</hi> in his Word,<note place="margin">Many Rulers over a great multitude, more naturall than one.</note> ever joyned with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler, many Rulers, who, as touching the essence of a Iudge, (which is, to rule for <hi>God</hi>) were all equally Iudges: some reserved Acts, or a longer cubite of power, in regard of extent, being due to the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. 3. <hi>Whether Magistrates, as Magistrates, be naturall?] Answ.</hi> Nature is considered, as whole and sinlesse, or as fallen and broken. In the former consideration, that either man should stand in need of any, to compell him with the sword to doe his duty, and not oppresse; was no more naturall to man, than to stand in need of <hi>Lictors</hi> and <hi>Hangmen,</hi> or <hi>Physitians</hi> for the body, which in this state was not in a capacitie of sicknesse or death: And so Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Parents and Husbands was only naturall, in the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. <hi>Magistrates</hi> as <hi>Magistrates,</hi> are two wayes considered; 1. According to the knowledge of such an Ordinance; 2. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the actuall erection of the practice of the office of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. In the former notion, I humbly conceive, that by Natures light, Man, now fallen and broken, even under all the fractions of the powers and faculties of the soule, doth know, that promises of reward, feare of punishment, and the coactive power of the Sword, as <hi>Plato</hi> said, are naturall meanes to move us, and wings to promote obedience, and to doe our duty. And that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by <hi>Magistrates</hi> is naturall: But, in the second relation, it is hard to determine, that Kings, rather then other Governours, are more naturall.</p>
               <p>Quest. 4. <hi>Whether Nature hath determined, that there should be one supreme Ruler a King, or many Rulers in a free Commnitie? Answ.</hi> It is denyed.</p>
               <p>Quest. 6. <hi>Whether every free Commonwealth hath not in it a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of Majestie, which it may formally place in one, or many?] Answ.</hi> It is affirmed.</p>
               <p>Quest. 6. <hi>Whether absolute and unlimited power of Royaltie, be a ray and beame of Divine Majestie, immediately derived from God?] Answ.</hi> Not at all: Such a creature is not in the world of <hi>Gods</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: Royalists, and flatterers of Kings, are parents to this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious birth. There is no shadow of power, to doe ill, in <hi>God:</hi> An absolute power is, essentially, a power to do without or above Law, and a power to doe ill, to destroy: and so it cannot come from <hi>God,</hi> as a Morall power, by institution; though it come from God by a
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:50873:234"/>
flux of permissive providence: but so things unlawfull and sinfull come from God.</p>
               <p>Quest. 7. <hi>Whether the King may, in his actions, intend his owne Prerogative and Absolutenes?] Answ.</hi> He can neither intend it as his nearest end, nor as his remote end. Not the former: for if he fight, and destroy his People for a <hi>Prerogative,</hi> he destroyeth his People, that he may have a power to destroy them, which must be meere Tyranny, nor can it be his remote end; for granting that his supposed absolute Prerogative were lawfull, he is to referre all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Power, and all his actions to a more noble end, to wit, to the safetie and good of the People.<note place="margin">To resist the Will, is not to resist the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note>

God hath joyned King and Power: who dare seperate them?] Answ.</hi> If the <hi>Parliament</hi> abuse their power, we may resist their abused power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 9.</note> and not their power Parliamentarie. Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> doth well distinguish, in his Annot. on the [<hi>Loyall Convert</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Kings power,</hi> and the <hi>Kings will.</hi> 2. The Resisters doe not separate <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>; but the <hi>King</hi> himselfe doth separate his lawfull Power from his Will, if he worke and act Tyrannie, out of this principle, Will, Passion, Lust; not out of the Royall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Kingly power: So far we may resist the one, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Quest. 9. <hi>Why, if God might work a miracle in the three Childrens resistance active; why doth he evidence omnipotencie in the passive obedience of these Witnesses? The Kingdome of Iudah was Christs birthright, as man, and Davids sonne: why did he not, by legions of Men &amp; Angels, rather vindicate his own flesh and blood, than triumph by non-resistance, and the omnipotencie of glorie to shine in his meere suffering?] Ans. Who art thou that dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with God?</hi> He that killeth with the <hi>jaw-bone of an Asse, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi>;<note place="margin">It is no good consequence: Christ and the Apostles used not violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to spread the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, <hi>ergo,</hi> such resistance is unlawfull.</note> and he that destroyed the numberlesse <hi>Midianites</hi> by <hi>only three hundred,</hi> should no more put the three Children to an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fact in the one, if they had by three men killed <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and all his Subjects, than in the other. But nothing is said against us in a Sophisme <hi>à non-causa pro causa</hi>; except it be proved, <hi>God</hi> would neither deliver his <hi>three Children,</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> from death, and the Iewes from bondage, by miraculous resistance, because resistance is unlawfull. What? patient suffring is lawfull; <hi>Ergo</hi> resistance is
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:50873:234"/>
unlawfull. It is a poor consequent, and a begging of the question, both must be lawfull to us. And so we hold, of ten lawfull meanes fit to compasse <hi>Gods</hi> blessed end, he may choose one, and let goe nine: shall any inferre, <hi>ergo,</hi> These other nine meanes are unlawfull, because <hi>God</hi> chose a mean, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and refused them. So may I answer by retortion. The <hi>three hundred</hi> sinned in resisting <hi>Midian,</hi> and defeating them: Why? Because it should be more honour to God, if they had, by suffering patiently the sword of <hi>Midian,</hi> glorified <hi>God</hi> in Martyrdome. So <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who could have wrought miracles, might have wrought Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the sword, and destroyed <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> the opposers of the <hi>Lambe:</hi> and they did reforme by suffering; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the sword is unlawfull in Reformation. It followeth not. The meane <hi>Christ</hi> used, is lawfull; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all other meanes that he used not, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, It is vaine Logick.</p>
               <p>Quest. 10. <hi>Whether is the Coronation of a King any other thing but a Ceremonie?] Ans.</hi> In the <hi>Coronation</hi> there is, and may be,<note place="margin">The Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto,</hi> is more then a <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Ceremonie of a shout</hi> and an Acclamation, and the reaching of a Scepter in his right hand who is made <hi>King</hi>; and the like: But the Coronation <hi>in concreto,</hi> according to the substance of the act, is no <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> nor any accidentall ingredient in the constitution of a <hi>King</hi>; 1. Because <hi>Israel</hi> should have performed a meere ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all action on <hi>Saul,</hi> when they made him <hi>King,</hi> which we cannot say: for as the Peoples act of <hi>Coronation</hi> is distinctive, so is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive; it distinguished <hi>Saul</hi> from all <hi>Israel,</hi> and did constitute him in a new relation, that he was changed from no <hi>King,</hi> to be a <hi>King.</hi> 2. The people cannot by a <hi>Ceremonie</hi> make a <hi>King</hi>; they must really put some honour on him, that was not on him before. Now this <hi>Ceremonie</hi> which <hi>Royalists</hi> doe fancie Coronation to be, is only symbolicall and declarative, not really dative, it placeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>King.</hi>

               <p>Quest. 11. <hi>Whether may Subjects limit the power that they gave not to the King, it being the immediate result (without intervening of Law, or any act of man) issuing from God only?] Ans.</hi> Though we should give (which in reason we cannot grant) that <hi>Royall</hi> power were a result of the immediate bounty of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Men may limit the Power that they gave not.</note> without any act of man; Yet it may be limited by men that it over-swell not its banks, though <hi>God</hi> immediatly make <hi>Peter</hi> an Apostle, without any act of men, yet <hi>Paul</hi> by a sharpe rebuke, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. curbeth and limiteth

This is to beg the question. And for the <hi>Commonwealth of Bees and Cranes,</hi> and Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongst them, Give me leave to doubt of it. To be subject to <hi>Kings,</hi> is a Divine morall Law of <hi>God</hi>; but not properly naturall to be subject to coaction of the Sword.

'Tis true, <hi>Arnisaeus</hi> saith, he neither could be compelled to resigne his power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arnisaeus de jure Pontif. Rom. in Regna &amp; Princ. c.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 30.</note> nor was he compelled to resigne his Royall authoritie; but he willingly resigned actuall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and remained <hi>King,</hi> as Tutors and Curators are put upon <hi>Kings</hi> that are mad, stupid, and Children, who yet governe all by the authoritie of lawfull Kings. But that <hi>Vzzah</hi> did not denude himselfe of the Royall power voluntarily, is cleare. The reason, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.21. why he dwelt in an house apart, and did not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reigne; is, because he was a Leper; for, <hi>He was cut off</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>from the house of the Lord; and Jotham his sonne was over the Kings house, judging the people of the Land.</hi> Whereby it is cleare by the expresse law of <hi>God,</hi> he being a Leper, and so not, by Law, to enter into the Congregation, he was <hi>cut off from the house of the Lord:</hi> and he being a patient, is said to be <hi>cut off from the Lords house.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Vzzah</hi> turned necessitie to a vertue, I know not: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that <hi>Gods</hi> Law removed the actuall exercise of his power. If we obteine this, which <hi>Gods</hi> Word doth give us, we have enough
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:50873:237"/>
for our purpose, though <hi>Vzzah</hi> kept the naked title of a <hi>King,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he tooke but up roome in the Catalogue of <hi>Kings.</hi> Now if, by Law, he was <hi>cut off</hi> from actuall governing; Whether he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or not willing to denude himselfe of Reigning, it is all one. And to say, that <hi>furious men, ideots, stupid men,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> who must doe all Royall acts by Curators and Tutors, are Kings <hi>jure,</hi> with correction, is <hi>petitio principii:</hi> for then hath <hi>God</hi> infused im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from heaven, (as <hi>Royalists</hi> teach us) a <hi>Royall power</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> on those, who are as capable of <hi>Royaltie,</hi> as blocks. I conceive that the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15, 16, 17. commandeth the people, to make no blocks <hi>Kings:</hi> and that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath not done that himselfe in a binding Law to us, which we have no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him to doe. I conceive that <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Josiah</hi> and <hi>Joash</hi> Kings typicall, and in destination, for his promise sake to <hi>David,</hi> while they were Children, as well as he made them Kings; but not <hi>actu completo ratione officii,</hi> to be a rule to us now, to make a Childe of sixe yeares of age, a King by office. I conceive, Children are to us, only Kings in destination and appointment: And for Idiots and Fooles, I shall not believe, (let <hi>Royalists</hi> breake their faith upon so rocky and stony a point, at their pleasure) that <hi>God</hi> hath made them Governors of others, by <hi>Royall office,</hi> who can scarce number their own fingers; Or that God tyeth a people to acknowledge stupid blocks for Royall Governours of a Kingdome, who cannot governe themselves. But far be it from me to argue with <hi>Bellarmine</hi>; From <hi>Vzziah</hi> his bodily leprosie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> to inferre, that any Prince spiritually Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, and turned Hereticall, is presently to be dethroned. Nothing can dethrone a King, but such Tyrannie as is inconsistent with his Royall office. Nor durst I inferre, that Kings, now adayes, may be removed from actuall Government, for one single transgression. It is true, 80 Priests, and the whole Kingdome so serving King <hi>Vzzah,</hi> (their motives, I know, were Divine) proveth well that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may punish the transgression of Gods expresse law, in the <hi>King,</hi> in some cases, even to remove him from the Throne: but as from Gods commanding to stone the man that gathered sticks on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, we cannot inferre, that Sabbath-breakers are now to be punished with death; yet we may well argue, Sabbath-breakers may be punished, and Sabbath-breakers are not unpunishable, and above all Law; So may we argue here: <hi>Vzzah,</hi> though a King, was punished; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Kings are punishable by Subjects.</p>

Because they are obliged to the King only as a King, and not as an enemy: But in so raising war, he cannot be considered as a King. 2. Though, if the people agree with him, and still acknowledge him King; it is unpossible, <hi>Physicè,</hi> he can be their King, and they not pay his debts, yet they sin not, but may, <hi>ex decentia, non ex debito legali,</hi> pay his debts, yet are they not obliged by any Law of God, or man to pay his debts; but though it be true, by all Law the King be obliged to pay his debt, (except we say, that all the peoples goods, are the Kings, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way, I confesse, to pay all that any voluptuous <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I dispute not, whether <hi>A. B.</hi> borrowing money formally, that thereby he may buy a Whore, shall be obliged to repay it to <hi>C.

I dare not pray to God, That all our Kings debts may be payed; I have scarce faith so to do.</p>
