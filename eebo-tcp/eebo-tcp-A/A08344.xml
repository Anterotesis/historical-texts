         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>4. 1. Thes 17.</note> First is vnbeliefe: for if we supposed not, that those things were fables, which are mentioned in the scriptures euery where of the last day of iudgement, and of the voyce of the Archangell, and of the trump of God, and of the throne of Gods seate, wherat al mé must stand, of the punishment of the wicked, of the euerlasting and blessed life, which the godly after this miserable life shal enjoy, of the resurrection of the bodies &amp; soules, eyther to be partakers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither of certaine ioye, or else of certaine paine, and also shall giue his accompt of al things, which he hath done, either intended, by thought, saide, or done, and how he hath vsed gods giftes and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, towards his needy members, &amp;c. VVithout al doubt &amp; que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion they would not liue thus ydlely &amp; naughtily as they do.</p>
            <p>The second cause is, the boldnesse (to sinne) vpon gods mercie: this boldnesse is great in very deede, but yet it is such as they may well ynough deceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues withal.<note place="margin">Eccles. 5.6. Ezech. 18.322 1. Pet. 3.9. Rom. 2.4.</note> For of boldnesse they haue no sure trial at al. So Salomon saith, say not, the mercie of God is great: he wil forgiue me my manifold sinnes: for mercy and wrath came from him, and his indignation commeth downe vpon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. &amp;c. with this boldnesse I say, the wicked enimie of mankinde kepeth man in sinne continually, but like as god graunteth forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenesse at the first to the repentaunt: so doeth he also sharply pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those sinners which do continue obstinately (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) in vice and sin. For such men then, as repent not vnfainedly, and purpose to leade newe liues, conceiue a false hope and bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the mercie of God. And by this meanes that the Diuell setteth forth to men this boldnesse, he bringeth this to passe, that they liue on forth quietly, and securely in vice and wickednesse, and thinke little or nothing with themselues at any time of anye reformation or amendment. And herein they despise the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and riches of the bountifulnesse &amp; long suffering of god, being ignoraunt, that the goodnesse of god doth induce, and lead vnto repentaunce.</p>
            <p>The third cause is, the custome of sinne, which is in a manner,
<pb facs="tcp:13701:5"/>
made naturall in long continuance. For like as it is harde for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to alter nature:<note place="margin">VVisdo. 14.19. Levit. 18.30. Iereme. 13.23. Ecclesi. 4.12.12.</note> so custome, if it be once rooted, cannot easily bee plucked vp and expelled. And therefore it is that learned men doe cal custome an other nature. It is as a certaine wiseman saith: such vices as we haue accustomed our selues to, from our tender age, cannot be without great difficultie weeded out afterward, whiche thing though it be very certaine and true, yet who seeth not how fondly fathers and mothers bring vp their children in cockering,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.4. Eccle. 30.7.9.</note> and pampering them: from their infancie they bee giuen to none other thing, but to pride, delicious fare, and vaine idle pleasures and pastimes.</p>
            <p>VVhat prodigious apparel, what vndece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t behauiour, what boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, bragging, quarelling and ietting vp and down, what quassing, feasting, ryoting, playing, dauncing and dicesing, with other lyke felowship that is among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a wonder to see.<note place="margin">Eccl. 30.11.12.13.</note> And the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents can hereat reioyce and laugh with them, and giue libertye to their children to doe what they liste, neuer endeuouring to tame and salue their wilde appetites. VVhat marueyle is it, if they bee found thus naughtie and vicious, when they come to their full yeares, and mans state, which haue of children bene trayned and entred with suche vice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof they wil alwayes taste,<note place="margin">Horatius.</note> as <hi>Horace</hi> saith, <hi>Quod nouatesta capit, inueterata sapit.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If these men therfore at any time do fully purpose to repent the and reforme their liuing: as when their conscience moueth them, or the burthen of their sinne pricketh them:<note place="margin">Eccle. 5.7.</note> yet custome hath so preuailed in them, that they fal into worse and worse enormities, and like mad men desire the reformation of their life.</p>

               <note place="margin">Luke. 14.23. Deut. 21 18 19.20.21.</note>Also the slacknesse and vnreadinesse of the Magistrates to doe and execute their office, is a great cause of this: if they that vse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes, playing, and walking vp and downe the streates, in time of a Sermon: if disobedient children, to their parents.

much, repenteth it, as we commonly see. Sleepe then must bee taken, for necessitie onely, to reuiue, refreshe, and comforte the wearye senses, the spirites vitall, and other wearye members. For too much sleepe (besides that it maketh heauie the spirits and senses, the partie also becommeth slouthfull, weake, and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with ouermuche ydlenesse) ingendreth much humiditie and rawe humors in the bodie, which commonlye assaulte it with sundrie infirmities, messengers of death, and of finall ruine. For when we sleepe too muche, all the moystures and humors of the bodie, with the naturall heate, retire to the extreme parts therof, no where purging or euacuating whatsoeuer is redundant. So then vnmeasurable sleepe is not onely forbidden by Philosophers and Phisitions but also is a thing odious to the wise. Ouid with other Poetes, terme sleepe an Image, or pourtraite of death, saying:

               <p>My answere is this: We must make distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ordinarie things that a Christian is bounde of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to doe, and those things which are permitted, and graunted him by God for the refreshing and helping of his infirmitie, as to ease him when he is weary, to sleepe after labour, and to play af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long paine. Ouid sayth: <hi>Quid caret alterna requie, durabile non est.</hi> The thing cannot indure that lacketh rest. And therefore the holy Scriptures (whiche are the rule of good and euill) maketh mention of playing, and alloweth Christians so to doe. Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sayth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zacha</hi> 8.5,</note> And the streetes of the citie shall bee full of boyes and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13701:23"/>
girles, playing in the streetes thereof. Also when Saint Paule sayth:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31</note> Whether ye eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer else ye doe, doe all to the glorie of God. Wee maye by this worde, (whatsoeuer ye doe) vnderstande all honest recreations, which certainely is as lawfull and permitted to vs, by reason of our infirmttie, as is either eating, drinking, or sleeping, when wee haue neede thereof. And as our Lorde Iesus Christ sayeth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Luc.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Math.</hi> 12.8.</note> That man is made for the glorie of God, and therefore the Sabboth serueth for man, and not man for the Sabboth: so honest recreation is inuented for man and for his health, which maketh vs the better and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout to serue God. Then to playe at honest games and pastimes, is a thing both indifferent and lawfull, and such as are lefte to Christian libertie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gala.</hi> 12 13.</note> as Paule sayth: Brethren, ye haue bene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto libertie: onelye vse not your libertie as occasion vnto the fleshe, but by loue serue one another: which thing must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in any wise. Neuerthelesse, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse we ought not to abuse (through too great pleasure which we take in them) no more than to abuse any other thing of the lyke kinde. In very deede it should seeme too great a crueltie to restraine wearied natures, ouertoyled bodies, that they neyther might or durste take some recreation. For although we ought to apply al &amp; euery our doings to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God, &amp; edifying &amp; helping of our neighbours, neuerthelesse whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we take our honest recreation to maintaine and preserue our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and health, or to recouer our strength, or to refreshe vp our spirites, that we may afterwarde the more cherefully and fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go about that businesse that God hath called vs vnto, and doe it the better. The same in the ende redoundeth to the glorie of God, whome we shall by this meanes be more able and readye to serue, and also to seeke our neighbours furtherance and profite. I doe not then forbid or condemne all playe, neither mislike that a faithfull Christian doe sometimes play and sport himselfe, so that such play and pastime be in lawfull and honest things, and also done with moderation.</p>

For nowe (by you) I vnderstande, that of ydlenesse commeth no goodnesse, but rather the contrary, &amp;c. Also I see and learne that euery man (in his calling) ought to labour and get his liuing in the feare of God, and sweate of his browes. And therefore I will henceforth (God willing) speake no more against the worde of truth, but will be ashamed of the lyes of mine owne ignorance,<note place="margin">

But to shewe you my minde plainlye, I thinke it is lawfull for a Scholemaister to practise his schollers to play Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, obseruing these and the like cautions. First that those Comedies which they shall play, be not mixt with any ribaudrie and filthie termes and wordes (which corrupt good manners.) Secondly,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33.</note> that it be for learning and vtterance sake, in Latine, and very seldome in Englishe. Thirdly, that they vse not to play commonly, and often, but verye rare and seldome. Fourthlye, that they be not pranked and decked vp in gorgious and sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparell in their play. Firstly, that it be not made a common exercise publikely for profit and gaine of mony, but for learning and exercise sake. And lastly, that their Comedies bee not mixte with vaine and wanton toyes of loue. These being obserued, I iudge it tollerable for schollers.</p>

               <p>As touching the first: Men of the olde time were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed with common vowes to sing certaine solemne ditties, both when they gaue thankes to God, and also when as they woulde obteyne any thing of him. Wherefore Orpheus, Limus, Pindarus, and Horace, and suche like Poetes, which vsed the Harpe, wrote their hymnes for the most part, for these vses. Also in the Romane publike wealth, the Priests of Mars which were called <hi>Salij,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Satij.</hi>
                  </note> caried shieldes, and sang their verses through the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Furthermore it was the manner, that Musicke and verses were had, when the prayses of noble men were celebrated, chiefly at feastes, whereby they which stoode by, might be admonished, to imitate their noble actes, and detest suche vices, which were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie vnto their vertues. Moreouer, they vsed them to recreate the mindes, and to comfort such as were pensiue, beauy, and sad for the deade.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 16.23.</note> As Saule being heauie. &amp;c. caused Dauid to playe vpon the Harpe to refresh him &amp;c. The vse hereof also we maye reade in Mathews, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 15.2.20</note> &amp;c. Contrariwise, when any great cause of ioye
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13701:48"/>
happened, it was expressed by Musicke and songs, as wee maye reade many examples hereof in the holy Scriptures, as of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses sister Miriam,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11.34. <hi>Iudet.</hi> 16.2.</note> Iudith, Iephtah his daughter. &amp;c. Likewise in weddings they were wont to playe musically, and to sing wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding songs. All these things if they bee done moderately, and in due time, are tollerable. For Musicke and songs containe three kindes of good things, that is, honest, profite, and pleasantnesse. For although singing of it selfe delighteth the mindes of men, yet when wordes are ioyned vnto it, which are of a iust number, and bounde by certaine feete (as Uerses are) is much more pleasant. And vndoubtedly Poetrie had hereof his beginning, and cannot be denied but it is an excellent gift of God: yet this ought to bee kept pure and chast among men, bicause certaine lasciuious men haue and doe filthily defile it, applying it to wantonnesse, wicked lusts, and euery filthie thing.</p>

               <p>The reason is playne. For there are certaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which onely fill the outwarde senses: and there are others also, which pertaine only to the mynde or reason. But Musick is a delectation so put in the middest, that both by the sweetnesse of the soundes it moueth the senses, and by the artificiousnesse of the number and proportions, it deliteth reason it selfe. And that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth then chiefly, when such wordes are added vnto it, whose sense is both excellent and learned.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pythagoras</hi>

                     <hi>Cicero.</hi>
                  </note> that rockes and wildernesses doe giue a sounde, and cruell beasts by singing are assuaged, and made to stande still, as it is reported of the Unicorne: when as men will take him, they put a yong mayden into the wildernesse, and when the Unicorne seeth hir, he standeth still, and when hee heareth the mayde sing and play on an instrument, he commeth to his, and sleepeth harde by hir, and layth his head vpon hir lap, and so the hunters kill him.</p>

               <p>Secondly, we must consider whether it may be vsed in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In the Cast part the holy assemblies euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, vsed singing, which we maye easily vnderstande by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of Plinie in his Epistle to Traiane the Emperour:<note place="margin">

                  </note> where he writeth that Christians vsed to sing hymnes before day vnto their Christ, and therefore were called Antelucanos coetus, the morning assemblies.

By which

                     <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>confes. ca.</hi> 33.</note> these things must be specially noted, Saint Augustine in his booke of Confession, confesseth and is also sorie, that hee hadde sometime fallen, bicause he had giuen more attentiue hede vnto the measures and cordes of Musicke, than vnto the wordes which were vnder them spoken. Which thing hereby he proueth to be sinne, bicause Musicke and singing were brought in for the wordes sake, and not wordes for Musicke. And he so repented this his faulte, that hee exceedinglye allowed the manner of the Churche of Alexandria vsed vnder Athanasius, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Reader, that when he sang, hee shoulde but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle alter his voyce, so that he shoulde bee like rather vnto one that readeth, than vnto one that singeth.

                  </note>First we must take heede that in Musicke bee not put the whole summe and effect of godlynesse, and of the worshipping of God, which among the Papistes they doe almost euerywhere thinke that they haue fullye worshipped God, when they haue long and much sung and piped. Further we must take heede that in it be not put merite or remission of sinnes. Thirdly, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging be not so much vsed and occupied in the Church, that there be no time in a maner lest to preach the worde of God and holye doctrine. Whereby it commeth to passe, that the people depart out of the Church full of Musicke and harmonie, but yet hungerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fasting, as touching heauenly foode and doctrine. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that rich &amp; large stipends be not so appointed for Musitians, that eyther very little, or in a maner nothing is prouided for the ministers which labour in the worde of God. Fiftly, neyther may that broken and quauering musicke be vsed, wherewith the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by are so letted, that they cannot vnderstand the words, no,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13701:50"/>
though they woulde neuer so faine. Lastly, we must take heede, that in the Church nothing be song without choyce, but onelye those things which are contayned in the holye Scriptures, or which are by iust reason gathered out of them, and doe exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the worde of God.</p>
               <p>Nowe to conclude this matter, I saye, that godly, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious songs may be retayned in the Church. And yet I confesse that there is no precept giuen in the new testament of that thing. Wherefore if there be any Church, which vpon iust causes vseth it not, the same Church cannot iustlye be condemned, so that it defende not, that the thing it selfe of his owne nature, or by the commaundement of God is unlawfull, and that it doe not for the same cause reproue other Churches, which vse singing and Musicke, or else exclude them from the fellowship of Christ. Yet this ought to be considered, that if we shall perceyue, that christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people doe runne vnto the Churche, as to a Stage playe, where they may be delighted with pyping and singing (and doe thereby absent themselues from hearing the worde of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) in this case we must rather abstaine from a thing not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, than to suffer thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The reason is most cleare and plaine: First that play (whatsoeuer it be) was not appoynted or permitted as a meane and way to get or winne mony, but onely for exercise of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or recreation of the minde: so that whosoeuer vseth it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende, maketh it no game, but abuseth, chaungeth, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the nature of the recreation, into a filthie and vnsufferable gayne, and therefore dishonest.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13701:53"/>
is profitable or gaine (to thee) which is not honestlye gotten: otherwise it is <hi>Turpe lucrum,</hi> filthie gaines. Furthermore, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was neuer allowed as a kinde of bargaining, traffike, or occupying among men: if wee eyther consider Gods lawe or mans. Amongst all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes in the world, which haue throughly decided all meanes howe to get, and iustly to possesse other mens goodes, neuer make mention that gaming was a iust meane. The Romane law, which we call the Ciuile lawe, hath verye largely and diligently determined of it. But amongst all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest meanes whereof the Ciuile lawe maketh mention, gaming is not mentioned, nor once within the compasse. Yet he speaketh of contractes in sale, of letting to hire, making restitution, and such like, whereby we may iustly haue and get that which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but there is no mention at all made of Play, or that wee may thereby wynne or possesse any thing. So that whosoeuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and keepeth the mony of another which he hath wonne in play, withholdes it without lawfull cause, and therefore agaynst conscience, and to speak plainly, sheweth himselfe a flat theefe. If S. Paule forbiddeth vs to vse deceyte in bargaining and selling, what shoulde we doe in gaming? And if this shoulde be suffred, we shall bring in a greedie couetousnesse, in steade of the recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the minde, and to be short, a desire to beguile eche other, in steade of folace and pastime.</p>
               <p>To gayne then by play, and especially at Dice, is as much as to steale and rob, notwithstanding any customes, euill vses, or corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of maners.<note place="margin">

               <p>First it is ordeyned against the expresse and thirde commaundement of God, which sayth: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lorde thy God in vaine. So that whosoeuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this chaunce of lottes in ydle and trifling things, taketh the name and prouidence of God in vaine. For the lot is one of the principall witnesses of Gods power (as Salomon recordeth) that it is ruled and gouerned immediately by his hande,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 16.33. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18.18.</note> power, and
prouidence. And therefore we maye not vse lottes so triflinglye, as it were to tempt God, and to trie what care hee hath of the worlde, but onely in matters of great importaunce, and where his diuine will shoulde be extraordinarilye knowne and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode. as in diuiding of goodes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Actes</hi> 1.26.</note> choosing of Magistrates, and such lyke, to ende all quarrels or corruption of voyces, and not in sleyght things, as thoughe wee woulde make God seruaunt to our Pastymes and Sportes, and trye what care hee hadde
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13701:62"/>
of them. Secondly, this play is instituted contrarye to the true nature and ende of that which we in Englishe call Play or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, and the Latines call <hi>Ludus.</hi> And therefore the Playe at Dice is a very corruption of Gods holy permission, &amp; of true and honest play. For all playes are appointed and lyked of men for two causes onely: eyther for the exercise of the bodye (whereof Diceplay is wholy contrarie, being a sport of a sorte of ydle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftes:) or else Playe shoulde serue for the recreation of the minde, and refreshing of our bodies, wherevnto Diceplaye is wholy repugnant and contrarie: for therein is no exercise of our wittes, but we onely stay vpon the chaunce of the Dyce, whyle as well he that winneth, as he that loseth, is amazed and vnsure of his chaunce, but alwayes gapeth for the chaunce of his happe, without any pleasure, but onely a couetous desire to gayne. Also we see that the more they play at such games, the more they may, without any such contentment or pleasure of the mynde as is founde in other honest and lawfull games. Thirdly, the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof by the Ciuill lawes, and commaundements of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, maketh these Playes offensiue, wicked, and vnlawful, though of their owne nature they were not so. For Saint Paule sayth thus:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13.</note> Though I shoulde forbeare from eating of fleshe all the dayes of my life, rather than offende my brother, I ought to doe it: Much more ought we for feare of offence to forbeare this play, in that it is nothing necessarie for the sustayning of mans lyfe, nor of like commoditie to the vse of fleshe, which S. Paule willeth vs yet to forbeare, if occasion serue. For there are other wayes to pastime and sport vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Colos.</hi> 4.5. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2.</note> than by those playes. Fourthly, the spirit of God commaundeth vs by Saint Paule, to redeeme the time that we haue lost in ydle and vnprofitable things, and to bestow the time present in good and holy things to edification, bicause the dayes are euill. For when God giueth vs leysure ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to read his holy word, to visit the poore, to comfort the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or to doe such lyke dutifull deedes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.36. <hi>Iames.</hi> 1.27.</note> we ought to doe it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bicause that incontinently one let or other may happen, which may withdrawe our mindes therefrom, a thousande afflictions
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13701:62"/>
are present before vs, and it will be harde to recouer that whiche we so sleightly ouerslippe. But I pray you is that well spending the time and the leysure which God giueth vs to doe good in,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.</note> to lose it in playing at Dyce, which I haue declared to be so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue? Fiftly, the beggerly and greedie desire in that game doth so farre exceede all other, that there is nothing that doth more entise and encourage a man to play, than this Diceplay doth. And the reason thereof is manifest, that seeing the loser perceyueth that such losse happeneth not by the cunning of the Player, but rather by his happe and chaunce for that time, he hopeth to recouer hys mony by the sayde hap, which is likely to chaunge, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye chaungeable, and therefore playeth on hoping for better chaunce, and so continueth, feeding himselfe with looking fvr the chaunge of the Dice: so as this game is proued to be the very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of loyterers and vagabondes, but in playes of skill and cunning, the cause of the losse is soone espied and to be perceyued, and therefore hee that perceyueth himselfe to be the weaker, doth immediatly leaue playe. What shall I speake of the insatiable couetousnesse that is in this Play, while eyther partie seeketh to winne others mony, or rather the one of them to vndoe the other, and also go about to deceyue the other? What shall I speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of the great and excessiue losses that haue alwayes bene, and daily are in the sayde play? Some play away their houses, horses, clothes: some all that euer they haue, or can borowe, ere they can leaue off, till all be gone: so entising and alluring is this game aboue all other, which causeth so many come to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, stealing, and finallye to that vntimely death of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. To this effecte, a certaine Poet and a Doctor of both Lawes, sayth:

               <p>There are diuers opinions hereof. For as Solynus sayth: it was first deuised in Crete by one Pyrthus, that was one of Sybilles priestes. Others saye that the Priestes of Mars (called <hi>Salij.</hi>) inuented it,<note place="margin">

Wherevpon men in Sicilia began to expresse their meanings and thoughts by books and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of the body: which thing aftewarde turned into an vse and custome.

               <p>First, that Daunce that Miriam Aarons sister (and the other women vsed) was no vayne and wanton Daunce, for carnall and filthie pleasures (as yours is) but it was that kynde of Daunce which is called (<hi>Chorea</hi>) for they did it in praysing God, signifying and declaring their great ioye, that Moses and Aaron, with all the children of Israell, were passed the redde sea in safetie, and their enimies (Pharao and his hoste) destroyed. &amp;c. And the like order did Iephtah his daughter vse, for the victorye that God gaue vnto hir father against his enimies. &amp;c. And so did the women in meeting king Saule And also Iudith, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the women. &amp;c. praysed God for the victorie that Saule had ouer the Philistines. And Iudith with the residue, magnified God (as appeareth in the xvj. Chapter) for that the Citie of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thulia was deliuered from the enimies by the death of Holofer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and so in going altogither hande in hande, reioyced and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God in Psalmes. Also here is to be noted in these examples, that you alledge for Dauncing, that Miriam and the other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Iephtah his daughter, the women that daunced in mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13701:67"/>
Saule, and Iudeth that daunced with the other women of Israell, for ioye of their deliuerye. &amp;c. daunced not with yong men, but apart by themselues among women and maydens (which celebrated their victories) but seuerally by themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. Also their daunces were spirituall, religious, and godly, not after our hoppings, and leapings, and interminglings men with women. &amp;c. (dauncing euery one for his part) but so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, grauely, and matronelyke, mouing scarce little or nothing in their gestures at all, eyther in countenance or bodie: they had no Minstrels or pypers to play vnto them: but they tooke their Timbrels into their owne handes (that coulde play) and not as our foolishe and fonde women vse to mixe themselues with men in their Daunce. And as for that place of Salomon that sayth: There is a time to daunce. &amp;c. He meaneth this kynde of daunce which these good women vsed, which is a ioyfulnesse of heart, which bringeth spirituall profite, and not carnall pleasures (as our Daunces doe.) Also Salomon hereby teacheth vs howe we shoulde vse tymes in their order: As when there is a tyme and cause to mourne and lament, then must we vse it. When God sendeth agayne, good things, we must also vse that, and to bee mery and reioyce in the Lorde. A time of sorowe the widow had in losing of hir groate.<note place="margin">

Therefore you maye easily perceyue hereby, that Salomon meaneth by this worde Daunce, ioyfulnesse and comforte. And by the worde Mourning, hee meaneth sorrowe and calamitie. &amp;c. Also you muste note in these foresayde Daunces, that it was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie custome and manner among the Iewes, to vse suche kinde of godly Dauncings in certaine solemnities and triumphs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as God did giue them good and prosperous successes against their enimies.

Agayne: <hi>Est honesta saltatio, qua tripudiat animus, &amp; bonis corpus operibus reuelatur, quando in salicibus organa nostra suspendimus,</hi> There is an honest daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, when as the mynde daunceth, and the bodye sheweth hym selfe by good workes, when as we hang our instrumentes vppon the Willowe trees.

Therefore he sayth: <hi>Docuit nos Scriptura cantare grauiter, &amp; saltare spiritualiter,</hi> The holye Scripture teacheth vs to sing reuerentlye, and to daunce spiritually (sayeth he.)

                  </note>Saint Ambrose sayth (wryting to his sister Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellina) myrth ought to bee in a cleare conscience, and a good mynde, and not in spiced bankets, and wedding feastes full of Minstrelsie. For therein shamefastnesse is yll defended, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull abusion suspected, where the last ende of pleasure is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, from which I desire all Uirgins of God to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. For no man (as a certayne wise man of the Paganes sayth) daunceth, if he be sober, except he be madde. Nowe then, if that either drunkennesse or madnesse be reckened to be the cause of Dauncing among the Paganes, what then shall we counte to be commaunded in the holy Scripture: where we reade that Saint Iohn Baptist (the messenger of Christ) was put to death at the pleasure of a Dauncing wench? By the which thing we may take example, that this vnlawfull pastime of Dauncing hath bene cause of more hurte, than the phrensie of Robbers and Murtherers. This dedly feast was prepared with a kingly large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and excesse, and watch layde when the company was at the most, and then the daughter which was hidde vp before in secret, was brought forth to daunce before the people. What coulde the daughter learne more of hir mother (which was an harlot) but to lose hir honestie? For nothing incly neth folke more to bodilye lust, than by vncomely mouing and gesture, to shewe the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of these partes, which eyther nature hath hydde secretely, or good maner &amp; nurture hath couered: or to playe castes wyth hir eye, or shake the neck, or swinge hir armes and heare. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muste needes fall into offence agaynst the maiestie of God. For what honestie can be kepte there where dauncing is? So then the King delighted with that pastime, bid hir aske what soeuer she woulde. &amp;c. Thus farre Saint Ambrose.</p>

               <p>Some Maydes doe nothing more gladly, and be taught also with great diligence both of father and mother, that is, to daunce cunningly. Feastings out of time, and pleasant sportes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate pastime bringeth alwayes Dauncing in the last ende. So that Dauncing must needes be the extreme of all vices. But wee nowe in christian countries haue schooles of Dauncing, howbeit that is no wonder, seeing also we haue houses of baudrie. So much the Paganes were better and more sadde than we be, they neuer knewe this newe fashion of Dauncing of oures, and vncleanlye handlings, gropings, and kissings, and a very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of lechery: whereto serueth all that bassing, as it were Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons the birds of Uenus?</p>
               <p>What good doth all that Dauncing of yong women, holding vpon mens armes, that they may hop the higher? What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that shaking vnto midnight, and neuer weary, which if they were desired to go but to the next Churche, they were not able, except they were caried on horsebacke, or in a chariot: who would not thinke them out of their wittes?</p>
               <p>I remember (sayth he) that I hearde vpon a time saye, that there were certaine men brought out of a farre countrie into our partes of the worlde, whiche when they sawe women daunce, they ranne awaye wonderouslye afrayde, crying out that they thought the women were taken with an vncoth kynde of phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. And to saye good sooth, who woulde not recken women fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike when they daunce, if hee had neuer seene woman daunce before?</p>
               <p>And it is a world to see, howe demurely and sadly some sit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them that daunce, and with what gesture, pace, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the bodie, &amp; with what sober footing some of them daunce.

What holy woman did wee euer reade of, that was a Dauncer? Or what woman nowe a dayes (that is sadde and wyse) will be knowne to haue skill of Dauncing? &amp;c.

Then when shame and honestie began to decay, women also and Maydens vsed to daunce, and had their proper daunces appointed them.

This encreased and went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, that men and women being mixt, daunced togither.
