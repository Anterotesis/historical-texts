            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The difference between Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, and Equity is this.

                  <p>TO gain, keep and govern Kingdomes, there are three [principal l]inſtruments: The

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Tongue; tis the inſtrument of Religion, and Prudence. That is, of the Goods of the Minde.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſword is the [pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per] Inſtrument of the Body and its Goods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Treaſure is more [the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument] of Fortunes, and Eſtates: which ſerves the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114773:35"/>and Minde [onely] Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily: but the true Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the Tongue and the Sword.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that uſe the ſword only, founding their power upon that, thoſe quickly loſe their dominion; as <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, Attila,</hi> and <hi>Brennus,</hi> and moſt of the Northern nations.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuites in <hi>Japan</hi> gaine [firſt] ſoules, then Kingdomes to <hi>Spaine</hi> and the Papacy, by their tongues.</p>
                  <p>There be that gaine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by crying up ſome new ſect, built upon ſome ſpecious colour of truth, by ſowing diſcord betwixt the old Religion, &amp; the new Sect, which ſhall be attempted and fitted to the guſt and palate of the multitude: But ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is of it ſelfe not very long liv'd.</p>

                  <p>Ring-leaders of Hereſies, although [commonly] they gain much, they keep little: as for example, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Dulcinus &amp; Theudas.</hi>

                     <q>John <hi>of</hi> Leydon <hi>was an ignorant fellow, a perſon of of no worth at all, who through the hatred againſt the Prieſts of his time (whoſe lives were abominable in the eyes of all men) gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a rabble of the baſeſt people.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>They that uſe well the ſword and tongue, do lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of durable Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but then the ſword muſt be juſt, and the tongue vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> build the Empire of the Jews, [namely, in veracity and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,] which impious <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>

                  <p>The Law of <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Empire of the Jews, but <hi>Mahomets</hi> Laws ſhall ſink with his Empire: Thus fell the laws of <hi>Alexander</hi> with his perſon and power; Thus <hi>Numa's, Belus,</hi> and <hi>Minos, Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Zamolxis</hi> his lawes are extinct, even for want of juſtice and veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He, that knows not how to give lawes to thoſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers, doth quickly loſe the Kingdome he has gain'd. Thus <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth loſt <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> which he had wonne, for want of skill to ſecure his conqueſt by the addition of Lawes and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.

Prudence (the ſecond cauſe of Dominion) does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to thoſe that are truely Kings; and to ſuch next under God, is <hi>Dominion</hi> due which prudence is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to <hi>Craft</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety,</hi> which is proper only to <hi>Machiavels Tyrant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prudence is conſonant to God, that is to eternall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Craft agrees to nothing but a mans own will and pleaſure: that is, acts all Arbitrarily.</p>
                  <p>Prudence is magnanimous, Craft baſe, yet proud.</p>
                  <p>Prudence [alwaies] advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wiſe and valiant men, and puts them in place of power
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114773:53"/>and truſt. Craft depreſſes and deſtroyes them, that ſhe may rule over Baſtard-Subjects, when the Legitimate are cut off.</p>
                  <p>Prudence treaſures up riches for the good of mens ſouls and that their numbers may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: Craft aymes at money and ſtrong holds, and rejoyces in the Diminution and leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Prudence even in loſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers, Craft by conquering is a loſer.</p>
                  <p>Prudence is mercifull, Craft is cruell.</p>
                  <p>Prudence is that of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall men and Chieftaines, ſuch as <hi>Ceſar,</hi> craft belongs to ſervile perſons, ſuch as <hi>Davus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prudence has an eye to the Stern, but Craft to the Oare.</p>
                  <p>Prudence makes Lawes for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114773:54"/>every mans good, but Craft only for her own.</p>
                  <p>Prudence puniſhes, and gains good-will by it, and makes ſubjects the better; Craft pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes and becomes odious, and the people the worſe for't. It is proper to magnanimity and valour, to gain Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; but to juſtice and temperance to preſerve them, as to the <hi>Venetians:</hi> and he that is adorned with all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is fit for both, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He that acquires Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, muſt have ſuch a Prudence as is magnanimous, ſtout, liberall, juſt, &amp;c. but ſomewhat inclining to pride, boldneſſe, prodigality; but ſeverity mixt with it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He that keepes and preſerves
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114773:54"/>Dominions, muſt have the ſame prudence, but inclining to Puſillanimity, to fear, Tenacity, and [ſome] Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>But if they embrace the ſame Religion with thee (as the <hi>Neapolitanes</hi> with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) treat them gently, receive them into Common friendſhip, and change not their Cuſtomes, nor Polirie, but by degrees: let the Supreme Judges be made out of thine own men; the inferiour out of theirs. If they did violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thine entrance, Levell the <hi>Peers,</hi> with the People: but if they did receive the as friends: Tranſplant them out of their Native ſoyle, and drill them
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114773:55"/>with Honors, Rewards, and Promotions; but be ſure let not the chief heads be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: for they will either grow inſolent, upon Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and render thee odious to the People, or elſe they will rebell.

                  <p>The Remedy for this is, to keep an Empire within its

                  <p>The Remedy of this is to have a choice Militia of thine owne alwaies in readineſſe; to arme and unite thine own men, but to diſarme and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the ſtrangers.

                  </p>
                  <p>The remedy for this is, on a ſudden to divide the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into diſtant quarters: and not to be embodyed till the Generall commands.</p>

                     <q>
                        <hi>'Tis expedient, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Peers, and the Plebeians, there ſhould be a middle ſort, and degree of Perſons, as a Seminary of Nobility: ſuch as were the Knights and Gentlemen of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114773:70"/>Rome: for this degree is a kinde of tye, or Ligament of both the other</hi>
                     </q>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Peeres contend with the people [uſually] about ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Offices, Tributes, and Matrymonie, and Lands, and the like: and if the Nobility get the day, the Republique is ruin'd; for it is neceſſary for them to keep under a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſuſpicious people, and thence comes their downfall. But if the people gain the day, the matter's worſe then before, for either the Nobles are driven into baniſhment, or elſe they call in ſtrangers, and ſo the people become a prey to every crafty Citizen, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign potentate, or valiant Commander.</p>
                  <p>If once the Nobles mix and couple themſelves with the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114773:71"/>Plebians, to the end they may partake of the government with them; they grow vile and deſpicable both together, and ſo the common-wealth falls to ground; as it alwaies happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Florentine repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and divers times in that of <hi>Genoa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The remedy is, if the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (of a middle Size betwixt the Nobles and the pelting Plebeian) get the upper hand, and ſhare Magiſtracies and honours now and then, and Lands and Provinces alſo, By ſuch contentions <hi>Rome</hi> flouriſhed and grew great, and yet granted the honour of Victories, and the credit of them, to the Commons: but <hi>Florence</hi> periſhed under them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A republique is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, when Lawes are made
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114773:71"/>to the advantage of <hi>great ones,</hi> and preſſure of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the <hi>Powers</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>uſurpe Anthority</hi> [over the people] and keep guards for their defence; as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri</hi> did at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Thirty Tyrants</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Luxury</hi> of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> and their neglect of Armes [and Arts] makes them vile and cheap in the peoples eyes; and ſo makes a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſink into a baſe <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. When a <hi>Patrician</hi> grows too rich or potent, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations grow rife about priority, then the republique's loſt: So <hi>Sylla</hi> when he had ſubdued <hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Ceſar</hi> when <hi>Craſſus</hi> was ſlaine, and <hi>Pompey</hi> conquered (who were
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114773:72"/>then Rivalls in the Empire) carried all before them, and were Tyrants at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Correſpondency with ſome forraign Prince, of any perſon in power, may ruine a republique.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When any fawning Poplicola, in a time of Famin, or other occaſion, endeavours to gain the people by oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and advantage, and by ſuch arts, gets the power into his own clutches; theſe muſt be lookt to, and ſuppreſſed, as <hi>Metius</hi> was in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Manlius</hi> &amp;c. which King <hi>David</hi> neglecting in <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi> run the hazard [of his life and Crown.]</p>
                  <p n="9">9. A <hi>Republique</hi> falls: to ground oft-times, becauſe it wants a <hi>Militia;</hi> when the people &amp; Patritians mutually
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114773:72"/>fear one another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon call in forraign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, which is uſuall in <hi>Venice.</hi>

                  <p>Which commanders after ſome ſignal Victory obtained, either themſelves ſeize upon the common wealth (as <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> did at <hi>Millain,</hi>

                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p>A Republique muſt never
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114773:73"/>be <hi>Neutrall,</hi> becauſe it muſt neceſſarily be a prey to the Conqueror, not being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported either by friends or enemies <hi>[Nec amicis nec ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micis fota Lat.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. A <hi>Republique</hi> falls, when the <hi>People</hi> confide not in the <hi>Nobility,</hi> nor the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in them; and therefore they call in a forraign <hi>Umpire,</hi> that will devour them both: as <hi>Florence</hi> call'd in King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> &amp; <note n="*" place="margin">or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Dux.</note>, the Duke of <hi>Athens.</hi>

                  <p>It is dangerous to call in a ſtranger to the adminiſtration of juſtice, as the <hi>Florentines</hi> uſed to do; for this is a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of diſſention amongſt
