            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

higher times, and neerer the Apostles, such
was the clarity and splendour of the pure
Church, that in a manner it obscured the
Sun. But, in succeeding and degenerating
times, after the number of the name of the
Beast, 666, it began much to be obscured
and clouded with ignorance and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and in the thousandth yeer, in which,
Satan was let loose, and much more after,

from the beginning
long before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of Christ,
God euer had his
Church, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more visible
and glorious, and sometimes more
contracted, and obscured: so since the
appearance of our Sauiour, at all
times infallibly and without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there haue been chosen children
of God, who haue retained his faith,


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27282:6"/>
and calling vpon his name haue stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
to expresse their knowledge in
their life, by retyring themselues both
from the loose conuersation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,
and the profanation of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
persons. Neither euer was
there any of our profession, which
did teach or write the contrary. But
wheras the Synagogue of Rome layes
it downe for a fundamentall Rule,
that this Church hath been and must
bee in all ages, a visible and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Congregation at the least, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of an apparant Hierarchy, so
that at all times a man may poynt it
out, and may repaire thither, as to a

pompous too; or to say as <hi>Stapleton</hi>

               <hi>It is euermore visible in respect

and to the people and Cleargie

that the Lord shall not come, except

with great pride and disdaine should
shew himselfe. This is solemnly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of by the Apostle, and by all both

to some matter of great note, that
is to say, some maine declining from

to touch this sore, which can in no case

interpreted, to note nothing else but
the slipping of diuers regions &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

(in the Margent it is, <hi>and from

Heere they would haue vs take the

deserueth a long pause: we rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
out of them, that this reuolt is in
matter of faith, and not onely from
the Empire; then which Glosse, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be truer. Well then, if there
must bee so egregious an Apostacie, it

will not bee negligent so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the publike seruice of God, that
it shall not carry any liuely head, or

So that certainely our <hi>Rhemistes</hi> yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

confesse so much, as that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parancy

for if any body held it vp, it was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi>
who then played least in

<hi>Liberius,</hi> who did for a time second
him, did afterward shrinke. He went

it he would, that he only consented

               <note n="b" place="margin">Cochleus. l. 2.</note> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

that vnto this day there remaineth a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

<hi>That the people of Germanie are now by

               <hi>Vnto this day remaineth the

or leauings of the <hi>Hussites to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the Church, and the Germanes to
cast out all new Sectes.</hi> VVhat can bee
more euident, then that the Doctrine
of <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was sensibly and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
continued somewhere, euen till
the dayes of <hi>Martin Luther?</hi> Vnto
which may bee added, that whereas
<hi>Luther</hi> began to shew himselfe but in

there be good reason assigned, why it

was imbraced by many, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintained euen vnto the death.
When <hi>Hus</hi> began first to preach the
people which vsed<note n="h" place="margin">Cochleus l. 1.</note> handy craftes did
with great desire heare his sermons, &amp;
did read the scriptures, being turned by

that the Pope the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing was <hi>Antichrist;</hi>

King of <hi>Naples,</hi> then infesting the

three persons were martyred for this

In small processe of time, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

               <hi>Onuphrius</hi>

one was against the <hi>Hussites,</hi> the other
to take away the Schisme between the
Popes. These of liklihood grew great,
that now a generall Councell was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against them. Neither did the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

but the Nobles of <hi>Bohemia</hi> stood appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

to the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> in

and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi> (contrary to the

Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the second then
intending warres against the Turke,
did by all meanes perswade them,
that they should yeeld obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. This <hi>George,</hi> saith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
<hi>was borne and brought vp in the
heresie of the Hussites.</hi> Now when
Pope <hi>Pius</hi> did interpose himselfe as a


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27282:27"/>
Mediator betweene the King and his

would not yeeld thereunto, the King
calleth together the Estates of his
kingdome, and protesteth that hee
would liue &amp; die in those Compacts,
and so did also the nobles which were
<hi>Hussites.</hi> This was done at <hi>Prage</hi> in the
yeare 1462. This resolutenesse of his
caused that Pope to tolerate many
things in him. But <hi>Paul</hi> 2, who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in that See of <hi>Rome,</hi> did excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
that King, &amp; set vp a <hi>Croisado</hi>

and <hi>Silesia,</hi> &amp; a good part of the
kingdom of <hi>Bohemia: Vratislauia</hi> also,
and some other Prouinces and Cities
did put themselues in subiection to
<hi>Mathias.</hi> Yet did not <hi>George</hi> deale hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Papistes which were in
<hi>Prage;</hi> but in his greatest extremity did
vse both the aduise and aid of many
Nobles of the popish belief. At length,
after the continuance of warre for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
yeares, <hi>Mathias</hi> concludeth a peace
with king <hi>George,</hi> both against the wil
of<note n="q" place="margin">Cochl. l. 12.</note> the Pope, and the Emperour. And
then this King was content to aske of
the Pope an absolution from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
some Princes being
mediators for him in that respect. But
before the Agents could returne from
<hi>Rome,</hi> the King died, in the yeare of
our Lord, 1471. By this Story it is
manifest, that both noble and learned
of high account, were of that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Beliefe which <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> taught, and
were contented to aduenture al things


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:27282:28"/>
which they had in the world for the
maintenance of the same.</p>
            <p>Perhaps here it may bee asked;<note place="margin">Sect. II.</note> but
how shal we know that <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and
his followers did imbrace that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which is now professed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
We find in <hi>Aeneas Syluius,</hi> some
opinions of theirs, which peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will scant be reputed currant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all <hi>English</hi> Protestants. Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearseth
these foure of theirs:<note n="m" place="margin">Hist. Bohem. c. 50.</note> 
               <hi>That
they would receiue the Sacraments in both
kinds; that ciuill dominion is inhibited to
Clergie men; that Preaching of the Word
was permitted to al men; that publik crimes
are in no sort to be tolerated.</hi> I answer, that
truth it is, that hee there mentioneth
onely those; and whether he relateth
them truly or no, it may be doubted, as
anon I shall shew, by laying open the
custom of the enemies of the Gospell,
in misreporting their doctrine. But
<note n="n" place="margin">Ep. 130.</note> elsewhere he deliuereth other opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theirs, as <hi>against the Supremacy of


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27282:29"/>
the Pope against Purgatory, against Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints,</hi> and such like matters. If
we returne to <hi>Cochleus,</hi> who was best
acquainted with their matters, we shal
find much more. As thus,<note n="o" place="margin">Coch. Hist. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Hus</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the Books of Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into the <hi>Bohemian</hi> tongue, and the
people did most diligently read them.
They would haue <hi>the holy Scriptures to

held, <hi>that all Bishops and Priestes are the
Successors of the Apostles;</hi> that, <hi>not the

neither are the Cardinals the body, but all
that beleeue in Christ;</hi> that, <hi>that the Pope
is not a member of the Church, but of the

began to be distinguished in two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;
the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not so much
dissent from the Pope as the other:
Those which in fewer matters diffred
from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> retained still
the name of <hi>Hussites;</hi> they which disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in more, were called <hi>Thaborites,</hi>
of <hi>Thabor,</hi> the citie which <hi>Zisca</hi> built
for them. And these were the greater
number, and the stronger. There is in
<hi>Cochleus</hi> a confession of faith made by
one <hi>Iohann. Pezibram,</hi> a <hi>Bohemian,</hi> who
was but a <hi>Hussite,</hi> and not wel affected
to the <hi>Thaborites,</hi> because he accounted
them as a kinde of Precisians, or Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
in comparison of himselfe; yet this

that they held,<note n="u" place="margin">Artic. 55.</note> 
               <hi>that materiall bread doth
remaine in the Sacrament; that the Saints
now triumphant are not to be called vpon;
that there is no purgatory; that no suffrages
or prayers are to be made for the dead. Also
they allow not of the holy dayes almost of all
the Saints, nor of Eue or Vigils that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; nor the consecrations of visible
things, as salt, oyle, holy water, Bels,</hi> and
such like. <hi>They haue a schismaticall cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of their Masses,</hi> that is, a seuerall
sort of Church-seruice, <hi>and refuse the
most celebrious seruice of the Church, and
the rites and administrations of almost all
the Sacraments.</hi> Let our Papists now
speak, whether they &amp; we do not agree
in the same doctrine altogether. For I

so much grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the Scripture, and reprooue the cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
of that time, as also the Priests;
to the exceeding great trouble and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

into English, as may bee seene
by diuerse Copies written and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

the first yeere of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fift,
diuers were put to death as <hi>Lollards.</hi>
Afterward the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
for a shew, as if hee had beene a

also burnt as a reputed Heretick. So
was one <hi>Iohn Claydon,</hi> for his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
consumed to ashes. Not long
after the comming of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixt
to the Kingdome,<note place="margin">Sub. Hen. 6.</note> besides diuers
which were questioned and much
troubled about religion, <hi>Taylor</hi> and
<hi>White,</hi> two Priests, and <hi>Houeden</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen

escape without the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of sundry English, yeelding vp
their liues for Iesus Christ his sake, and
for the profession of the truth: The
particular Stories of whom may bee
found in the Author aboue-named.
The Clergy of those times did beare
much sway with their Princes, and


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27282:43"/>
left no meanes vnsought, no stone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
to keepe vp the dignity and
preeminence of their romish Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
and the superstitious Idolatry
which then was in vse. Now, if in the
Raigne of all these Princes, so many
were slaughtered for the testimony of
a good conscience, how many weake
brethren were there, who made not
open profession of their faith? &amp; how
many did there lie hid, diuers of them
in probability hauing confederates,
and some of them beeing Priests, and
therfore not vnlikely to haue learning
both to confirme themselues in the

had euill opinions, yet so it is, that these
did not stir vp the hate of the Pope and of
great Princes against them so much, as
their liberty of speech did, wherewith they
vsed to blame the vices and dissolutenesse
of the said Princes and of the Clergie, yea,
to tax the vices and actions of the Popes.
This was the principall point which
brought them into vniuersall hatred, and
which charged them with more euil opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then they had.</hi> Now first, that they
were not men infamous, either for


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:27282:48"/>
their vile opinions or filthy conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and secondly, that they were not
onely base and poore people, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by this, that so many noble and
worthy men took part with them,
yea, to the aduenturing of their liues
in their company, and for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe;
as the Counts or Earles of
<hi>Tholouse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of <hi>Coninges,</hi> of <hi>Bigorr,</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
yea, the King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> And
when <hi>Raymund,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Tholouse,</hi>
was for his beliefe excommunicated
by the Pope, and a Croisado was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against him and the Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses,
as if they had beene Saracens
or Infidels, not onely the Counties of
<hi>Foix</hi> and <hi>Coninges</hi> came with all their
strength to assist <hi>Raymund,</hi> but <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> came in his
owne person to his succour, as beeing
his kinsman and his friend. And when
all these were met together; <hi>the report
is, saith</hi> Du Haillan, <hi>that the Armie of
these Hereticks did consist of about the
number of one hundred thousand fighting


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27282:48"/>
men.</hi> These things beeing thus disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
by men of your owne part; bee
ashamed, you Papists, and blush to
spread among your simple and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Followers, that neuer men did as
we doo, nor beleeued as wee beleeue,
before <hi>Luther</hi>'s time; but that all
Christendome formerly liked of the
papisticall doctrine and proceedings.
But because you shall heare one testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
further touching these Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses
and Waldenses, how honest
and truely religious they were, I will
cite what one <hi>Reinerius,</hi> a man who
did hate them, and was (as it is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
an Inquisitor against them, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
concerning them, now 300 yeers
ago, or thereabout. Thus then, among
much other matter, he saith of them:
<hi>There were many Sects of Hereticks long
ago: among all which Sects that are or
were, there is not one more pernicious to
the Church of God, than that of the poore
men of <hi>Lyons,</hi> for three causes. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is of longer continuance: some say,


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27282:49"/>
that it hath endured from the time of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uester:</hi>
others say, that from the time of
the Apostles. The second is, because it is
more generall: for, there is almost no Land
into which this Sect doth not creep. The
third, that whereas all other, by the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their blasphemies against God, doo
make men abhorre them; this of the Lyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
hauing a great shew of godlinesse,
because they doo liue iustly before men, and
doo beleeue all things well of God, and all
the Articles which are contained in the
Creed, onely the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>they
doo blaspheme and hate: which the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is easie to beleeue. And as</hi> Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'<hi>s
Foxes had their faces seueral waies,
but their tails tied one to another: so He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
are diuerse in Sects among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
but in the impugning of the Church
they are vnited.</hi> There can hardly be
found a more honourable testimony
out of the mouth or penne of a bitter
and bloudy Aduersary as he was, who
wrote this &amp; much more concerning
those good seruants of God. We shall

was not deeply learned. <hi>Berengarius</hi>
indeed was onely called in question
for denying Transubstantiation in the

by the strength of our Sauiour, and for
disliking then the vile life of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
how cleer, how learned, how co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
is hee! These things wee teach
together with him; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his other slips, we doubt not
but his soule doth rest with the Lord,
God pardoning vnto him his errours
and his ignorances; which hee, being
carried with the stream of that Time;
did neuer discusse, but took them as
they were deliuered to him, without
scanning or examining. And to this
good hope we are firmly induced by
that Saying of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>

that our best deeds are but <hi>via Regni,

that cause, we doubt not but his soule
is safe, though his hay and stubble of
praying to Saints, and such other stuffe
as cannot endure the fire of the holy
Ghost's triall, doo burn and consume.
And this is our iudgement touching
many other both before and after the
time of Saint <hi>Bernard;</hi> that, holding
Christ the Foundation aright, and
groning vnder the heauy burden of
humane traditions, satisfaction, and
other popish trash, they, by a generall
repentance from their errors and lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
knowne and vnknowne, and by
an assured faith in their Sauiour, did
finde fauour with the Lord. Such as
these were we hold to be God's good
seruants, to bee of the number of the
Elect; and, <hi>propter sanioren et meliorem

            <p>And in this respect our settled and<note place="margin">Sect. 21.</note>
resolued iudgement is, that when it is

we haue formerly answered, truly say,
that it was in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in

<hi>Spiritus vbi vult spirat,</hi> the holy
Ghost breatheth where it pleaseth: for
who cannot conceiue by the writings
of many in former Ages, or by such
touches as others doe giue concerning
them, that diuers, who liued neerest
the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> did most detest
her abomination; and, finding that
the weaknes and impurity of her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
could not truely satisfie the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and thirsty soule, did, according
to that knowledge which Christ out
of his Word reuealed vnto them, seek


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27282:52"/>
some means which was not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professed in that Time? And if it be
asked, Who they were, and how they
could lie hid from the world? It may
truly be answered, that their case was
like the case of them in the daies of
<hi>Elias,</hi> who were not knowne to that
State which would haue persecuted<note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 18</note>
them. Now, why should not wee
think, but as God had his secret and
inuisible company at that time, in
that most idolatrous Countrey: so, in
the time of the deepest darknesse, hee
had those which saw light; his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Children, among Antichrists
Brood; such as embraced true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
among the superstitious? So that
<hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and these Westerne
parts, had some of Gods Saints in all
Ages, who, like Sea-fish, most fresh in
the salt water, and beeing remoued in
their affections, though not in their
persons,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 8.</note> did with <hi>Lot</hi> vex their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

of the world. And yet it is not to bee
taken, that wee coarctate the Church
within those Prouinces onely which
looked towards the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> but
know, that God had thousands of his
Elect elsewhere. Christians haue bin

And is it not probable, that long since,
when much darknesse did couer the
face of the earth, that few had grace to
perceiue their dooings, and fewer had
authority to question their doctrine,
the Pope-holy Clergie, which hated
the true gospellers with all their harts,
would pay them with vile &amp; odious
reports; when in this Age, wherein
God hath affoorded more plentifull
meanes to discouer their false-hoods,
they doo dare, not onely in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,

for that cause, there was no corner of
the braine of man, or rather of men, in
many Ages succeeding together, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought,
to procure glory to that which
in it selfe was very vnglorious. Their
care therefore was, to conuert the eies
of all persons on their externall hue,
which was maruellously adorned
and garnished to the sense with their
Crosses set vp or carried before some<note place="margin">Prefat. catal. testium veritat.</note>
Prelates, with the triple Crowne of
their Popes, in the red Hats of their
Cardinals, the precious attire of some
in their Churches, their prodigious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
abroad, the diuers color'd Couls
of their Monks, such singing &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with Organes, such ringing of
Bells, such trimming of Images, and
many more such sensible matters, as
that neither the Iewes nor the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
had the like. And among al this, if
true Religion in diuers were present, it
is not to be maruelled at, if shee were

scant seene, or if no notice were taken
of her for her poore, and vntrimmed,
or vngarnished hue, for her naked sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and vnpainted integrity. It was
the commendation giuen to <hi>Salomons</hi>

that <hi>the Kings daughter is all

purity in faith, verity in doctrine, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereness
in behauiour, innocency, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and such like spirituall comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And these are as much contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in others, by the Antichristian
Rabble, as they are neglected in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
whereas their externall pomp,
on the contrary side, is as much despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Lord, as it is magnified in
their fleshly and carnall imaginations.
The Lord direct vs in his own waies,
and call home such as wilfully, or by
ignorance, haue gone astray; that at
length they may bee reduced to the
sheepfold of Christ Iesus: to whom,
with his Father and the blessed Spirit,
be praise for euermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
