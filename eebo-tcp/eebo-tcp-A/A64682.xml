            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>BISHOP <hi>USHER'S</hi> SECOND PROPHESIE, Which he discovered to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on his <hi>Sick-Bed,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HE Prophesied of the Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Massacre there, and the Wars in <hi>England,</hi> many Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they brake out; and this he saw fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>He Prophesied of another great Persecution that was to come; and when one demanded of him, whether that great Persecution were passed or not? He turning his Eyes to the Person asking him, and fixing them after an ireful manner, as he was wont to do, when he spake not his own Words; and when the Power of God was upon him; he said, Feed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53732:3"/>
not your selves with vain Hopes of its being past: For I tell you, all you have seen, is but the beginning of Sorrow, to that which is to come over all the Protestant Churches of Christ, who e're long will fall under a sharper Persecution than ever they have had upon them; and therefore, (said he to the Person that spake to him) look you be not found in the Outward Court; for Christ will measure all that profess his Name, and call themselves his People; and the Outward Court he will leave out to be trodden under Foot, and to be swept away, whose Religion stands in performing the outward part, without the inward power of Faith, and Love uniting them unto Christ. Those God will give to be trodden down, and swept away by the Gentiles; but the Worshippers which are in the Temple before the Altar, are those who indeed worship God in Spirit, and in Truth; whose Souls are made his Temples, by whom he is loved and adored in their most inward Thoughts: They have, and do sacrifice their Lusts and vile corrupt Affections, and their own Will to him. These God will hide in the Hollow of his Hand, and under the Shadow of his Wing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53732:3"/>
And this shall be one great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the last and all preceding Persecutions, That whereas in the former, the most eminent Saints were cut off, here the most eminent and faithful to God shall be preserved by God as a seed for the Glory which shall immediately follow to the Churches, as soon as this storm shall be blown over; for as it shall be the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, so it shall be a short Persecution, and shall take away the Dross with Hypocrites and Formalists, whilst the true Spiritual Believers shall be preserved till the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is over.</p>
            <p>It was then asked, by what Instruments this Persecution should be carried on? He answered, by the <hi>Papists.</hi> It was answered, that seemed improbable, since they were now less countenanced, and less numerous than heretofore in these Nations, and people more against them. He replyed, it should be by their Hands, and by the way of a suddain Massacre; and that the Pope should be the Instrument of it.</p>
            <p>And these things he pake with that Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that was seen to be, which had been observed in him, when he predicted se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53732:4"/>
things formerly, which came to pass ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, in the Observation, and to the Knowledge of those he spake them to. And he added, those were in his esteem the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. And the Second, to whom the outward Court should be left, that they might tread it under Foot, they having received the Gentiles Worship by Images and many Mediators. And this, saith he, is more designing among them, and will come; therefore look you be found watching and ready.</p>
            <p>The like he spake also to the Lady <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> his Daughter, about the same time, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself as above: And the said Lady adds, that after she had opened the Door of his Chamber, she found him with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, and Tears running down his Cheeks apace, and in a kind of Extasie, wherein he continued after she came in, near half an hour, without taking any notice of her; and then recovering, told her, his Thoughts were exercised in contemplating the great Miseries and Persecution which was coming, which would be so sharp and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that they had drawn those Tears from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53732:4"/>
his Eyes; but he hoped he should not live to see it; but possibly she might: for they are, said he, even at the Door; therefore take heed you be not found sleeping.</p>
            <p>The same also he repeated to Mrs. <hi>Bisse,</hi> the Chief Baron of <hi>Ireland's</hi> Wife in <hi>Dublin,</hi> with this Circuustance added to her, That, said he, if they bring in the King, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him, it may a little longer be deferred; but it will surely come; and therefore be not unprovided for it.</p>
