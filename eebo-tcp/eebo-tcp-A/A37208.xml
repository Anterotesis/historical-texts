         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the whole Creation hath
groaned ever ſince its
original ſubjection unto
Vanity, earneſtly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the manifestation of the Sons
of God: ſo more eſpecially in
theſe latter dayes the travelling
pains thereof have encreaſed, as
preſages of its approaching Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
The vanity of it hath
alwayes been great, but the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
Diſcoveries thereof never
<pb facs="tcp:58315:3"/>
more than now. In this caſe it is
the wiſdome of a Chriſtian to ſecure
to himſelf an Interest in a Portion as
ſufficient and permanent as <hi>Jehovah</hi>
that never changeth: A greater than
which cannot be procured: This may,
and a leſs will never ſatisfie: By
this men live indeed, and in this
is the Life of a Chriſtian. <hi>That the
Lord's Portion are his People,</hi>
addeth nothing to him that is alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to himſelf; but, that <hi>the
Lord is their Portion,</hi> is all in all
to them. And this is the foundation of
their Hope and Comfort. For here we
are all embarqued in a Veſſel, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
caught with Windes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
covered with Waves, and
ſhould ſoon be at our wits end,
but for this ſure and steadfast ancre
which entreth into that <hi>within the
Vail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that Portion, and this Hope
<pb facs="tcp:58315:3"/>
grounded on it, are the Churches, and
a Chriſtians ſupport in the midſt of
their lamentations: For the Church
at this time was driven from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
Zion,</hi> Temple, Temple-Ordinances,
and native Place of
reſidence, greatly afflicted and toſſed
with Tempests. This is only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that ſhe hath God for her portion,
and Hope for her Anchor, never to
be taken from her. And both theſe are
the Subject of the enſuing Diſcourſe,
ſeaſonable and ſuitable at all times,
eſpecially in theſe laſt moments of the
laſt Dayes, in which God is ſhaking
Heaven, Earth, and Sea, in order to
the appearance of the Deſire of all
Nations.</p>

which the ſame Writer thinks, was
this Chapter, which conſiſteth of a
threefold Alphabet, in the Hebrew.
The Prophet, having diſcharged his
offices, in labouring to convince the
Jews of their ſins, and to bring them
to repentance, when he found not the
ſucceſſe he deſired, he fals to lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and weeping, for their pride and
obſtinacy in ſin, and teacheth them
alſo how to lament their own miſery
in Captivity; and, becauſe there was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58315:6"/>
among them a basket of good figges, he
teacheth them how to exerciſe faith and
hope in the middeſt of their ſorrows.
Among other paſſages, my Text hath
a tendency thereunto, which admits a
double conſideration: 1. As a part of
a Lamentation. 2. As an expreſſion
of a free ſpirit. Accordingly I ſhall
handle it, firſt, as a part of a Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In verſe 17, 18. you may ſee
their deep dejection and deſpondency;
<hi>I ſaid my strength and my hope is peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from the Lord.</hi> In verſ. 19, 20,
21. you may ſee how, from the good
fruit of their affliction, in humbling
them, they gather hope. In verſ. 22,
23. they can ſee mercy in God towards
them in their Affliction. In my Text,
they are as men that find reſt, after
their dangers and toſſings at Sea, by
caſting Anchor upon firme ground, in
a ſafe Harbour. The Doctrinal note I
collect from the words ſo conſidered,
is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Though it may be the caſe of true
believers to be greatly dejected for a
time, yet, even then, God doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their ſpirits, and quicken their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58315:7"/>
faith and hope in him. To clear this
point, we muſt prove two things.
1. That it may be the caſe of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
to be greatly dejected, for a
time. This may be abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
both by the Scriptures in the
examples of <hi>Iob, David, Hezekiah,
Aſaph, Heman,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in the Garden, and on the Croſſe,
and by reaſons of ſundry ſorts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. From God himſelf, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with-holding the light of his
countenance from true believers. Then
it is with them, as it is with the earth,
which would be covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
coldneſſe, and deadneſſe, if the
light and influence of the Sun were
with-drawn from it. He is the God of
all comfort, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. without him no
true comfort can be had. Sometimes
he creates darkneſſe in the Soul; then
it is filled with fear and amazement,
and diſquietment. And thus he doth,
for holy and good ends. 1. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
believers to Chriſt, as members
to their head, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. 2. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them, where their <hi>life is hid,</hi>
viz. <hi>with Chriſt, in God, Col.</hi> 3. 3.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58315:7"/>
and that Chriſt, <hi>the laſt Adam, is
made a quickning Spirit. 1 Cor. 15.
45.</hi> that thereby he may quicken his
People in God, who quickeneth the
dead, when themſelves had not only a
ſentence of death, in their bodies, as
<hi>Paul</hi> had, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. but alſo a ſenſe
of death in their ſoules, as <hi>Heman</hi> had,
<hi>Pſalme</hi> 88. 5. 3. To reforme them.
Partly, for correction of their unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
for former comforts received
from him, and for their not improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them unto the ends for which he
gave them. As a father, when he ſeeth
his child doth but play with the candle
which he afforded him to work by,
takes it from him, and leave him in the
dark. Partly, for prevention of ſpiritual
pride. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Of ſpiritual wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe,
and ſelf confidence, <hi>Pſal.
30.</hi> 6, 7. Of carnal ſecurity, <hi>Cant. 5.
6.</hi> and ſundry other diſtempers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. From Satan, that envious
one, who, as in the beginning he
ſought to caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice,
and to bereave him of his happineſſe in
communion with God, ſo now, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
believers in the Kingdom of grace,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58315:8"/>
which conſiſts in righteouſneſſe, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit,
when he cannot deprive them of their
righteouſneſſe, will endeavour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
their peace, and damp their joy,
knowing, that when they performe
duties uncomfortably, they do them
weakly and but by halves. To this
end: 1. He ſtrives to hide from them
thoſe promiſes that might comfort
them, when they have moſt need and
uſe of them, and he ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
herein. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. 2. He ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts
any word that may terrefie them,
and preſents to their memory and
thoughts former ſins, to amaze them.
3. He preſents all thimgs unto them in
falſe glaſſes; the comforts of God, in
a diminiſhing glaſſe, that God may
ſeem to them leſſe merciful, leſſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
then he is, and the promiſes of
God leſſe free, leſſe general then they
are; that all the conſolations of God
may ſeem ſmall things to them, <hi>Iob
15.</hi> 11. but he preſents to them their
ſins in a multiplying glaſſe, that they
may ſeem more, and greater then they
are; their ſins, as impardonable; their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58315:8"/>
miſeries, as intollerable, incurable;
their ſtate, as deſperate. 4. He uſeth
his inſtruments to deal with them, as
the Philiſtims did with <hi>Izhack,</hi> whoſe
wells they ſtopped up, to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to them thoſe wells of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
from whence believers might
draw waters of conſolation. Thus he
uſed <hi>Saul</hi> to baniſh <hi>David</hi> from the
ordinances, and wicked men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
and reproach him; ſaying, <hi>VVhere
is now thy God? Pſal.</hi> 42. 3. So o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to twit them with their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when they are in diſtreſſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where are now your prayers, your
hearing, reading, meditating, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
your conſcientious and exact
walking, your confidence in God?
You live more dejectedly then others,
and are as fearful, as others, to die.
Thus they thruſt, as it were, ſwords
and daggers into their bones, to kill
their comforts, as <hi>David</hi> there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
verſe 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 3. From themſelves: 1. Sin
preſſeth down their ſpirits, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their cheerful progreſſe in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
courſe, as weight doth runners
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58315:9"/>
in a race, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. Sorrow in the
heart brings it down, eſpecially, when
guilt of ſin is added to it. When
the ſhoulder is out of joynt, it cannot
bear its own pain, much leſſe other
burthens. So it is with the ſoul, a
wounded ſpirit who can bear? <hi>Prov.
18.</hi> 14. 2. Their ſpirit ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from their bodies, by ſympathy; as
in melancholy, which ſo darkens their
imagination, that every thing ſeems
dark to them, and ſo ſowres their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that every thing ſeems bitter to
them, and ſo fills them with fears and
ſuſpitions, that every thing affrights
them. 3. Sometimes paſſion ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
in them, that the higher fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the ſoul are ſubjected to the
affections, which ſo bemiſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
that it cannot judge of
things according to right reaſon: The
conſcience becomes ſuſpenſive, and
wavering, and the memory, like a
leaking veſſel, lets the grounds of
comfort run out, and be forgotten:
4. Sometimes ſpiritual gifts of grace
are not exerciſed, but as the body
growes liſtleſs when ſome dull humour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58315:9"/>
ſeizeth upon it; ſo in the ſoul, when
faith is oppreſſed by unbelief, hope
with fears, they do not put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to wreſtle with God, and ſtir
up themſelves to take hold on him, but
yield unto every temptation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.
Thus you ſee, that it may
be the caſe of believers to be greatly
dejected, for a time.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be cleared, is;
That though it be thus with true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
for a time; yet then God will
do two things for them.</p>
            <p>1. He will ſecretly ſupport them, ſo
that they may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did, in 2 <hi>Cor.
4. 8, 9. VVe are troubled on every
ſide, yet not distreſſed; we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
but not in despair, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but not forſaken; caſt down, but
not destroyed.</hi> God dealt with the baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
of good figges, in Captivity, as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> did with <hi>Peter,</hi> who firſt let
him ſee his own weakneſſe, in the
water, then quickned him to cry unto
him for help, and then ſtretched forth
his hand and upheld him. <hi>Mat. 14. 30,
31.</hi> So the Lord left the Church ſo far
that they complained my hope is peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from the Lord, yet ſpeedily raiſed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58315:10"/>
them up in ſight of his mercy to truſt
and hope in him. In like manner, he
ſupports believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. From Gods unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in his love, and unweariedneſſe
in doing them good. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 5. and
40. 27, 28, 29, 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. From Gods faithfulneſſe in
his covenant and promiſes. <hi>Iſa. 54. 8,
9. Pſal. 37. 24. Heb.</hi> 13. 5. 2. He
will quicken their faith, to look unto
himſelf for relief and comfort, in ſuch
times, 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 12. Pſal. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1.
1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Jon.</hi> 2. 2, 4. for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. From the efficacy of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of faith in them. As the needle in
the Compaſſe, being touched with the
Load-ſtone, though it may be moved
and ſhaken this way and that, for a
time, yet reſteth not till it point to
the North; ſo the ſoul, being touched
with the ſpirit of faith, though it may
be forced, by Temptation, from its
bent, for a time, yet it hath no reſt,
till it ſtand God-ward. They may by
Temptations be as ſheep driven from
mountaine to mountaine, and forget
their reſting place. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 6. But
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58315:10"/>
the ſpirit of, faith in them will cauſe
them to return unto God, and to ſay,
as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116. 7. Return unto
thy reſt, O my ſoul. Believers are like
<hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, that finding no reſt for
the ſoles of its feet, in the deluge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto the Arke. Other men will
like the Raven, be ſoon ſatisfied with
other things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. From the ſutable operation
of Gods ſpirit in them unto Gods end
in afflicting them. Gods end, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
his children, is to drive them
from all other things unto himſelf. For
he corrects them for their good, <hi>Heb.
12.</hi> 10. And its good for them to draw
neer to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 28. When
afflictions work us thereunto, it is
from the ſpirits ſanctifying operation
in them. For, 1. afflictions cannot
work thus of themſelves, but rather
ſet men further off from God by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment
with his providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it croſſeth their carnal affections.
And, 2. the ſoul of it ſelf is apt to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,
in ſuch caſes, and to have
hard thoughts of God. And 3. Satan
takes ſuch occaſions to breed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58315:11"/>
a diſtance and diviſion between
the ſoul and God. Therefore it muſt
be from the ſanctifying operation of
Gods ſpirit in them and with them,
when they work this good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. For Inſtruction. 1. Here
we may ſee the differenc between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
and others, in their dejected
condition. 1. Believers have the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of faith in them, whereby the ſoul,
though it be over-borne by paſſion and
Temptation, for a time, yet it will
worke it ſelf into freedom again, as
oil will be uppermoſt. The ſpirit, as
a ſpring, will be cleanſing it ſelf more
and more, from that mudde that is
in it. But the heart of unbelievers is
like a ſtanding poole, where that
which is caſt into it reſts. They are
like the Sea, where trouble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe
are in their proper place,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 20. True reſt and peace are
for ever ſeparated from ſin in any ſoul,
till the breach between God and the
ſoul be made up by faith in Chriſt.
2. Believers have an intereſt in God,
and he in them, through Jeſus Chriſt.
Hence they are kept, as in a Garriſon,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58315:11"/>
by his mighty power, through faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. through the
interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 3. by
the ſpirit of Chriſt dwelling with
them, and who ſhall be in them and
abide with them for ever: So that
they ſhall not be left comfortleſſe.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18. Hereupon <hi>Paul</hi>
triumphed, in <hi>Rom. 8. 35, &amp;c.</hi> Where
he puts the queſtion about perſons, and
anſwers about things, neither ſhall
ſeparate them from the love, which
either Chriſt bears to them, or they
to Chriſt. Sin cannot ſeparate them
from Chriſts love to them, becauſe
he hath more than conquered it, by
his own power. Tribulation cannot
ſeperate believers from the love they
bear to Chriſt, becauſe they ſhall more
then conquer it, by the power of
Chriſt. It is not our hold of God and
Chriſt, but Gods and Chriſts hold of
us that keeps us to him. The root
bears us up, not we the root. <hi>Rom.
11.</hi> 18. This <hi>Aſaph</hi> acknowledged
unto God, when his feet were almoſt
gone, his ſteps had well nigh ſlipt;
ſaying, <hi>Nevertheleſſe I am continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58315:12"/>
with thee, thou haſt holden me by my
right hand, Pſal.</hi> 73. 2, 23. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
are without Chriſt, and
without God in the World. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12.
Therefore when their creature-comforts
fail them, they are as a ſhip toſſed in the
Sea without a Pylot, and without an
Anchor, which ſoon is bulged upon
Rocks, or falleth upon quick-ſands, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no God to guide or ſupport them.</p>
            <p>2. Hence we way learn how to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
our ſelves toward afflicted dejected
Chriſtians. Judge mercifully and
wiſely of poor weaklings. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 1.
men are apt, through want of wiſdom
and love, to miſ-apprehend the cauſes
of their dejectedneſſe. It is the leſſe
to be wondred at, that an heathen
King miſ-interpreted the dejected
countenance of <hi>Nehemiah, Neh. 2.
2.</hi> ſeeing godly and wiſe <hi>Eli,</hi> miſ-cenſured
<hi>Hannah,</hi> as a diſtempered
woman, when ſhe was in bitterneſſe
of ſpirit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. and <hi>Iobs</hi>
friends miſ-judged him for his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and men generally miſ-conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4, 5.
They are not alwayes the beſt that are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58315:12"/>
merrieſt, nor they the merrieſt in
heart that are ſo in the face. Nor are
they alwayes of the weakeſt faith, or
ſpirit, who are ſometimes dejected,
as we ſee <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> was; in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.
Therefore be not raſh, or harſh in
cenſuring the dejected; but rather
worke with God for their ſupport and
comfort. Two things are required
hereunto; knowledge, and goodneſs,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 14. The firſt will make you
able, the ſecond willing to be helpful
to ſuch. Labour to abound in both,
1. In knowledge both of the word,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16, and of the temper of the
party, that you may ſpeak to them ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
and ſeaſonably, <hi>Iſa. 56. 4.
2.</hi> In goodneſſe, to pity them, to pray
for them, and to ſet them in joynt.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
            <p>2. As for your ſelves, beware that
you miſ-judge not your own eſtate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, under ſuch dejections, but
know that, if ever you had any clear
teſtimony of Gods love to you, in
Jeſus Chriſt, the love of God toward
you in Chriſt is unchangeable, it is an
everlaſting love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58315:13"/>
hold the confidence and rejoycing
of your hope firme unto the end, <hi>Heb.
3.</hi> 6. and ſay, with the Church, in
<hi>Mich. 7. 8. When I ſit in darkneſſe,
the Lord ſhall be a light unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. For Admonition. Take heed
of placing your comfort too much in
the creature, which being ſubject to
change, and inconſtancy, will be apt
to breed diſquietment. Vexation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
followes vanity, when vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not apprehended to be where it is.
In what degree any are lifted up in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of ſatisfying good from
creatures, or overjoyed with the
comforts of them, in that degree they
are dejected in the diſ-appointment of
their hope, and diſtreſſed in the loſſe
of creature-contentments. Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
of affections imbitters all ſuch
afflictions. Hence ariſe thoſe bitter
complaints; I had ſetled my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and hope in ſuch a friend, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
but now they are gone, and
with them all my joy is gone. Woe is
me, I am undone. Therefore <hi>Agur</hi>
prayed wiſely, in <hi>Prov. 30. 8. Remove
far from me vanity and lies.</hi> i. e. vain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58315:13"/>
and falſe apprehenſions, whereby the
affections are too ſtrongly fixed upon
things that are vain, and lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
that contentment, which they
cannot yield; confidence in vanities
makes them Idols, and makes the
heart vaine, like the things it relyes
upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 8. They ſhall find
continual diſquietment who walk in a
vain ſhadow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 6. The beſt
remedy againſt this is, by dwelling in
the ſecret of the moſt High, to abide
under the ſhadow of the Almighty.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 1, 2.</p>
            <bibl>Lam. 3. 24.</bibl>
            <q>The Lord is my
portion, &amp;c:</q>
            <p>The words having been conſiderd,
as they lie in the context, as a part of
a Lamentation; we proceed to handle
them as in my Text they hold forth
the expreſſion of a free ſpirit, that is, of
a ſpirit ſet at liberty from thoſe ſad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
wherein it had been intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and held under deep dejection,
and deſpondency. The Text, thus
conſidered, conteineth the Anchor-Hold
of a toſſed afflicted ſpirit:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58315:14"/>
wherein three particulars are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
1. An Aſſertion, <hi>The Lord is
my portion.</hi> 2. A Proof of it, <hi>ſaith
my ſoul.</hi> 3. A Conſectary, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from the premiſes; <hi>Therefore
will I hope in him.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak onely
of the firſt, at this time: <hi>The Lord
is my portion.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a part, or porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is not to be taken here in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
or common uſe of that
word, as denoting a part of a whole,
as it is frequently in Scripture, when
that part of eſtate, which Parents give
their children, is called their portion,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 14. and that part of the ſpoil,
which is the Souldiers ſhare, is called
their portion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 24. and that
<hi>dimenſum</hi> of food, which is allowed
unto any, is called their portion,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 8. and the almes given to
the poor is called their portion, <hi>Eccl.
11.</hi> 2. For God is not parted, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
and diſtributed among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſo as one hath one part of him,
another another part of God; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one hath whole God wholly; as
the whole Sun ſhines to every one, in
which reſpect God is called a <hi>Sun,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58315:14"/>
Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. Therefore God is ſaid
to be his peoples portion, not in a
comparative, but in an abſolute ſenſe,
God himſelf is theirs, a ſuitable and
all ſufficient goods to them. They have,
not onely gifts and all good things
from him, but himſelf alſo to be their
God, in the Covenant of Grace,
through Jeſus Chriſt. He is their portion
though <hi>not formally,</hi> yet in two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
1. <hi>Objectivèly,</hi> as he is their ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
end, and chief good. 2. <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
as he gives, together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in Chriſt, all good to them. The
Doctrinal note ſhall be this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> All true believers have ſuch
a bleſſed intereſt in God, as renders
him their portion. It is the voice of
faith, to ſay, <hi>The Lord is my portion:</hi>
Others may ſay, The Lord is an all-ſufficient
portion: But onely Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
truly ſay, <hi>The Lord is my
portion.</hi> Becauſe onely faith intereſts
a man in God, and appropriates him
to him. This faith doth by a double
act. 1. By a direct act, whereby
true believers ſee in God thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
which are required in a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58315:15"/>
portion. They are three:
1. All-ſufficiency. 2. Perpetuity. 3. Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in placing his happineſſe and full
contentment there. All theſe the
Scripture declare to be in God alone.
1. Sufficiency, <hi>Gen. 17. 1. Pſal.
84.</hi> 11. 2. Perpetuity. It tells us, that
<hi>he is without ſhadow of change, Jam.
1.</hi> 17. and that <hi>he will never fail, nor
forſake</hi> his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.
3. Safety, in placing all our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and happineſſe in him alone,
<hi>Pſal</hi> 144. 15. 2. By a reflexed act
of faith, a believer ſeeth his peculiar
right and intereſt in God, as his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Hence <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord
is the portion of mine Inheritance, and
of my Cup, Pſal.</hi> 16. 5. and, <hi>Thou
art my portion O Lord, Pſ.</hi> 119. 57. and
<hi>Aſaph, VVhom have I in heaven but
thee, and there is none upon earth
that I deſire, beſides thee:</hi> And again,
<hi>God is the ſtrength of my heart, and
my portion for ever, Pſal. 73. 25,
26.</hi> To cleer this, two things muſt
be added: 1. The grounds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Saints have claimed this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in God, as their portion. 2. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58315:15"/>
uſe they have made of God, under
this notion and relation. For the firſt,
Their title unto God, as their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is founded: 1. In Gods vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and free donation of himſelf
to them, in the Covenant of Grace,
whereby both they become his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Deut. 32. 9. The Lords porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is his people,</hi> and he becomes their
portion; <hi>The portion of Jacob is the
former of all things: The Lord of
Hosts is his Name, Jer.</hi> 10. 16.
An act ſo done, by one, that is, <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>juris,</hi>
is a ſtrong binding act, as
<hi>Peter</hi> argued in the caſe of <hi>Ananias,
Acts</hi> 5. 4. It was free and deliberate,
and therefore exceedingly diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to break it. God ſtands much upon
his honour in this, <hi>Pſal. 89. 34. My
Covenant will I not break.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.
111. 5. He will ever be mindful of his
Covenant.</hi> 2. This donation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
ſundry wayes: 1. By Oath,
<hi>Pſal. 89. 35. Once have I ſworn by
my holineſſe.</hi> Again, in <hi>Pſal. 105. 9.
He remembred his Oath unto Izhack,</hi>
The Covenant of Grace, whereby
God gives himſelf to be his peoples
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58315:16"/>

A conſideration inſerted, adds
weight to a Deed and Covenant. The
conſideration is, that we ſhould be
joyned unto the Lord Jeſus, and then,
<hi>all the promiſes of God, in him, are
Yea and Amen to us,</hi> in him, 2 <hi>Cor.
1.</hi> 20. And Chriſts God and Father
is our God and portion, <hi>Joh. 20. 17.

I may ſo ſpeak, when, after they are
fallen into Gods diſpleaſure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to him, with repentance for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58315:16"/>
and from their ſins, and renewing
their faith in Chriſt, they have renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their taking hold of the Covenant
and have pleaded it with God, and
their plea hath been accepted. Thus
did <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after they had
ſinned, in the matter of the Golden
Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10, 13. and the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
for themſelves <hi>Iſa. 63. 10, 16,
17,</hi> 19. The ſecond thing to be ſhewn
is, what uſe the Saints have made of
their right and intereſt in God, as
their portion: They have made uſe
of him thus, both for themſelves, and
others. 1. For themſelves: 1. To
glory in God; <hi>This God is our God.
Pſal. 48. ult. 2. To delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Lord,</hi> in confidence of
his goodneſſe toward them, in the
middeſt of Temptatious, <hi>Pſal. 37.
4.</hi> Whence followeth a rowling
themſelves upon him in all their wayes
and difficulties, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. and a patient
waiting upon God in delays, with
hope of a good iſſue, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. 2. For
others, whether they be friends or
enemies, or of a middle ſort. 1. Friends,
A poor believer can pleaſure his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58315:17"/>
richeſt friends out of this his portion,
his God. This is a Prophets and a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
mans reward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 41.
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> abundantly recompenced
all his friends and well-willers out of
his portion, <hi>Phil. 4. 19. My God
ſhall ſupply all your need, according
to his riches in glory by Ieſus Christ.</hi>
2. Enemies: In Jeſus Chriſt all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
have ſufficient help from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all ſorts of enemies, and can, in
an holy manner challenge them to do
their worſt, and triumph over them
before the battail, upon this aſſurance,
<hi>My God will help me; therefore I
ſhall not be confounded, Iſa. 50. 7, 8,
9.</hi> Other men are ſtrong in men, in
armes, in ſhipping, in fortifications,
&amp;c. a believer hath all in God, he is
<hi>strong in the Lord, and in the power
of his might, Eph.</hi> 6. 10. 3. A mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

learn to behold and admire the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and happineſſe of every true
believer in his portion. The All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
God is their portion. His great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

faithfulneſſe, forgiveneſſe, juſtice,
all are for them; and, that they may
poſſeſſe him, as their portion, he

To this end, wait upon God

It will not be in vain, <hi>Iſa. 5. 5. 1, 2,
3. Prov.</hi> 8. 34, 35. For thereby, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ſhall be cleered unto you that
the Lord is your portion, or the Lord
will become your portion. And he is
ſo unto them, in whom faith is
wrought in Chriſt by the Spirit, in the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel. They that
can ſay to Chriſt, with <hi>Thomas, My
Lord and my God, Ioh.</hi> 20. 28. may
alſo ſay to God, with <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſ.
142. 5. O Lord, thou art my refuge
and my portion in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
This is the priviledge of
thoſe, who anſwer Gods call, by
joyning to him in Covenant. So ſaith
the Lord, <hi>I entred into Covenant
with thee, and thou becameſt mine,
Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. And again, in <hi>Hoſ. 2.
23. I will ſay unto them which were
not my people, Thou art my people,
and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To perſwade you hereunto: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
1. Every man deſires to have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58315:18"/>
beſt, for his portion in other things,
in houſes, lands, food, apparel cattle.
But this portion is ſimply abſolutely
the beſt. This Chriſt teacheth, in
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 12. This he calls our own,
thoſe, <hi>another mans.</hi> VVhen a man
views houſes, or ſurveys land, or
tells money for another man, his heart
is not ſo affected with them, as when
he views, ſurveys, tells for himſelf.
Propriety draws and engages the heart
to that wherein a man hath a property,
though it be but mean and worthleſſe,
and carrieth the heart after it; much
more, when propriety and a moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
property meet together; as <hi>David</hi>
found this to be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. 2. The
miſery of thoſe that have not this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Little, or rather, no
cauſe have ſuch to bleſſe themſelves in
their worldly portions and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as worldly men are apt to do,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 18. For they <hi>have their
portion onely in this life,</hi> which is but
a vapour: But believers are happy in
their portion, in God, both in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this life: For they <hi>ſhall behold his
face in righteouſneſſe, and ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58315:19"/>
when they awake with his
likeneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 17, 14, 15. Attend
therefore, in time, to the counſel of
Chriſt, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>2. Specially, To believers; To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
themſelves as it becomes thoſe,
who have God for their portion. That
you may ſo do, 1. Profeſſedly avouch
God to be your portion, <hi>Deut. 26.
17.</hi> This is done two wayes, 1. When
you ſet your love upon him, with ſuch
an eſteem of him, as is meet for ſuch
a portion. <hi>Where a mans treaſure is,
there will his heart be alſo, Matth.
6.</hi> 21. Let God be your treaſure, when
you look upon all things in the world,
ſingle out thoſe that you account moſt
amiable, deſirable; then aſcend, in
your thoughts to heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
all the excellencies there, the
rivers of pleaſure, the bleſſed fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Saints in glory; each of them
as dear to another, as if all relations
of husbands, and wives, of parents,
and children, and friends, were in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them; yet let God and Chriſt
be above them all. So did <hi>Aſaph,
Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. So will every one that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58315:19"/>
knows Gods name aright. <hi>Pſal. 91.
14. Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon
me, therefore will I deliver him: I
will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath
known my name.</hi> 2. When you are
content to part with all, to enjoy him
alone. A maid will ſay of a man
whom ſhe loves, I will have him,
though I beg my bread with him.
A man will lay out his eſtate, in
ſuit, for his own. 3. When you live
in the world with affections free from
worldly ingagements, as Pilgrims,
whoſe hearts are at home, when their
feet are travailing abroad. 2. Poſſeſſe
and uſe, and injoy God, as your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus, 1. Live upon God, as
the Iſraelites in <hi>Canaan</hi> did upon their
lots and inheritances: Live upon Gods
favour, in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. And
upon his promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 16. Live
by the faith of the Son of God, <hi>Gal.
2.</hi> 20. fetching all your comfort
thence. 2. Walk with God, <hi>Gen.
5.</hi> 24. and work in God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 21.
marry in the Lord, live unto the
Lord, exalting his ends, and rules,
in all things. 3. Caſt all your care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58315:20"/>
him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. you may try men
in ſmaller things, before you truſt
them with greater; eſpecially, if they
be ſtrangers. But it is diſhonourable
to God, if you do not, at the firſt,
truſt him with all that you are, and
have. When mens hearts ſink in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
danger, it is from a defect, either
of faith, or in faith. See how Chriſt
reproved this in <hi>Peter, Mat. 14. 30,
31. Davids</hi> firſt recourſe was to
God, and what ever means he uſed,
he looked up to him, <hi>Pſal. 5. 3.
4.</hi> Live contentedly, when you injoy
God in his Ordinances, without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. and with out
diſcontentedneſſe becauſe of outward
afflictions, or wants. <hi>David</hi> as he was
the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
a ſweet frame of ſpirit, in
2 <hi>Sam. 23. 5. He hath made with me
an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in
all things and ſure: this is all my
ſalvation, and all my deſire, &amp;c.
5.</hi> Make up all your happineſſe in
God. A worldly man, when he
views his houſes, lands, cattle, barns
filled with corn, &amp;c. his heart is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58315:20"/>
cheared, like that rich fool in <hi>Luke
12.</hi> 19. But ſee the vanity of that
joy, in the anſwer of God to him,
ver. 20. But a true believer hath true
cauſe of rejoycing in his portion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch an eſtate in God, and Chriſt,
and the Covenant, that he ſhall want
nothing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 1. his downly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and up-riſings, himſelf and his
children are well provided; for what
though his eſtate lyeth not in lands,
or monies, or plenty of corn and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?
he hath that which is better,
for his portion. A believer is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
of heaven; there is his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
things on earth are added to
him, onely <hi>pro viatico,</hi> while he is
travailing thitherward.</p>
            <bibl>Lam. 3. 24.</bibl>
            <q>Saith my Soul.</q>
            <p>Having ſpoken of the Aſſertion, <hi>the
Lord is my portion;</hi> we are now, with
Chriſts aſſiſtance, to ſpeak to the proof
of it, <hi>ſaith my Soul.</hi> The Church
proveth that the Lord is their portion,
by their ſouls ſaying it. Where note,
1. The Principle of this ſpeech, <hi>their
ſoul,</hi> which ſheweth that there is a
mental as well as a vocal ſpeaking:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58315:21"/>
               <hi>The fool ſaith in his heart, there is no
God, Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. when his tongue
ſpeaketh and profeſſeth the contrary,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. 2. That, by an act of the
ſoul reflexed upon it ſelf, they knew
what their ſoul ſaid. So <hi>David,</hi> in
<hi>Pſal. 16. 2. O my ſoul, thou haſt
ſaid unto Jehovah, thou art my Lord.</hi>
3. That the uſe they make hereof is, to
prove two things: 1. That the Lord
is their portion. 2. That they know
that the Lord is their portion. 1. To
prove that the Lord is their portion,
they argue thus: What the Soul ſaith
is a mans portion, that is his portion.
But my ſoul ſaith, the Lord is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore the Lord is my portion.
2. To prove that they know that the
Lord is their portion, they argue thus.
What a man knoweth that his ſoul ſaith
is his portion, that he knoweth to be his
portion. But I know that my ſoul ſaith,
the Lord is my portion; therefore I
know that the Lord is my portion. In
like manner, <hi>David</hi> putting up this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttion,
<hi>Preſerve me, O God,</hi> preſſeth
it by this motive, <hi>for in thee do I truſt,</hi>
and he proveth that he truſteth in God,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58315:21"/>
by an Apoſtrophe, a turning of his
ſpeech, to his ſoul, <hi>O my ſoul, thou
haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my
God.</hi> And this he confirmeth from the
teſtimony of his own ſoul and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 1, 2. and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred;
<hi>The Lord is the portion of mine
inheritance, and of my Cup,</hi> ver. 5.
<hi>q. d.</hi> The Lord is my land and revenue,
and food, he ſupplies all, and is himſelf
above all, better then all, unto me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D.</hi> When a believer knoweth that
his ſoul ſaith, The Lord is his portion,
he hath from thence a clear proof that
the Lord is his portion. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of this point, two things muſt be
declared.</p>
            <p>1. That a true believer may know
that his ſoul ſaith, The Lord is his
portion. <hi>David</hi> knew it, when he
ſaid, <hi>O God! my ſoul truſteth in thee,
Pſal.</hi> 17. 1. He knew that he truſted
in God, as one truſteth in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and in <hi>Pſal. 84. 2. My heart
and my fleſh cryeth out for the living
God.</hi> As, when an houſe is on fire,
and all is in danger to be loſt, the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
crieth out, oh, let me have my
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58315:22"/>
casket of jewels, my box of eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they are my treaſure, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of my eſtate, I am not undone,
unleſſe I loſe them. And then, as his
deſire is ardent, ſo his expectation is
earneſt for them, looking when they
ſhall be delivered to him. Saith he,
have you them? have you found
them? As the Church ſaid to the
daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> concerning
her beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8. and 3. 3.
and, as any hope appeareth, he is the
more incouraged to wait, yet ſtill
watching and obſerving if he can get
the ſight of them. So <hi>David, My ſoul
waiteth for the Lord, more then they
that watch for the morning: I ſay,
more than they that watch for the
morning, Pſal.</hi> 130. 6. And, as
<hi>David</hi> knew thus that the Lord was
his portion; ſo may other believers,
as <hi>Paul</hi> argues, in a like caſe, from
<hi>Davids</hi> example, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. From
parity of reaſon, ſeeing we have the
ſame helps as he had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. From the proper excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or excellent property of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſoul, that it can reflect, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58315:22"/>
diſcern its own internal acts; much
more the renewed ſoul. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. From the office and power
of conſcience, to teſtifie what is
within a man. This the Apoſtle notes
in natural men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. and in
believers, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21.</p>
            <p>R. 3. <hi>From the ſpirit of God joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the renewed ſpirits of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
Rom. 8. 16. <hi>and</hi> 9. 1, 2. My
conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the
Holy Ghoſt. <hi>And the Holy Spirit
brings into the ſoul a ſelf-evidencing
light, whereby he doth manifeſt unto
the renewed ſoul, that it is himſelf,
and no deluſion, who teſtifieth to us
our intereſt in God.</hi> Hereby we know
that we dwell in him, and he in us,
becauſe he hath given us of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
1 Ioh. 4. 13. <hi>For</hi> the Spirit is
given for this end, that we might
know the things that are freely given
to us of God, 1 Cor. 2. 12.</p>
            <p>2. That a believer, from his ſouls
ſaying, the Lord is his portion, hath a
good proof that the Lord is his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So the Church, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 20.
from knowledge that their ſoul wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58315:23"/>
for the Lord, proves, that he is
their help and their ſhield, and from
thence they infer, in ver. 21. <hi>Our
heart ſhall rejoyce in him, becauſe
we have truſted in his holy name:</hi> So
<hi>David</hi> proved his intereſt in God, by
his <hi>ſouls thirſting for him. Pſal, 63.
1.</hi> and, by his <hi>ſouls following hard
after him,</hi> ver. 8. The ſame holds in
other believers alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. Becauſe the ſouls ſaying, the
Lord is my portion, is the anſwering
of the ſoul unto God, calling his
Elect effectually, by the miniſtry of
the Goſpel, out of the World
and ſin and ſelf, unto himſelf, in
Jeſus Chriſt. There is an outward
calling, by the miniſtry of man onely,
of which the Prophet ſpeaks, in <hi>Hoſ.
11. 7. Though they called them to the
moſt High, yet none would exalt
him.</hi> This is ineffectual, unto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
converſion, of it ſelf, without
the quickening efficacies of the ſpirit.
But when that is added, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the miniſtry of man (which
of it ſelf onely ſoundeth in the ear)
then God ſpeaketh to the heart, <hi>Hoſ.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58315:23"/>
2.</hi> 14. Thereby the father draweth
the Elect unto his Son, <hi>Ioh. 6. 44,
45.</hi> Then they hear the voice of the
Son of God, which they that hear,
ſhall live, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 25. The ſoul being
thus quickned, anſwers the call of
God with the obedience of faith, as
<hi>David</hi> found, in <hi>Pſal. 27. 8. Thou
ſaidſt, ſeek ye my face; my heart anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
thy face Iehovah, I do ſeek.</hi> This
anſwer is the voice of the whole
ſoul unto God. The underſtanding,
being illightned and fully convinced,
cloſeth with God, in Chriſt, as the
firſt Truth, and the will chooſeth him
as the chiefeſt good; the affections
reſt ſatisfied with him alone, and the
whole ſoul placeth all its happineſſe in
its injoyment of him, and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to him. Hope waits for him, deſire
longeth after him, and joy delighteth
in him above all things. The Lord
calleth the whole ſoul to come unto
him, that it may find true reſt, in
voluntarily ſubjecting it ſelf under his
yoke. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29. and the whole
ſoul, in all its faculties and affections,
anſwereth, as the Church did, in <hi>Ier.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58315:24"/>
3. 22. <hi>Lo we come unto thee; for thou
art the Lord our God:</hi> With renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
all other refuges, as they did, in
ver. 23. according to that promiſe, in
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 23. I <hi>will ſay, thou art my
people, and they ſhall ſay, thou art
my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. Becauſe the ſouls ſaying, the
Lord is my portion, argues unſeigned
love of God, in Chriſt. For all the
affections depend on love. What a
man loveth, as his portion, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to poſſeſſe and injoy; and any
impediment thereof ſtirs up his anger
proportionately, to his eſteem and
love of it. As we ſee with what ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſſe
and earneſtneſſe, men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to remove any thing that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their credits, or eſtates, &amp;c.
Now, if any love God above the
world, above themſelves, they will be
more jealous of Gods honour then
their own, and againſt that which
tends to Gods diſhonour, more then
againſt what croſſeth their own world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour. Hence will ariſe hatred
againſt ſin, becauſe God hates it, both
in our ſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 10. and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58315:24"/>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 6. Anger is againſt
particulars, but hatred is general.
Anger ſeeks revenge with moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in proportion to the wrong done
us, but hatred ſeeks the deſtruction of
its object. Anger is placable, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
is implacable. And according to
the degree of mens love to any thing,
will be their fear of being deprived of
it, and ſeparated from it, and of all
cauſes and ſignes of alienation from
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 3. Becauſe the ſouls ſaying,
The Lord is my portion, importeth the
higheſt actings of the ſoul upon God.
When <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid, <hi>the things that my
ſoul refuſed to touch, Job</hi> 6. 7. he
ſhewed the greateſt deteſtation of
them; and when he ſaid, <hi>my ſoul
chuſeth death rather than life, Iob
7.</hi> 15, he ſhewed a moſt vehement
deſire. And when the Lord ſaid, <hi>I will
plant them in this land aſſuredly, with
my whole heart, and with my whole
ſoul. Ier.</hi> 32. 41. he ſhewed the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his purpoſe. So, when the
ſoul ſaith, The Lord is my portion,
it argues the moſt full and firm clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58315:25"/>
of a believer unto God, with
purpoſe of heart, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to do, in <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. Elſe
men do not return to him, nor cleave
to him, as to the moſt High, <hi>Hoſ. 7.
16.</hi> unleſſe they turn to him with all
their heart, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12. and love him
with all their heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6.
For, it is by ſuch a love that faith
workes, which is a believing with all
the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. and produceth
obedience from the heart, <hi>Rom. 6.
17.</hi> which is done when all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and affections of the ſoul do
open themſelves, and ſtand open, to
give entertainment unto God, in
Chriſt, as the King of glory, <hi>Pſal.
24.</hi> 7. When the Keyes of the whole
houſe, and every room in it are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up for the uſe and ſervice of a
King, he is entertained like a King.
Inferiour gueſts are content, one with
one room, another with another, and
ſometimes two have but one room,
yea, one bed for them both. But the
King muſt have all. So it is in this
caſe, when the God of glory appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and called him,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58315:25"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed him, without reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 2, 3. So muſt we, yea,
ſo will all, whoſe ſoules ſay, the Lord
is their portion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. For inſtruction, in four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
1. Hence learn how a man
may know when afflictions are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
and bleſſed unto him, <hi>i. e.</hi>
when the eye of the ſoul is, by them,
turned, 1. Upward, to look unto God,
for an intereſt in him, as their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
2. Inward, to reflect upon the
inward actings of the ſoul, that they
may know their intereſt in God, as
their portion. Indeed afflictions of
themſelves work the contrary, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange
us from God, and from our
ſelves, and Satan labours to foment
and increaſe a ſeparation of the ſoul
from God, and a diviſion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
of the ſoul within it ſelf.
Therefore it is by an over-ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and ſanctifying efficacy of Gods
ſpirit, when they cauſe us to return
unto the Lord, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 1. and to our
ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17, 18. It is a ſure
rule of diſcerning ones ſelf to be in
the ſtate of grace, when he finds that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58315:26"/>
every condition brings him neerer to
God, and every ſanctifying gift of
grace is quickned to its proper functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to turn the faculty and affection
of the ſoul, in which it is planted,
unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29. God is
a pure act, alwayes acting, and every
one, the neerer he comes to God, the
more gracious frame of ſpirit he hath,
and the more ſpiritual affections, and
ſuitable actings of them, ſweetly iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
from thence.</p>
            <p>2. Learn hence a profitable uſe of
ſpiritual ſoliloquies, which are a
mans ſpeaking within himſelf, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
about ſpiritual things. <hi>David</hi>
preſcribes communing with a mans
own heart, to further his repentance,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 4. and himſelf made uſe of
it, to quicken his faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5.
So the Church in my Text, in times
of affliction, being driven out of their
creature-comforts, and expectations,
they communed, and parlied with
their own ſouls, to cleer unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
their intereſt in God, as their
portion, and to excite their faith and
hope in him unto excerciſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58315:26"/>
3. Learn hence, not to reſt in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profeſſion, in words, that the
Lord is your portion. Many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
ſay ſo, whoſe hearts cleave to
ſome thing elſe, as their portion; ſome
to their ſinful wills, and wayes. They
draw neer unto God with their lips,
but their hearts are removed far from
him. Such were thoſe in <hi>Hoſ. 8. 23. Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
will cry unto me, my God, we
know thee,</hi> when, <hi>Iſrael hath caſt off
the thing that is good;</hi> even God
himſelf, in whom and from whom
is all good, and the good word of
God, and the rules thereof; though
they thus departed from him, yet,
in their diſtreſſe, they were ready to
claim an intereſt in him. Others, to
their worldly objects. They <hi>lay up
treaſures for themſelves on the earth,</hi>
and <hi>there their hearts are, Mat. 6.
19, 21. Their belly is their God,</hi> and
portion, <hi>that mind earthly things,
Phil.</hi> 3. 19. Theſe ſteal away their
hearts from God, even while they
are hearing the Word, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31.
All, to one idol, or other, like thoſe
of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:58315:27"/>
57. 6. <hi>Among the ſmooth ſtones of
ſtreams is thy portion; they, they are
thy lot.</hi> A woful portion have all ſuch,
for at preſent, <hi>their portion is curſed
in the earth, Job.</hi> 24. 18. and, for
the future, <hi>God will rain upon them,
ſnares, fire, and brimſtone, and an
horrible tempeſt; this ſhall be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Cup, Pſal.</hi> 11. 6. Again,
2. Reſt not in ſome occaſional ſpeeches
of ſome one affection alone. <hi>Balaam</hi>
had a tranſient deſire that his latter
end might be like theirs, who had
the Lord for their portion, <hi>Numb.
23.</hi> 10. This is but the ſaying of one
aſſertion, for a ſhort time. Nothing
is to be accounted as ſaid by the ſoul,
unleſſe all the faculties and affections
of the ſoul conſent in it, acting ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1.</p>
            <p>4. Learn hence, to make out for
an intereſt in God, as your portion.
This is to be had onely by and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 20. 17. For it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Father, that in Chriſt,</hi> God
incarnate, <hi>all fulneſſe ſhould dwell,
Col.</hi> 1. 19. and, that <hi>out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
we all ſhould receive, and grace
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58315:27"/>
for grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16. So that Chriſt
is the immediate fountain of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
bleſſings unto the Elect, <hi>Eph. 1.
3.</hi> Gods next end, in this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, <hi>that all men ſhould honour
the Son, as they honour the Father,
Joh.</hi> 5. 23. which they do, when they
come to the Father by the Son, <hi>Joh.
14.</hi> 6. and therefore come to the Son
firſt, ſeeking to have an intereſt in
him, and then in the Father, by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and communion with him, through
faith in the Son of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3.
Let thoſe who are out of Chriſt, ſee
their miſery, in that ſtate, and the
remedy thereof in Chriſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
value him above all things,
<hi>Rev. 3. 17, 18. Mat.</hi> 13. 45. Let
thoſe that have him, ſeek more full
communion with him, prizing that
above all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and
anſwerably prize the word, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
who ſaid unto God, <hi>the law of
thy mouth is better unto me then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Gold and Silver, Pſal. 119.
72.</hi> See that the word be mixed with
faith in your hearts, to receive Chriſt
thereby, as God offereth him unto
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58315:28"/>
you in his Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. Shew
it to be ſo, really, and not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profeſſion onely, by ſetting your
affections on things above, where
Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and by your driving an
heavenly trade, in this world, <hi>Phil.
3.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. For comfort to all who can
thusſay, The Lord is their portion <hi>i. e.</hi>
to all true believers, who know that
their ſoul ſaith the Lord is their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
be exhorted to rejoyce in your
portion, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
and again, I ſay, rejoyce,
Phil.</hi> 4. 4. Have you plenty of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things? Rejoyce not in them,
but in the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 23, 24. In
him alone you have fully enough.
There is a vaſt difference between <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
portion and <hi>Eſau's,</hi> though the
Tranſlation holdeth forth each of
them, as ſaying, I have enough, yet
the Original varieth their expreſſions,
<hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I have much,
Gen.</hi> 33. 9. but <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
I <hi>have all,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>Eſau</hi> had much
in worldly things, but not enough:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58315:28"/>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> had enough in God, who was
his All-ſufficient portion. Are you in
any want? <hi>Habent omnia qui habent
habentem omnia.</hi> They cannot want
any thing; who have him to be their
portion, who hath all things. In
wants of outward things, ſay with
<hi>David, Pſal. 23. 1. The Lord is my
ſhepherd, I ſhall want nothing;</hi> and
with the Church, <hi>Hab. 3. 17, 18.
Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
nor fruits be in the vine, and
the fields yield no meat, the flocks
ſhall be cut off from the fold, and no
herds in the ſtalls, yet</hi> I <hi>will rejoyce
in the Lord,</hi> I <hi>will joy in the God of
my ſalvation.</hi> In ſpiritual wants, the
God of all grace, wiſdom, power,
and goodneſſe, is your God and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
you have all in him, and ſhall
have all that is good for you from him,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. Are you in fear of
dangers? Say, as <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 27.
1. The Lord is my light and my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
whom ſhall</hi> I <hi>fear, &amp;c. Pſal.
27.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Again, God is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
and ſtrength, a very preſent help
in trouble; therefore will not we fear,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58315:29"/>
though the earth be moved, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.
46.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. Laſtly, are you in as
great diſtreſſe as <hi>David</hi> was, in
1 <hi>Sam. 30. 3, 4, 5, 6?</hi> Yet even then
take the courſe that he took. What
was that? <hi>David</hi> comforted himſelf
in the Lord his God. So do you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in this your portion. For it is,
1. All-ſufficient. 2. Everlaſting.</p>
            <bibl>Lam. 3. 24.</bibl>
            <q>Therefore will I
hope in him,</q>
            <p>We have already ſpoken of two
parts of the Text; the Aſſertion, <hi>the
Lord is my portion,</hi> and the proof of
it; <hi>ſaith my ſoul.</hi> VVe now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the third, the inference, which
the Church draws from the premiſes;
<hi>therefore will</hi> I <hi>hope in him.</hi> In which
words three particulars are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
1. The reaſon, whereupon their
hope was grounded <hi>[therefore.]</hi> 2. The
reſolution of their will to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that reaſon [I <hi>will.]</hi> 3. The
act it ſelf reſolved upon, together
with the proper object of it <hi>[hope in
him.]</hi> For the firſt, the reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58315:29"/>
their hope was grounded. This
illative particle, <hi>therefore,</hi> notes the
reſult of a diſcourſe in the minds of
believers, whereby they compare one
thing with another, and gather one
thing from another; and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
to act ſuitably to the trueſt and
beſt reaſon. Faith is an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace, and knowes what uſe to
make of the ſouls intereſt in God.
When a man hath God for his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and knows it, thence faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
it is my duty, and it is for my
good to hope in him: Therefore I
will hope in him. Reaſon of it ſelf,
in this corrupt ſtate of fallen man,
cannot teach men to hope in God.
But when God hath in the word of
promiſe given himſelf to us to be our
portion, and faith hath cloſed with
him, as our portion; and the word
telleth us it is our duty, and for our
good to hope in him, then faith ſeeth
good reaſon that we ſhould hope in
him. Faith uſeth reaſon, though not
as the ground, yet as a ſanctified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
to find out Gods grounds,
that it may rely upon him, He believes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58315:30"/>
beſt, who beſt knows, why he believes,
and he beſt hopes in God, who can
give the beſt reaſons for his hoping in
him. The affections, though they have
not reaſon grafted in them, yet they are
thus farre reaſonable, that, in all that
are godly-wiſe, they are raiſed up, and
laid down, guided, and actuated, by
ſanctified reaſon, which is the higheſt
and beſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> They that hope in God a right,
have their hope in him raiſed, and
ſtrengthened by good and ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Reaſons fetched from God, and
from the ſouls knowing its intereſt in
him, as his portion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are good and ſtrong
reaſons, for our hoping in him; and
ſuch are the reaſons which the Church,
in my Text, gives of their hoping in
God. They conſidered Gods All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
in himſelf, and to every one
that hath him for his portion, and
what intereſt themſelves had in him,
through faith in Chriſt, and thereupon
conclude; therefore will I hope in
him. So may all believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. From the inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
of hope with faith: Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58315:30"/>
in Chriſt, and in God through
Chriſt, upon Gods authority in his
word, and what faith believes, hope
expects. The reaſons for a believers
hoping in God, are as good and
ſtrong, as for his believing in him.
For, as, naturally, beams come from
the Sun, and branches from the root;
ſo, by ſpiritual diſcourſe, one truth iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth
from another; and, as the Sun
and its beams, the roots and branches,
are all of one nature; ſo the grounds
of comfortable truths, and reaſons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from thoſe grounds, are both of
the ſame divine authority in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Though in us, diſcourſe is apt
to be ſo troubled, in times of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we cannot ſee how one
truth ariſeth upon another; yet ſo far
as faith ſees God to be our portion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſoul ſees good and ſtrong reaſon
for our hoping in him for all good, that
may ſuit all our needs, in the beſt
ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. From the convincing light,
which the ſpirit of God bringeth into
the ſoul, when he worketh faith and
hope in it. It is the office and work
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58315:31"/>
of the ſpirit, to convince, and, by
convincing, to comfort, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7, 8.
Conviction is a clear and infallible
demonſtration, and comfort is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
with application unto
us, of better and ſtronger reaſons to
raiſe us up, then thoſe are which tend
to caſt down our ſouls. When the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
convinceth, he bringeth ſuch a full
and powerful light into the ſoul, as
ſilenceth all diſputes and cavils, and
cauſeth the ſoul to yeeld, as overcome
by the evidence and authority of the
light and truth brought into it. Light
hath a convincing property and force
in it. When we ſee the light of the
Sun, we know it is day, and will not
believe thoſe that ſhall deny it, though
they were ten thouſands, becauſe the
convinction hereof is undeniable, it
is an unreaſonable thing to deny it.
So the ſpirit of God brings an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
light into the ſoul, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the vanity of thoſe windings,
and turnings, whereof mens deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hearts are ſo full, that there can be
no thorough conviction, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to ſalvation, without the efficacy of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58315:31"/>
the Holy Spirit. A common convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there may be, by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or of a natural conſcience, or
of ſome common tranſient work of
the Holy Spirit, but that is but weak:
For either it diſcovers but little, as a
little ſpark ſhews little light, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to lighten the room, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
the darkneſſe, and turning
it into light; or the light, which it
ſhews, it ſhews but weakly, like a
flaſh of lightning, or a blaze in ſtraw,
that is ſoon out again. But ſaving
convinction is a greater and ſtronger
light, like the light of the Sun, which
is a full and powerful light. This is
onely from the ſanctifying ſpirit of
God. This light ſhewes the evil of
ſin, and the good of the contrary, in
their ſpiritual nature, and compaſſe,
and drawes the will anſwerably, from
the one to the other, by converting
grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. This light is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
in the renewed ſoul. Thus the
Church, in my Text, was convinced
and comforted, in their great diſtreſſe,
by the ſpirit and word of God, ſo as
they could hold forth good and ſtrong
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58315:32"/>
reaſons, whereupon their hope was
ſtrengthened, and their hearts were
comforted in ſad houres.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. For Inſtruction, two-fold:
1. Learn hence to examine and trie the
reaſons, whereby you are moved to
act; whether they they be good, or
not good, reaſon is a beam of Gods
light. What comes from God, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ſoul to God; Therefore that
which drawes the ſoul from God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a good reaſon, it is not right
reaſon, but falſely called reaſon, it is
not from faith, but from unbelief,
not good but evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. Hence,
no good reaſon can be given for any

all ſuch arguings are fetcht, the World,

pretend their good intention for Gods
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58315:32"/>
honour, when they ſeek no them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

are the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the reaſonings of
natural men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. which ſhould
warn all men to deny their carnal
wiſdom, which is enmity againſt
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. 2. Learn hence to

in, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 15. Be ready alwayes to
give an anſwer to every man that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you a reaſon of the hope that is in
you.</hi> You ſay, you hope in God, If
you have no reaſon for it; its a fooliſh
unreaſonable hope. If you have but
ſlight reaſons; its a vain hope. And
ſuch is hope of the moſt: one grounds
his hope of ſalvation upon his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſaying, I am Gods creature, and
he hath not made me to damne me:
Therefore, I hope he will ſave me.
See the deluſion of this plea, 1. Are
not the Devils Gods creatures? yet
they are damned. 2. Though Gods
end in making you, was not to damne
you, yet your impenitency in ſin, and
unbelief will damne you. 3. See the
Lords own refutation of this plea, in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 11. Another grounds his hope
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58315:33"/>
of bleſſedneſſe upon Gods bleſſing
him, as he calls it, with worldly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
and proſperity. But Chriſt
ſhews the vanity of this hope in that
rich man in Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25. and
by telling us that <hi>it is that they ſhall be
deſtroyed for ever, Pſal.</hi> 92. 7. Gods
end in proſpering ſuch in the world,
is like <hi>Heſters</hi> end in feaſting <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
Another grounds his hope that
he ſhall have heaven hereafter, becauſe
he hath had his Hell, through afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in this life. But ſuch conſider not
what the Word ſaith concerning <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah, Jude 7. Suffering
the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> What
miſery wicked impenitent ſinners ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
here, is but a beginning and
pledge to them of Hell hereafter. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grounds his hope upon his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
priviledges and performances.
But this is plentifully refuted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by <hi>Johns</hi> ſpeech to the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
Mat.</hi> 3. 9. and <hi>Pauls</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Rom.</hi> 2. 28. and concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7. Others ground their
hope upon Gods mercy, though they
continue in their ſins. This indeed is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58315:34"/>
a good reaſon for hope, in thoſe that
confeſſe and forſake their ſin, <hi>Prov.
28.</hi> 13. But for thoſe that abuſe this
mercy to the hardning of themſelves
in ſin by it, ſee how the Lord thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
againſt ſuch, in <hi>Deut. 29. 19,

their own ſelf-flattering and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
thoughts of themſelves. Such
may ſee their own folly and madneſſe,
by what the Scripture ſaith, in <hi>Prov.
28.</hi> 26. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 3. Let all ſuch,

the firſt work of the Spirit, in the ſoul,

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. For Exhortation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
being under temptations and
afflictions, whether outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to improve the reaſons, which
faith ſupplieth, for the quickening
and ſtrengthening of their hope in
God. For, in ſuch times, faith is put
to it to uſe reaſons. Indeed the ſoul
needeth not that help ſo much, when
it is in a clear and quiet ſtate, for upon
its cloſe and ſweet communion with
God, in Chriſt, and from ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
between the renewed ſoul and
God, it preſently, and without prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
diſcourſe, runneth to God, as
by a ſupernatural inſtinct; as, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inſtinct, the child runneth to his
natural parents in danger, and diſtreſſe,
with confidence. But, in dark times
of great afflictions, and temptations,
faith is put to uſe Arguments, and
reaſons to quicken and ſtrengthen
hope. Accordingly, ſtudy the grounds
of hope, and improve them for your
help. 1. Such as may be ſupplied from
the inward ſtore laid up in the ſoul,
as the Church did in my Text. 2. Such
as are, or may be, ſuggeſted by others:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58315:35"/>
Harken, and yield to them, and cloſe
with them. For, thus you will ſhew
that you have a frame of ſpirit ſuitable
to any holy and comfortable truth,
that ſhall be preſented and applied to
it. There is a principle in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
ſpirit, that cloſeth with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
commeth from Gods ſpirit, that
readily claimes acquaintance and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
with it, as comming from the
ſame bleſſed ſpring, the holy Spirit.
When <hi>Aſaph</hi> found the contrary in
himſelf, that his <hi>ſoul refuſed comfort,
and he remembred God and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
Pſal.</hi> 77. 23. he ſaw, and <hi>ſaid,
this is mine infirmity,</hi> ver. 10. He
ſaw that it aroſe from a ſickneſſe, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
diſeaſe, and diſtemper in his
ſoul. While paſſion and temptation
diſturbe the ſoul, they hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of ſpiritual reaſon: As we ſee
in <hi>David,</hi> who <hi>ſaid, in his haſte, all
men are liars, Pſal.</hi> 116. 10, 11.
This he ſaw afterward, when his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
reaſon had recovered it ſelf,
which before by his diſtemper was
hindred in its working; then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
God for his benefits toward
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58315:35"/>
him, notwithſtanding his provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him to have taken a contrary
courſe with him, ver 12. Labour
therefore, 1. That your mind, which
is the ſeat of principles, be well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with divine and ſpiritual truths.
For falſe principles can never produce
true comforts. As onely truth ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. So truth onely tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforteth. There is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of both. For it is the peculiar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Holy Spirit, both to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
and to comfort: And the Holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is the Spirit of Truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13.
Therefore he will not work by a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood,
but onely by Truth, either
ſanctification, or conſolation. 2. See
that your underſtanding <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
dianoetical, diſcourſing faculty, which
is the ſeat of concluſions, be uſed to
deduce from ſpiritual principles, ſuch
ſpiritual concluſions as they are apt to
beget. For, by falſe reaſonings, in
times of affliction and temptation.
1. Believers hinder their faith and
hope, when they reaſon too much
from ſenſe and preſent feeling, <hi>Iſa.
40.</hi> 27. and 49. 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58315:36"/>
2. Others have falſe comforts from
the light of a fire kindled by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 11. But, if, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ſuch reaſonings, you flie to Chriſt
and his righteouſneſſe alone, for your
acceptance with God, through faith in
his blood, with true repentance; then
you may reaſon with God, <hi>Iſa. 1.
18.</hi> though not in your own ſtrength
or worth, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 14, 15. yet you may
reaſon with him in faithful fervent
prayer, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 10, 11. 12. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he prevailed and got both a new
bleſſing and a new name, ver. 28.
Fervent prayers are ſtrong reaſonings
with God, in Chriſts ſtrength, and
for his ſake. This will be well pleaſing
to God. For, as, when God cals for
our obedience, he adds perſwaſives to
his precepts, and reaſoneth with us
as well as commandeth us; ſo he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
us, in prayer, to add perſwaſions
to our petitions, and to reaſon with
him as well as intreat him. Onely, it
muſt be our care that we reaſon from
right Topicks, and heads of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Such as theſe, 1. From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe
and freeneſſe of Gods merccy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58315:36"/>
and grace. 2. From the immutable
firmneſſe of his Covenant and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in Chriſt. 3. From our indigence
and dependance upon him. 4. From
the concernments of his glory, and our
neceſſary good. In ſuch reaſonings of
faith and hope, the ſpirit, ſtrength,
and life of prayer conſiſteth. Such
pleadings, in the name of Chriſt,
God approveth and requireth, <hi>Iſa.
43.</hi> 26. 3. See that the heart, which
is the ſeat of practical knowledge be
fitted to order the converſation and
practice, by ſound principles, in the
mind, and right concluſions, in the
underſtanding; that mental diſcourſe
may not vaniſh in meer empty ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
As, in my Text, <hi>The Lord is
my portion,</hi> is the principle laid up
in their mind, <hi>ſaith my ſoul,</hi> is the
proof it; the concluſion to be from
thence inferred, is, Therefore it is
my duty to hope in him. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
becomes practical, when the
heart ſo receiveth it, that the will
comes to a reſolution; <hi>therefore I will
hope in him.</hi> Which is the next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58315:37"/>
            <bibl>Lam. 3. 24.</bibl>
            <q>Therefore I will
hope in him.</q>
            <p>The reaſon alledged by the Church
is, not ſo much an Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the judgment (though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that alſo, as we have before
proved) as a motive to induce and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the will to hope in God. For
truſting and hoping in God, being a
relying and waiting upon God for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
good, do eſpecially carry the will
to him. As the underſtanding is led
with truth, ſo the will is led with the
goodneſſe of things. As the judgment
muſt be convinced of Gods ability, ſo
the heart muſt be ſweetned with his
love and readineſſe to do us good, for
the future, that we may hope in him.
For meer knowledge and diſcourſe
cannot draw the heart to truſt and
hope in God, except it hath a relliſh
of his goodneſſe. Therefore <hi>David</hi>
ſaith, <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is
good, Pſal.</hi> 34. 8. Thoſe reaſons are
moſt prevailing to incline the will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, which are drawn from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58315:37"/>
the goodneſſe of God, whereby the
heart is opened and enlarged to expect
all good, and nothing but good from
him, who is goodneſſe it ſelf, and our
God and portion, in Jeſus Chriſt.
This relliſh is wrought in the renewed
ſoul, by the ſpirit of faith, together
with a light to diſcern our intereſt in
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The reaſons whereby belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are quickned and ſtrengthened to
hope in God, do ſtrongly incline their
will to reſolve to hope in him. This
is obvious frequently in Scripture,
that when the will is inclined to
any ſpiritual good, it is upon ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
reaſons, the Spirit of God joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his efficacy therewith, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a powerful relliſh of that good in
the ſoul. This you may ſee in <hi>Pſal.
40. 8. Cant. 1. 3, 4. Ier.</hi> 3. 22. and
in ſundry Texts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. From the different manner
of the ſouls guiding the will, and the
bodily members. The ſoul ſwayeth
the will and affections, as counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
doe a well ordered ſtate, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
reaſons to them. But the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58315:38"/>
ſoul governeth the bodily members, as
a Maſter doth his ſlaves, by meer
command. The will moves the hands
and feet, &amp;c. by command, without
giving them Reaſons. But the will
and affections move not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or at leaſt a ſhew of reaſon.
God made man an underſtanding crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
indued with rational faculties,
the underſtanding to be the leading
faculty, and the will to be the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
of the ſoul, according to reaſon.
Therefore it moves toward ſuch a good
as is preſented to it by the illightned
mind, or underſtanding, as the moſt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and unqueſtionable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it. For the freedom and
willing conſent of the heart is not
without rules to order it; but it is
therefore ſaid be free, becauſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
out of a true judgment, it moves
one way, or, out of a falſe, another
way; yet, in both, it moves, in a
manner ſuitable to its own condition.
For this reaſon it is that God condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
ſo far to us, in his word, as to
give us ſo many reaſons to hope in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; that our wils might be drawn
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58315:38"/>
thereunto, by ſuitable reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R,</hi> 2. From the manner of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
putting forth his efficacy to incline
the wils of believers to hope in God.
The heart of man, naturally, is not
apt, but averſe, hereunto, even when
the underſtanding ſees good reaſons
for it. Therefore the will muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
be renewed and changed. This
change conſiſts in altering the
bent, and inclination of the will,
which the ſpirit of God doth, by
bringing into the ſoul a new light, and
powerful influence. 1. A new light,
whereby we are inabled to ſee other
things, or the ſame truths in a more
ſpiritual and effectual manner, thoſe
impedimens being removed, which
might hinder the evidence of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
truths, and the judgment being
fully convinced, that we might <hi>know
things</hi> not onely notionally, but pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically,
<hi>as we ought to know them,
1 Cor.</hi> 8. 2. This is that illumination
and revelation, whereof the ſcripture
ſpeaks, in <hi>Eph. 1. 18, 19. 1 Cor. 2.
12. 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 20. 2. A powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence:
Jeſus Chriſt, both opened
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58315:39"/>
the underſtanding of his Diſciples,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45. And cauſed their hearts
to burn within them, when he ſpake
unto them, ver. 32. By this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
influence the ſpirit makes every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and affection of the renewed
ſoul, to work unto ſupernatural ends,
and objects, according to its proper
manner. As the ſoul, in the bodily
eye, cauſeth it to ſee, and, in the ear,
cauſeth it to hear, and, in the tongue,
cauſeth it to ſpeak, &amp;c. So the ſpirit,
in the mind, cauſeth it to underſtand
aright, and, in every affection, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it freely to chooſe and cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, and to God, in him, and,
in every affection, cauſeth it to move
towards Chriſt and God, in ſuch a
manner and way of working, as is
ſuitable to its nature. This the Holy
Spirit doth, by creating and implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in-dwelling lively ſpiritual gifts of
grace in the ſoul, which he thereby
ſanctifieth and lifteth up unto God
in Chriſt; the faculties and affections,
which were by nature ſet upon the
world and ſin, and ſelf, being now,
by grace ſet upon things above, and ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58315:39"/>
are ſaid to be quickned and made alive
unto God. Hence every ſpiritual gift
of grace, whereby any faculty and
affection of the ſoul is ſanctified, is
called the ſpirit of that faculty and
affection. The ſanctified diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the mind is called, <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a ſound mind, 2 Tim. 1.
7:</hi> The gift of faith is called, <hi>the
ſpirit of faith, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 13. So
the gift of love, and of fear of
the Lord, is called, <hi>the ſpirit of love,
2 Tim.</hi> 1. 7. and <hi>the ſpirit of the fear
of the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 11. 2. Becauſe the
Holy Spirit, dwelling in the ſoul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
thoſe gifts into it, and ſo renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the faculties and affections of it,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. And, 2. Quickeneth
and exciteth theſe ſpiritual gifts, and
by them the faculties and affections
unto ſpiritual acts. Without this
quickening influence, thoſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
gifts would be, in the ſoul, un-act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as the bodily ſenſes are, in ſleep,
or as a ſhip in a calme, at Sea, <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
agimus.</hi> We act, but inſtrumentally,
ſubordinately under the ſpirit, who is
the principal, efficient and agent, in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58315:40"/>
all ſpiritual good. We act, but not in
our ſtrength, nor in the ſtrength of
grace received, but from the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſtrengthening influence of the
Spirit. As trees, though they have in
them a ſeminal vertue, yet, except
they be helped by influence from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
cannot bring forth their fruits;
ſo it is with theſe ſpiritual <hi>trees of
righteouſneſſe,</hi> as believers are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
in <hi>Iſa. 61. 3. It is God that

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> For Inſtruction, threefold:
1. Hence we may learn the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why the ſudden reſolutions of
many to reforme this and that, and to
do this and that particular, are ſo
weak and mutable, <hi>as the morning
cloud, and as the early dew, Hoſ. 6.
4.</hi> which ſoon vaniſh. Some, at an
heart-ſearching and ſoul-piercing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
are affected, as that young man,
till they are put upon ſuch conditions,
as their praedominant luſt will not
accept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 16, 22. Others,
in ſome ſtrong convictions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings
of conſcience, are affected,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58315:40"/>
as <hi>Saul</hi> was for his unrighteous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>David,</hi> and do purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, as he did, yet afterward with
him return to their former ſin again,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16, 17. with 26. 2. Some,
in great ſickneſſes, others, in great
dangers by Land, or Sea, reſolve that
they will become new men, if God
will be pleaſed to ſpare them, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, this time; of whom the
Lord may complain, as he did of the
children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Iudg. 10. 11,
12,</hi> 13. The reaſon is, becauſe they are
unregenerate, they are in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſtate. Such may have a notional
light, in their minds, and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of their natural conſciences, and
ſtirrings in their affections, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
purpoſes toward God, and Chriſt,
and ſpiritual things, from a tranſient
work of the ſpirit, exciting their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
principle of ſelf-love thereunto,
for a time; during which, they are in
a better mood, but not in a better
ſtate: as in ſickneſſes, the fits may be
altered, yet the ſickneſſe remain in
its ſtrength. New reſolutions, in an
un-renewed heart, are like ſeed in an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58315:41"/>
unſuitable ſoil, which proſpers not,
but withers, and dies, and comes to
nothing, at laſt. How many ſuch are
now in Hell; where their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of ſuch fruitleſſe, ineffectual
purpoſes gnaweth their conſciences, as
a never-dying worm, and torments
them for ever.</p>
            <p>2. Hence we may learn, whence
it is that true believers have ſuch firm
reſolutions of cleaving to God, in
Chriſt, and of hoping in him, when
he hideth his face from them, in great
afflictions, <hi>Iſa. 8. 17. Ion.</hi> 2. 4. The
reaſon of it is, becauſe their hearts
are purified by faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. which
is ſeated principally, in the will,
whereby it receiveth Chriſt, <hi>Ioh. 1.
12. Rom. 5. 17. 1 Tim.</hi> 15. and is
the effect of the operation of God,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. by his exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20.
whoſe peculiar glory it is, to perſwade
the heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 27. and to draw
the will, to come unto Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.
6.</hi> 44. which he doth, by changing the
diſpoſition, inclination, and bent of
it. If you offer green boughs unto
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58315:41"/>
Swine; they regard them not, but
trample them under their feet; but
if their nature were changed into
the nature of ſheep, then they
would be drawn to them. This is
done by the ſpirit of God. 2 <hi>Cor.
3.</hi> 17. Before regeneration, the
will is in bondage unto ſin, but,
being united unto Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
<hi>the Son makes us free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Ioh.</hi> 8. 36. Then the will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moveth towards God, in Chriſt,
by faith and hope; as a man, though
he cannot give life to himſelf being
dead, yet, when he is made alive, he
can move himſelf, from a principle of
life in him. So much faith as a man
hath, ſo much free-will he hath to
hope in God, in the worſt times. So
far as his ſpiritual grace and ſtrength
goes, ſo far he is able, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Gods ſpirit, which he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
joyns with the ability he hath
given to his people, that it may be
quickened and actuated thereby. A
man cannot act his natural abilities,
he cannot move his hand or foot, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he be aſſiſted with Gods general
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58315:42"/>
concourſe: So a man can do nothing
in ſpiritual actions, without ſpecial
concourſe of grace in Chriſt. <hi>Ioh. 15.
5.</hi> But, being aſſiſted, with a ſupply of
the Spirit, proportioned to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of ſervices to be performed,
and of temptations to be reſiſted, and
of corruptions to be mortified, he
may ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil. 4. 13.
I can do all things, through Chriſt,
which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Hence we may learn, in what
manner believers in Chriſt reſolve to
hope in God. This reſolution in them
may be known and diſtinguiſhed from
the reſolutions of others, by four
characters or properties.</p>
            <p>1. It is a ſanctified reſolution. It
is the effect of Gods Holy Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in them, and removing far from
them vanity and lying, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 8.
that is, vain and falſe apprehenſions of
things, and turning their whole ſoul
unto God, in Chriſt, to ſeek all their
good in him. This is the effect of
converting grace, as the Prophet
ſhews, in <hi>Iſa. 17. 7, 8. At that
day ſhall a man look to his Maker, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58315:42"/>
2. It is an obedient reſolution, in
anſwer to Gods calling them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 8. it is the
yielding up of their wills to be ruled
by Gods will <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. When
mens wils are not ſubdued and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
unto Gods will, they are, in times
of affliction, like ſullen birds in a Cage,
which beat themſelves to death; like
peeviſh froward children, which will
be pleaſed with nothing, if their wills be
croſſed in any thing. But when the will
is ſubdued unto Gods will, by the ſpirit,
through the miniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y of the Goſpel,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. then we can ſay, with
<hi>Aſaph, It's good for me to draw near
to God, Pſal. 73. ult.</hi> And, with <hi>David,
2 Sam. 15. 26. Let the Lord do with
me what ſeemeth good in his own eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is a rational reſolution, led
by the beſt reaſons. For, faith believes
in Chriſt, and in God, through Chriſt
upon Gods Authority and faithfulneſſe
and truth, in his Word and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Hence it miniſtreth reaſons to
quicken and ſtrengthen hope, from
Gods All-ſufficiency, and love, in
Chriſt, and faithfulneſſe in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58315:43"/>
to expect and wait upon God
for all good from him, ſuitable to our
needs, in the beſt ſeaſon; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,
as <hi>Job</hi> did, who ſaid, <hi>though
he kill me, yet will I truſt in him,
Iob</hi> 13. 15. and (if they ſee cauſe to
complain) to complain, not of God,
but to God, nor of their croſſes, but
of the croſſeneſſe of their wils to Gods
holy will; as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, in <hi>Ier.
31.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>It is a dependent reſolution, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon God, in Chriſt, for ability
to hope in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12. and
therefore praying to him, as <hi>David</hi>
did, in <hi>Pſal. 138. ult.</hi> and to keep
it ever in the purpoſe of their hearts,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 18. with true ſelf deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of any ſufficiency of themſelves, ſo
much, as to think any thing, 2 <hi>Cor.
3.</hi> 5. Thus they become <hi>ſtrong in the
Lord, and in the power of his might,
Eph.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
            <bibl>Lam. 3. 24.</bibl>
            <q>Hope in him.</q>
            <p>The laſt thing to be ſpoken to, is
the duty eſolved upon, illuſtrated by
its objectr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is, to exerciſe <hi>divine
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58315:43"/>
hope;</hi> for ſo I call that hope, which
hath God for its object and efficient,
who is therefore called <hi>the God of
hope, Rom.</hi> 15. 13. and for its ground,
the Word of God, as this hope hath,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 49. The word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> tranſlated <hi>hope,</hi> ſignifieth,
<hi>to expect;</hi> which is the formal act of
hope. Hence we may gather a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this divine hope. It is a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſpiritual in-dwelling gift of grace,
whereby believers are inclined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
in and from God, what ever
good they want, and he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
1. For the general nature of it,
which it hath in common with other
fruits of the ſpirit; it is, 1. A lively gift
of grace, an holy quality, or habit,
or diſpoſition, freely given of God;
hereby it is diſtinguiſhed from that
hope, which is meerly a natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
For, the natural affection of
hope is, by corrupt nature, ſet upon a
mans ſelf, and earthly things, and
cannot ſavour the things of God; and
therefore is ſaid to be dead. It's an
hope that hath <hi>given up the Ghoſt,
Job</hi> 11. 20. Natural men are big
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58315:44"/>
with hopes, as they that are <hi>with
child,</hi> and are in <hi>pain,</hi> to bring their
hopes to the birth; but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they <hi>bring forth wind.</hi> After long
looking and hard labour, all is but a
gripe of wind, like a fit of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
as the Prophet intimates, in <hi>Iſa.
26.</hi> 18. But, by this gift of grace,
which I call divine hope, that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is ſanctified, and lifted up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and ſet upon him and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, and ſo quickened and
made alive unto God. Whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are ſaid to be <hi>begotten again to
a lively hope, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 3. This gift
of grace I deſcribe further by two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties:
1. <hi>Spiritual,</hi> it is a ſpiritual
gift, for two reaſons: 1. Becauſe it
is created and perfected in believers
<hi>by the power of the Holy Spirit, Rom.
15.</hi> 13. 2. Becauſe it makes them
<hi>ſpiritual,</hi> in whom it is wrought,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. and fit inſtruments for
Gods ſpiritual ſervice, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5.
2. In-dwelling;</hi> I call it an in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
gift: 1. Becauſe it abides in all
that are in Chriſt. Union with Chriſt
doth not extinguiſh it in believers.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58315:44"/>
Therefore, when believers are ſaid to
be <hi>dead,</hi> in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. it is not meant,
in reſpect of ſanctifying gifts of grace,
inhaerent in them, as if they were
dead, and the faculties and affections
of their ſouls were immediately acted
by the Holy Spirit; but, in reſpect of
ſin, they are <hi>dead unto ſin, but alive
unto God, through our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 6. 11. 2. Becauſe it
it is not a tranſient work upon us, nor
abiding in the Holy Ghoſt, though
he abideth in us (for no created gifts
or qualities abide in him; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is in him is himſelf) but it is
wrought, preſerved, increaſed, actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and perfected in us by the Holy
Ghoſt, as all other ſanctifying inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
gifts of grace are. So much for
the general nature of this divine hope.
2. The ſubject recipient of it are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
For this hope is grounded on
faith in the promiſes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5.
Therefore, in the Old Teſtament,
truſting in God, and hoping in God,
are promiſcuouſly uſed in one and the
ſame ſenſe, and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. hope
is put for faith. For they both act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58315:45"/>
inſeparably, in ſupporting
the ſoul, in times of affliction; yet,
in their manner of acting, there are
ſome differences between them. For,
1. The adaequate object of faith is
the whole Word of God, holding
forth good and evil, promiſes and
threatnings, bleſſings and curſings.
But the object of hope is good
onely. 2. Faith, in its relying upon
the promiſes, looks to the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing,
and to the Authority of God,
the promiſer; but hope to the good
promiſed, and to the goodneſſe of the
promiſer. 3. Faith looks to all times,
paſt, preſent, and to come, and makes
future things preſent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. 7.
But hope looks onely at good things,
and at thoſe onely as future. 4. Faith
lookes at God, as the firſt truth; hope
relies on God, as the chief good.
3. The formal act of hope is expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore it is ſaid to <hi>look for
him,</hi> in a way of waiting for him,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 17. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
is well tranſlated, <hi>earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi>
in <hi>Rom. 8. 19. Phil.</hi> 1. 20.
it being a metaphor taken from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58315:45"/>
geſtures of thoſe who look for
ſome perſon or thing, with earneſt
deſire, and aſſurance, lifting up and
putting forth their head, ſtretching out
their neck, fixing their eyes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and obſervation, to ſhew the
ſtrength, firmneſſe, and certainty of
this hope. For the object of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hope is principally God himſelf,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and ſecondarily, all
thoſe means and degrees, whereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
come unto God, ver. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. unto
whom this hope looketh, with wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him for all the good they
want, and he hath promiſed: So that
this hope is certain and infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
objectated upon God, founded in
faith, and grounded upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of <hi>God, who cannot lie, Tit.</hi> 1.
2. Hence it ſupporteth the heart, in
the worſt times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Hoping in God a right is a
ſpecial means of ſupporting the ſoul
againſt diſcouragement, in times of
great afflictions. The Scriptures are
innumerable which confirm and prove
this truth: And it muſt be ſo for theſe
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:58315:46"/>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. From the formal object of
divine hope, which is God himſelf,
in whom alone is to be found all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and readineſſe to do good
unto thoſe that hope in him,
and wait upon him, in ſuch
times. 1. All ability to help is in
God alone. Princes are of greateſt
abilities among men, yet we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to <hi>truſt in Princes, in whom
there is no help, Pſal.</hi> 146. 3. Men
commonly think themſelves happy in
the favour and protection of Princes:
But they are deceived. Therefore it is
added, in ver. 5. <hi>Happy is he that
hath the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>for his help,
whoſe hope is in the Lord his God.</hi> For
no creature hath ability, of it ſelf, and
what ever ability God hath put into
any, yet the exerciſe and ſucceſſe of
it depends on God alone. <hi>Except the
Lord build the houſe, they labour in
vain that build it: Except the Lord
keep the City, the Watchman waketh
but in vain. It is in vain to riſe up
early, to go to bed late, to eat the
bread of ſorrows. So he will give his
beloved quiet ſleep, Pſal.</hi> 127. 1, 2.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58315:46"/>
that is, in their reſting upon him,
building, keeping, giving them bread
without ſorrows. Therefore, when
men ſay, They hope for this or that,
from ſuch a creature; either they mean,
They hope to receive it from God, by
ſuch a creature, or it notes, not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
but a meer humane hope; or it
is, not a Chriſtian, but a vain hope.
2. As God onely is able, ſo he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ready to do good to all thoſe
that hope in him. For he is infinite,
as well in goodneſſe, as in power.
<hi>Thou are good and doeſt good, Pſal.
119.</hi> 68. This <hi>David</hi> largely ſhewes
by ſundry inſtances, in two caſes.
1. In deliverances, where of he notes
four examples, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 1. Of
men wandering in the Wilderneſſe,
ver. 2. to 10. 2. Of Priſoners, ver.
10. to 17. 3. Of perſons dangerouſly
ſick, ver. 17. to 23. 4. Of men in
great danger, by Storms, at Sea, ver.
23. to 33. In all which, he ſaih, God
helps men crying to him, when all
help and hope in the creature fails
them. 2. In various changes of mens
outward conditions; in reference,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58315:47"/>
both to the increaſe of the fruits of the
earth, or to the diminiſhing of them,
whereby men become rich, or poor,
ver. 33. to 36. and to mens prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or abaſement, ver. 40, 41.
The ſumme of all is, that, which the
Pſalmiſt ſaith elſewhere, in <hi>Pſal. 46.
1. God is our refuge and ſtrength, a
very preſent help in trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Seeing hope is of things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and God is a preſent help; how
can it be ſaid, that God is the object
of our hope?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God is, not onely
a preſent help; but alſo a future
help, even for ever. And ſo he is the
object both of our faith and hope,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. And, for the future,
hope relyes upon God, though the ſoul
doth injoy him, at preſent, as our
God. 1. That he will continue his
goodneſſe to us. <hi>This God is our God,
and he will be our guide unto death,
Pſal. 48. ult.</hi> 2. That we ſhall have
a more cleer and full ſight of him,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 11. 3. That he will ſupply
all our need, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. and that he
will multiply grace and peace unto us.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58315:47"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. and that, as he is <hi>the
God of all grace,</hi> he will, <hi>after we
have ſuffered a while, make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle us,
1 Pet.</hi> 5. 10. Theſe future good things
hope expects, and 4. at laſt eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Therefore it is called, <hi>the
hope of Salvation, 1 Theſſ. 5. 8. the
hope of glory, Rom.</hi> 5. 2. and the
<hi>hope of eternal life, Tit.</hi> 3. 7. all
which are good things to come, and
though difficult, yet poſſible to be had,
by his help, and are moſt certain, by
vertue of his promiſe, in Chriſt, which
is the ground of this hope. Hence
hope is called an anchor ſure and ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. From Gods manner of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſoul and this object, himſelf,
together, by this hope. For 1. By ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
convincing and humbling the
ſoul, he prepares it for this hope. He
<hi>gives them the valley of Achor for a
door of hope, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 15. 2. He doth
it, by revealing his grace to a ſoul ſo
prepared. To this end, 1. He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the eyes of their underſtanding,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. 2. Having given them a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58315:48"/>
ſpiritual eye-ſight: he layes his grace
and goodneſſe in Chriſt, before them,
by the miniſtry of the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.
3.</hi> 9. 3. He particularly applyeth the
ſame to them, as theirs, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 26. and
by the efficacy of the ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.
35.</hi> 3. So that now they can look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, in the Covenant of grace,
as their God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the good of the Covenant, as a
legacy given unto them by Chriſt, in
his laſt Will and Teſtament, 2 <hi>Pet.
1.</hi> 3. Hence what they yet have not,
in ſenſe, they ſee ground to hope for,
<hi>Pſal. 130. ult.</hi> And this hope ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the heart under great affliction,
upon three main propps: 1. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Gods grace: 1. To pardon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great great ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20.
2. To perform all his promiſes, how
difficult ſo ever it may ſeem to our
ſenſe and reaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. to 22.
3. To comfort in all tribulations,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3, 4. 4. To help in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9, 10. 2. Upon the
freeneſſe of Gods grace and promiſe,
notwithſtanding all our un-worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58315:48"/>
               <hi>Iſa. 43. 25. Mich. 7. 18.
3.</hi> Upon the reality of Gods good
purpoſes towards us, declared by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Son, and his Sons comming,
to bring us to God, <hi>Luke 19. 10.
1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. and Chriſts calling us
unto himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29. and
the fathers drawing us unto his Son,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44, 45. The relliſh which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
have of the ſweetneſſe of Gods
grace, in Chriſt, turneth the eye of
their ſoul towards him, in deſires and
expectations of further good from him,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 3. From the effects of this hope,
all which ſhew that the ſoul is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by it. 1. It brings comfort to
the ſoul. Therefore <hi>rejoycing</hi> is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this <hi>hope, Rom.</hi> 12. 12. There
is joy in hope of good to come,
though it be yet abſent. Becauſe the
ſoul hath a taſte of it, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
and firſt fruits. Now joy
ſtrengthens the heart anſwerably to
the degree of it. <hi>The joy of God is
your ſtrength, Neh.</hi> 8. 10. As when
a man ſeeth the clouds begin to clear,
in a time of rain, he is comforted, in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58315:49"/>
hope that it will be fair weather; ſo
when the ſoul, under great affliction,
ſeeth ſome glimpſe of the light of Gods
countenance, his hope and joy revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
and is increaſed, as that is more
cleared unto him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 6.
2. It quieteth and ſetleth the heart in
peace proportionably to the meaſure of
our truſting and hoping in God;
<hi>Moſes</hi> found it ſo, at the Red Sea.
<hi>Exod,</hi> 14. 13. and <hi>David,</hi> at <hi>Ziglag,
1 Sam.</hi> 30. 6. 3. It makes the heart
patient in waiting on God, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to his good pleaſure, <hi>Pſal.
37.</hi> 7. &amp; 34. 34. How is God <hi>their
ſtrength in the time of trouble?</hi> By
ſtrengthening their hope to wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
and quietly upon him, not
uſing any indirect and unlawful
means to eſcape or come out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The Lord <hi>cryed, concerning this:
Their ſtrength is to ſit ſtill, Iſa. 30.
7.</hi> 4. It cauſeth the ſoul to cleave
unto God, whatever befals them in
the way of obedience, <hi>Rom. 5. 23.
Heb.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. For reproof of two ſorts:
1. All unregenerate perſons may be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58315:49"/>
hence convinced that their ſtate is
wretched and miſerable, upon two
grounds: 1. Becauſe they have no
hope in God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. A Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
ſtate is an hopeleſſe ſtate, and
an hopeleſſe ſtate is the worſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They pretend to this hope, but
without ground, and an ungrounded
hope is a ſelf-deluding hope. The
object of their hope ſhall fail them,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. and the hope which
they ſeem to have, <hi>ſhall periſh,</hi> and
<hi>be cut off, Iob</hi> 8. 13, 14. It ſhall be
<hi>as a ſpiders web,</hi> finely ſpun, but
not firm, its but an hope of their own
making, as the ſpiders web is wrought
out of its own bowels; and, as the
ſpider thinks it ſelf, when it is lodged
in its web, ſo they think themſelves
ſafe in their ſalſe hope; but as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
web is eaſily and ſuddenly ſwept
away, ſo ſhall their hope be by Gods
beeſome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 23. 2. Becauſe
they abound in vain hopes; in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<hi>Luke</hi> 18. 19. in men, <hi>Iſa. 2.
22.</hi> in riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
and horſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20. 7. in their
mental and bodily abilities, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 4.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58315:50"/>
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23, 24. Such hopes argue ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
pride, atheiſm, idolatry, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up the creature above God, <hi>Jer.
2.</hi> 12, 13. The effects alſo are perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
1. Loſſe, <hi>Jon. 2. 8. Phil.</hi> 3. 7.
2. Diſappointment, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 15. 3. To
be aſhamed of their hope, <hi>Iob 6. 20.
Iſa. 1. 29. and 20. 5. and</hi> 30. 5.
4. Great hurt, <hi>Hoſ. 12. 1. Ephraim
feedeth on wind, and followeth the
Eaſt-wind.</hi> The Eaſt wind, in thoſe
eaſtern countries, was an hot skorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wind, that blaſted things, and
made them wither, <hi>Gen. 41. 6. Ezek.
17.</hi> 10. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo are all falſe objects
of hope, <hi>the ſtaffe of a broken reed,
whereon if a man leane, it will go into
his hand and pierce it, Iſa.</hi> 36. 6.
Many have found it ſo, on their death
beds, and in Hell for ever. 2. Hence
believers are to be reproved, who do
not exerciſe this hope, but give way to
diſcouragement, in times of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For, 1. Hereby they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unfit to perform duties towards
God and men, in a right manner.
Towards God, in prayer, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58315:50"/>
the word and the outward ſeales
of the Covenant, and in thankſ-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and prayſing God. Towards
men, in an amiableneſſe towards all,
and in merciful helpfulneſſe towards
the afflicted. 2. They diſhonour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by ſtrengthening ignorant
and profane perſons, in a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that Religion is but a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick
humour. 3. They weaken
themſelves and others. Themſelves;
For, from fainting, comes diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thence, halting, and from
thence an aptneſſe to be turned out of
the good way. For take away hope,
and you take away all endeavor. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo, if they be weak, will be
offended; and, if they be prejudiced,
will be apt to inſult and to twit ſuch,
as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> did <hi>Iob,</hi> in <hi>Iob</hi> 4. 3. to
7. 4. They give Satan great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
againſt themſelves, who dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obſerveth ſuch times, when
Chriſtians are under deep deſpondency
of ſpirit, when they have laid aſide
their helmet, to wound and weaken
them more, he will then ply them
with ſuggeſtions, to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58315:51"/>
any thing againſt God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Scripture, and againſt
themſelves, and to conclude deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
things, to their own hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> This is my caſe; therefore
I never had a right hope in God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus one iſcouragement
followes upon another, as circles in
the water, whereinto a ſtone is caſt,
which ſhould humble you for neglect
of ſtirring up your hope unto excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.
But yet, let it not diſcourage you.
For true hope is ſometimes in a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as in thoſe trees, ſpoken of in
<hi>Iſa. 6. 13. Whoſe ſubſtance is in
them when they caſt their leaves.</hi> It
is onely winter with you, then life is
hid in the root, though no ſigne of
it appears outwardly; that you may
learn not to truſt in grace received,
but in Chriſt; depending on him to
quicken and actuate his own gifts of
grace in you, waiting with fervent
deſires and prayers for the Sun of
righteouſneſſe to ariſe upon you, with
healing in his wings. In the mean
time, remember that Chriſt himſelf
hath pronounced them bleſſed, who are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58315:51"/>
poor in ſpirit, and mourn, are meek,
and hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and that he hath promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch, that heaven is theirs, they
ſhall be comforted, ſhall inherit the
earth, and ſhall be ſatisfied. Let ſuch
encouragements quicken your hope,
and quiet your hearts, that it ſhall be
with you, according to his Word,
and that your hope ſo grounded, ſhall
not make you aſhamed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. For Inſtruction, in three
particulars: 1. How to bring and
keep the object and this act, God and
this hope together. 2. How to try,
whether you hope in God aright, or
not. 3. How to exerciſe this hope, in
ſundry caſes, in which you may be
called to the practice of it. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
is neceſſary, at all times,
and eſpecially, in theſe times, wherein
we may have more neceſſitous uſe of
this hope, then many do imagine.
Therefore I ſhall the more ſtudiouſly
inſiſt in clearing theſe particulars,
ſpeaking to the firſt, at this time,
with the help of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. How to bring and keep the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58315:52"/>
and act, God and this hope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The holy Pen-man of the
Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> in <hi>Heb. 3.
6.</hi> compares the Church of God to an
houſe; ſaying, <hi>whoſe houſe we are, if
we hold faſt the confidence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
of hope firme to the end.</hi> As
it is in the building of an houſe, ſo it
muſt be in the building of this hope.
In the building of an houſe, that it
may be ſtrong, and kept ſtrong, three
things are neceſſary: 1. That a ſtrong
foundation be well laid. 2. That the
houſe be ſtrongly built upon it.
3. That it be kept in due repair. So
it muſt be, in this great buſineſſe,
whereof we now ſpeak. 1. A ſtrong
foundation of hope muſt be well laid.
2. Our hope muſt be ſtrongly built
upon it. 3. We muſt be careful that
our hope be continually kept in due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.
Of theſe three we ſhall ſpeak
diſtinctly, and ſhall endeavour to
ſhew how they are to be done. 1. For
the firſt, God himſelf, as he makes
himſelf and his will known unto us,
by his written Word, is the onely
ſuitable object, and ſtrong foundation,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58315:52"/>
or ground-work of this hope. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church, in my Text, ſaith, <hi>I
will hope in him.</hi> For in him alone
are the properties of that object, on
which true hope muſt rely. A man
can be in no condition, wherein he
needs help, but there is in God pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and will to ſupply it unto him. If
comfort be wanting, he is <hi>the God of
all comfort, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 3. He can
and will create comforts, for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
out of nothing; yea, out of the
contrary: As he cauſed at firſt, <hi>light
to ſhine out of darkneſſe, 2 Cor. 4.
6.</hi> Thoſe troubles, temptations, and
perſecutions, and afflictions, which
threaten deſtruction, become means
of our ſalvation, by his over-ruling
providence, <hi>who is wonderful in
counſel, and excellent in working,
Iſa. 28. ult.</hi> In this object, two
principles are to be looked at. 1. A
principle of being. 2. A principle of
knowing. 1. The principle of being,
is God himſelf, concerning whom,
five particulars muſt be believed, that
our hope may be objeccated upon him.
1. That God in whom we hope, is an
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58315:53"/>
eternal, independant Being or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
who giveth being, and order
of being, and power of working un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all things. 2. That in the Being or
Eſſence of God are three Subſiſtences
or Perſons: God, in the firſt Perſon,
the Father (with the Son and Holy
Spirit) decreed the ſalvation of the
Elect, and all things tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
God, in the ſecond Perſon, the
Son, hath fully and exactly anſwered
that decree, as our ſurety, in the work
of Redemption. God, in the third
Perſon, the Holy Spirit, effectually
reveales and applies the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the grace of the Son unto
the Elect, in time, and fits them for
communion with the Father and the
Son, from both whom he proceeds.
3. That Chriſt, the Mediator, is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi>
in whom God was reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the World unto himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.
5.</hi> 19. who united the two natures of
God and man, in his Perſon, and
was thereby fit to bring God and man
together, having made man amiable
to God, and God amiable to man,
who were enemies before, by the ſin
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58315:53"/>
of man. 4. That God, in Chriſt, is
fatherly towards believers, in all his
Attributes, whereby he is deſcribed,
in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. and other Texts of
Scripture, all which are in God eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential;
and therefore eternal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.
5. That God acteth all theſe
his excellencies, by his fatherly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
governing and ordering all
things for the good of his people, ſo
powerfully, that Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in ſeeking to croſſe his reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will, ſhall and do fulfil his ſecret
will, to their own confuſion. This
providence extends as far as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all things, even the moſt caſual,
and moſt diſordered things, ſins, and
the moſt free actings of men are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by it, ſo that God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
great things by weak means,
diſabling more likely means, <hi>Eccleſ.
9.</hi> 11. Sometimes without means, and
ſometimes croſſing the courſe of
means. And, when evil is intended,
God either wholly averts it, or limits
and bounds it, in regard of meaſure,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 3. 4. or of continuance,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 3. Hereby alſo he cauſeth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58315:54"/>
and ordereth a ceſſation of actions,
that ſome ſhall not favour us, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhall want wiſdom and ability
to help us, from Gods with-drawing
his concurrence, who hath ſufficient
reaſon, as well, not to do what he
doth not, as to do what he doth. The
right knowledge of God in his Being,
is neceſſary to the well-laying the
ground-work of this hope, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
unto the preparatory purpoſes
and uſes. 1. To ſilence all diſputes and
murmurrings: This made <hi>Aaron</hi> hold
his peace, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 2, 3. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
not to open his mouth, <hi>Pſal. 39.
9.</hi> 2. To cauſe the ſoul to reſigne up
a mans ſelf to the will of God, <hi>who
worketh all things according to the
counſel of his will, Eph.</hi> 1. 11. So it
wrought in <hi>Ely, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 18. in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
2 Sam.</hi> 15. 26. and in the Saints,
<hi>Acts</hi> 21. 14. 3. To quicken us to
inure our ſelves to do Gods will, that
we may be fit to ſuffer it. For paſſive
obedience ſprings from active. Then
are mens wills in right order, when, as
God is the higheſt, ſo his will hath
the higheſt place in our hearts; when
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58315:54"/>
they are willing to do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
to ſuffer what God inflicts,
and to be at Gods diſpoſe, when this
ſtayeth our hearts, in all events, that
they are in covenant with him, who
ſits at the Stern, and hath committed
all power to our Redeemer, who hath
our names in his breſt-plate, and on
his ſhoulders. The ſecond principle
to be looked at in God, that our hope
may be well built on him, is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of knowing. This principle is the
written Word, whereby God makes
himſelf and his will known unto us,
without which we have no good
ground or warrant to build our hope
upon God. But, that his people may
thus hope in him with ſtrong encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
He gives us his Word, that
thereby we may know his good
thoughts, and purpoſes towards us,
which is a ſufficient ground of hope,
it being the Word of him that cannot
lie; and not onely his bare Word,
but a binding Word, his promiſes,
which are free expreſſions of his love,
with engagement of it unto us; nor
onely Promiſes, but his Covenant,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58315:55"/>
founded upon a full ſatisfaction made
to his juſtice, by our Redeemer, as
the head of the Covenant; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
hath added his Oath, <hi>Hob.</hi> 6. 18.
and Seals, both outward, <hi>Rom. 4.
11.</hi> and inward, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. and all
this he hath done, that our hope might
be built upon a ſtrong foundation, that
believers might be ſupported in all
tempeſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 9. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>2. Having ſuch a ſtrong foundation
well laid, our next duty is, to build
ſtrongly upon it. Which that you may
do, attend to theſe directions. 1. See
that you truſt and hope in God by light
and ſtrength received from himſelf.
1. By divine light, not by meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reaſons. For none can ſo know
God, in his truth, and goodneſſe, as
to truſt and hope in him, but by his
own light revealing himſelf to the
ſoul, by his Word and Spirit; as
none can ſee the Sun, but by its own
light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 9. 2. The divine
power muſt accompany this light.
For, neither education, nor examples
of others, nor our own reſolutions,
can ſettle our hearts upon God, till
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58315:55"/>
we find an inward power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
cauſing divine truths to ſhine into
our hearts, and ſubduing all our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
and thoughts unto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of faith; onely that ſoul, which
hath found the efficacy of the ſpirit, by
the Word, in caſting it down, and
raiſing it up, and renewing it, can
hope in God aright for things of
God; them, and not before, a man
chooſeth God for his portion, and
cleaveth to him, as his chief good;
then, and not before, the ſweetneſſe
of Gods love is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let into the ſoul, and
relliſhed by it, which draweth the
whole ſoul to truſt and hope in him,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
            <p>3. Suit the Promiſes to your ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conditions. For what ever condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life any believer is or can be
in, he hath Promiſes in the Word
ſuitable to it; whether preſent, or
poſſible. 1. At preſent, what ever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
or impoſſibilities, as to ſecond
cauſes, and means appear to ſenſe, or
reaſon, faith lifteth up the ſoul above
them all, to look unto the Promiſes
and power of God, and thereby
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58315:56"/>
quickneth and ſtrengthenth our hope
in him, <hi>Rom. 4. 19, 20, 21. Heb.
11.</hi> 27. 2. Poſſible, The Saints have
found great help to their faith and
hope, by putting caſes, and anſwering
their own hearts therein from Gods all-ſufficiencies.
So <hi>David, Though I walk
through the valley of the ſhadow of
death, I will fear none evil; for thou
art with me, Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. Again,
<hi>Though an Hoſt ſhould encampe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, my heart ſhould not fear,
Pſal.</hi> 27. 3. Again, <hi>God is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
and ſtrength, a very preſent
help in trouble; therefore we will not
fear, though the earth be removed,
and though the Mountains be carried
into the midſt of the Sea, though the
Waters thereof roar, Pſal. 46. 1, 2, 3.
Paul</hi> excellently puts other caſes, of
an higher nature than theſe, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
over them all, in the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
of Gods love to believers in
Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>3. When your hope is quickened,
by the Promiſes, look unto God with
a ſingle eye, truſting and hoping in
him alone. To truſt upon two props,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58315:56"/>
of which one is ſound, the other rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
is the ready way to fall. Make
uſe of all helps, which God gives
you, but hope in him alone. For ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in God is a part of that natural
worſhip of God, injoyned in the
firſt Commandement, which belongs
to God alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 20. and thus
to have our eyes towards God alone is
the proper effect of true converſion,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>4. See that the diſpoſitions of your
ſpirits be anſwerable to the relations
you have to God, when he becomes
your portion, and the object of your
hope. He hath, 1. The relation of a
faithful Creator, and the diſpoſition in
you that muſt ſuit that, is, to commit
your ſouls to him in well-doing,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. in the want of means.
2. The relation of a father, and the
diſpoſition in you that ſuits thereunto,
is, to caſt your care upon him, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that he careth for you, 1 <hi>Pet. 5.
7. Mat.</hi> 6. 32. 3. The relation of
an husband, the diſpoſition that ſuits
that, is foederal faithfulneſſe, <hi>Hoſ. 2.
19, 20. 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3. 4. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58315:57"/>
of a guid and teacher, the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
ſuitable to that is, to yield up
your ſelves in all things to be guided by
his counſel, as <hi>Aſaph</hi> did, <hi>Pſal. 73.
24.</hi> 5. The relations of your Judge,
Law-giver, and King, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 22.
The diſpoſition which anſwers thoſe
relations, is obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and walking in his wayes.
Elſe, you do not truſt in him, but
tempt him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 7. You may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
God, in his wayes of mercy,
when you keep in your way of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Then you may, with comfort,
expect what ever good thoſe relations
can yield, from the All-ſufficient
God, who regarding more our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
then his own greatnneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcendeth
ſo low as to take upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſuch relations, for the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our hope in him.</p>
            <p>5. Often call to mind former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,
both of your ſelves, and others.
<hi>Experience worketh hope, Rom.</hi> 5. 4.
1. Of others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 4. and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Thou Lord haſt not
forſaken them that truſt in thee, Pſal.
9.</hi> 10. 2. Of your ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58315:57"/>
10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17, 18. Chriſtians ſhould
be ready to communicate their own
experiences to others, as <hi>David</hi> did
in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 16. Thus the Word will
be as ſilver ſeven times tryed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
            <p>6. Reſt not in your hoping in God,
as it is an act done, or a grace exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by you. For hoping is but the act
of a creature, and the gift of hope it
ſelf is but a created gift, and to hope
in any creature, is to make that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
an Idol. But to depend upon God
to quicken and ſtrengthen your hope
in himſelf alone, who is called, <hi>the
hope of Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 14. 6. and by his
help, through the promiſe, to truſt and
hope in him the Promiſer, who gives
Promiſes, and can create performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(ſo that, if you cloſe with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
as good, you may cloſe with the
Promiſer, as better, who both ſpeaks
what he means, and will perform what
he ſpeaks;) this is the way to build your
hope ſtrongly upon God.</p>
            <p>3. That you may keep this hope in
repair: 1. See that your hoping in
God be a continued act, frequently
renewed upon every new occaſion, not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58315:58"/>
onely in adverſity, but alſo in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
as well in injoyments as in
wants. For we have uſe of hoping in
God for the continuance of the good
we have, and for his bleſſing to be
continued to us in it. 2. Obſerve what
breaches are made in your hope, from
day to day; whether from within, by
corruptions, or from without by
temptations? You will find that the
main breaches are either from falſe
principles, or from doubts of true
principles, or from inadvertency, and
mindleſſeneſſe of them. Thence the
ſoul is as ſheep that are driven from
mountain to hill, and have forgotten
their reſting place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 6. 3. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found out the impediments of
your hoping in God, ſtir up your
ſelves as <hi>David</hi> did, ſaying, return
unto thy reſt, O my ſoul, <hi>Pſal. 116.
7.</hi> by ſtirring up this gift of God in
you, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. To this end, 1. See
that your judgment be right. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of thoſe things that are oppoſite
to this hope, and caſt them off, <hi>Heb.
12.</hi> 1, 2. where every thing that bows
the ſoul downward is compared to a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58315:58"/>
weight; and looſe affections, and
falſe reaſonings, are compared to a
long looſe garment, which eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets
the feet, and will hinder a runner
in a race, if it be not laid aſide, or girt
up. 3. Speak to your own heart, as
you would ſpeak to another, in a like
caſe. 4. Joyn prayer with your uſe of
other means, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. 5. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods order of promiſing,
do you proceed to quicken and
ſtrengthen your faith and hope in him.
1. He promiſeth that he will be your
God, ſo let your faith look at him, in
Chriſt, and let your hope expect that
he will be ſo to you, for the future,
and for ever, <hi>Pſal. 48. ult.</hi> 2. He
promiſeth that he will forgive all ſins
unto repentant believers. Therefore
renew your repentance and faith in the
blood of Chriſt daily, and then hope in
him, and pray that he will make you
to hear joy and gladneſſe, and reſtore
to you the joy of his ſalvation, as <hi>David</hi>
did, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 8, 12. 3. He hath promiſed
that he will ſanctifie, and heal his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Therefore hope in him, and pray
to him for it, as <hi>David</hi> did, in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 138.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58315:59"/>
               <hi>ult.</hi> 4. He hath promiſed that he will
give that inheritance in heaven unto all
that are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt.
Therefore wait for it in hope, <hi>Rom. 8.
23,</hi> 24. and let that hope comfort and
ſtrengthen your hearrs in all the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of this life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18.
5. He hath promiſed that he will give
all things needful for this life, till we
come thither, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hope in him for daily bread, and
for all things you need. For as the
ſame love of God moved him to ſave
his elect for ever, and to provide for
them in this World, till they be put
into poſſeſſion of that ſalvation; ſo the
ſame hope relyeth upon God, both for
heaven hereafter, and for all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſupplies, till we come thither. Thus
we have endeavoured to inſtruct you,
in this firſt point, how to bring the
act and object, God and this hope,
together, that you may hope in him,
which, you ſee, is a matter of great
importance, and neceſſary to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
practically, that we may
hope in God aright.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Inſtruction is, to teach
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58315:59"/>
men how to try whether their hoping
in God, which they pretend, is right, or
not. The danger is very great, if you be
deceived herein, yet many are deceived,
through want of light to diſcern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the natural affection of
hope and this ſpiritual gift of hope in
God. This divine hope, whereof we now
ſpeak, may be known by 3 Characters.</p>
            <p>1. By the ground of it. 2. By the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
act of it. 3. By the proper effect of it.</p>
            <p>1. By the ground of it. If it be
rightly grounded, it is the right hope.
The ground of this hope is faith, <hi>Heb.
11.</hi> 1. which hath a double object.
1. God in Chriſt. 2. The Word of
God. That you may try and examine
your hope, whether it be thus ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or not; we ſhall inſiſt ſome-what
more largely in this, and be more
brief in the two following Characters,
which will be more eaſily apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after this is cleared.</p>
            <p>1. Hope is rightly grounded, when
it is grounded or bottomed upon faith,
receiving Chriſt, and applying to our
ſelves, in him, God as our God, and
portion, in the Covenant of Grace.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58315:60"/>
It is the office and work of faith, to
appropriate God in Chriſt, to a mans
ſelf. The voice of Chriſt unto belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
is, <hi>My Father</hi> is <hi>your Father,
and my God your God, Joh.</hi> 20. 17.
And the voice of faith, in a believer,
to Chriſt, is, <hi>My Lord and my
God, ver.</hi> 28, 29. God abſolutely
conſidered, out of Chriſt, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the greateſt terrour unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14. But God, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
conſidered, in Chriſt, as our
God and portion, is the chiefeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our hope, and love. Faith clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
unto God, as our God and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And, when we know that God
is our portion, and thereupon hope
in him, then our hoping in God is
right, becauſe it is rightly grounded.
Our having God for our portion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at our entring into Covenant
with him. For then, and not before,
we have a propriety in God, and he
in us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. This propriety in
God is given and manifeſted to us, by
degrees. 1. The ſoul is convinced of
the vanity and inſufficiency of all
other things to be our portion, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58315:60"/>
ſo is made willing to forſake them all,
that it may injoy God, as his portion.
Till this be done, men <hi>obſerve lying
vanities,</hi> and <hi>forſake their own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Jon.</hi> 2. 8, 9. 2. The ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that God is the God of ſome,
by a peculiar right, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 3. Theſe
he accounts the onely happy men in
the World, <hi>Pſal. 144. ult.</hi> 3. Hence
ariſe fervent deſires that God would be
ſo to him, in particular. <hi>Remember
me, O Lord, with the favour of thy
people, Pſal.</hi> 106. 4. 4. The ſoul is
quickened, by the Spirit of faith, to
turn unto the Lord with true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and to put it ſelf upon Gods
mercy in Chriſt, and to wait upon
him for the diſcovery of his love to
him, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 13, 14. 5. God, having
thus far brought the ſoul towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
doth, in his own time, manifeſt
to us that he is our God, whence the
ſoul actually cloſeth with him, by faith,
in Chriſt, as our portion, <hi>Hoſ. 2.
13. Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. 6. Hereupon we
come to hope in him, for what ever
good we need, and he hath promiſed,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 11. And as faith groweth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58315:61"/>
more towards full aſſurance, ſo hope
groweth more ſtrong in ſpiritual ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and courage, and glorying in
God, <hi>Pſal. 48. ult.</hi> yet, in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
times, faith inables the ſoul, from
its former taſte of Gods goodneſſe, to
claim an intereſt in him ſtill. <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
thou art our Father, &amp;c. Iſa.
63.</hi> 16. with an expectation of future
good from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 11. Yea,
when experience and ſenſe failes, by
reaſon of our inadvertency, yet ſo
much vertue of former ſenſe remains,
as inables the ſoul, even when it is
<hi>in darkneſſe, and ſeeth no light, to truſt
in the name of the Lord, and ſtay it
ſelf upon his God, Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. and
to <hi>wait upon the Lord,</hi> even when he
<hi>hideth his face from us, and to
look for him, Iſa.</hi> 8. 17. But, if any
deſire to know how they may clearly
diſcern that their hope is grounded
on faith in God, as their God and
portion in Chriſt; I anſwer, you may
know it by Gods influence in a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſoul, whereby this hope is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and ſtrengthened. For, when
God becomes any ones portion, he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58315:61"/>
becomes a fountain of bleſſings to that
perſon, <hi>God, our own God ſhall bleſſe
us, Pſal.</hi> 67. 6. He is <hi>a Sun and a
Shield, the Lord will give grace and
glory, no good thing will he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
from them, Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
of ſpiritual bleſſings, which
the Apoſtles, in their ſalutations,
comprehend in two things, grace. and
peace. God as our God, in Chriſt,
is the God of both to his people. He
is <hi>the God of all grace, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 10.
and <hi>the God of peace, Heb.</hi> 13. 20.
That is, he influenceth believers with
all thoſe graces, which breed peace and
quietneſſe in their ſouls, ſupporting
them under all burthens of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
troubles, wants, imperfections,
till they come to enjoy perfect reſt in
God himſelf, and fitting them, in the
mean time, more and more, for all
that good, which they want, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and he hath prepared for them,
in Chriſt. For, 1. God, as our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is the God of love; yea, <hi>love it
ſelf, 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 8. and a taſt of his <hi>love
is better than wine, Cant.</hi> 1. 3. ſo full
of ſpirit that it will revive a drooping,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58315:62"/>
ſinking, dying ſoul, and quicken all
graces in it, and make any condition
comfortable, any affliction tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ſtrengthen it to wait for
more full communion with God, in the
uſe of the moſt difficult means, as
<hi>Jacobs</hi> love to <hi>Rachel,</hi> inabled him
to wait for her ſeven years, in an hard
ſervice, and they ſeemed to him but
as a few dayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 20. 2. God,
as our portion in Chriſt, is <hi>the God of
hope, Rom.</hi> 15. 13. whereby, as by an
Anchor, he ſtayeth and ſixeth the ſoul
upon himſelf: as a Ship at Anchor,
though it may be moved, and toſſed,
yet it is not removed from its place
and ſtation; ſo, if you find that your
ſoul cleaveth to God, in Chriſt, and
will not be driven from him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
troubles, or temptations befal you;
your hope in him is right. This <hi>Aſaph</hi>
found, in <hi>Pſal. 73. ult.</hi> 3. God, as
our God and portion, is <hi>the God of
patience, Rom.</hi> 15. 5. whereby belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
reſigne up themſelves to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
humbly ſubmitting their wils
to his. If you find it ſo; your hope is
right. <hi>David</hi> found it ſo, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58315:62"/>
4. God, as our portion, is <hi>the Father
of Spirits, Heb.</hi> 12. 9. which he ſo
governs, and meekens, that, though
we be ſenſible of afflictions, he keeps
our ſpirits from diſcontentment and
murmurring, in a quiet frame. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
alſo you may know that your hope
is right. The Church found it ſo, in
<hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 9. 5. God, as our portion,
is <hi>God All-ſufficient, Gen.</hi> 17. 1.
whence he gives us contenment,
in all eſtates, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 6. 6. If you find
it ſo, your hope is right. <hi>Paul</hi> found
it ſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12. 6. God, as
our portion, is <hi>the God of all comfort,
2 Cor.</hi> 1. 3. who, by letting the light
of his countenance into the ſoul,
maketh it light-ſome. This joy
ſtrenthens the ſoul, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 6. againſt
inordinate fears of wants, <hi>Pſal. 23.
1.</hi> or of dangers, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and under
ſenſe of afflictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2, 3. and
oppoſitions, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 7. and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 10. and in all
events, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39. Not, that
every believer attains to ſuch high
actings of faith and and hope; yet, if
it prevail to cauſe them to truſt in him,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58315:63"/>
and ſtay themſelves upon him, in the
dark, it is a right hope, <hi>Iſa. 50.
10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Hope is rightly grounded, when
it is bottomed upon the Word and
Promiſes of God believed in. In the
firſt converſion, when the ſoul had
nothing, but the bare promiſe of free
mercy in Chriſt, to look at, God
did thereby cauſe us to truſt and hope
in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 49. without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
experiences. In like manner, he
worketh in believers, in dark times,
when they cannot recal former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,
and want preſent ſenſe of
Gods love, God quickeneth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by quickening their in-looking
to the naked promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 50.
and thereby their hope alſo, <hi>Iſa. 8.
17.</hi> Hence <hi>Jacob</hi> became ſuch a
mighty wraſtler with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.
with <hi>Hoſ. 12. 4. God is ever mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his Covenant, Pſal.</hi> 111. 5.
and <hi>faithful in his Promiſes. 1 Theſſ.
5.</hi> 24. Hope looks at the good of the
Promiſe, and the goodneſſe of the
Promiſer, for that part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
which is not yet performed, as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58315:63"/>
faith looks at the truth of the promiſe,
and faithfulneſſe of the Promiſer.
Now, that hope thus grounded, is a
right hope, may be proved; becauſe,
when faith in the Promiſes quickeneth
and ſtrengtheneth hope in believers,
then Gods ends are attained, for which
he giveth Promiſes. His ends are
theſe, and the like: 1. To make
known unto his people his good
thoughts and purpoſes concerning
them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 10. This he doth, to
incourage them to hope for a good
end, and to endeavour, in the uſe of
good means, to attain it, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12.
2. To draw the Elect unto Chriſt, in
whom all Gods Promiſes are Yea, and
Amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. 3. To ſhew
what credit God hath in the hearts of
his people, <hi>Joh. 3. 33. 1 Joh. 5. 9.
10.</hi> 4. To let believers ſee that they
are richer, in their loweſt eſtate, than
others are in their greateſt worldly
poſſeſſion. For they have God himſelf,
for their portion, when others have but
his gifts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 7. They have
Chriſt, and <hi>unſearchable riches,</hi> in
him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. who became <hi>poor,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58315:64"/>
that, by his poverty, we might be made
rich, 2 Cor.</hi> 8. 9. They have ſpiritual
riches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. they are <hi>rich in faith,
Iam.</hi> 2. 5. whereas others have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their <hi>bellies filled, Pſal.</hi> 17. 14.
Believers have a large eſtate in Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. which are Gods
bills, and bonds, and deeds of gift,
<hi>for a great while to come, 2 Sam. 7.
19.</hi> They have much in poſſeſſion,
and much more in hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3.
ſo that, when we hope in his word,
God attaineth his end in giving his
word. Therefore hope grounded on
the word, is a right hope.</p>
            <p>2. By the formal act of hope, you
may try, whether it is right or not.
Expectation is the formal act of hope.
This expectation hath three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
1. It's earneſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20.
2. It's patient, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 25. Patient,
1. Of Labouring. 2. Of Suffering.
3. Of Waiting. Becauſe between ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and having, there is a want of the
thing deſired and promiſed, till Gods
time, for performing comes. This
delay is troubleſome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 12.
Therefore we have need of patience,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58315:64"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 35. The Husband-man
ſoweth in hope, and waits with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the precious fruits of the
earth, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 7. which the Apoſtle
there applies to believers. 3. With
continuance <hi>Iob</hi> 14. 14. Such wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on God gives him the glory of his
independency, all-ſufficiency, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability,
goodneſſe, faithfulneſſe, and
wiſdom, it hath great bleſſings, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to it, <hi>Prov. 8. 34, 35. Iſa.
30. 18. Iſa.</hi> 40. 31. The contrary
is a compound of many ſins, of pride,
and impatience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 41. and
and diſcontent, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 33. and
unbeliefe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16.</p>
            <p>3. By the proper effect of this hope,
you may know, it to be right; love
floweth from faith and hope, 1 <hi>Cor.
13. ult.</hi> eſpecially, to God, in Chriſt,
in whom we hope. Hence he <hi>that
hath this hope, purgeth himſelf, as
Chriſt is pure, 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in uſing all Gods means, with
avoiding the contrary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.
to 26. with dependance on God, and
truſting in him alone, not in our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
1 <hi>Sam. 2. 9. Prov.</hi> 3. 5, 6, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58315:65"/>
graces, which gave <hi>Peter</hi> two fals,
nor in our performances, <hi>Pſal. 127.
1,</hi> 2. nor in the means themſelves,
<hi>Heſt.</hi> 4. 14, 16.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what are the characters
of hoping in God aright: If upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
you find them to be in you, in
truth; that hope will not make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,
but you ſhall have cauſe to
ſay, with the Church, in <hi>Iſa. 25. 9.
Lo, this is our God, we have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for him, and he will ſave us,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Inſtruction is, How to
exerciſe hope in God aright, in ſundry
caſes, wherein you are called to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
it. Theſe caſes are of two ſorts.
1. Such as concern mens private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
2. Such as concern the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
The firſt ſort of caſes, which
concern the private conditions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
are either for the preſent, or
for the time paſt, or for the time to
come. We ſhall ſhew how this hope
is to be excerciſed, in theſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſeverally, and diſtinctly, with
Gods aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>1. For the time preſent, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58315:65"/>
are under exceſſive grief, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is the cauſe of it; whether ſin or
affliction, in your perſons, or relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Believers, as well as others, are
ſubject to many afflictions, in this
life, <hi>Pſal. 34. 19. Many are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of the righteous,</hi> and, not
of ſome one kind onely, but of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of every one,
<hi>his fleſh upon him ſhall have pain,
and his ſoul within him ſhall mourn,
Iob 14. ult.</hi> Herein two things are to
be cleared. 1. That it is our duty to
grieve under affliction, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to the cauſe. It is dedolency,
ſtupidity, not to grieve for afflictions,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 3. it is therefore our duty to
grieve, when God afflicteth us, but
more for Gods diſpleaſure apprehended
therein. 2. It is our duty to grieve more
for ſin then for affliction. 3. More
for ſin in our ſelves than in others,
And 4. For ſin in our near relations
more than in others more remote; yet
it is unlawful to let grief exceed the
proportion allowed by the rules of
Gods Word, as all do, who have not
this hope, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 13. The ſpirit
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58315:66"/>
of man is, by corrupt nature, <hi>unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as water, Gen.</hi> 49. 4. alwayes
running forth, unleſſe (as water is
bounded by the bank or veſſel, into
which it is put, ſo) our ſpirits be
bounded, and kept within Compaſſe,
by the Spirit of God. VVould you
know, when grief exceeds, or is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate?
You may know it by the
effects. 1. If it diſtempers and hurts
the body. Godly ſorrow, as ſuch,
hurts no man, it is healing to the ſoul,
and not hurtful to the body, unleſſe,
by accident, the body being before
under painful diſtemper, which is
apt to be increaſed by any grief. <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſorrow cauſeth death, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 10.
VVorldly ſorrow is, not onely, that
which is for worldly things, but alſo
that which is for ſin, upon worldly
reſpects, as the principal motives of
it. And that ſorrow hurts the body,
and doth no good to the ſoul, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
found, when guile prevailed in
his ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 2, 3, 4. 2. If it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
you from, or in, the performance
of any duty. 1. From it. The good
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hief, on the Croſſe, was in great
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58315:66"/>
grief; yet that did not hinder him
from honouring Chriſt, nor from
minding his own ſalvation, nor from
rebuking his fellow, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 39.
to 43. Nor did Chriſts ſorrow on the
Croſſe, which was far greater than that
thiefs, take him off from minding the
future good of his Mother, <hi>Joh. 19.
26.</hi> 2. In duty. It turned <hi>Davids</hi>
praying, wherein he ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
repentance, out of love unto
God, into roaring, out of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſelf- love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. and it
hindred the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in hearing
<hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſpake moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
to them, from receiving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thereby, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 9. It is with
the ſoul, in this caſe, as it is with the
body. VVhen Phyſick works upon
the right humour, it carries away that
which diſtempers, without hurting the
body. But, if it onely exaſperates the
diſtemper, and removes not the cauſe;
it doth hurt. 3. If your minds are ſo
fixed upon a particular grievance that
you cannot be duly thankful for other
mercies, nor take comfort in them;
like froward children, that, being
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58315:67"/>
croſſed in one thing, throw away all
the reſt. For this <hi>Joab</hi> juſtly blamed
<hi>David,</hi> though he erred in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
becauſe he wept exceſſively for
the death of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and did not
rejoyce in the victory, and give
thanks to God for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 1. to
8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>4. If it inclines the will to ſeek
eaſe and comfort, in ſome un-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
and unſafe way. This is
called <hi>halting,</hi> whereby men are
<hi>turned out of the way, Heb. 12. 12,
13.</hi> 5. If the ſoul ſinks, and faints
under it, is wholly ſubdued by it, ſo
as it cannot bear up it ſelf. This is one
of the extreams which wiſdom forbids
all her children to fall into, and
which to forget is a ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
            <p>Now the exerciſe of a right hoping
in God, is of neceſſary uſe, in this
caſe, to moderate ſorrow, and to keep
it within due bounds. This it doth,
eſpecially two wayes. 1. By ſtriking
at the root, and weakning the cauſes
of it. 1. If it be for outward loſſes
and croſſes, hoping in God raiſeth up
the ſoul by looking up to God, and
ſeeing that they are, either from him, as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58315:67"/>
our God in Covenant. Thus it raiſed
up <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 1. 21. and <hi>David, 1 Sam.
30.</hi> 6. or that they are for God, and
for their witneſſe-bearing to his truth.
This inabled the Saints of old, to <hi>take
joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods,
knowing in themſelves that they had
in heaven a better, and an enduring
ſubstance, Heb.</hi> 10. 34. 2. If it be
from loſſe of dear relations, and Gods
diſpleaſure apprehended therein; this
hope will quicken in you godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and endeavours to ſeek recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
and peace with God, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and faith in Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ. 6.
1.</hi> 2. It will purge out inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to the creatures, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3.
over-grieving for the loſſe of creature-comforts
ariſeth from over-joying in
creature-contentments. 3. If it be
from bodily weakneſſe, or ſickneſſe,
or pain, or any diſtemper, that renders
a man unſerviceable in his place; this
hope, being rightly exerciſed, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll
moderate that ſorrow. 1. By bringing
a ſpiritual light into the ſoul, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it to receive comfort. For the
body is compared to an houſe, and to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58315:68"/>
a garment. Hence they can argue,
<hi>à pari,</hi> the more worn and tattered
the garment is, the ſooner we ſhall
have a new one. So it is with the ſoul
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43, 44. And the more
crazy and weak the houſe, or rather,
the priſon is, the nearer the priſoner is
to be delivered from it. So it is with
the ſoul impriſoned in this earthly
houſe of the body, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. &amp;c.</hi>
2. By quickning us unto thoſe duties
which ſuch a condition cals for, <hi>viz.</hi>
Patience, paſſive obedience, quitneſſe,
contentedneſſe, prayer, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 39.
9,</hi> 10. 4. If it be from ſin, in our
ſelves, or others, or in our families
and near relations; this hope will be
of neceſſary uſe to keep the ſoul from
being ſwallowed up with over-much
ſorrow. He that grieves for ſin, muſt
grieve in hope. For a vexing, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging,
deſpairing grief will do no
good, but much hurt, as you may
ſee, in <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 12. and <hi>Ezek. 33. 10,
11.</hi> But that ſorrow for ſin which is
accompanied with hope of mercy,
quickneth to prayer of faith, <hi>Iob 7.
20.</hi> and to reformation, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 2, 3
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58315:68"/>
5. If it be from an apprehenſion that
God is your enemy, and fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you, as he is and doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 10. this hope is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
uſe; whether your apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be right, or wrong. If it be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it will quicken you to make all
ſpeed to be reconciled unto God, in
Chriſt. Hereunto this hope encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth:
1. From the mercy and grace
of God in forgiving repenting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. 2. From his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe
to deal ſo with you, declared
ſundry wayes. 1. By ſending his Son
to make attonement for loſt ſinners.
2. By ſending his Embaſſadours to
beſeech you to be reconciled unto him,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. 3. By his never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
Rebels, that ſought his favour
in Chriſt, upon Goſpel terms. 4. By
his commanding us to forgive ſuch as
repent, though they have ſinned againſt
us unto ſeventy times ſeven times; and
himſelf will not be behind us in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and kindneſſe. 2. But if it be not
ſo indeed; if God be not our enemy;
this hope will awe the ſoul from
wronging God, by our miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58315:69"/>
It is an injury to a man, that
is our friend, and hath approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo to be, by many kindneſſes, if
we ſhould charge him with enmity,
and ſay to him, you do not love me,
you hate me, you are mine enemy,
when you cannot prove it. Hoping in
God will arme the ſoul againſt ſuch
concluſions, by former experiences
of ſundry effects of Gods favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, in pardoning ſome ſins,
ſubduing ſome luſts, healing ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
ſcattering ſome temptations,
working ſome ſpiritual good in you;
as, faith in the Lord Jeſus, and love
to all the ſaints, granting ſome pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Say not, I know not, whether
God hath done thus, in mercy and
favour toward me, and whether he will
continue them unto me, or not; for
theſe are Covenant mercies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſure mercies, even <hi>the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of David, Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. Every
anſwer of prayer, every gift of grace,
that makes the more prayerful, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
watchful, thankful, ſerviceable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to God and man, that leads the ſoul to
God, in Chriſt, is from his fatherly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58315:69"/>
goodneſſe and love to thee in Chriſt.
Say not, if God were my Father, I
ſhould ſee his face, but he hides his
face from me; For that doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
follow. Sometimes children
are infants, and know not their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though he acts for them, as a
father. Sometimes grown children
ſee not their father, many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet reſt in his fatherly love and
care for them. So God will have his
ſtronger children, many times, <hi>to
walk by faith and not by light, 2 Cor.
5.</hi> 7. Sometimes the child, being
forth at School, or at Prentiſhip, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
earneſtly to come home and ſee
his father, but the father ſees it to be
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>dient, at that time, to grant
his requeſt. But he will ſend him a
letter, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, a meſſenger, or ſome
friend to viſit him, he ſhall ſee him,
in them, not in his perſon. So God
deals, many times, with his children,
who deſire to ſee his face, to have
ſenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le demonſtrations of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and love to them. They ſhall ſee
him, in his letters the Scriptures, and
the Promiſes, or in ſome token of his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58315:70"/>
love, ſome <hi>ſtrength in their ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Pſal.</hi> 138. 3. or, in ſome <hi>meſſenger,
Job</hi> 33. 23. whom he ſends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them, and his ſpirit to quicken
and ſtrengthen them to wait upon
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But where the Spirit is,
there are the fruits of the Spirit, and,
among the reſt, joy, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. which
I want.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Take a believer, at the
worſt, he hath that joy which he
would not part with, in exchange,
for the jocondneſſe of worldly men.
2. He hath true joy, through faith,
even when he is <hi>in heavineſſe, for a
time, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8. he hath it, in the
root, when it doth not ſprout forth in
leaves, becauſe it is winter with him.
He who deſires ſpiritual joy, and
grives for the want of it, hath true joy,
in ſome degree; as that man, from
faith, bewailed his unbelief, <hi>Mark
9.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>The ſecond way, whereby this hope
boundeth and moderateth ſorrow, is,
by ſtrengthening the ſoul to ſtick to
right g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounds of true comfort, to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58315:70"/>
maintain their joy in God, through
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not yielding up their purſe to
every thief, nor ſuffering themſelves
to be wrangled out of their right in it.
If exceſſive ſorrow begins to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſoul of a believer; this hope
will 1. Quicken him to examine its
commiſſion, by parlying with his
ſoul, and enquiring whether there be
good reaſon, a ſufficient cauſe, for it, or
not, as <hi>David</hi> did, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5. 11.
and 43. 5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O
my ſoul, &amp;c.</hi> For ſometimes your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is cauſeleſſe, and groundleſſe, and
commonly it is ſo: 1. When it is
boundleſſe. For reaſon will ſet bounds
unto grief, but miſtakes, and miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
know no bounds. 2. When
it is plea-leſſe, being tried at the bar
of right reaſon, or of the judgment
of thoſe who are godly-wiſe. <hi>Job</hi> in a
paſſion, challenged God himſelf to
diſpute, and gives him his choiſe,
whether he will oppoſe, or anſwer, he
will be for him, and fill his mouth
with Arguments, and doubts not that
he ſhall carry the cauſe. But, when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58315:71"/>
God appeared, and ſpake to him,
<hi>Jobs</hi> paſſion vaniſhed, and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
failed, and he confeſſed that he
had ſpoken fooliſhly, and would
now lay his hand upon his mouth.
Compare <hi>Job</hi> 23. 3, 4, 5. with <hi>Chap.
40.</hi> 4, 5. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 42. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So
ſometimes a dejected diſcouraged
Chriſtian thinks he hath ſo much to
ſay againſt his comfort, as will put to
ſilence the beſt and ableſt Miniſters.
But when any judicious Miniſter, or
experienced Chriſtian, comes to him,
he hath either nothing to ſay, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of weight, but what is full of
errour and miſtakes. Say therefore
to your felves, in this caſe, as God
did to <hi>Ionah, Doeſt thou well to be
angry?</hi> Do I well to be thus dejected?
2. If there be cauſe for ſorrow: 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
whether it be ſufficient to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
ſuch a meaſure or degree of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or not. That ſorrow, which
drives the ſoul from God, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſeth
it to prayer, thankſ-giving,
to the duties of his calling, to works
of mercy and love, that makes him
lumpiſh, harſh, paſſionate, that ſowres
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58315:71"/>
and diſtempers his ſpirit, is exceſſive
and immoderate. 2. Examine from
what Topicks the Arguments are
fetched, that are uſed to juſtifie ſuch a
degree of ſorrow. The ſoul of man
ſhould not be ſubjected to ſenſe and
feeling, or to any way of reaſoning,
but that which is from and according
to the Word of God. To argue, that
you have no faith, becauſe you are
full of doubting, that you have no
grace, becauſe you have ſtrong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
is to <hi>offend againſt the
generation of Gods children, Pſal.
73.</hi> 15. the vanity whereof <hi>Aſaph</hi>
ſaw, when he went into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
of God. So will you, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the Scriptures. 3. Fly <hi>to the God
of all comfort, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 3. Firſt iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
that great queſtion, Am I Gods
Child, or not? If not; reſt not in
that ſtate, but haſten out of it. If
yea, and thou art ſo, if thou haſt his
Image; then ſet faith on work:
1. Upon Gods all -ſufficiency, and
fetch all from heaven, which thou
wanteſt on earth. 2. Upon his Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58315:72"/>
1. Recal to mind what he
hath done for thee in times paſt, as
<hi>Aſaph</hi> did, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 5, 6. 2. For the
future; reſt on his bare word, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
which ſhewes what he will do.
Account that to be thine, which thou
haſt in grant by the promiſe, as <hi>David</hi>
did, <hi>Pſal. 60. 7. God hath ſpoken in
his holineſſe, I will rejoice, &amp;c. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
is mine, &amp;c.</hi> Thus apply what
Chriſt ſaith, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 4. 5. and
the Scripture every where. 3. For
the preſent; conſider what God doth
for thee. Doth he ſupport thee, that
thou ſinkeſt not under deſpair? Doth
he keep thee in patience, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to his will by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>? Doth he
quicken thee to uſe all good means,
with waiting upon him? Give him
the glory of his grace, and be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to ſpread before him, in prayer, all
thy doubts, thy fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and wants, <hi>Phil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4. 6. and, with
prayer, joyn hoping in him, and
waiting on him. Say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

to help; though I find no comfort, yet,
I hope, I ſhall; though my prayers be

in the beſt ſeaſon, and I will wait on

Ordinances, as <hi>David, I will hearken
what at God the Lord will ſpeak, Pſal.

uſe the communion of the Saints, in
private alſo; but ſo, as waiting for
his manifeſting himſelf to your ſoul,
as the Church found he did, in <hi>Cant.
5.</hi> 8. and 6. 3. And, if thou canſt not
find out what particular hinders thy
comfort, do as men uſe to do for their
bodies, when the diſtemper is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
who make an iſſue, to draw the
matter to ſome head; pitch upon ſome
particular ſin, to which thou art moſt
ſubject, by natural inclination, or by
thy calling, or company, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the times, and let out the
corruption that may. Begin repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
there, and joyn with it faith in
the blood of Chriſt, and ſo ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58315:73"/>
with God, and comfort
thereby. In thus doing, wait on God,
till he ſatisfie thy thirſty ſoul, who
hath promiſed, that <hi>they, who wait
on the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength;
they ſhall mount up upon wings, as
Eagles; they ſhall run, and not be
weary, and they ſhall walk, and not
faint, Iſa.</hi> 40. 31.</p>
            <p>The ſecond caſe, whereon believers
are called to exerciſe this hope, in their
perſonal concernments, is, in reference
to the time paſt, the ſeeming fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſappointment of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
expectations. For, having pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and waited for the good deſired,
yet they have not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tained it. And
many, when they have given up their
names unto Chriſt, looked for peace,
proſperity, and good dayes, but
find troubles, croſſes and afflictions
of ſundry kinds; this much diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and ſometimes diſcourageth their
ſpirits. Hence, they are apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
with the Church, in <hi>Jer. 8. 15.
We looked for peace, but no good came,
and for a time of health, and behold
trouble;</hi> and, to conclude, as they did,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58315:73"/>
in <hi>Iſa. 49. 14. Zion ſaid, the Lord
hath forſaken me, and my Lord hath
forgotten me.</hi> In this caſe, that may be
made for a right exerciſe of hoping in
God, I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of it.<note place="margin">Quoſdam deſerit, quoſdam deſerere videtur. Amb. in Pſal. 118.</note> 1.

Apoſtates, that depart from the rules

are others, whom God doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake,
really, but onely ſeemingly, and
that, but in ſome reſpect, and, but for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58315:74"/>
a time. And that he is preſent with
them graciouſly, when they think he
hath forſaken them, appeareth by his
efficacy in them. 1. That he quickens
them to ſeek him in the uſe of all
means, <hi>Pſal. 9. 10. For thou, Lord,
haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee.</hi>
2. That they ſeek him, as their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as their chief good, without
injoyment of whom nothing will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them. This is from the efficacy
of his grace in them, as it was in the
Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6, 8, 10.
3. That Gods with-drawing from
them, in any degree, makes them
fearful of his forſaking them utterly,
and, for prevention thereof, careful
to engage themſelves to obey him
more perfectly. Thus it wrought in
<hi>David, Pſal. 119. 8. I will keep thy
Statutes, O forſake me not utterly!</hi>
Theſe are the perſons, who are called
to exerciſe hope in God, in this caſe.
To inſtruct them how to perform this
great duty aright, I ſhall propound

            <p>1. <hi>Direction.</hi> Make it clear unto

in God is right. For this hope is the
daughter of faith. And, if you are in
the dark, as to preſent ſight of your
good eſtate; conſider whether former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when you had a clear light, you
then knew that your ſoul ſaid, <hi>the
Lord is my portion.</hi> For it may be, at
ſometimes, with a true believer, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
as it was with <hi>Eutychus,</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 10. that, though
life is in him, yet he hath not the
ſenſe of it. Then, though Gods face
is towards him, yet he complains
that he hath long hid his face from
him; as <hi>David</hi> did, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. 1.
and, if his Miniſters ſpeak comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to him; it is with him as it was
with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake as comfortably unto them
as at any time, but they hearkened not
unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for anguiſh of heart,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 9. and, when <hi>he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
God, he is troubled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth,
and his ſpirit is over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
as <hi>Aſaph</hi> found, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 3.
In this caſe, faith it ſelf muſt be
helped, by reflecting upon former
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58315:75"/>
experience. This courſe <hi>Aſaph</hi> took,
and found relief by it, <hi>ibid. ver.</hi> 5, 6.

            <p>2. <hi>Direction.</hi> When thus the ground
of hope is cleared to be good, and
way is made for the excerciſe of it;
then let it be exerciſed, in its purging
work. This is the firſt uſe, wherein
hope is to be improved, in this caſe.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58315:76"/>
For, <hi>every man that hath this hope in
him, purifieth himſelf, even as
Chriſt is pure, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 3. Elſe, that
which now hindreth your comfort and
peace, will hinder them, till it be
taken away. Sin is the great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all our good. This therefore
muſt be the firſt work of this hope, the
purging away of ſin. Therefore the
Church in my Text, took that courſe:
Saying, <hi>Let us ſearch and try our
wayes, and turn again to the Lord,
ver.</hi> 40. Do ye the like, in a like
caſe, and, that you may do ſo, follow
theſe Directions. 1. Pray the Lord to
ſhew wherefore he contendeth with
you, <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 2. with purpoſe of heart
to forſake whatever ſin provoketh him
to anger. This was <hi>Elihu's</hi> counſel to
<hi>Iob.</hi> Surely, ſaith he, <hi>It is meet to be

I will not offend. That which

34.</hi> 31, 32. Pray him alſo, to ſhew you
what he would have you to do, as
<hi>David</hi> prayed, in <hi>Pſal. 86. 11. Teach
me thy way, O Lord, I will walk in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58315:77"/>

<hi>Ephraim</hi> found the benefit of this

of their former unſubduedneſſe to
Gods will and yoak, and of their
prayer, <hi>Turn thou me, and</hi> I <hi>ſhall

Jer.</hi> 31. 18. What benefit had <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi>
hereby? They tell that, in <hi>ver. 19.
Surely after I was turned, I repented
and, after that</hi> I <hi>was inſtructed.</hi> I
<hi>ſmote upon my thigh, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Having
thus done, ſearch the Scripture, and
your own hearts, to find out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſin, or ſins, which have brought
this affliction upon you, or which
do hinder the exerciſing of your hope.
1. To find out the particular ſin or
ſins, which have brought the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon you; conſider, 1. For what
ſins God hath threatned, in his Word,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58315:77"/>
or inflicted upon others, ſuch judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as are upon you, <hi>Ezek. 12. 25.
Jer. 26. 4, 5, 6. Zeph.</hi> 3. 6, 7. 2.
How you have abuſed thoſe things
wherein or wherby God afflicteth you.
<hi>Eli,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were too indulgent
to their children, and were puniſhed
in them and by them. <hi>Iſrael</hi> abuſed
the corn and wine, the wool and flax,
the ſilver and gold that God had given
them. Therefore God took them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 8, 9. God cauſed the
land to keep the Sabbaths, while the
Jews were in Captivity, for their not
ſanctifying the Sabbaths, in their own
land. And for their lightly eſteeming
the Word preached unto them, the
Lord brought a famine of the Word
upon them, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11. There is
now much ſickneſſe and mortality
among us, did you not miſ-ſpend your
time, and ſtrength, in the dayes of
your health? ſundry are reſtrained
from the publick Ordinances; Is it
not, becauſe they have diſregarded
them, or been unfruitful and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
under them? 3. Search, if you
have not been faulty towards others, in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58315:78"/>
the things you now ſuffer your ſelves.
<hi>They that ſpoiled and dealt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly</hi>
with others, <hi>ſhall be ſpoiled
and dealt treacherouſly with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
Iſa 33. 1. He that leadeth
into Captivity, ſhall go into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
he that killeth with the ſword
muſt be killed with the ſword, Rev.
13. 10. He ſhall have judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy that hath ſhewed no mercy,
Jam.</hi> 2. 13. Do others wrong you,
in your names, in your eſtates, in any
of their dealings with you? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how you have wronged others.
Are others helpleſſe and hard-hearted
towards you, in your afflictions? If
upon ſearch you find, that you have
been ſo to others, give God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his righteouſneſſe, ſaying, with
<hi>Adonibeſek, as I have done, ſo hath
God requited me, Judg.</hi> 1. 7. 4. If
you have not profited by afflictions
formerly upon you; you may juſtly
ſuſpect that he reneweth, and, it may
be, increaſeth your afflictions, for
that cauſe. For ſo the Lord threatned
his people of old, <hi>If ye will not for
all this (viz.</hi> former leſſer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58315:78"/>
inflicted on you) <hi>hearken unto
me, then will</hi> I <hi>puniſh you ſeven times
more for your ſins, Lev.</hi> 26. 18. and
the ſame he repeats again and again,
four or five times, in that Chapter.
And he did accordingly, when the
people of <hi>Iſrael turned not unto him
that ſmote them,</hi> the Prophet told
them, <hi>for all this, his anger is not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away, but his hand is ſtretched
out ſtill, Iſa.</hi> 9. 12. and it is thrice
repeated, in that Chapter. So hath
the Lord dealt with us, in this place;
for ſundry years paſt, he hath viſited
us with returns of ſickneſſes, every
following year ſharper than the former;
becauſe whatever purpoſes men and
women had, and whatever promiſes
they made, when Gods hand was upon
them, all wore off and came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
after he had releaſed them: So
that we, in this wilderneſſe, may be
juſtly charged for dealing with God,
as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
and have cauſe to expect, as
they found from the Moſt High, <hi>Pſal.
78.</hi> 32. to 38. In this caſe, God
dealeth with his people, as Phyſitians
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58315:79"/>
are wont to do with their patients, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom when they find that the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
formerly given doth not work,
they ſecond it with ſome ſtronger
purge; and, when they find that the
diſeaſe is ſo ſetled, that quicker courſes
are not effectual; they preſcribe a
courſe of longer continuance. 5. Search,
to find out your own ſpecial corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the ſinnes of your nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
you are naturally, that is, by your
natural conſtitutions, more addicted
and inclined, then unto other; the
fins of your callings, that is, ſuch
as whereunto, by occaſion of your
place and vocation, or your courſe of
life and converſation, you may have
more and more frequent occaſions of,
and greater and ſtronger inducements,
and inticements to, then others, and
the ſins of the times and places in
which you live. This courſe <hi>David</hi>
took, and thereby proved that he was
upright before God, <hi>Pſal. 18. 23.
6.</hi> Call to mind of what ſins you have
been formerly admoniſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
publikely, by the Miniſters
of the Word, or privately, by godly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58315:79"/>
friends, and others; or ſecretly, by the
motions of Gods Spirit, and checks
of your own conſciences, but have
not repented of them, nor turned from
them. For it is Gods manner, to <hi>open
the ears of men, and to ſeal inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by afflictions,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> told <hi>Job,</hi>
though he miſ-applyed it to his caſe.
<hi>Iob</hi> 33. 14. to 30. 2. Having found
out the particular cauſes for which God
contendeth with you; add thereunto
another ſearch, to find out thoſe ſins
which hinder the exerciſe of this hope
more directly and immediately; as,
1. Your aptneſſe to have hard thoughts
of God. This is very injurious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonourable
to God, and therefore he
frequently in Scripture expoſtulateth
with and complaineth of his people for
it: As you may ſee in <hi>Ier. 2. 31. Ezek.
33. 10, 11. Mich. 6. 1, 2, 3. David</hi>
found out this evil, in himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of it; as you may ſee, in <hi>Pſal.
31.</hi> 22. and 116. 11, 12. 2. Your
aptneſſe to be ſhort ſpirited with God,
which is contrary to the waiting of
hope. This greatly incenſed the wrath
of God againſt his people of old, of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58315:80"/>
whom it is ſaid, in <hi>Pſal. 78. 40, 41.
How often did they provoke him, in the
Wilderneſſe, and grieve him in the
Deſart? yea, they turned back, and
tempted God, and limited the Holy
One of Iſrael.</hi> So do all they, whoſe
hoping in God ceaſeth, if he do not
grant them the particular thing which
they expect, and in their time, and
by their means. 3. Your unwarranted
expectations of good, without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of any evil; of peace, without
trouble; of health, without ſickneſſe;
of eaſe, without pain; of joy, without
ſorrow; of proſperous ſucceſſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
croſſes; which God hath no
where promiſed; but hath fore-told
the contrary every where in his
Word; that he <hi>will viſit our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
with the rod, and our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with ſtripes, Pſal. 89. 32. and
that we muſt through much tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enter into the Kingdom of God,
Acts</hi> 14. 22. and that <hi>whom the Lord
loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth
every ſon whom he receiveth, Heb. 12.
6.</hi> And the reaſon why Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
theſe things, is, <hi>that,</hi> when they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58315:80"/>
come to paſſe, <hi>we might not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi>
as himſelf ſaith, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.
1. and, that, <hi>when the time ſhall come,
we may remember that he told us of
them,</hi> as he ſaith, in <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 4. Your
aptneſſe to be ſlight ſpirited and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in retaining the favour of God,
and in maintaining the workings of
his Spirit in you. The former, the
Church found in themſelves and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
in <hi>Iſa. 64. 7. There is none
that calleth upon thy Name, that
ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of
thee.</hi> For the later, the Lord repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> though
he took notice of many good things
in them, and done by them: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
he tels them, that he hath
this againſt them, <hi>that they had left
their firſt love, Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4. and
commands them, <hi>Remember therefore
from whence thou art fallen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and do thy firſt works: Elſe I
will come unto thee quickly, &amp;c. ver.
5.</hi> 5. Be humbled for, and repent of
your fruſtrating of Gods expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the great provocation of God
to diſ-appoint your expectations.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58315:81"/>
Conſider, to this end, what God hath
done for us, and therefore doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from us, in that which the Lord
ſaid concerning the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 4, 5. and let us fear leſt our
unfruitfulneſſe, unprofitableneſſe, and
un-anſwerableneſſe to the means and
mercies received incenſe his wrath and
jealouſie againſt us more then againſt
others, for whom he hath not done ſo
much, as he hath done for us. For ſo
he determined concerning <hi>Iſrael; you
onely have I known of all the families
of the earth; therefore I will viſit
upon you all your iniquities, Amos
3.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>2. Having thus ſearched and tried
your wayes; the next duty is, to <hi>turn
again to the Lord,</hi> with unfeigned
repentance, and faith in the blood of
Chriſt, and amendment of life. This
was the fruit of <hi>Davids</hi> conſidering
his wayes, his turning his feet unto
Gods teſtimonies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 59.
Elſe you do but, as if a wounded man
ſhould cry to the Chyrurgeon for eaſe
of his pain, but will not endure to
have the arrow head, or ſplinter, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58315:81"/>
ſticks in his fleſh, plucked out. <hi>If I
regard iniquity in my heart,</hi> ſaid <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
the Lord will not hear my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. And the people of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> found that, when they did evil
as they could, and caſt off the thing
that is good, and yet prayed unto
God, as their God, he would not
own them, nor accept their prayers,
but upbraided them with their ſins; as
you may ſee, in <hi>Jer. 3. 4, 5. Hoſ. 8.
2,</hi> 3. Therefore the Church in my
Text took a right courſe to ſtrengthen
their hope in God, when they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon this order, firſt to ſearch and
try their wayes and turn again to the
Lord, and, after that, to lift up their
hearts, with their hands unto God in
the heavens, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40, 41. Theſe
things being done, that your hope
may act aright.</p>
            <p>3. The third Direction, which is
to be attended, that you may exerciſe
this hope, is to uſe this hope aright in
its ſecond work, for encouragement,
by your cheriſhing in your ſelves good
thoughts of Gods good purpoſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, and expectation of good
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58315:82"/>
from God ſuitable to your needs:
Hereunto the Lord encouraged the
repenting Jews, in their Captivity in
<hi>Bayblon, Jer.</hi> 29. 11. to <hi>15.</hi> Having
promiſed them that, at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
he would viſit them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his good towards them, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them to return, he acquainted
them with his good thoughts towards
them, as the reaſon of it, and what
he would work in them, to fit them
for that mercy; ſaying, <hi>For I know the
thoughts that I think towards you,
ſaith the Lord, thoughts of peace,
and not of evil, to give you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
end. Then ſhall ye call upon
me, and ye ſhall go, and pray unto
me, and ye ſhall ſeek me, and find
me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with
all your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
concerning Gods thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, by preſent ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but by his own word. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>David</hi> reſolved to <hi>hearken to what
God the Lord ſaith,</hi> not to what car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
reaſon and ſenſe would ſay, and
the reaſon of his ſo reſolving is drawn
from the expectation of his hope; <hi>for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58315:82"/>
he will ſpeak peace unto his people,
and to his Saints, Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. and
his expectation ſo grounded, was ſo
ſtrong, that he pleaded it with God,
ſaying, in <hi>Pſal. 119. 49, 50. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy word unto thy ſervant,
upon which thou haſt cauſed me to
hope. This is my comfort in my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for thy word hath quickened
me.</hi> And well may believers be
ſtrengthened in this hope, having it
built upon ſo firm a foundation, as
the word of God concerning which
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, in the ſame <hi>Pſal. ver.
89, 90. For ever O Lord, thy word
is ſetled in heaven. Thy ſaithfulneſſe
is unto all generations; thou haſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
the earth and it abideth.</hi> How
is the earth eſtabliſhed? we ſee, if
you caſt the leaſt ſtone upwards in the
aire, it abideth not there, but ſoon
fals down to the earth; yet the earth it
ſelf, though it is an huge, vaſt, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
body, abideth in the air, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it is ſurrounded, and wherein it
hangeth. How is this done? It hath
no pillars to hold it up, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
and Word of that mighty God,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58315:83"/>
who <hi>upholdeth all things by the Word
of his power, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. His power
accompanying his Word upholdeth
the earth in the middeſt of the air, and
ſhall it not ſupport our hearts, in the
middeſt of all temptations? If the
greatneſſe of your former ſins, of
which you have now repented, diſmay
you; remember what the word of the
Lord ſaith, in <hi>Iſa. 55. 7. Let the
wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
man his thoughts; and let
him return unto the Lord, and he
will have mercy upon him, and to
our God, for he will multiply to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
Say not, I cannot think that God
can have any good purpoſes and
thoughts toward ſuch a ſinful wretch
and rebel, as I have been. For, to
prevent this, the Lord addeth, in <hi>ver.
8, 9. My thoughts are not your
thoughts, neither are your waies my
waies, ſaith the Lord. For as the
heavens are higher than the earth, ſo
are my maies higher then your waies,
and my thoughts then your thoughts.</hi>
If the Lord, in the time of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
bring to your remembrance
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58315:83"/>
ſins formerly, many years paſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by you, but not repented of,
look at it, as an inſtruction, which
he joyneth with correction, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
you to repentance, as he did <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi>
brethren, when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to priſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. But, if
ſins committed before your calling, or
ſince, but repented of, be ſet before
you; do not think that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned,
or that the pardon is revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
or that God doth it to upbraid
you with them. God can, for holy
and good ends, read over to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
old bils of debt, which yet are
cancelled, to humble them, and to
make them more thankful, and more
watchful. Thus he made <hi>Job</hi> poſſeſſe
the ſins of his youth, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 26. And
if the Lord defer the full and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manifeſtation of his favour to
you, after you have repented; do not
impute that diſpenſation to his not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
your ſins, but to his fatherly
wiſdom and love, to excite you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to perfect your repentance unto the
full mortifying of your ſins. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
dealt with <hi>Abſalom,</hi> whom, though
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58315:84"/>
his heart was towards him, and, as a
token thereof, he ſent for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet he let him not
ſee his face, for two years after his
return, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 14, 28. So the
Lord dealt with <hi>David,</hi> he pardoned
his ſin. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. yet with-held
joy and gladneſſe from him, till he
had more thorowly repented, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
prayed that he would reſtore
to him the joy of his ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.
57.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Direction, is in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Gods delayes; if yet you find
not the good you ſeek then, exerciſe
your hope in its third work, which is,
waiting upon God. Hereunto the
Lord encouraged his people in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
by a Viſion, concerning their
deliverance, which the Prophet <hi>Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakuk</hi>
received from God, and of
which the Lord ſaid, <hi>The Viſion is yet
for an appointed time, but at the end
it ſhall ſpeak, and not lie; though it
tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will
ſurely come, it will not tarry, Hab:
2.</hi> 3. Set down this for a concluded
truth, which every true believer may
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58315:84"/>
reſt upon, that, <hi>the Lord will not caſt
off for ever, but, though he cauſe
grief, yet will he have compaſſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the multitude of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Lam.</hi> 3. 31, 32. And, that he
may do ſo, he waiteth for a fit ſeaſon.
For he is a God of judgment, as <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
ſaith, in <hi>Iſa. 30. 18. Therefore
will the Lord wait, that he may be
gracious unto you, and therefore will
he be exalted, that he may have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon you. For Iehovah is a God of
judgment. Bleſſed are all they that
wait for him.</hi> The Lord waits for a
time, wherein he ſhall be exalted in
being gracious unto his people. That
time is the time of their renewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and converſion unto God, as
to the Moſt High. Then God will
have the higheſt place in their hearts.
Pray that this may be wrought in you,
and that thereby you may be fitted for
the good you hope for, and wait for
it, till Gods time comes. For all they
are bleſſed that wait for him. They
are now bleſſed in their ſtate, and they
ſhall be bleſſed in their injoymens. In
the mean time, <hi>they that wait upon
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58315:85"/>
the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength;
they ſhall mount up with wings as
Eagles, they ſhall run, and not be
weary; they ſhall walk, and not faint.
Iſa.</hi> 40. 31.</p>
            <p>The fifth Direction is, in reference
to afflictions continuing upon you;
while God delayes his beſtowing the
good you wait for; exerciſe your hope
in its fourth work, which is patience.
Wait with patience, <hi>For, if we hope
for that we ſee not, then do we with
patience wait for it, Rom.</hi> 8. 25. It
is Chriſts precept, <hi>In your patience
poſſeſſe your ſouls, Luke</hi> 21. 19. As
faith gives us the poſſeſſion of Chriſt,
ſo patience gives us the poſſeſſion,
firſt, of our ſelves, and, then, of all
good things. <hi>Let patience have its
perfect work,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Iam.
1.</hi> 4. This it hath two wayes: 1. When
it puts forth perfect acts, whereunto
it ariſeth by certain ſteps. The firſt is
a ſilent ſubmiſſion, with a voluntary
reſignation of our ſelves to the will of
God. So <hi>David</hi> did, and ſaid, <hi>I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not my mouth, becauſe it was thy
doing, Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. The ſecond is, a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58315:85"/>
thankful acceptation of the affliction,
with, as it were, a kiſſing of the Rod,
where-with our heavenly Father cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
us. This is that, which, in a
ſoul truly humble, is called <hi>the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the puniſhment of his ſin, Lev.
26.</hi> 41. unto this ſtep <hi>Iobs</hi> patience
aſcended, who ſaid, when he had loſt
all his creature-poſſeſſions, <hi>The Lord
hath given, and the Lord hath taken,
and bleſſed be the Name of the Lord,
Iob</hi> 1. 21. The third, and higheſt
ſtep, is, to <hi>count it all joy, when ye
fall into divers temptations, Iam.</hi> 1. 2.
This is the higheſt ſtep, for perfecting
the actings of patience: Therefore he
addeth to that, <hi>Let patience have its
perfect work,</hi> to ſhew that then it
hath it. The ſecond way whereby
patience comes to have its perfect
work, is, when patience perſeveres
in acting. <hi>The good ground,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>is the honeſt and good heart,
that brings forth fruit with patience,
Luke</hi> 8. 15. where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
both patience and perſeverance. It
is not ſufficient to be patient in ſome
troubles, but it muſt be exerciſed in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58315:86"/>
all; nor, at ſometimes onely, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes;
and then onely and not elſe,
patience hath its perfect work, and
when patience hath its perfect work,
then every grace hath its perfect
work.</p>
            <p>The third caſe, wherein we are to
be inſtructed, how to exerciſe this
hope aright, in our private and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
concernments, is, in reference to
the times future. When fears of evils
to come diſquiet mens minds and
hearts, many ſecret miſ-givings of
heart are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncident even to true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
by reaſon of the fleſh remaining
in them, in part, that ſundry outward
afflictions, by croſſes, or loſſes of
deareſt relations, or of the means of
outward ſubſiſtence, or of liberty, or
of life, may befal them: or inward
temptations and ſins may prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them; which fears do uſually
diſ-ſweeten to them preſent mercies,
and accordingly hinder their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to God for them. Therefore the
inſtruction is of great importance, and
of continual uſe, which we are now
upon. For the more diſtinct handling
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58315:86"/>
whereof I ſhall endeavour to clear two
things. 1. Something concerning ſuch
fears. 2. How this hope is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
about them.</p>
            <p>1. For the firſt. Fear is an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
acted and exerciſed upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of ſome impendent and
approaching evil. This fear is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
culpable, ſometimes commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
1. Fear is culpable, and a ſin,
when it is oppoſite to truſting in God,
of this <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith; <hi>The fear of
man bringeth a ſnare; but who ſo
truſteth in the law ſhall be ſet on high,
Prov.</hi> 29. 5. He ſhall be ſet above the
reach of ſnares, and ſo be ſafe. This
fear may be known by three characters.
1. By its riſe, when it ariſeth from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
in Gods promiſes and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
This is an habitual, ruling, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
in all natural men; it is not ſo
in the regenerate; yet, by the ſtrength
of temptation, and the fleſh, in them,
it ſometimes prevailes actually. Hence
<hi>David</hi> diſcovered a ſuddain pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of his mind, by unadviſed
ſpeeches, which were diſhonourable
to God, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall periſh
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58315:87"/>
one day by the hand of Saul, 1 Sam.
27.</hi> 1. and, <hi>I ſaid in my haſt all men
are liars, Pſal.</hi> 116. 11. 2. By its
immediate object; whether, it be ſin,
or trouble. 1. Fear leaſt they ſhould
hereafter fall into ſuch or ſuch a ſin,
fixeth their thoughts upon ſin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares
them in ſin. It is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to propound to a mans ſelf any
thought of ſin, as ſin, eſpecially, of the
materials of ſin. For ſuch is mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and Satans ſubtilty, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of ſin in the thoughts, though
it be not done with any intent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, but to avoid it, defiles the ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men are aware. For ſin is a defiler,
and leaves a ſtain behind it, whereby
thoughts of ſin ſoon become ſinful
thoughts, and the ſpeculation of ſin
fals into ſpeculative acting ſin. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> warneth us, in
<hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 14. Saying, <hi>Every man is
tempted, when he is drawn aſide of
his own luſt, and enticed. Then, when
luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth
ſin, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Fear of future troubles
and ſufferings, ariſing from fore-think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, becomes blame-worthy,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58315:87"/>
three wayes. 1. When they imagine
ſuch as are never likely to befal them,
and are diſquieted with fears of them.
This is to fear ſhadowes; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
weakneſſe in the judgment, or
guilt in the conſcience. That may be
ſaid to ſuch truly, which <hi>Zebul</hi> ſpake
to <hi>Gaal</hi> skoffingly; <hi>Thou ſeeſt the
ſhadows of the mountains, as if they
were men, Judg.</hi> 9. 36. It is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for a puniſhment upon ſinners, in
<hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 36. aud executed upon
them, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 1. 2. When
they think of future evils, which are
but poſſible, and, at the moſt, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
with ſuch terror, as if they
were certain and inevitable; and ſo
give certain ſtrength to an uncertain
croſſe. This God reproveth, in <hi>Iſa. 57.
11.</hi> 3. When they multiply and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
evils, that are to be expected as
certainly future, above their duepropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo fear leſſer evils, as if
they were the greateſt evils. Chriſt
warned his Diſciples of this, in <hi>Mat.
10.</hi> 28. The third Character of ſuch
fears, is the evil effects of them.
1. <hi>Bondage,</hi> which is contrary to faith,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58315:88"/>
               <hi>Rom. 8. 15. 2. Torment,</hi> which is
contrary to love, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 8. 3. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,</hi>
from uſing good means
for the prevention of the thing feared.
Hence the diſtruſtful Jews rejected the
Prophets exhortation to converſion;
ſaying, <hi>if our tranſgreſſion, and our
ſins be upon us, and we pine away in
them; how ſhould we then live, Ezek.
33.</hi> 10. 4. Venturing upon the uſe of
unwarranted means to avoid the thing
feared; whereby they bring it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves. Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> fearing
that, if <hi>David</hi> lived, his poſterity
ſhould not ſucceed him in the throne,
ſought to kill him; and the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>
fearing that, if Chriſt were let alone,
all men would believe in him, and the
<hi>Romans</hi> would come, and take away
both their place and Nation; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that Chriſt muſt be put to death.
Both brought upon themſelves that
which they feared, by the wrath of
God againſt them, for uſing ill means
to avoid it. According to Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
denounced againſt all ſuch, in
<hi>Prov. 10. 24. The fear of the wicked
ſhall come upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:58315:88"/>
2. Fear is commendable, and good,
and our duty, when it hath hope in
Gods mercy joyned inſeperably with
it. Of this fear <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold,
the eye of the Lord is upon them that
fear him, upon them that hope in his
mercy, Pſal.</hi> 33. 18. Again, <hi>The
Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear
him; in thoſe that hope in his mercy,
Pſal.</hi> 147. 11. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lial reverential
fear of God may be known by three
Characters. 1. By the riſe of it; it
ariſeth from faith. <hi>By faith Noah
moved with fear prepared an ark,
Heb.</hi> 11. 7. 2. By the direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
object of it, which is God
himſelf. This was ſo eminent in
<hi>Izhack,</hi> that God hath a denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>Izhacks</hi> fear of him, he is
called <hi>the fear of Izhack, Gen. 31.
53.</hi> When others fear men, fear po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
fear diſgrace, a believer fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God, the Majeſty, Authority,
power of the great God is ſtrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his heart. This makes him careful
to worſhip God, according to his
revealed will, and to walk uprightly
before God, to honour, ſerve, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58315:89"/>
pleaſe him in his whole converſation,
and to ſeek the face of God in Jeſus
Chriſt. 3. By its effects, which are
ſuch as theſe: 1. It keeps from carnal
ſecurity, and placing our reſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in worldly things. Thus it
wrought in <hi>Job,</hi> whileſt he lived in
outward proſperity. Therefore he ſaid,
in his affliction; <hi>the thing that</hi> I <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feared is come unto me.</hi> I <hi>was not
in ſafety, neither had</hi> I <hi>reſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was</hi> I <hi>quiet, Job</hi> 3. 25, 26. and
from truſting in ſpiritual priviledges
and graces received; whereof <hi>Paul</hi>
warneth all Gentile-Chriſtians, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>be not high minded, but fear,
Rom.</hi> 11. 20. 2. It makes men care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to avoid what might provoke God
againſt them, and bring on them the
evil feared. Hence they fear and avoid
ſin, as a deadly ſnare. <hi>The fear of the
Lord, is a well-ſpring of life, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the ſnares of death, Prov.
14.</hi> 27. 2. Hardneſſe of heart, as a
miſchievous evil, <hi>Prov. 28. 14. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is the man that feareth alwayes,
but he that hardneth his heart, ſhall
fall into miſchief.</hi> 3. Departing from
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58315:89"/>
God, ſo ſaith God, <hi>I will put my fear
in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart
from me, Jer.</hi> 32. 46. 3. This fear quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
to uſe all good means to ſenſe our
ſelves againſt future evils; as fear of an
inundation cauſeth men to raiſe banks,
for keeping out the Sea, and, if a breach
be made; to repair it ſpeedily. Thus this
fear wrought in <hi>Jacob,</hi> when <hi>Eſau</hi>
came out againſt him; and in <hi>Noah,</hi> to
provide againſt the deluge; and in
thoſe <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> to keep themſelves
and their cattle in their houſes, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
the ſtorm, which <hi>Moſes</hi> fore-told
would kill all that were in the field.
The more we are prepared, by this fear,
for afflictions, before they come, the
leſſe we ſhall be oppreſſed with them,
when they come. For thereby, either
afflictions ſhall be weakned, and leſſe
able to hurt us, or we ſhall be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,
and more able to bear them.
Now, this hope, whereof we ſpeak,
being rightly excerciſed, will be of
great efficacy, to quicken good fear,
and to ſubdue ſinful fear in us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you
how you may excerciſe this hope aright,
in four Directions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:58315:90"/>
1. Lay a ſure ground-work for this
hope to be built upon. This is then
done, when you know that your ſoul
ſaith, the Lord is your portion. For,
1. This will aſſure your intereſt in
God himſelf, who is an all-ſufficient
portion. When you can ſay, with
<hi>David, The Lord is the portion of
mine inheritance and of my Cup,
Pſal.</hi> 16. 5. you may comfortably
adde, as he did, in <hi>ver. 6. The lines
are fallen unto me in pleaſant places:
yea, I have a goodly heritage.</hi> 2. This
will cauſe you <hi>to cleave to the Lord
with purpoſe of heart,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas</hi>
exhorted the <hi>Antiochians</hi> to do, in
<hi>Acts 11. 23. For where a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is, there will his heart be alſo,
Mat.</hi> 6. 21. As the needle in the
Compaſſe, being touched with the
Load-ſtone, is in continual motion,
till it points to the North; the reaſon
whereof, ſome conceive, is, becauſe
in the North are Rocks of Load-ſtone,
with which the needle ſo touched hath
a ſympathy: ſo the ſoul being touched
by the ſpirit of faith, is in continual
motion, till it points unto God in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58315:90"/>
Chriſt, that living Rock and true
Load-ſtone, who draws believers to
him by a ſpiritual ſympathy which
they have with him; as he ſaid in
<hi>Ioh. 12. 32. I, if</hi> I <hi>be lifted up from
the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi>
Then, and not before, they have true
reſt. Then they may ſay with <hi>David,
Return unto thy rest, O my ſoul!
Pſal.</hi> 116. 7. 3. This will ſettle and
ſtrengthen your hearts againſt all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting,
diſcouraging, diſtruſtful
fears about future evils. For, <hi>things to
come are yours,</hi> when <hi>you are Chriſts,
1 Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. The worſt that can
be-fall you, ſhall not looſe that bleſſed
union that is between God in Chriſt
and your ſouls. Not ſin paſt, for that
is already pardoned; and therefore
ſhall not condemn you hereafter,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. nor ſhall ſin to come, <hi>have
dominion over you, Rom.</hi> 6. 14. For
you <hi>are kept by the power of God,
through faith, unto ſalvation, 1 Pet.
1.</hi> 5. Nor death, though it may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
two neer friends, the ſoul and
body; yet it ſhall joyn together more
fully and perfectly two better friends,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58315:91"/>
Chriſt and the ſoul, which, when it is
abſent from the body, is preſent with
the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. and, in the
Reſurrection, when both ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united,
<hi>we ſhall be for ever with the
Lord, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17. Nor tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
See how <hi>Paul</hi> triumphed over
all principalities and powers, over life
and death, over things preſent and to
come, in aſſurance that nothing ſhould
ſeparate him, or any true believer, from
the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom. 8.
38,</hi> 39. yea, <hi>that all things ſhould work
for his &amp; their good, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
in Chriſt is as ſure of the time to
come, as he is of the time preſentor paſt.
For he can ſay, with the Church, in <hi>Pſ.
48. ult. This God is our God, and he will
be our guid unto death;</hi> and can look
unto Chriſt, as <hi>Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the ending, which is and
which was, and which is to come, the
Almighty, Rev.</hi> 1. 8. and he hath the
promiſes of God in Chriſt for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Iſa. 46. 3, 4. Joh.</hi> 10. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>2. This ground work being well
laid, build upon it, for the future, by
excerſing this hope, 1. In its purging
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58315:91"/>
work, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. to purge out inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
affection, whereby the ſoul
cleaves cloſe and faſt to preſent things
and creatures, whence, they are as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to part with them, as one is to
have a piece of linnen cloth or plaiſter
plucked off from an ulcerous ſore,
whereunto it ſticketh ſo faſt, that it
can hardly be pulled away without
great pain, and without drawing the
skin and part of the fleſh with it;
whereas if that ulcerous matter were
purged, and the ſore healed, the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
would fall off it ſelf, and the cloth
might be taken away, without any
pain or difficulty. Hoping in God,
being rightly excerciſed, worketh this
great cure, by rectifying mens appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
concerning the creatures,
and ordering their affections aright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, looking at both with the
eye of faith, by Scripture light, which
repreſents all things, out of God in
Chriſt, when they become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of our hope, as vain, and ſinful
and hurtful. The creatures are good,
as they come out of Gods hand, but
as they are abuſed, by being idolized,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58315:92"/>
they become vain, and degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nothing. For as <hi>an idol is nothing in
the world, 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 4. nothing,
which men account it to be, not to
be truſted in. So, creature are but vain
and empty, like thoſe blaſted eares of
corn, in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream, unleſſe
God fils them with his bleſſing. It is a
common errour and deluſion, to think
that, if you had ſuch friends, ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
ſuch eſtates, &amp;c. you ſhould
live happily and comfortably. For, as
<hi>David</hi> ſaid of an horſe, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to getting the victory, <hi>an horſe
is a vain thing:</hi> So we may ſay of all
creatures being ſeparated from God,
in reference to happineſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
they are vain things to be truſted
in, for which Chriſt called that rich
man a fool, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19, 20. 2. It
is a ſin againſt the firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to give the honour which is due
to God alone, unto any creature, as
men do that glory in them, <hi>Jer. 9.
23,</hi> 24. and <hi>ſet their hearts upon
them, Pſal.</hi> 62. 10, 11. This <hi>is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
Col.</hi> 3. 5. It is Atheiſme, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of Gods all-ſufficiency, which is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58315:92"/>
his peculiar glory, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of upright walking in the Saints,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Its the cauſe of all ſins.
The Schoolmen do rightly define ſin
to be an averſion of the ſoul from the
immutable God and turning of it to
the mutable creature. For all ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
an over-valuing of the creatures,
and an under-valuing of God. See
with what indignation God reproves
this ſin, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13, 14. 3. Thus
to cleave unto preſent things, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is very hurtful to your ſelves.
For, 1. It ſteals mens hearts from
God (as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſtole the hearts of
the people from <hi>David) unto things
that cannot profit, nor deliver, for
they are vain, 1 Sam.</hi> 12. 25. 2. It
provoketh God to with-draw and
with-hold his concourſe and bleſſing
from the creatures, without which you
cannot have any good from them, nor
by them; your own experience may
convince you of this. For hence it is
that the creatures work unequally, not
alwayes one way; friends and other
things, ſometimes comfort us, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
afflict us. Phyſick could not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58315:93"/>
cure <hi>Aſa,</hi> becauſe he truſted in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
more than in God; that all may
ſee, creatures cannot of themſelves
do us any good, but as God worketh
by them, and with them, whoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
glory it is to <hi>do good or evil,
Iſa.</hi> 41. 23. 3. It provokes God to
hide his face from you; and then,
though your mountain ſtand, you will
not have peace, as <hi>David</hi> found, in
<hi>Pſal. 30. 6;</hi> 7. Yea, to fill you with
terrours in the middeſt of your jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as he did <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> in <hi>Dan.
5.</hi> yea, to reject your prayers, in the
day of your diſtreſſe, and to ſend you
to your Idols for help, as he did thoſe,
in <hi>Judg. 10. 13, 14. For they that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
lying vanities, forſake their
own mercies, Jon.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>3. The third direction is, to excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
this hope in its quickening work.
For this hope <hi>is a lively hope, 1 Pet.
1.</hi> 3. it, being quickened by the <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making
ſpirit,</hi> hath lively operations
and efficacy, in the ſouls of believers
to quicken true child-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ike <hi>fear of God</hi>
in them, which is <hi>the beginning of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Prov.</hi> 1. 7. for, though know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58315:93"/>
and faith go before it, yet there
is no true wiſdom in either of them,
unleſſe they work in a man this fear.
This fear will make us ſtand in aw of.
God, when we ſee the effects of his
wrath upon others. So it wrought in
<hi>David,</hi> when he ſaw <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> ſmitten
dead, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6, 9. and when he
ſaw that God did put away the wicked
as droſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 12. and in all, that
heard of the dreadful ſtroke of Gods
vengeance upon <hi>Ananiah</hi> and <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
in <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 5. 10, 11. It will make
men <hi>tremble at his word, Iſa.</hi> 66. 2.
at the commands of the word, leſt
they ſhould diſobey them; at the
threatnings of the word; leſt they
ſhould fall under them, 2 <hi>Kings 22.
19.</hi> at the promiſes of the word; leſt
they ſhould fall ſhort of them, <hi>Heb.
4.</hi> 1. This fear breeds care, and
quickens to ſelf-humbling, <hi>putting
his mouth in the duſt, if there may
be hope, Lam.</hi> 3. 29. and to ſpeedy
reformation; as we ſee in that ſpeech
of <hi>Shecaniah</hi> unto <hi>Ezra, Ezra. 10.
2,</hi> 3. and to fervent prayer, as we ſee
it wrought in <hi>Jacob, Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58315:94"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. and <hi>Hezekiah, Jer.</hi> 26. 19.
and the King and people of <hi>Niniveh,
Jon.</hi> 3. 5. and the Prophet <hi>Habba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk,
Hab.</hi> 3. 16. It quickens belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to ſeek acceſſe unto God by the
Mediator, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 27, 28. 29. and
therefore to flie unto Chriſt, as chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
get under the wings of the hen,
in affrightments, and to truſt in God,
through Chriſt, and in his word. So
it wrought in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 56. 3.
Laſtly, it quickens us to <hi>fear the Lord
and his goodneſſe, Hoſ.</hi> 3. 5. it will
not ſuffer men to be wanton upon the
goodneſſe of God, to ſlight his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to do evil, becauſe God is
good; or to ſin, that grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound:
but it will cauſe them to fear
the Lord and his goodneſſe, fear to
offend his goodneſſe. The goodneſſe
of God will ſtrongly ingage their
hearts to walk cloſely and uprightly
with God.</p>
            <p>4. The fourth Direction is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe
this hope in its encouraging
and ſtrengthening work, to eſtabliſh
and ſettle our hearts againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
diſtruſtful fears: 1. Of evil
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58315:94"/>
tidings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 1, 7. 2. Of evil
times; when all things are turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
down, and the mountains, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and great Potentates, render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
terrible to the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and the prophane multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
rage againſt them, like the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the waters, and they can have
no reſt in their dwellings; yet they
the Church and people of God ſhall
have ſweet refreſhments, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
and Ordinances, as they of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
had by the waters of <hi>Siloah,</hi>
and ſafety, by the protection of God,
who is their refuge, and a preſent help
in times of trouble; as it is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſſed, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 3. Of the
proſperity and oppoſition of evil men,
againſt which <hi>David</hi> comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by hoping in God, <hi>Pſal. 49. 5.
16.</hi> and, upon his experience encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
all believers to take the ſame
courſe, <hi>Pſal. 27. 1, 2, 3, 13, 14.
4.</hi> Of whatever may or can befal them,
in this World, <hi>Pſal. 91. 1, &amp;c,</hi> For,
1. God is graciouſly preſent with
them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. Therefore they
may be confident of ſafety againſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58315:95"/>
evil, as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 4.
Though armies ſhould ſurround them,
as the <hi>Syrians</hi> did <hi>Eliſha,</hi> they have
no cauſe of diſcouraging fears; for,
if the Lord open the eyes of their
faith, they may ſee an inviſible guard
of Angels about them, as <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
ſaw about his Maſter, 2 <hi>Kings 6.
15.</hi> 2. They are dear to God, as the
<hi>apple of his eye, Zach.</hi> 2. 8. 3. All
future events are in Gods, not their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
not in their own hands, <hi>Pſal.
31.</hi> 15. 4. They have the ſure word
and promiſes of God, for them, <hi>Iſa.
41.</hi> 10, 11, 12. and 43. 1, 2. 5. God
is, in all the changes that paſſe over
them, unchangeable, as in himſelf,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. ſo in his love to them,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. and in his faithfulneſſe in
his promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. 4. to whom
they are called to commit their ſouls in
well doing, as into the hands of a
faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. doing
their own duties, and leaving events
to God, as <hi>Jacob Gen. 43. 14. Heſt.
4.</hi> 16. and they in <hi>Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond caſe, wherein we are
to be inſtructed how to excerciſe this,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58315:95"/>
in reference to the publick ſtate of the
Churches of Chriſt under perſecution,
and the oppreſſion of enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to be ſpoken to. Which that I
may the more diſtinctly and fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare;
I ſhall indeavour to cleer two
things: 1. What the preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the Proteſtant Churches,
throughout <hi>Europe</hi> is. 2. How we
may and ought to excerciſe this hope,
in reference thereunto.</p>
            <p>1. To clear the firſt, I ſhall give
you a true Narrative of the Proteſtant
Churches, in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſingly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
conſidered, as I have received
it from a faithful
and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
hand.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Duries</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the ſtate of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </note> 1.
the Churches in
<hi>Poland, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,
Moravia,
Anſtria,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia,</hi>
which were, not long ſince,
many and flouriſhing, are now whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſſipated and waſted. 2. Though
ſome Churches remain in <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
and <hi>Hungary,</hi> yet they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be ruined by any advantage of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58315:96"/>
power which the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
may get againſt them. 3. In <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
the Churches are ſo divided, and
the Proteſtant States are ſo diſtracted,
that, not onely all concurrences in a
common way, for their mutual edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and preſervation are hindred;
but alſo, as the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party, by
their contentious miniſtry, hath ſet it
ſelf to deſtroy the reſt, ſo God hath
ſuffered their chief Protectors, the
Kings of <hi>Sweeon</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> to
deſtroy each other. And the Electors
of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
the ſafety of their Churches,
do ſerve the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> deſign againſt
the Proteſtant intereſt. Nor is there
any conſiderable Prince in <hi>Germany,</hi>
except the <hi>Landsgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> that
is able to do any thing of moment to
maintain that intereſt. 4. In the Low
Couutreys; their preſent actings tend
rather to ſerve the enemies deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Proteſtant Intereſt, then for
it. 5. In <hi>France,</hi> the Proteſtant
Churches are deprived of their former
priviledges. So that their ſtanding is
a meer toleration, at pleaſure. 6. In
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58315:96"/>
               <hi>Geneva,</hi> we are informed, from other
hands, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would
impoſe a Governour and a Biſhop up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, or, in caſe, of their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
threatens to beſiege them; and
that the King of <hi>France</hi> refuſeth to
protect them, unleſſe they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Biſhop. 7. In the vallies of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emont;</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> doth ſtill
moſt cruelly, though not openly, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
and vex the Proteſtants, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the peace made with
them; by giving them up to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Popiſh Inquiſition, which
threatens their utter ruin, if God
doth not prevent it. 8. In <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Pope and the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi>
have ſtirred up and hired the Popiſh
Cantons to break their fundamental
League with the Proteſtants, by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
to death or baniſhment all ſuch
as leave their ſuperſtitions to become
Proſelytes to us. 9. How it is with
our native Countrey, <hi>England,</hi> and
thoſe conjoyned with it, in <hi>Scotland</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> you have formerly
heard, in part, and may have more
hereafter. 2. If we add hereunto the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58315:97"/>
great advantages which the Popiſh
party hath againſt the Proteſtants, and
what poſture the Proteſtant Churches
are in, in reſpect of their mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
each to other, to oppoſe this
combination of their enemies, ſo
ſtrongly and univerſally laid; it will
be manifeſt that the Antichriſtian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had never ſo great advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Churches of Chriſt, ſince
the Reformation began, as now they
have. For, 1. Whereas formerly the
Popiſh parties were divided, now,
their differences being compoſed, they
are all united in one common deſign
againſt the Proteſtant Religion and
Churches; and their head, the Pope,
doth manage their common intereſt
with much ſubtlety and vigour, and
that openly, by innumerable Agents
and Emiſſaries, who are ſubordinate
to <hi>the Congregation de propaganda fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
who creep into all Proteſtant
States and profeſſions, to obſerve any
diſtance or diviſions among them, to
widen and foment the ſame in the
minds of the common ſort, and to
caſt ſtumbling blocks cunningly before
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58315:97"/>
all the reſt, and thereupon to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the more plauſibly their own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions.
Hence, in <hi>France,</hi> where
the popiſh Inquiſition was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
admitted, it is now of late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
under a new name of <hi>the
Congregation de propaganda fide;</hi>
which is an Inquiſition in effect, and
hath begun to act there with publick
Authority, prohibiting all commerce
from abroad, for the vent of Divinity
books; in ſo much that they do not
ſuffer Bibles brought from <hi>Geneva</hi> to
be ſold any where, but do confiſcate
them. And in every City in <hi>France,</hi>
where a Church of Proteſtants is,
there is alſo a certain number of Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
belonging to <hi>the Congregation
de propaganda fide,</hi> ſetled, to oppoſe
and vex them. And it is intended
that this deſigne ſhall be proſecuted
univerſally againſt all proteſtant
Churches in other places, ſo ſoon as
the Proteſtant States ſhall be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
weakned, by diviſions among
themſelves. 2. It is greatly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
that, whileſt Satans Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are ſo active and united to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58315:98"/>
his Kingdom; we who are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Chriſts Kingdom, and ſo
many wayes bound to advance it, are
ſo careleſſe of Chriſt his intereſt, that,
on the one hand, licentiouſneſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe,
hereſies, blaſphemies, and
wickedneſſes break forth, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Chriſtian Religion; and, on
the other hand, the divided profeſſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
thereof ſeek &amp; follow eagerly their own
advantages, of power and places to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the ſettlement of each other;
and while the enemies have Agents e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, and an univerſal correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to weaken us by diviſion, &amp; then
to ruin us; no ſuch way of Agency or
correſpondency is ſet on foot by publick
Authority among us to ingage the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-wiſe
&amp; peaceable to joyn with us to
lay the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-Goſpel-intereſt to heart,
and to communicate counſel and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
each to other, at leaſt, to pray for
one another ſuitably to the exigencies of
things, that when help faileth on
earth, it may be procured from the
mighty God immediately. For which
the Lord may juſtly daſh us into pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
one againſt another, as veſſels unfit
for his honour and ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:58315:98"/>
2. This being the preſent ſtate of
all the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>Europe,</hi>
I proceed to inſtruct you to excerciſe
this hope aright, in reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
Which that I may do, I muſt
clear two things: 1. What diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſpirit is neceſſary to qualifie
the perſon, to make him a fit ſubject
of this hope. 2. How they who are
thus qualified muſt excerciſe it.</p>
            <p>1. For the firſt; whoſoever would
have and excerciſe this hope in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the publick ſtate of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Churches of Chriſt, they muſt
have and excerciſe publick ſpirits in
the communion of Saints, that is, they
muſt be ſanctified by faith in Chriſt,
and joyned unto Chriſt viſibly, as the
head of his Church, in communion
with the Church, which is his body,
and take to heart the publick ſtate of
the Churches, and Chriſt his intereſt
in them, whatever their own private
condition is, and to prefer the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
concernments before and above
their own private, in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
affections, and indeavours.
We muſt eſteem that ſpiritual Society,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58315:99"/>
and the concernments of it, as more
conſiderable then our own. Hereof
God himſelf gives us example, who
preferres his Church before and above
all the World beſides, as his <hi>chief
treaſure, Exod.</hi> 19. 5. his <hi>jewels,
Mal.</hi> 3. 17. tels them that they are
ſo <hi>precious in his ſight, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and loved of him;</hi> that he <hi>will
give men for them, and people for
their life, Iſa.</hi> 43. 4. as he did call
off <hi>Senacherib</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by
ſending <hi>Tirrhaka</hi> the King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi>
to invade his land, and ſo
gave both <hi>Aethiopians</hi> and <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
into his hand, to free his Church
from him. Now, Gods judgment of
perſons and things ſhould be the rule
of our judgment. For we know that
the judgment of God is according to
truth. So did <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe love act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo highly from his high eſteem of
the Church and Gods intereſt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in it, that, though God offered
to make him a great Nation, if he
would let him alone, that he might
conſume <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 10. yet he was ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58315:99"/>
it, that he prayed the Lord
to forgive their ſin, and, if not, to
blot him out of the Book which he
had written, <hi>ver. 32. David</hi> was ſo
ſtrongly ingaged in his affections to
the Church of God, that if all his
petitions were to be put into <hi>one;</hi> it
ſhould be this, that he <hi>might dwell in
the houſe of the Lord, to behold his
beauty there, Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. he had
<hi>rather be one day</hi> there, <hi>then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
elſewhere,</hi> and to <hi>be a Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
in Gods Houſe, than to dwel in
the Tents of wickedneſſe, Pſal. 84. 9,
10.</hi> The place of the publick holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
was a Tent, a Tabernacle,
an unfixed, a moveable place, yet he
cals that an Houſe, a fixed Manſion.
The people dwelt in houſes firmly built
upon foundations; yet <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the houſes of wicked men
Tabernacles; he looked for no ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the World, but onely in the
Church and fellowſhip of thoſe that
are in Covenant. See how affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
he ſpeaks of Church Aſſemblies
and Communion with them, <hi>Pſal.
122.</hi> 8, 9. of the ſame mind and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58315:100"/>
were the Saints in the Babiloniſh
Captivity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 5, 6. And the
ſame ſpirit works the like diſpoſition
in all the members of Chriſts myſtical
body; <hi>whether one member ſuffer, all
the members ſuffer with it; or one
member be honoured, all the members
rejoyce with it, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 26. And
they ſee good reaſon for their ſo act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the concernments of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt. For, 1. They know
that God hath recorded his Name
there; and his Name is put upon
Church members, and therefore his
Name is honoured, or diſhonoured,
as things are well or ill with his
Church. Hence it was, that <hi>Joſua</hi> was
ſo exceedingly afflicted for the flight
of the people before <hi>Ai,</hi> though but
about thirty ſix were ſlain; <hi>what ſhall
I ſay, when Iſrael flies before the
enemies? and the Canaanites will hear
of it, &amp;c. and what wilt thou do to
thy great Name? Ioſh.</hi> 7. 8, 9.
Therefore Chriſt teacheth us to joyn
theſe together immediately; <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
be thy Name: Thy Kingdom come,</hi>
to ſhew us that anſwerable to the well
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58315:100"/>
being of the Church, which is the
Kingdome of grace, will be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Gods Name, in this World.
2. They know that the welfare of all
States and people, where Churches
are, depends upon the welfare of the
Church. For ſo runs the promiſe;
<hi>Iſrael ſhall be a bleſſing in the midſt
of the land, Iſa.</hi> 19. 24. Hence it
was that the Saints could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with their own private welfare,
if the Church of God was in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and danger, or under reproach.
As you may ſee in <hi>Vriah, 2 Sam.
11.</hi> 11. in <hi>Nehemiah, Neh.</hi> 1. 3, 4.
with 2. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Daniel,</hi> though
he was as highly preferred, as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
could be, in the greateſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 2, 3. Hence alſo,
when there hath been a double afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon them, both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
the publick hath ſwallowed up
the private, and made it inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in compariſon. As we ſee in <hi>Eli.
1 Sam.</hi> 4. 18. and his daughter in
law, the wife of <hi>Phineas, ver. 21,
22.</hi> Laſtly, hence it was, that when
they have had a double opportunity,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58315:101"/>
of doing or procuring good to the
publick, and to their own private;
they have preferred the publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
before their own private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
Thus <hi>Terentius</hi> a Chriſtian
Commander in the Wars under the
Emperor <hi>Valens,</hi> who was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
being willed by that Emperor,
for a ſpecial ſervice done by him, to
demand what he would, made his
petition to the Emperor, which he
preſented to him in writing; that the
Chriſtians might have the liberty of a
Church by themſelves, to worſhip
God apart from the Arrians. The
Emperor read his petition, and diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it, tore it, and threw it away.
<hi>Terentius</hi> meekly gathered up the
ſcattered pieces, and profeſſed to the
Emperor, that, if he could not be
heard in Gods cauſe, he would not
make any ſuit for his own profit. How
may this worthy man ſhame moſt
Chriſtians, in theſe dayes, who, if
their garners may be ful, their ſheep
multiply, their oxen be ſtrong to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
their ſons be as plants grown
up, and their daughters poliſhed and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58315:101"/>
ſet forth with ornaments, and there
be no complaining in the ſtreets; think
themſelves happy, and regard not
what becomes of religion, and of
Chriſts cauſe and intereſt in the
Churches, take not to heart the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Gods people; if their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
increaſe; one good bargain will
more comfort them then all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the Church can grieve them;
they can hear and ſpeak of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and ruins of <hi>Sion,</hi> as the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
did of news, without remorſe,
or regard. Brethren, it is a weighty
matter to read letters, and receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
in them concerning the ſtate
of the Churches. You had need to
lift up your hearts to God, when
you are about to read your letters
from our native Country, to give you
wiſdom and hearts duly affected, that
you may receive ſuch intelligences, as
you ought. For God looks upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, in ſuch caſes, with a jealous
eye, obſerving with what workings
of bowels they read or ſpeak of the
concernments of his Church. You ſee,
in <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. how his wrath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58315:102"/>
againſt thoſe who ſolaced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with their private proſperity,
but <hi>were not ſick,</hi> their hearts aked
not, <hi>for the afflictions of Joſeph.</hi> 3.
They know that, if they with-draw
from being helpful to the Church,
God will do good to his Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them; but he will be avenged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that deſert or neglect his
cauſe and people. This Argument
<hi>Mordecai</hi> uſed to <hi>Heſter,</hi> in <hi>Heſt.
4.</hi> 13, 14. and it prevailed mightily
with her to run the utmoſt hazard of
her own perſon, when there might be
hope of ſome good to the Church
thereby, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. For the contrary,
<hi>Meroz</hi> was curſed by the Angel of the
Lord, <hi>becauſe they came not to the
help of the Lord againſt the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Iudg.</hi> 5. 23. Though men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help the Lord, eſſentially or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally,
yet they may be ſaid to help
him, relatively, in his cauſe and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when they own his cauſe and
people, and appear on that ſide, when
Satan and his inſtruments raiſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and reproaches againſt them:
Though the Lord needs not mens help,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58315:102"/>
in ſuch caſes; for, <hi>when he ſaw that
there was no mon, no interceſſor, his
own arm brought ſalvation unto him,
Isa.</hi> 51. 16. yet it is our duty to ſhew
on whoſe ſide we ſtand. For Chriſt
will look at them as his enemies that
diſown his cauſe and people, at ſuch
times, as he ſaith, <hi>He that is not
with me, is againſt me, Mat. 12.
30.</hi> Are the people and wayes of God
under reproach? Chriſt is reproachd
in them and with them, <hi>Rom. 15. 3.
Object.</hi> Ah! but they are called fools
and fanaticks? <hi>Anſw.</hi> When was
it otherwiſe? <hi>Bernard</hi>
complained of the like,<note place="margin">Bern. de conſ. ad Eugen. lib. 4.</note>
in his time; <hi>Ipſa Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio
in opprobrium

ſimplicitas reputatur, ne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,

ſelf comes into reproach, and the fear
of God is accounted ſimplicity, that
I ſay not folly.</hi> And, before him,
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> deſcribes the
ſcoffs<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Verb. Dom.</note> and frumps of
luke-warm profeſſors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the zeal of thoſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58315:103"/>
that were <hi>fervent in ſpirit, ſerving
the Lord, Quid inſanis? aiunt nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

Iſta ſtultitia eſt, dementia
est.</hi> That is, <hi>Why art thou mad? ſay
they, your zeal is too much. What?
are none Chriſtians but you? That is
folly, it is fanatiqueneſſe.</hi> And, before
his time, long, how were the ancient
Chriſtians in the Ten Perſecutions
300, years after Chriſt traduced re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached!
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. Before that,
in the Apoſtles dayes, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of
himſelf, and the reſt, <hi>we are fools for
Chriſts ſake, &amp;c, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 10. and,
<hi>if we be beſides our ſelves, it is to God,
2 Cor. 5. 13. Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it a grace to be diſgraced for Chriſt,
<hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. Chriſt well knew how
croſſe to the natural affection of all
men reproach and diſgrace is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he, to arme his diſciples againſt
it, ſhews them the happineſſe they
ſhould have by ſuffering reproaches
and revilings, for his ſake, and the
Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11, 12. and the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
iſſue of declining it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 28. Chriſt
added, as a motive, to incourage his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58315:103"/>
Diſciples in ſuffering reproaches, that
ſo <hi>perſecuted they the Prophets, Mat.
5.</hi> 12. which of the Prophets eſcaped
ſharp tryals, this way? yea, <hi>David</hi>
himſelf, though a King, was deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by <hi>Michal</hi> for his zeal in bringing
home the Ark, and dancing before it,
with his head uncovered, <hi>as one of
the vain perſons,</hi> ſaid ſhe: but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was ſo far from being diſcouraged
thereby, that his zeal was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,
and his reſolution increaſed;
<hi>it was before the Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which
choſe me before thy Father, &amp;c. And
I will be yet more vile then thus, and
will be baſe, in mine own ſight, &amp;c.
2 Sam.</hi> 6. 21, 22. I have ſpoken the
more largely unto this, becauſe the
preſent temptation of this time, in
the other afflictions of the Churches,
is the reproachful titles put upon the
people of God, whom prophane men
call <hi>Phanaticks.</hi> But, if he is a fool
that will be laughed out of his coat;
much mure is he a fool, and a mad
man, that will ſuffer himſelf to be
laughed out of heaven, that will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the loſſe of his ſoul, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58315:104"/>
to free himſelf from the mocks
and ſcoffs of a prophane and ſinful
World. If Chriſt had not, for our
ſakes <hi>endured the croſſe, deſpiſing the
ſhame,</hi> we could never have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
and ſaved; <hi>let us go forth
therefore unto him, without the Camp,
bearing his reproach, Heb.</hi> 13. 13. In
the ſame Epiſtle, the Chriſtian <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
are exhorted to <hi>call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
the former dayes, in which,
after they were illuminated, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
a great fight of afflictions, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whileſt they were made a gazing
ſtock, both by reproaches, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
and partly, whileſt they
became companions of them that were
ſo uſed, Heb.</hi> 10. 32, 33. Let us do
likewiſe, and own the reproached
and perſecuted people and cauſe of
Chriſt in ſuffering times. With-hold
not countenance, entertainment, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
from ſuch, if they come to us,
from other Countreys, as from <hi>France</hi>
or <hi>England,</hi> or any other place. <hi>Be
not forgetful to entertain ſtrangers;
for thereby ſome have entertained
Angels unawares. Remember them
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58315:104"/>
that are in bonds, as bound with them,
and them which ſuffer adverſity, as
being your ſelves alſo in the body,
Heb.</hi> 13. 2, 3. the Lord required
this of <hi>Moab,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Make thy
ſhadow, as the night in the midſt
of the noon day, i. e.</hi> provide ſafe
and comfortable ſhelter and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for my people, in the heat of
perſecution and oppoſition raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, <hi>hide the out-caſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
not him that wandereth. Let
mine out-caſts dwell with thee Moab,
be thou a covert to them from the face
of the ſpoiler, Iſa. 16. 3, 4. Object.</hi>
But ſo I may expoſe my ſelf to be
ſpoiled or troubled? He therefore, to
remove this objection, addeth, <hi>for
the danger is at an end, the ſpoiler
ceaſeth, the treaders down, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
out of the land.</hi> While we are
attending to our duty, in owning,
and harbouring Chriſts witneſſes,
God will be providing for their and
our ſafety, by deſtroying thoſe that
would deſtroy his people. Two helps
I ſhall propound, to arm you againſt
thoſe fears of reproach, or dangers,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58315:105"/>
whereby men are apt to be drawn to
flinch from the cauſe and witneſſes of
Chriſt, in ſuffering times. 1. Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
your faith. A ſight of the inviſible
God, and an eye to the recompence
of reward ſo quickened and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
the faith of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>he
choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with
the people of God, then to enjoy the
pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reproach of Chriſt greater ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
then the treaſures of Aegypt,
Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 26. And, as faith will
ſtrengthen you hereunto; ſo faith will
be ſtrengthened hereby, in your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
againſt being lead into temptation,
and left unto ſcandalous evils, that
might expoſe you to juſt reproach.
Therefore <hi>David</hi> having put up this
requeſt to God, that none that wait
on God and ſeek him ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
or confounded for his ſake,
urgeth this, as an Argument, to
ſtrengthen his faith; <hi>Becauſe for thy
ſake I have born reproach, ſhame
hath covered my face, Pſal. 69. 5.
6,</hi> 7. 2. Exalt God, as the higheſt
object of your fear. Fear God, as he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58315:105"/>
ought to be feared, fear him above all.
The greater fear will expel the leſſer.
Therefore the Lord preſcribes this
fearing him aright, as the beſt remedy
againſt all carnal fears, whereby
men are wont to be hindred from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
God in thoſe duties that will
expoſe men to hurt from the creature,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 12, 13. and <hi>Chap. 51. 7, 8,
12,</hi> 13. So doth Chriſt, in <hi>Mat.
10.</hi> 28. The balking of any duty,
which God commandeth, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way to bring upon you, by the
wrath of God, that very evil, which
you fear that the doing of your duty
will expoſe you to, by the wrath of
men. This was that Argument, which
the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> uſed, to <hi>Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
in <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
Becauſe he, fearing leſt the <hi>Iews,</hi>
that were fallen to the <hi>Caldaeans,</hi>
ſhould deliver him into their hand,
and they ſhould mock him; by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
the Commandement of God,
brought upon himſelf, as a juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
from the wrath of God, the
thing which he feared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:58315:106"/>
2. The next thing to be ſhewn, for
your inſtruction, is, how they that are
ſo qualified ſhould exerciſe this hope,
in reference to the publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Churches, in this their
low and afflicted condition. For this
purpoſe I ſhall propound two directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>1. See that you lay a ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this hope, a firm ground-work
for this hope to be built and exerciſed
upon; faith in God as his Churches
portion, is this ground-work. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let the eye of your faith, through
the glaſſe of the word, look unto God,
in this caſe; as <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> did, in
2 <hi>Chron. 20. 12. We have no might
againſt this great company that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
againſt us; neither know we
what to do, but our eyes are upon
thee.</hi> Look not ſo much with the eye
of ſenſe downward, and round about
you, as with the eye of faith upward,
and into the ſcripture-promiſes. There,
if the Lord open your eyes, you ſhall
ſee that more are with the Church
and cauſe, and people of God, then
can be againſt them. This courſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58315:106"/>
               <hi>David</hi> took, and was comforted, even
when he was ſurrounded with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<hi>Pſal. 25. 15. Mine eyes are
ever towards the Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for
he ſhall pluck my feet out of the net.</hi>
That your faith in God may be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
in this hour of temptation, in
theſe times of the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph;</hi>
conſider three things: 1. Chriſt his
intereſt of propriery in the Churches
of the Saints. For the Church is
Chriſts Vineyard. <hi>The Vineyard of
the Lord of Hoſts is the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
Iſa. 5. 7. Salomons</hi> Vineyard
in <hi>Baal-haman</hi> was the choiceſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of his lands. Chriſts Vineyard is
the chiefeſt part of his inheritance in
the World. <hi>Salomon let forth his
Vineyard to Keepers.</hi> But of this
Vineyard, his Church, Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>My Vineyard which is mine, is before
me, Cant.</hi> 8. 11, 12. Chriſt doth
not let forth his Vineyard unto Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but himſelf keeps it under his
own eye continually. Indeed, when
his Vineyard anſwers not his coſt and
pains beſtowed upon it, but, <hi>when
he looketh that it ſhould bring forth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58315:107"/>
grapes, it brings forth wild grapes,</hi>
then, <hi>he will take away the hedge
thereof, and break down the wall
hereof,</hi> and then <hi>it ſhall be eaten up,
and trodden down, Iſa.</hi> 5. 4, 5. then
<hi>the boar out of the Wood will waſte it,
and the wild beast of the field will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it,</hi> for a time, till God attain
his end, in their repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment;
and then he will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to return, and look down from
heaven and behold and viſit this Vine,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 13, 14. And when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>a Vineyard of red wine,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the value and vertue of the
blood of Chriſt, in their faith and
obedience, ſee what he ſaith of it: <hi>I
the Lord do keep it, I will water it
every moment; leſt any hurt it, I
will keep it night and day, Iſa. 27.
2,</hi> 3. 2. The Church is Chriſts houſe,
<hi>the houſe of the living God, 1 Tim.
3.</hi> 15. an houſe which coſt him more
then all the ſilver, and gold, and
precious ſtones in the world will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto. For <hi>God purchaſed the
Church with his blood, Acts 20. 27,
28.</hi> Chriſt is the builder and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58315:107"/>
of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 3, 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will ſee to it, when it ſuffers
any hurt, that it be repaired, and
kept in repair. 3. The Church is
Chriſts Kingdom, which God will
maintain againſt all rebels, as you ſee
at large, in the ſecond Pſalm. 4. The
Church is Chriſts ſpouſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nearer and dearer to him then any
other ſociety in the World, <hi>At his
right hand ſtands the Queen in gold
of Ophir, Pſal.</hi> 45. 9. as <hi>Salomon</hi>
ſet his Mother at his right hand, to
ſhew that ſhe was next to him, and
above all other his ſubjects. <hi>Ahaſueroſh</hi>
his wrath was ſo incenſed againſt
<hi>Haman,</hi> for plotting againſt his
Queen, and her people, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
evil againſt him, and when
he ſaw him fallen upon the bed whereon
<hi>Heſter</hi> was (though he did it to make
requeſt for his life) his wrath ſo boiled
up to the height, that he ſaid; <hi>will he
force the Queen alſo before me in the
houſe?</hi> Then they covered <hi>Hamans</hi>
face, and, at the Kings command,
hanged him upon the Gallows which
he had prepared for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58315:108"/>
you may ſee in the 7th. Chapter of
<hi>Heſter.</hi> The love of Chriſt to the
Church, which is his ſpouſe, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
exceeds the love of <hi>Ahaſueroſh</hi>
to <hi>Heſter.</hi> Therefore they conſult mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and ruin to themſelves and their
families, who plot againſt the Church.
And wo to them that would force the
Church to their own wills and deviſes,
contrary to the mind of Chriſt. 5.
The Church is Chriſts body and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
Chriſt hath not his fulneſſe
without his Church. <hi>God hath put all
things under Chriſts feet, and hath
given him to be the Head over all
things to the Church, which is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the fulneſſe of him that filleth
all in all, Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. Hence
he ſympathiſeth with them. <hi>In all
their afflictions he is afflicted, Iſa. 63.
9.</hi> and what is done againſt them, is
done againſt him. <hi>Saul, Saul, why
perſecuteſt thou me? Acts</hi> 9. 4. as
when the leaſt toe is trodden upon, the
head, by the tongue, cries, why do
you hurt me? you ſee what Chriſts
intereſt of propriety in his Church is,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the greateſt that can be. For it is his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58315:108"/>
Vineyard, yea, more, his houſe, yet
higher, his Kingdom, yet dearer, his
ſpouſe, and nearer yet, his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
And, you know, propriety is of
great force with all, to uſe all their
wiſdom and power to maintain and
preſerve their intereſt. Much more
will Chriſt vindicate his own intereſt
of propriety in his Church againſt all
oppoſers of it. 2. Conſider the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
whereinto God hath taken his
Church and people, together with
the promiſes, that, as ſo many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Covenant, belong unto
them thereby. God ſaith unto his
Church, <hi>I ſware unto thee, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a Covenant with thee, and
thou becameſt mine, Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. and
of God it is ſaid; <hi>he will ever be
mindful of his Covenant, Pſal. 111.
5.</hi> upon this ground the faith of the
Church was ſtrengthened, when they
were in a very low and forlorn ſtate,
to plead with God; <hi>Doubtleſſe thou
art our Father, though Abraham be
ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
us not; thou, O Lord, art our
Father, our Redeemer, thy Name is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58315:109"/>
from everlaſting, Iſa.</hi> 63. 16. and
again, in <hi>verſe 19. We are thine, thou
never beareſt rule over them, thy
Name was not called upon of them.</hi>
The promiſes that belong unto the
Church and people of God, under this
relation, are innumerable. I ſhall touch
upon two or three, that are ſuitable
unto them, in reference to the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their enemies, <hi>Pſal. 37. 12,
13. The wicked plotteth (or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth)
againſt the just, and gnaſheth
at him with his teeth. The Lord ſhall
laugh at him,</hi> (that is, ſhall render
him ridiculous, and contemptible to
others, as he plots to make the Church
be unto the world) <hi>for he ſeeth that
his day is comming.</hi> By <hi>his Day,</hi> is
meant, his diſmal day, the day of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
the day appointed of God for
his puniſhment, the deſtruction, the day
when their iniquity ſhall have an end.
Such a day is comming upon them:
Therefore it is added, in <hi>verſe 17. For
the arms of the wicked ſhall be broken;
but Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.
Behold,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I will make
Jeruſalem a Cup of trembling unto all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58315:109"/>
people that beſiege it round about, Zac.
12.</hi> 2. The beſiegers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the
Church of God, think they may as
eaſily ſwallow it up, as a man may
drink a cup of wine, and it is as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome
unto them to do ſo; but
they ſhall find it a cup of giddineſſe, a
drink too ſtrong for them; yea, a cup
of poyſon, that will caſt them into a
drunken ſleep, out of which when
they ſhall be awakened, horrour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment,
trembling ſhall ſeize
upon them. It is added, in <hi>verſe
3. And in that day, I will make
Jeruſalem a burdenſome ſtone, for
all people; all that burden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with it, ſhall be cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
though all the people of the
earth be gathered together againſt it.</hi>
It is folly for any one to lift at a ſtone,
that being too heavy for him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
will fall upon him and break his
bones. Such a ſtone ſhall all that lift
at the Church to remove it out of its
place, find it to be unto themſelves.
The Lord Jeſus, to whom all power
in heaven and earth is given, hath
ſaid, ſpeaking of <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſing him
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58315:110"/>
to be Chriſt, the Son of the living
God, with a divine faith, ſuch as is
wrought by the Revelation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>upon this Rock I will build my
Church; and the gates of Hell ſhall
not prevail againſt it, Mat. 16. 16,
17, 18. The gates of Hell,</hi> ſignifie
all the power and policy of the Devil,
and all his inſtruments, they ſhall not
prevail againſt Chriſts Church, taken
indefinitely. He will preſerve his
Church, in one place or other in the
World, maugre all their malice. Theſe,
and the like promiſes, are <hi>the ſtreams,</hi>
which, flowing from that <hi>river,</hi> the
Covenant of Grace, <hi>make glad the
City of God,</hi> which is his Church,
even when <hi>the waters roar, and the
mountains are ſhaken with the ſwelling
thereof, Pſal.</hi> 46. 3, 4. That is, what
ever changes of government are cauſed
by the fury of a tumultuous multitude,
ſtirred up by Satanand his inſtruments
againſt the Church and people of God.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider the preſence of God,
in Chriſt with his Church, in their
loweſt and moſt afflicted condition;
according to Chriſts promiſe to them,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58315:110"/>
being taught to obſerve and do what
he hath commanded, <hi>Lo, I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the
world, Mat.</hi> 28. 20. This ſerves to
ſtrengthen the faith of Gods people
concerning the Church, in her loweſt
and moſt afflicted eſtate; that <hi>God
is in the midſt of her; ſhe ſhall
not be moved, God will help her,
at the looking forth of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Pſal.</hi> 46. 5. It is night with
the Church, when <hi>the nations make
a noiſe and the Kingdoms are moved,</hi>
as it is ſaid in the neXt verſe; yet,
even then, the Churches faith in God,
as their portion, being quickened
and ſtrengthened, they ſay, <hi>Jehovah of
Hoſts is with us; the God of Jacob,
an high refuge for us, Selah: ver.
7.</hi> Therefore, that this conſideration
may the better ſerve to ſtrengthen our
faith, I ſhall ſhew you ſundry Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of Gods preſence with his
people in their loweſt, and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
condition, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
holdeth forth unto us. Unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
it was repreſented, under a
double ſimilitude: 1. <hi>Of fowles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58315:111"/>
down upon the earcaſſes,</hi> about
to be ſacrificed, and <hi>Abrahams dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them away, Gen.</hi> 15. 11. which
repreſented the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and all
enemies of the Church, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
the people of God in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
duties of Gods worſhip, and
that ſeek to devour the people of God,
as Kites or Eagles, &amp;c. devour carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and Gods preſence and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to drive them away. 2. Of <hi>a
ſmoaking furnace and a burning lamp,
verſe</hi> 17. The ſmoaking furnace, notes
great afflictions, fiery tryals, which
ſhall befal the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. The
burning lamp, ſignifieth that God in
Chriſt is with them, at ſuch times, to
ſave them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 1. Unto <hi>Moſes</hi>
it was repreſented under <hi>the appearing
of the Angel of God in a flame of
fire out of the midſt of a buſh, the
buſh burned with fire, and the buſh
was not conſumed. Iſa.</hi> 3. 2. This
<hi>Moſes</hi> looked at as <hi>a great ſight;</hi> and
ſo may we. For, the buſh, is the
Church of God, which is burned with
fiery tryals: But whence is it that it
is not conſumed? It is not from the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58315:111"/>
impotency of the fire to burn the buſh,
nor from the ſtrength of the buſh to
reſiſt the fire, but from the preſence
of God in Chriſt, as appears, <hi>ver. 6,
7, &amp;c.</hi> To <hi>Ezekiel</hi> it was repreſented
under the ſimilitude of a <hi>valley, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were many bones, and they very
dry, Ezek.</hi> 37. 2. The valley ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the low eſtate of the Church, the
many dry bones denoted the diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
apprehenſions the people of God
have, when they look upon the power
of the enemies, and their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
with the eye of ſenſe, for ſo
the Lord ſaid, in <hi>verſe 11. Behold,
they ſay, our bones are dried, and
our hope is loſt, we are cut off for our
parts:</hi> Yet the Lord to quicken their
faith, promiſeth a reſurrection to
them. Another reſemblance of Gods
preſence with his Church and people,
in the midſt of their greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we have in thoſe three companions
of <hi>Daniel, who were caſt bound into the
midst of the fire,</hi> yet <hi>the fire had
no power upon their bodies, not ſo
much as to ſinge their hair, or to
change their coats.</hi> The reaſon of it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58315:112"/>
was, becauſe the Son of God was
wIth them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25. Unto <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi>
another reſemblance hereof
was preſented; he <hi>ſaw, by night a
man riding upon a red horſe, and he
ſtood among the myrtle trees, that
were in the bottom, Zach.</hi> 1. 8. The
night, is the time of affliction; the
bottom is the low condition of the
Church, which is likened unto myrtle
trees for its ſweet ſavour unto God.
And, in this low afflicted eſtate,
Chriſt is with them, riding upon a red
horſe, as ready to fight againſt thoſe
that afflicted his Church, for whom he
intercedes and receives gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.
Again, in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 2, 3. the
Lord fore-told that he would <hi>make
Jeruſalem a Cup of trembling to the
beſiegers,</hi> who thought they could as
eaſily ſwallow them up, as one may
drink a cup of wine, and they would
do the one with as much pleaſure as
the other. But, ſaith the Lord, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this cup ſhall be trembling and
aſtoniſhment in you. And, in <hi>ver.</hi> 3.
he ſaith, <hi>he will make Ieruſalem a
burdenſome ſtone to all people that are
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58315:112"/>
gathered together againſt it; they
ſhall be cut in pieces.</hi> Then they will
ſee cauſe to wiſh they had never <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
themſelves with it.</hi> Thus you
ſee, upon what firm grounds the faith
of Gods people concerning the good
purpoſes of God towards his Church,
in their loweſt, and moſt afflicted
condition, may be ſtrengthened and
ſetled.</p>
            <p>2. This ground-work being thus
laid, build and exerciſe this hope
upon it, in its ſuitable operations, and
works.</p>
            <p>1. In its purging work: For, <hi>he
that hath this hope purgeth himſelf,
1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. Then we work with God,
when we improve Gods means to
Gods end. Gods end, in afflicting
his Church, is, not to deſtroy it,
but to purge it. So he ſaith, in <hi>Iſa.
1. 25, 26. I will turn mine hand
upon thee, and purely purge away
thy droſſe, and take away all thy
tinne. And I will reſtore thy Judges
as at the firſt, and thy Councellors
as at the beginning; afterward
thou ſhalt be called the City of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58315:113"/>
the faithful City.</hi> There
he compares the afflictions of his
Church and people to the fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
Gold and Silver is caſt, which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
nothing thereby, but its droſſe
and tinne; but the metal it ſelf is
thereby made more pure and fit for
honourable uſes, and ſervices. In the
27th. Chapter, the 8. and 9. verſes,
the ſame is expreſſed under two other
metaphors: 1. Of an Huſband-man,
or Vine-dreſſer. <hi>In meaſure, and
in the branches, wilt thou debate with
it;</hi> as the Husband-man or Vinecoome,
doth not ſtock up the roots, to deſtroy
the fruit trees and Vines, but onely
lopp them, and prune them, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away their luxuriant and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
branches, that ſo they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more fruitful.</p>
            <p>2. Of ſtormy winds. He inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in the Eaſt-wind, which is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the trees and corn, in thoſe hot
Eaſtern Countreys, by blaſting them,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 6. by its ſcorching heat,
whence the <hi>Graecians</hi> call it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
yet the Lord ſaith he will ſo order it,
that no hurt ſhall redound to his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58315:113"/>
Church and people, by it, but, <hi>by this
ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged,
and this ſhall be all the fruit, to take
away his ſin.</hi> Now, ſeeing this is
Gods end and way; let all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and people of God, act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
in this time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> troubles,
looking up to God in Chriſt for the
aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, to make
this uſe of his afflicting providences,
to be awakened and excited to purge,
firſt, their own hearts, then, the
Churches, more fully and perfectly. It
is no true policy, but folly, in ſuch
times, to ſeek an eſcape from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and dangers, by complyance with
the inventions of men, and cuſtomes
of degenerate Churches and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
in the matters of Religion. For
that is the ground of Gods controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
with his people, for which he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth
againſt them, with ſo ſtrong
and open rebukes. But account the
fear of God to be the head-point and
beginning of wiſdom. Till men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the fear of God, in all their
wayes, they do not begin to act wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
This point of true wiſdom God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58315:114"/>
taught <hi>Ioſuae,</hi> when he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
dejected, in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 10. to 14:
and the Church, in captivity practiſed
accordingly. For they confeſſed that
their ſorrows and ſufferings were the
effects of their ſins; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to <hi>ſearch and try their wayes
and turn again to the Lord;</hi> and then,
having removed the impediments, their
hope was quickened to <hi>lift up their
hearts with their hands unto God, in
the heavens, Lam. 3. 39, 40, 41.
Shecaniah</hi> alſo, obſerving how the
hearts of Gods people were prepared
to ſeek reconciliation with God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that they had treſpaſſed againſt
God, in the particular ſin diſcovered
to them, and added; <hi>yet now there is
hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi>
And thereupon inferred, <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us make a Covenant with our
God, &amp;c.</hi> and incouraged <hi>Ezra</hi> to
act vigorouſly for reformation, <hi>Ezra
10.</hi> 2, 3, 4. The like courſe the
Church reſolved to take, upon incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the like hope in <hi>Hoſ. 6.
1,</hi> 2, 3. This courſe we alſo muſt
take, in this hour of temptation, if
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58315:114"/>
we would have a good iſſue of theſe
afflicting diſpenſations, which are
upon us.</p>
            <p>2. Exerciſe this hope in its quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
and incouraging work. For
this hope is a <hi>lively hope, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 3.
It is very diſhonourable to God, and
uncomely for Chriſtians, to be deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and diſcouraged, in ſuch times
of trial. The time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trial
ſhould be the time of <hi>Iacobs</hi> truſting
in God. So did the Church, when
the enemies inſulted, in <hi>Mich. 7. 8.
Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
when I fall, I ſhall ariſe; when
I ſit in darkneſſe, the Lord ſhall be a
light unto me.</hi> Two objections are
wont to ariſe in the minds of Gods
people in ſuch times, to weaken their
hope in God, you have them both in
the anſwer of <hi>Gideon</hi> to the Angel,
who ſaid unto him, <hi>the Lord is with
thee, Iudg. 6. 12, 13, And Gideon
ſaid unto him, oh, my Lord, if the
Lord be with us, why then is all this
befallen us? and where be all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which our Fathers told us of?</hi>
Theſe are the two temptations which,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58315:115"/>
if they be not ſcattered, will hinder the
exerciſe of this hope. 1. <hi>If God be
with us, why then is all this befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
us?</hi> Therefore, to arm you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that theſe two, Gods preſence
with his people, and calamities incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon them, may well conſiſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
For wiſe and holy ends God
ſuffers extream calamities to befal his
Churches and people, before he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth his hands to deliver them.
Particularly, he thus diſpenſeth: 1.
That he may thereby convince them
of the vanity of thoſe creature-propps,
whereupon they are wont to rely too
much, and to purge carnal confidence
out of them. This was the great ſin of
the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to truſt in the
ſhadow of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to rely upon
<hi>Aſſyria,</hi> though they were fore-warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Aegypt</hi> would be a broken
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed, which would rather hurt then
help them; <hi>therefore,</hi> ſaith the Lord,
<hi>have I cryed to her; their ſtrength
is to ſit ſtill, Iſa.</hi> 30. 6, 7. that is, to
renounce their creature dependencies,
and to expect ſalvation from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58315:115"/>
in <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 13. But they
continually diſobeyed God herein, till
the Lord had convinced them of their
ſin and folly, by their Captivity in
<hi>Babylon,</hi> from which no creature could
deliver them. Then, when God by
affliction had wrought their hearts to
an humble frame, and to repentance,
they expreſſe it, in reference to this
ſin, particularly, ſaying, <hi>Aſhur ſhall
not ſave us, we will not ride upon hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
&amp;c. for in thee the fatherleſſe
findeth mercy, Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. The like
controverſie God hath with his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and people, at this day, for their
truſting too much in the arm of fleſh,
in the Parliament, in the Army, or in
the Protector; and thereupon became
carnally ſecure and wanton, and
ſlight, when they had ſuch propps to
ſtay upon, and anſwerably dejected
and almoſt diſcouraged, when they
failed them. The Lord awaken and
humble his people for it, and cauſe
their eyes, for the future, to be towards
him alone. 2. That his people may
ſee him in his glory, and glorifie him
alone for their deliverances, he brings
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58315:116"/>
them unto a ſeemingly for lorne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and helpleſſe, to the eye of
ſenſe. So in <hi>Iſa. 33. 9, 10. The earth
mourneth and languiſheth; Lebanon
is aſhamed, and withered; Sharon is
like a Wilderneſſe; and Baſhan and
Carmel. All things fail: Now will I
riſe, Now will I be exalted; ſaith the
Lord; Now will I lift up my ſelf.</hi>
Mans extremity is Gods opportunity.
3. That, Gods faithfulneſſe in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
may be glorified. For ſo he hath
promiſed in <hi>Deut. 32. 36. The Lord
ſhall judg his people, and repent himſelf
for his ſervants, when he ſeeth that
their power is gone, &amp;c.</hi> And, in <hi>Pſ. 12.
5. For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the
fighing of the needy, now will I ariſe,
ſaith the Lord, I will ſet in ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he ſhall have breathing.</hi> You ſee
how low they are brought, they are
poor and needy, and oppreſſed, ſo,
as they dare not make complaints o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
but ſigh and groan ſecretly.
This is the time when God promiſeth
to riſe up, and to give ſalvation to
them. And, to ſhew that this is Gods
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58315:116"/>
conſtant way, in performing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> addeth his <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
eſt</hi> to it, in the next verſe; <hi>the
ſayings of Jehovah,</hi> that is, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and, in particular, thoſe that
are of this import and concernment,
<hi>are pure ſayings, as ſilver tried in a
ſubliming furnace of earth, fined
ſeven times;</hi> that is, the Saints have,
by conſtant experience, found the
truth and faithfulneſſe of God in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them. 4. That thus God
may raiſe and heighten the eſteem of
his favours in the hearts of his people,
when they are beyond, and above their
expectation. This effect followed the
return of the people of God from their
Captivity in <hi>Babylon, Pſal. 126. 1,
2, 3. When Jehovah returned the
Captivity of Sion; we were like them
that dream;</hi> that is, it was ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
our thoughts, that we queſtioned
whether it was true, or no, as <hi>Peter</hi>
did, in <hi>Acts 12. 9. Then was our
mouth filled with laughter, and our
tongue with joyful-ſhouting.</hi> This did
ſo raiſe their joy and thankſgiving to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58315:117"/>
God, that it brake forth into ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The very heathens admired and
ſaid, <hi>God hath done great things for
them.</hi> Much more were themſelves
affected, and therefore they added,
<hi>Jehovah hath done very great things
for us, we are joyful.</hi> 5. That, by
ſuch diſpenſations, their faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
may be more fully tryed and
perfected. It is ſaid of Chriſt, that,
<hi>though he were a Son, yet learned he
obedience, by the things which he
ſuffered, Heb.</hi> 5. 8. that is, by his
ſufferings, he had the experimental
knowledge of that mediatourly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which he, as our ſurety, was
to perform; which is noted, in <hi>Phil.
2.</hi> 8. So the Churches of Chriſt are
brought low, that they may learn, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally,
ſuffering obedience,
which is the higheſt obedience of
faith, They are brought into a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-like
condition, that, as <hi>ſhe that
is a widdow indeed, and deſolate,
truſteth in God, and continueth in
ſupplications, and prayers, night and
day, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 5. ſo they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58315:117"/>
ſuitably to Gods end, in afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, who ſaith, <hi>I will leave in
the middest of thee an afflicted and
poor people, and they ſhall truſt in
the Name of the Lord, Zeph. 3. 12.
6.</hi> That they may be more fervent
in prayer: this operation hope had
in <hi>David,</hi> when he was brought ſo
low that he ſaid, <hi>I looked on the right
hand, and beheld, and no man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
me, refuge is periſhed
from me, no man ſeeketh for my
ſoul.</hi> This quickned and intended his
fervency in prayer, <hi>I cryed unto
thee, Jehovah, and ſaid, Thou art my
refuge, my portion in the land of the
living, Pſal.</hi> 142. 4, 5. Deſpaire
in the creatures help is oftentimes the
ground of hope in God for help. For
infinite goodneſſe, accompanied
with infinite wiſdom and power, can
never be at a loſſe, nor can faith and
hope, which look at them, ever be
at a ſtand. As God knows our ſouls
in adverſity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 7. ſo we know
God beſt in adverſity. God is beſt ſeen
in the Mount. To the ſecond objection;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58315:118"/>
               <hi>and where be all his Miracles, which
our Fathers told us of?</hi> I ſhall ſpeak
briefly. It hath been ſometimes that
which hath troubled the Saints, That
they ſee not ſuch great things done
for the Church, in our dayes, as we
read of in former times. But there is
no cauſe for it. For the hand of the
Lord is not ſhortened, nor is his
Church lower in his eſteem than
formerly. When the Lord had ſaid by
his Prophet, <hi>The People which were
left of the ſword found grace in the
wilderneſs,</hi> Jerem. 31. 2. the people
anſwered, <hi>Jehovah hath appeared of
old:</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, Truth,
he did ſo, in time paſt; thoſe were
good dayes indeed: but now thoſe
dayes are gone, we muſt look for no
more of them. The Lord replyed, <hi>Yea,
I have loved thee with an everlaſting
love, therefore with loving kindneſſe
have I drawn thee,</hi> Verſ. 3. teaching us
thereby to improve former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
to the ſtrengthening of our
Faith, for the preſent, and our hope;
for the future. Experience is a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
remembrance of former favours,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58315:118"/>
and Bleſſings, which will help to
multiply our Hope: For <hi>Experience
worketh Hope,</hi> Rom. 5. 4. Hope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by Experience, will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
unto Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 4. Hence
aroſe that pleading of Believers with
God in Prayer, in <hi>Iſa. 51. 9. Awake,
Awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the
Lord, awake, as in the ancient dayes,
in the Generations of old. Art thou
not it that hath cut Rahab, and
wounded the Dragon of the Sea? Art
thou not it which hath dryed the Sea?</hi>
V. 10. And fervent Prayer encreaſeth
and ſtrengtheneth this Hope; Thus
Chriſt teacheth us, in the Parable of
the Widdow importuning the Unjuſt
Judg, <hi>Luke 18. 6, 7, 8. Joab</hi> never put
up a more acceptable Requeſt unto
<hi>David,</hi> than when he interceded for
his baniſhed <hi>Abſalon.</hi> God is much
more pleaſed to be petitioned for his
afflicted Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. 6. He is
very ready to anſwer ſuch Prayers
with good Returns: For he ſaith,
<hi>Ask me of things to come, concerning
my Sons, and concerning the work of
my hands command ye me,</hi> Iſa. 45. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:58315:119"/>
3. Exerciſe this Hope in its ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
work. In every Degree of
the Exerciſe of this Hope there is an
anſwerable Degree of Joy; <hi>We rejoyce
in tribulation under the hope of glory,</hi>
Rom. 5. 2, 3. and anſwerable to our
<hi>joy</hi> in God will be our <hi>ſtrength</hi> in
God, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10. Therefore let this
Hope ſtrengthen you, 1. <hi>To cleave unto
God with purpoſe of heart,</hi> Acts 11. 23.
It is good cleaving to him who will
never leave nor forſake his People in
their diſtreſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5, 6. They that
forſake God to cleave to other helpers,
will finde their Hopes diſappointed,
when they have moſt need of help;
Then God will ſay, <hi>Where are their
Gods, their rock in whom they truſted?</hi>
Deut. 32. 37. And they ſhall not know
what to anſwer, but be aſhamed of that
which cannot, profit nor deliver: for
they are vain. When the People of
God are in diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wicked men will
inſult againſt them, and ſay, <hi>Where is
now their God?</hi> Pſal. 115. 2. But their
anſwer is ready, <hi>Our God is in the
Heavens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath done whatſoever he
pleaſed,</hi> Verſ. 3. They will be ready
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58315:119"/>
to ſay, Where are your Faſtings? your
Prayers? your confidence in God?
The Anſwer is eaſie, they are with
God in his Book of Remembrance:
they are as ſeed ſown in Heaven,
whence we ſhall reap a plentifull
crop of mercy, in due time. But how
eaſily may that be retorted upon them,
in reference to God, and his People,
which <hi>Zebul</hi> replyed unto <hi>Gaal,</hi> in
reference to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> in <hi>Judg. 9.
38. Where is now thy mouth, which
ſaid, who is the Lord, that we ſhould
ſerve him? Is not this the People
whom thou haſt deſpiſed?</hi> Only be
ſure, if you would cleave to God, that
you cleave to his Word, and every
truth in it, when it is oppoſed by a
ſinfull and unbelieving Generation:
<hi>Contend for the Faith which was once
given to the Saints,</hi> Jude 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſignifies, not ſimply to contend, but
with all our might, and more, if it were
poſſible. The thing to be contended for
is, <hi>the Faith,</hi> not a Fancy, but the
Truths received with Faith, upon
Gods Authority in his Word, the leaſt
jot and tittle whereof God values at a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58315:120"/>
higher rate than Heaven and Earth,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. and the Martyrs of
Jeſus eſteemed it above all worldly
things, and above their Lives. And
ſo ſhould we. 3. This Faith was <hi>once</hi>
delivered once for all. If it be loſt, or
exchanged for errour, there is danger
that it will be loſt for ever, as we might
prove by many examples of Apoſtates,
who have become Infidels and
Atheiſts. 4. This Faith was <hi>delivered,</hi>
depoſited, committed to our truſt, of
which a ſtrict Account muſt be given
how we have kept and uſed it.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three</hi> things which above
all others God expects we ſhould
keep moſt carefully and faithfully from
being wronged: 1. His own Name,
which is put upon us. 2. His Church.
3. His Truths contained in Scripture,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. 5. This <hi>Depoſitum</hi> is
committed to the Saints, in common;
not only to Miniſters or Magiſtrates,
but alſo to all Believers. It is the
<hi>common Faith,</hi> wherein every Believer
hath his intereſt in common with the
reſt; as all Planters or Inhabitants
have in the Commons that belong to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58315:120"/>
a Town, for which they will contend
with any man that ſhall wrong them
in that their Intereſt. 6. <hi>Salvation,</hi>
and this Faith are joyned, to teach us,
to provide for our Salvation by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Faith. Faith and Salvation are
kept or loſt together. 2. To wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
and conſtantly upon God, in
doing and ſuffering his will: For God
ſometimes puts a long Date to the
performance of his Promiſes. But
Gods deferring is no empty ſpace
but a time of fitting his Church and
People for the good things promiſed.
Whiles Phyſick is working the time is
not loſt, though health be not yet
recovered: For, when the ſick humor
is purged out, then comes health, ſee
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30. 18. only be carefull, that
whileſt you wait, you do not croſs
your Hope by ſinning againſt him,
upon whom you wait. True waiting
is not a meer ſtaying Gods leaſure,
but a continuing in a gracious inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
courſe, till the good waited for
be attained.</p>
