            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Take the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Self-denial</hi> to be the ſum of all ſaving Grace and Religion; the firſt of the Poſitive part, &amp; the ſecond of the Oppoſitive or Negative part: And I judge of the meaſure of my own and all other mens true piety by theſe two. And it is the rarity of theſe two which aſſureth me of the rarity of ſincere Godlineſs. O how much <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:34706:3"/>
how little <hi>Love of God,</hi> are too often found among thoſe contenders for, ſuppoſed, true Doctrine, true Worſhip, true Diſcipline, and the true Church! who can ſay that their Zeal for theſe things, doth eat up themſelves, their Charity, their Peaceableneſs, and their Brethren! The ſame men that will not abate an opinion, a formality, a ſingularity, for the Churches Peace and Concord, or for the intereſt of Love, and the healing of our wounds, will as hardly abate a jot of their Wealth, their worldly honour, their carnal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or ſelfiſh wills; which ſhews that their zeal and ſeeming Orthodoxneſs and wiſdom (as in them) is not from above but from beneath, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>O that men knew what <hi>hearts-eaſe ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> bringeth, by mortifying all that corrupteth and troubleth the ſouls of ſinners! And if that part of Religion which ſeemeth hardeſt &amp; harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be ſo ſweet, what is our <hi>Love</hi> and Delight in God, but the foretaſte of Heaven it ſelf?</p>
            <p>But the ſoul is ſeldom fit to reliſh this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine aright, till ſome ſpecial providence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction have made all the world notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſufficient for our relief. But he that in or after ſharp affliction will ſtill be <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> in a predominant degree, is next to <hi>hopeleſs.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that one accounted of eminent wiſdom, a little before he forſook the Land of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, made this the firſt word that ever he ſpake

               </note> when we are going out of the world, we ſhall all be much fitter to reliſh and underſtand the Doctrine of <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,</hi> than now we are.</p>
            <p>But though undeniable reaſon thus preſented, by the grace of God, do much cure ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſouls, yet alas, the World, the moſt of the Church viſible &amp; the Land is ſo far uncured, as that ſelfiſhneſs ſtill triumpheth over our innocency, piety and peace, and ſeemeth to deride our hopes of remedy. Were <hi>Profeſſion</hi> as rare as true <hi>Self-denial,</hi> I ſhould be of their mind who reduce the Church into a much narrower room than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Roman, the National, the Presbyterian, or Independent. Alas, how few are thoſe true Believers, whoſe inordinate SELF-LOVE, SELF-CONCEITEDNESS, SELF-WILL, and SELF-SEEKING are truly conquered by FAITH, and turned into the LOVE of GOD as GOD, and of the PUBLICK GOOD, and of their NEIGHBOUR, as themſelves; and into a HUMBLED UNDERSTANDING con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of its Ignorance; and into a <hi>humbled ſubmiſſive</hi> WILL, which is more diſpoſed to follow than to lead, and to obey than to be Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and domineer; and into a LIFE entirely devoted to God and to the <hi>Common good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this complaint was made before: But

            <p>One little thing I will here tell the Reader, that no Book of mine (except the two firſt) had ever the word [Dedicatory] joyned to the Epiſtle by my conſent, but I have very oft prohibited it in vain; whether by the <hi>oblivion</hi> or ſelf-conceit of the Bookſellers or the Printers I cannot tell.

            <head>To the Honourable Colonel JAMES BERRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PRovidence having deprived me of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of nearer converſe with you, which heretofore I have enjoyed, yet leaving me the ſame affections, they work towards you as they can; and have choſen here to ſpeak to you in the hearing of the world, that my words may remain to the ends intended, when a private Letter may be burnt or caſt aſide. Flattery I am confident you expect not from me, becauſe you know me, and know me to be your friend. (And yet my late Monitor hath made many ſmile, by accuſing me of that fawning crime.) I am told what it is to <hi>bleſs my friend with a loud voice,</hi> Prov. 27. 14. I have learnt
<pb facs="tcp:34706:5"/>
my ſelf, that <hi>[Open rebuke is better than ſecret love; and that faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kiſſes of an enemy are deceitful]</hi> Prov. 27, 5, 6. And therefore I ſhall do as I would be done by. <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> ſhall be the meaſure of my meſſage to you. And they have commanded me to ſet before you this leſſon of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and earneſtly to intreat you, and again intreat you, that you will faithfully <hi>Read,</hi> and <hi>Learn,</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> it. Though I judged you have learnt it long ago, I think it not needleſs to mind you of it again; my ſoul being aſtoniſhed to ſee the power of <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> in the world, even in thoſe that by Confeſſions and Prayers, and high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, have frequently condemned it. Yet this is the Radical-mortal ſin. Where this lives, all ſins virtually lives. Say that a man is <hi>Selfiſh,</hi> and (in that meaſure) you ſay all that is naught of him as to his inclination. That <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> is the ſumme of Vice, and the Capital enemy of God, of Common-wealths, of Order and Government, of all Grace and Vertue, of every holy Ordinance and Duty, eſpecially of Unity and Brotherly Love, and of the welfare of our neighbours, and of our own ſalvation, I have manifeſted to you in the following Diſcourſe. But alas, what need we words to manifeſt it, when the flames of diſcord and long-continued diviſions among Brethren do manifeſt it! When hatred, ſtrife, variance, emulation, backbiting, violence, rebellions, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:34706:5"/>
reſiſting and pulling down of Governments, have ſo lamentably declared it! When ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock is made by it before our eyes, and the evil ſpirit goes on and proſpereth, and deſolation is zealouſly and ſtudiouſly carried on, and the voice of Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers is deſpiſed or drowned in the confuſed noiſe! <hi>[Preſumptuous are they, ſelf-willed, they have not been afraid to ſpeak evil of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 2 Pet. 2. 10.] To ſpeak evil?</hi> was that the height of preſumption and ſelf-willedneſs then? Alas, how much further hath it proceeded now? even under the Cloak of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion?</hi> How many Conquerours that have often triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over their enemies, are conquered by <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and live in continual captivity, under this home-bred moſt imperious Tyrant?</p>
            <p>Whence is it but for want of. <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> that there is ſuch ſcrambling for Rule and Greatneſs, for Riches and Honours among all? As if they thought it more deſirable to fall from an high place than a low! and at death to part with Riches than with Poverty! and at Judgement to have much to anſwer for, than little! and to go to Heaven as a Camel through a needles eye, than by the more plain and eaſie way!</p>
            <p>Whence is it but for want of <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> that men are ſo hardly convinced of their ſins, be they never ſo open, and odious, and ſcandalous, if they be but ſuch as will admit of an excuſe before the world? Moſt ſins that are confeſt, are ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:34706:6"/>
ſeem not to be diſgraceful, or ſuch whoſe juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation would double the diſgrace, or ſuch as are confeſt in pride, that the Confeſſor may gain the reputation of humility.</p>
            <p>Whence is it but for want of <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> that Chriſtian Love is grown ſo cold, while all profeſs it to be the badge of Chriſts Diſciples? And that ſo many profeſſors have ſo little Charity for any but thoſe of their own opinions: unleſs it be a ſlandering Charity, or a perſecuting, or murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Charity? That all is commendable or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, that is done by men of their own conceits; and all condemnable, or a diminutive good, that is found in thoſe that differ from them; eſpecially if they diſpute or write againſt them?</p>
            <p>Whence is it but for want of <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> that men who know that whoredom, and drunkenneſs, and theft are ſins, can yet be ignorant (in the midſt of light) that diſcord and Church-diviſions are ſins? And that they hear him with heart-riſing, enmity, or ſuſpicion, that doth declaim againſt them? As if Uniting were become the work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and Dividing were become the work of Chriſt. I mean not <hi>Dividing</hi> from thoſe without, but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding</hi> in his Church, and among his Members; who are all baptized with one Spirit into one body, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 13.</hi> even the Body of Chriſt, (not of the Pope) of which even Apoſtles are but mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> was not the Head) <hi>1 Cor. 12. 27, 28.</hi> which is ſo tempered
<pb facs="tcp:34706:6"/>
together by God, that there ſhould be no ſchiſm in it, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 24, 25.</hi> And that for all the plain and terrible paſſages againſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, that are found in the word of God, it ſeems to ſome a Venial ſin, and to others a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Vertue, if not a mark of Chriſtian Piety. I may ſeem to ſpeak incredible things of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Profeſſors of Religion, if they were not atteſted by the common and lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the times.</p>
            <p>And whence is it but for want of <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> that Peace-makers ſucceed no better in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts? That while all men cry up Peace and Unity, moſt men are deſtroying them, and few are furthering them, and fewer do it with zeal and diligence; ſo few, that they are born down in the crowd, and ſpeed no better than <hi>Lot</hi> among the rabble of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> that cryed out againſt him <hi>[This one fellow came in to ſojourn, and he will needs be a judge: Now will we deal worſe with thee than with them]</hi> Gen. 19. 9. How long have ſome been longing, and praying, and moving, and labouring for Peace among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſons of Piety and Peace, in <hi>England?</hi> and all (for ought I ſee) almoſt in vain: unleſs to the condemnation of a ſelfiſh unpeaceable generation.

               <pb facs="tcp:34706:7"/>Whence can it be but for want of <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> that Magiſtrates profeſſing a zeal for Holineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard no more the intereſt of Chriſt? but that the name (&amp; but the name) of liberty, (a liberty that hath neither Moral good or evil in it) is ſet in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt the things of everlaſting conſequence, and thought ſufficient to over-weigh them? And that the meer pretence of this indifferent-carnal Liberty, is thought an argument of ſufficient weight, for the introduction of a wicked damning Liberty, even a Liberty to deceive and deſtroy as many as they can, and to hinder thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour mens ſalvation? And what's the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pleaded for all this? It's partly a pretence of <hi>tenderneſs and mercy:</hi> and partly becauſe <hi>men cannot be made Religious by force.</hi> And muſt ſuch ignorant or jugling confuſions ſerve turn, to cheat a Nation of their Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and many thouſands of their ſalvation? As if all the controverſie were, whether we ſhould force others to be of our Religion? when it is only or principally, whether we may hinder them from robbing us of our own? and from tempting unſtable ſouls to ſin and to damnation? and from hindring the means of mens ſalvation? and from the open practiſe of Idolatry or ungodlineſs? If we cannot force them to the Chriſtian faith, cannot we hinder them from drawing others from it? And are unmerciful to them, if we give them leave to damn themſelves (for that's the
<pb facs="tcp:34706:7"/>
mercy that is pleaded for) and only hinder them from damning others? Is it cruelty or perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hinder them from ticing ſouls to Hell, as long as they may freely go thither themſelves? I ſhould rather think, that if we did our beſt to ſave themſelves, it were far from crucity. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if Infidel, or Papiſts Books be prohibited, what cruelty or perſecution is this? If Quakers be hindred from railing at Gods Ordinances in the open ſtreets and Aſsemblies, what cruelty or perſecution is this? But ſome think it enough for this Toleration, that they think as confidently they are in the right, as we do that they err! And ſo do Heathens, Mahometans, and Infidels. And what! Shall every man have leave to do evil, that can but be ignorant enough to think, (or ſay he thinks) that he doth well? And muſt Magiſtrates rule as men that are uncertain whether there be a Chriſt, or a Church, or a Heaven, or Hell, becauſe ſome are found in their Dominions ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh or impious as to be uncertain of it? In plain Engliſh, is it any hinderance to mens ſalvation, and furtherance of their damnation, to be made Infidels, Papiſts, and ſuch as deny the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, or not? If not; then away with Chriſtianity and Reformation. Why do we pretend to it our ſelves? But if it be; will merciful Rulers ſet up a trade for butchering of ſouls? and allow men to ſet up a ſhop of poiſon for all to buy and take that will? yea to proclaim this poiſon
<pb facs="tcp:34706:8"/>
for ſouls, in ſtreets and Church aſſemblies, as if mens ſouls were no more worth than Rats or Mice, or hurtful vermine, or it were ſome noble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement to ſend as many as may be to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Judge impartially, whether all this be not for want of <hi>ſelf-denial?</hi> If ſelfiſh intereſt led them not to this, and if they were more tender of the Intereſt of Chriſt than of their own, and of mens ſouls than of their fleſh, it would not be thus. But the ſame argument that tempts the ſenſual to Hell, doth tempt ſuch Magiſtrates to ſet up Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for drawing men to Hell. The wicked ſell their ſouls to ſpare their fleſh, and let go Heaven to enjoy the Liberty of ſinning; and run into Hell to ſcape the trouble of an holy life: And ſuch Magiſtrates ſell the peoples ſouls to ſpare the fleſh of the deceivers; and in tenderneſs and mercy to their bodies, they dare not reſtrain men from ſeeking their damnation. Is faith and holineſs propagated by perſwaſion, and not by force? Surely then Infidelity, Popery and Ungodlineſs, are propagated by perſwaſion too! Again I tell you, <hi>ſelf-love</hi> doth make ſuch Rulers wiſer than to grant Commiſſion or Liberty to all that will, to tice their ſouldiers to mutinies or rebellion, their wives to Adultery, their children to prodigality, or their ſervants to thievery: But the love of Chriſt and mens ſalvation is not ſo ſtrong as to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them whether men ſhould be hindred from raiſing mutinies in his Church, and from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:34706:8"/>
ſouls! Forſooth, they tell us that Chriſt is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to look to his own cauſe. Very true (and they ſhall one day know it.) But muſt he not therefore teach or rule by men? Is not Adultery, Murder, Theft, Rebellion, againſt the Cauſe of Chriſt, and his Laws, as well as Popery and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity? And muſt they therefore be let alone by man? Chriſt is ſufficient to Teach the world, as well as to Govern. But doth it follow that men muſt be no Teachers under him? Nothing but <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> could cauſe this blindneſs.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I know, that this ſtream proceeds from the <hi>Roman</hi> ſpring, and it is their great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to perſwade the world, that it belongs not to Magiſtrates to meddle with Religion, but only to cheriſh them that the Pope approveth of, and to puniſh thoſe whom the Pope condemns, and that Chriſt muſt Govern and judge of matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion himſelf, that is, by his pretended <hi>Roman</hi> Vicechriſt, I ſhall only now ſay this: that if <hi>Rome</hi> were acquainted with <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> and if the <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh</hi> carnal intereſt of Riches and Rule and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greatneſs, had not blinded them, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have believed themſelves, that Chriſt did appoint the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be his Univerſal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car; and that Princes and Magiſtrates in their own Dominions, have not more Power to judge who is to be tolerated or puniſhed by the ſword, than the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> when no Prieſt or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late upon earth (as ſuch) hath any thing to do with
<pb facs="tcp:34706:9"/>
ſuch a judgement, no not in the places where they live. All that they have to do herein, is to judge who is the Heretick or offendor in order to his cenſure and excommunication: But it's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates only that muſt judge who is the Heretick or effendor in order to corporal puniſhment or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. And this I undertake to make good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Papiſts in the world: much more that the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyrant, hath no ſuch Power at the Antipodes, and in all the Chriſtian Nations on earth.</p>
            <p>Remember in all this, that I ſpeak not againſt a Toleration of Godly tolerable men, <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptiſt, &amp;c.</hi> that will walk in <hi>Charity, Peace and Concord; ☞ we ſhall never be well till theſe are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But do we not know that Papiſts have <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> at hand to help them? And that if we grant them ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as ſhall ſtrengthen them and make way for their power, we give away our own liberty, and are preparing faggots for our martyrdom, and giving away the Goſpel that by wonders of mercy hath been till now preſerved, (and I hope ſhall be preſerved in deſpite of <hi>Rome</hi> and Hell.) Nor yet do I plead for <hi>any cruelty</hi> againſt a Papiſt, but for a neceſſary <hi>Defence</hi> of the intereſt of Chriſt and the ſouls of men, and the hopes of our poſterity. True Humanity abhorreth cruelty.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:34706:9"/>Did Magiſtrates well know their dependence upon God, and that they are his officers, and muſt make him their end, they would not take their <hi>flocks</hi> to be their <hi>maſters,</hi> though they may take them for their charge; nor would they ſet up a carnal intereſt of the multitude, againſt the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, and mens ſalvation: nor would they think ſo highly of mens conceits and wills as to judge it a matter of ſo much moment, to allow them in Religion to ſay or do what they liſt.

If the rattling of the hail of perſecution on the tiles, even on this fleſh, which is but the tabernacle of our ſouls be a terrible thing;
<pb facs="tcp:34706:13"/>
how much more terrible is the indignation of the Lord, and the threats of him that is a conſuming fire! If you can venture your life againſt an enemy in the field, we are baſtards and not Chriſtians if we cannot venture ours, and give them up to perſecuting rage, as long as we know that we have a Maſter that will ſave us harmleſs, and that the God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us, &amp; that he hath charged us not to fear them that kill the body, and after that can do no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he hath told us that we are bleſſed when men revile us and perſecute us, and ſay all manner of evil againſt us falſly for his ſake; bidding us, <hi>Rejoyce and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad, for great is our reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets that were before us,</hi> Mat. 5. 10, 11, 12. and when we are told that he that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever will loſe his life, for the ſake of Chriſt, ſhall finde it, <hi>Mat. 16. 25.</hi> and when we know that we own a cauſe that ſhall prevail at laſt, and reſiſt them <hi>whoſe end ſhall be according to their works,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 15.</p>
            <p>And what though this be unknown to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers? That will not warrant <hi>us</hi> to betray a cauſe that <hi>we know</hi> to be of God; nor will the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of others excuſe us, for neglecting known truth and duty. If the ſouls of private perſons be worth all the ſtudy and labour of our lives, and we muſt deal faithfully with them, whatever
<pb facs="tcp:34706:14"/>
it ſhall coſt us: ſurely the ſafety of a Nation, and the hopes of our poſterity, and the publick intereſt of Chriſt, is worthy to be ſpoken for with much more zeal, and we may ſuffer more joyfully, for contradicting a publick deſtroyer of the Church, than for telling a poor drunkard or whoremonger of his ſin and miſery.</p>
            <p>Hither to I have permitted my pen to expreſs my ſenſe of the common want of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> in the Land: Now give me leave, as your moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate faithful friend, to turn my ſtile a little to your ſelf, and earneſtly to entreat of you theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>I. In general, that as long as you live you will watch againſt this common deadly ſin of <hi>Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and ſtudy continually the duty of <hi>Self-denial.</hi> We ſhall be empty of Chriſt, till we are <hi>Nothing</hi> in our <hi>ſelves.</hi> Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Self</hi> is the ſtrongeſt and moſt dangerous enemy that ever you fought againſt. It is a whole Army united; and the more dangerous becauſe ſo near. Many that have fought as valiantly and ſucceſsfully againſt other enemies as you, have at laſt been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and undone by <hi>Self.</hi> And conquer it you cannot without a conflict: And the conflict muſt endure as long as you live: And <hi>combating</hi> is not <hi>pleaſing</hi> to the <hi>enemy:</hi> And therefore as long as <hi>ſelf</hi> is the enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>ſelf-pleaſing</hi> ſo natural to corrupted man, (that ſhould be wholly addicted
<pb facs="tcp:34706:14"/>
to pleaſe the Lord)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Self-denial</hi> will prove a difficult task: And if ſomewhat in the <hi>advice</hi> that would engage you deeper in the conflict, ſhould ſeem <hi>bitter, or ungrateful,</hi> I ſhould not wonder. And let me freely tell you, that your <hi>proſperity</hi> and advancement will make the work ſo <hi>exceeding difficult,</hi> that ſince you have been a Major General, and a Lord, and now a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of State, you have ſtood in a more ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perillous place, and have need of much more grace and vigilancy, than when you were but <hi>Baxter's Friend.</hi> Great places and employments have great temptations, and are great avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind from God. And no errour ſcarcely can be ſmall, that is committed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick great Affairs; which the honour of God, and the temporal and ſpiritual welfare of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, do, in ſomeſort, depend upon. Theſe times have told us to our grief, what <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> can do, to ſtrengthen the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> principle in men: They have ſwallowed <hi>Camels</hi> ſince they were <hi>lifted up,</hi> that would have ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Gnats in a lower ſtate. The Miniſtery, and Ordinances, and Holy Communion that once were ſweet to them, are grown into contempt. <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury</hi> and <hi>Wormwood</hi> are excellent helps to procure an appetite, and ſtrengthen the ſtomach; but marrow and ſweetneſs breed a loathing. The Vertiginous diſeaſe is not ſo ſtrong with them that are on the ground, as with them that
<pb facs="tcp:34706:15"/>
ſtand on the top of a ſteeple. I had rather twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times look up at them that are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, than ſtand with them, and have the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of looking down. Had not profeſſors been intoxicated by proſperity, they had not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> and <hi>lived</hi> ſo <hi>giddily.</hi> I have often ſeen mens reaſon marr'd with a cup or two <hi>too much,</hi> but ſeldom by <hi>too little.</hi> And too many I have known, that have wounded conſcience and ſold their ſouls for the love of <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Wealth;</hi> but none that ever did it for <hi>Poverty.</hi> For a rich man to be ſaved is <hi>impoſſible to man,</hi> though <hi>all things are poſſible with God,</hi> Matth. 19. 26. Luke 18. 27. For my own part, I bleſs God that hath kept me from greatneſs in the world, and I take it as the principal act of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> that ever you did for me, that you provoked me to this ſweet, though fleſh-diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing life, of the Miniſtry, in which I have <hi>choſen</hi> to abide. I had rather lie in health on the hardeſt bed, than be ſick upon the ſofteſt. And I ſee that a fether-bed maketh not a ſick man well. The ſleep of the labouring man is ſweet: The plow-mans brown bread and cheeſe, is more ſavoury to him, and breedeth fewer ſickneſſes, than the fulneſs and variety of the rich. This Country Diet doth not cheriſh Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, Arrogancy, Vain-glory, Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs, Uncharitableneſs, and other <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> diſeaſes, ſo much as worldly greatneſs doth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34706:15"/>Experience telleth us that moſt men are beſt in a low eſtate: inſomuch that a bad man in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſpeak better, and ſeem more penitent and mortified, than many better men in health. It's a wonderful hard thing to live like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in a full proſperity; and to be above this world, and have lively apprehenſions of the inviſible things, and live a heavenly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Health and Wealth, when our fleſh hath ſo much proviſion at hand, to accommodate and pleaſe it. Proſperity doth powerfully corrupt the mind: It breedeth many dangerous errors, and vices; and it maketh uſeleſs that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which men have: ſo that though ſuch men can ſpeak the ſame words as another, about the matters of the life to come, it is but dreamingly, and without life. Their Knowledge hath but little power on their hearts and lives. The <hi>world</hi> is ſo <hi>Great</hi> with them, which is as <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>everlaſting life</hi> are as <hi>nothing</hi> to them which are <hi>All.</hi> They are ſo <hi>full</hi> of the creature that they have no room for <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and ſo buſie about <hi>Earth,</hi> that they have but little time for <hi>Heaven:</hi> and taſte ſo much ſweetneſs in their preſent pomp, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reliſh the true and durable delights. They know their <hi>Morals,</hi> as they know ſome Aſtronomical, or Geometrical verities, by an opinion or uneffectual Knowledge: ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they <hi>Know not</hi> what they Know, <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi>

            <p>How little is there in a proſperous ſtate, that ſhould ſeem deſirable in a wiſe mans eyes? why is it that great Travellers and Stateſmen, and all that have moſt tryed the world, deſire to withdraw from it toward the evening of their Age, and to retire themſelves into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, that they may there look towards eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, and cry out of the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which they have here found? Muſt we not conceive them wiſer after much <hi>experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I would not for all the world have been without the advantages of looking death ſo often in the face, as I have done ſince you firſt knew me. If I have been but a while without
<pb facs="tcp:34706:16"/>
this ſight, and have but conceited that yet I have many years to live, alas, how it hath enervated my Knowledge and my Meditations! So that twenty times thinking the ſame holy thoughts, will not do ſo much as once will do, when I ſeem to be nearer my everlaſting ſtate.</p>
            <p>And what doth worldly greatneſs add to your real worth in the eyes of God or of wiſe men? Magiſtracy as a thing Divine I honour: But <hi>James</hi> hath taught me, not to be partial to the rich as rich, and call up the man with the Gold Ring and gay attire, and ſay to the poor, Sit there at my footſtool. As to be proud of fine cloaths is a childiſh or womaniſh piece of folly, below a man: ſo to be proud of <hi>Victories,</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> and wealth, and worldly honours, is the vanity of an Infidel or Atheiſt, and below a Chriſtian that hath the hopes of heaven. If a man be holy, he is above his worldly greatneſs, and beareth it as his burden, and feareth it as his ſnare. And if he be <hi>Carnal,</hi> he is the faſter in his miſery; and golden fetters are ſtronger than any others. A pebble-ſtone on the top of <hi>Atlas</hi> is but a pebble: and a Pearl is a Pearl in the bottom of the Sea. A nettle on the top of a mountain is but a nettle: and a <hi>Cedar</hi> in the loweſt valley is a <hi>Cedar.</hi> If God dwell with the contrite, and have reſpect to him that is poor and humble, and trembleth at his word, it ſeems they are moſt to be reſpected, and are the
<pb facs="tcp:34706:17"/>
moſt honourable, if God can put more honour upon us by his approbation than man. God will not ask us, <hi>where we have grown</hi> (in order to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification) but <hi>what fruit we have born?</hi> nor whether we were Rich or poor? but whether we were <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>unholy?</hi> nor <hi>what was our ſtation?</hi> but <hi>How we behaved our ſelves in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proſperity uſually breedeth a <hi>tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>ſickly</hi> frame of ſoul, ſo that we can ſcarce look out of door, but our affections take cold; and can ſcarce feed on the moſt wholſome food, but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with ſome loathing, or turn it to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome diſeaſe.

Though our life be nor circular, but progreſſive, the end as to our naturals, is liker to the beginning than to the middle. If we die not children, yet liker to Children than we live.

To this end I crave your obſervation of theſe few unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable precepts.</p>
            <p>1. Take heed of Unbelief, and dread all temptations tending to it, and live by that faith which maketh abſent things to be to you as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and things unſeen as if they were ſeen. When Heaven once loſeth its intereſt in the ſoul, the world may play Rex and delude and deſtroy us at its pleaſure.</p>
            <p>2. Take heed of all intruſions of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs:</hi> Eſpecially <hi>☞ overvalue not your own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the things of God.</hi> Draw not a <hi>great picture</hi> of a <hi>little man.</hi> Be not eaſily drawn to <hi>contemn the judgements of thoſe</hi> that have ſearched the holy Scriptures with <hi>equal diligence</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> and with much more <hi>advantages</hi> of <hi>retirdeneſs,</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> than you.</p>
            <p>3. Take heed of engaging your hand, or tongue, or ſecret thoughts, againſt the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt: But further the work of
<pb facs="tcp:34706:19"/>
Chriſt in their hands with all your power. I am no Prophet, but yet preſume to ſay, <hi>☞ that if the reproaches of a faithful Miniſtry in</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>be purg'd away without ſome dreadful judgment of God on the Apoſtate reproachers, or elſe a deſertion of the Nation, by a removing of our glory, I ſhall wonder at the patience and forbearance of the Lord.</hi> It's a dreadful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, to ſee ſo much of the ſpirit of <hi>Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> poſſeſſing thoſe that once ſaid, they fought againſt <hi>Malignants.</hi> And that the Miniſters and ſervants of the Lord, are railed at by many of them, as formerly they were by the worſt of thoſe that their hands deſtroyed: And with this dreadful aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that then it was but <hi>ſome</hi> that were reviled, and now with many it is <hi>all:</hi> then it was under the name of Puritans and Round-heads, and now it is openly as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> under the name of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Pulpeteers.</hi> What have theſe <hi>ſouls done,</hi> that they are ſo far forſaken by the Lord! The <hi>judge</hi> of all the world is <hi>at the door,</hi> that will plead his ſervants cauſe in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. It is hard kicking againſt the pricks. He that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not men, but God. <hi>Perſecution</hi> under <hi>pretence of Liberty,</hi> is heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> and is one of the greateſt ſins in the world. But men are not catcht in Spiders webs, though flies are: our Lord will make us a way to eſcape. Perſecution never

conquered Chriſt, And becauſe he lives, we ſhall live alſo. Here is the faith &amp; patience of the Saints.</p>
            <p>I know that malice wants not words to cloak their iniquity, He that hath will and power to do hurt, hath ſo much wit as to pretend ſome reaſon for it: Though I think that malice did never walk more nakedly, ſince the Primitive perſecutions, than it doth in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> at this day. Their principles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found contrivances they can <hi>hide;</hi> but their <hi>Malignity</hi> goes ſtark naked, and is almoſt grown paſt ſhame. They talk againſt <hi>Mercenary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> as if they had never read <hi>1 Cor. 9.

But the matter is, that their wit is too ſcant and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their malice; and therefore the Popiſh and Malignant enemies have no fairer pretence to caſt out the Miniſtry, than by this engaging the Covetouſneſs of the ignorant and ungodly ſort againſt them. They talk of our want of a juſt call: But what is it in point of Calling that is wanting? <hi>Abilities</hi> ſay ſome; <hi>Succeſſion</hi> ſay
<pb facs="tcp:34706:20"/>
others; <hi>Miracles</hi> ſay others; and indeed it's what the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men doth dictate to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers. O that they would tell us what is the due Call; and where is the Miniſtery on Earth that hath it, if we have not? If they would have all laid by that work not Miracles, we may ſee what they would have done to the Church. If we are not what they would have us be, and do not what they would have us do, why do they not come in charity and meekneſs, and ſhew us the courſe that we ſhould take? If we are fools or beſides our ſelves, it is for them. The God whom we ſerve, that will ſhortly judge us, is our witneſs, that we have choſen the Calling that we are in, for their ſalvation, and for his glory; and that we labour in it in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon topleaſe Chriſt, and to profit them, rather than to pleaſe or accommodate our fleſh. <hi>You</hi> brought <hi>me</hi> into the Miniſtry: I am confident you know to what ends, and with what inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I deſired it: I was then <hi>very ignorant, young</hi> and <hi>raw:</hi> Though my weakneſs be yet ſuch as I muſt lament, I muſt ſay, to the praiſe of the great Shepherd of the ſlock, that he hath ſince then afforded me precious opportunities, much aſſiſtance, and as much <hi>encouragement</hi> as to any man that I know alive. You know my Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and initial weakneſs was ſuch as forbiddeth me to glory in the fleſh: But I will not rob God of his Glory, to avoid the appearance of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:34706:21"/>
leſt I be proud of ſeeming not to be proud. I doubt not but many thouſand ſouls will thank you, when they have here read that you were the man that led me into the Miniſtry. And ſhall I entertain a ſuſpicion, that you will ever hearken to thoſe men, that would rob you of the reward of many ſuch works, and engage you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of Saints? Is it <hi>gain,</hi> or <hi>eaſe,</hi> or <hi>worldly advantages</hi> that continueth me in this work? Let me ſpeak as a fool, ſeeing it is for the Lord in imitation of <hi>Paul</hi> that was no fool. Was I not capable of Secular and Military ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement as well as others that are grown great? Did I ever ſollicite you ſo much as for my Arrears (which is many hundred pounds?) You could ſcarce do the thing that would gratifie <hi>my fleſh</hi> more, than to ſilence and depoſe me from the Miniſtry. Might I conſult with the fleſh, I ſhould be more againſt my own employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than many of my enemies are. Did I but turn Phyſitian, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uld get more world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth: And my Patients would not be ſo froward, and quarrelſome, and unthankful, as moſt Miniſters find their carnal Auditors to be. When men come to me for Phyſick for their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> how ſubmiſſive are they? and how do they intreat? and what thanks after will they return? But when we would help their ſouls, what cavils, and quarrels, and unthankful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy do we meet with? We muſt be much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
<pb facs="tcp:34706:21"/>
to them to accept our help, and all will not ſerve ſurn. My Patients that have bodily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes will pay me, if I would take it: But if by <hi>giving them twice as much as I receive,</hi> I could ſatisfie and further the cure of diſeaſed ſouls, how joyful ſhould I be? And muſt we deny our ſelves and all things in the world, for our peoples ſakes, and after all be reproached as if we were a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary generation,</hi> and ſought our ſelves! O how will God confound this ingratitude, when he comes to judge!</p>
            <p>Something they might ſay, if the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> had the proviſion of the French and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popiſh Clergy. (I will not preſume to compare now our Calling, fidelity and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with Magiſtrates, Judges and men of other profeſsions.) Should I ſuppoſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy epitomized in you, and the Miniſtery in me, I ſhould give you an undue advantage: For I ſuppoſe there are far more Miniſters better than me, than there are Magiſtrates better than you. And yet I think you would not judge of me, as the Miniſters are judged of. As there are no ſuch Commiſsioners for ejection of ſcandalous inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient negligent Magiſtrates, as are for the ejection of ſuch Miniſters, ſo if there were, I ſhould not doubt, but you would quickly ſee which part were liable to more exceptions. But when I took on the faithful Miniſters round about me, (how many of them could I name!) with whom
<pb facs="tcp:34706:22"/>
my conſcience tells me I am not worthy to be compared in Holineſs, I am then amazed at the ingratitude of the Apoſtates of this age. How conſtantly and zealouſly do they preach in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, at home and abroad, ſome of them many times a week? How diligently do they inſtruct the ignorant in private, from houſe to houſe? How unblameably, and meekly, and ſelf-denyingly do they behave themſelves? And are men that once made profeſsion of Religion, become the enemies of ſuch a Miniſtry? <hi>[O my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret; unto their Aſſembly mine honour be not thou united]</hi> Gen. 49. 6. I had rather be in the caſe of Turks, yea of Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, than of thoſe men.</p>
            <p>I know that many think our very ignorant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders to have more illumination, and that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the flocks are carnal ignorant men: (As the blind man that ruſht againſt another, and asked him, whether he were blind, that could not go out of his way.) But I have long tryed the ſpirits; and I have found that theſe Cameleons have nothing within but lungs: and that ſtraw and little ſticks may make the quickeſt and the lighteſt blaze, but will not make a durable fire, as the bigger fewel doth.

            <p>I Here preſent to your ſerious conſideration, a Subject of ſuch Neceſſity and Conſequence, that the Peace and ſafety of Churches, Nations, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and ſouls do lie upon it. The Eternal God was the Beginning and the End, the Intereſt, the attractive, the confidence, the deſire, the delight, the All of man in his upright uncorrupted State. Though the Creator planted in mans Nature the principle of Natural Self-love, as the ſpring of his endeavours for Self-preſervation, and a notable part of the engine by which he governeth the world, yet were the parts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Whole, and the <hi>whole</hi> to God: And Self-love did ſubſerve the Love of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> and of God: and man deſired his own Preſervation, for theſe higher Ends. When <hi>ſia</hi> ſtept in, it broke this order:
<pb facs="tcp:34706:24"/>
and taking advantage from the natural innocent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Self-love, it turned man from the Love of God, and much abated his Love to his neighbour and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, and turned him to Himſelf by an inordinate ſelf-love, which terminateth in <hi>himſelf,</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in his <hi>Carnal-ſelf,</hi> inſtead of God and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good: ſo that <hi>Self</hi> is become <hi>All</hi> to Corrupted nature, as <hi>God</hi> was <hi>All</hi> to Nature in its integrity. <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> is the ſouls Idolatry, and Adultery: the ſum of its <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>increaſed</hi> Pravity, the Beginning and End, the life and ſtrength of actual ſin: even as the Love of God is the Rectitude and Fidelity of the ſoul, and the ſum of all our ſpecial Grace, and the Heart of the new Creature, and the life and ſtrength of actual holineſs. <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> in one word expreſſeth all our Averſion Poſitively, <hi>as the want of the Love of God</hi> expreſſeth it <hi>Privatively;</hi> and all our <hi>ſin</hi> is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily in theſe two: Even as all our Holineſs is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily in the <hi>Love of God</hi> and in <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> It is the work of the Holy Ghoſt by ſanctifying grace to bring off the ſoul again from <hi>Self</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> Self-denial therefore is half the eſſence of Sanctification. No man hath any more <hi>Holineſs,</hi> than he hath <hi>Self-denial.</hi> And therefore the Law, (which the Sanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit writeth on the heart) doth ſet up <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and our neighbour in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> againſt the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation and encroachment of this <hi>Self.</hi> It ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Love or Duty to our ſelves as ſuch expreſly. In ſeeking the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Pleaſing of God,</hi> and the <hi>Good of our neighbour,</hi> we ſhall moſt certainly <hi>find</hi> our own <hi>Felicity,</hi> which <hi>nature</hi> teacheth us to <hi>deſire.</hi> So that all the Law is Fulfilled in <hi>Love,</hi> which includeth <hi>Self-denial,</hi> as <hi>Light</hi> includeth the <hi>expulſion</hi> of <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> rather as <hi>Loyalty</hi> includeth a Ceſſation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and a rejection of the Leaders of it, and as
<pb facs="tcp:34706:24"/>
conjugal fidelity includeth the rejection of Harlots. The very meaning of the firſt Commandment is [<hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c.] which is the ſum of the firſt Table, and the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that animateth all the reſt. The very meaning of the laſt Commandment is [<hi>Thou ſhalt Love thy neighbour as thy ſelf</hi>] which is the ſummary of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, and in General forbiddeth all particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to others, not enumerated in the fore-going pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and ſecondarily animateth the four antecedent precepts. The fifth Commandment looking to both Tables, and conjoyning them, commandeth us to Honour our Superiours in Authority; both as they are the Officers of God, and ſo paticipatively <hi>Divine,</hi> and as they are the <hi>Heads</hi> of humane Societies, and our ſubjection neceſſary to Common good, ſo that <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is principally required in the <hi>firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that is, The <hi>denying</hi> of <hi>ſelf</hi> as oppoſite to God, and his Intereſt. And <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is required in the Laſt Commandment; that is, The denying of <hi>ſelf,</hi> as it is an enemy to our neighbours Right and welfare, and would draw from him unto our <hi>ſelves. Self-love</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> as oppoſite to our neighbours good, is the thing forbidden in that Commandment: and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Loving our neighbour as our ſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his Welfare as our own, is the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Self-denial</hi> is required in the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a double reſpect, according to the double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Commandment. 1. In reſpect to God, whoſe Governing Authority is exerciſed by Governours, their Power being a beam of his Majeſty, the fifth Commandment requireth us to deny our ſelves by due ſubjection, and by honouring our Superiours; that is, to deny our own aſpiring deſires, and our refractory minds, and diſobedient <hi>ſelf-willedneſs,</hi> and to take
<pb facs="tcp:34706:25"/>
heed that we ſuffer not within us, any proud or rebellious diſpoſitions or thoughts, that would lift us up above our Rulers, or exempt us from ſubjection to them. 2. In reſpect to humane Societies, for whoſe Good Authority and Government is appointed, the fifth Commandment obligeth us to deny our Private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and in all competitions to prefer the publick good: and maketh a promiſe of temporal peace and welfare in a ſpecial manner to thoſe that in obedience to this Law, do prefer the Honour of Government, and the Publick Peace and welfare, before their <hi>Own.</hi> Thus <hi>Charity</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and including <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,</hi> is the very <hi>ſum</hi> and <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Law: And <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is the radical comprehenſive ſin (containing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs) which breaks it all.</p>
            <p>And as the Law, ſo alſo the Redeemer, in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and his Doctrine, doth teach us, and that more plainly and urgently, this leſſon of ſelf-denial. The life of Chriſt is the pattern which the Church muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to imitate: And <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> were the ſummary of his life: Though yet he had no <hi>ſinful ſelf</hi> to deny, but only <hi>natural ſelf.</hi> He denyed <hi>himſelf</hi> in <hi>avoiding ſin;</hi> but we muſt deny our ſelves in <hi>returning from</hi> it. He loved not his Life, in compariſon of his love to his Father, and to his Church. He appeared without deſirable form or comelineſs: <hi>He was deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and rejected of men; a man of ſorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with grief: he bore our griefs, and carryed our ſorrows, and was eſteemed ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted: he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was laid upon him: the Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all. He was oppreſſed and afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſheerers is
<pb facs="tcp:34706:25"/>
dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth. He was taken from priſon and from judgement—he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the tranſgreſſion of his people was he ſtricken:—It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him; he put him to grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

What was his whole life, but the exerciſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial?</hi> He <hi>denyed himſelf</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> obeying him to the death, and pleaſing him in all things.

He denyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo in obedient ſubmiſſion to Governours. He was ſubject to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 2. 51. He paid tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and wrought a Miracle for money rather than it ſhould be unpaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 24, 25, 26. He diſowned a perſonal worldly Kingdom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36. when the people would have made him a King, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 15. as being not a Receiver, but a giver of Kingdoms: He would not ſo much as once play the part of a Judge or divider of inheritances, teaching men that they muſt be juſtly <hi>made</hi> ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do the work of Magiſtrates, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 14.
<pb facs="tcp:34706:26"/>
And his Spirit in his Apoſtles teacheth us the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1, 5. And they ſeconded his example by their own, that we might be followers of them as they were of Chriſt. What elſe was the life of holy <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but a conſtant exerciſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Self-denial?</hi> Labouring and travelling night and day, enduring the baſeſt uſage from the world, and undergoing indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and manifold ſufferings from unthankful men, that they might pleaſe the Lord and edifie and ſave the ſouls of men; and living in poverty that they might help the world to the everlaſting riches. In a word, as <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the whole Law, as to the poſitive part, ſo is <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> the evil that ſtands in contrariety thereto, even <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs, ſelf-willedneſs, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeeking;</hi> and thus far <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is the ſum of our obedience as to the <hi>terminus à quo:</hi> and Chriſt hath peremptorily determined in his Goſpel, that <hi>If any man will come after him, he muſt deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and take up his Croſs and follow him: and that whoſoever</hi> will put in a reſerve, but for the <hi>ſaving of his Life, ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever will loſe his life for his ſake ſhall find it,</hi> Matth. 16. 24, 25. And that he that doth not follow him, bearing his Croſs, and that <hi>forſaketh not all he hath for him, cannot be his Diſciple,</hi> Luke 14. 27, 33.</p>
            <p>According to the nature of theſe holy rules &amp; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is the nature of theworkings of the Spirit of Chriſt upon the ſoul: He uſually beginneth in ſhewing manhis ſin and miſery, his utter inſufficiency to help himſelf, his alienation from God, and enmity to him, his blindneſs and deadneſs, his emptineſs and nothingneſs, and then he brings him from himſelf to Chriſt, and ſheweth him his fulneſs and ſufficiency, and by Chriſt he cometh to the Father, and God doth receive his own again. It
<pb facs="tcp:34706:26"/>
is one half of the work of Sanctification, to caſt <hi>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Selves</hi> from our <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> our <hi>Wills,</hi> our <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and our <hi>Converſations;</hi> to ſubdue <hi>ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſelf-willedneſs, ſelf-love</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeeking:</hi> to mortifie our carnal wiſdom, and our Pride, and our concupiſcence, and our earthly members: And the other (and chiefeſt part) conſiſteth in ſetting up God where <hi>ſelf</hi> did rule: that his Wiſdom may be our Guide; his Will, our Law; his Goodneſs the chiefeſt object of our Love, and his ſervice the work &amp; buſineſs of our lives. The Spirit doth convince us that we are not our <hi>Own,</hi> and have no power at all to diſpoſe of our ſelves or any thing we have, but under God, as he commands us: It convinceth us that God is our <hi>Owner</hi> and abſolute Lord, and that as we are wholly his, ſo we muſt be wholly devoted to him, and prefer his intereſt before our own, and have no intereſt of our own, but what is his, as derived from him, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to him; <hi>Fear</hi> doth begin this work of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial;</hi> but it's <hi>Love</hi> that brings us up to ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtate of corrupted man, is a ſtate of <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs,</hi> and ſervitude to his own Concupiſcence; where pride and ſenſuality bear rule; and have no more reſiſtance, than now and then ſome frightening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual check.</p>
            <p>When God is calling men out of this corrupted <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh</hi> ſtate, he uſually (or oft at leaſt) doth caſt them into a ſtate of <hi>Fear;</hi> awakening them to ſee their loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and terrifying them by the Belief of his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and the ſenſe of his indignation; and making uſe of their <hi>Self-love,</hi> to cauſe them to fly from the wrath to come, and to cry out to the meſſengers of Chriſt, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34706:27"/>Some by theſe <hi>Fears</hi> are but troubled and reſtrained a little while, and quickly overcoming them, ſettle again in their <hi>ſelfiſh ſenſual</hi> ſenſeleſs ſtate: ſome have the beginnings of holy <hi>Love</hi> conjunct with Fear (of whom more anon.) And ſome do from this principle of <hi>Self-love</hi> alone, betake themſelves to a kind of Religious courſe, and forſake the practiſe of thoſe groſſer ſins that bred their <hi>Fears,</hi> and fall upon the practiſe of Religious duties, and alſo with ſome kind of <hi>faith</hi> do truſt on the ſatisfaction and merits of Chriſt, that by this means they may get ſome <hi>hopes</hi> that they ſhall eſcape the everlaſting miſery which they fear. All this Religion, that is animated by <hi>Fear alone,</hi> without the <hi>Love of God and Holineſs,</hi> is but preparatory to a ſtate of grace; and if men <hi>reſt</hi> here, it is but a ſtate of Hypocriſie or ſelf-deceiving religiouſneſs: For it is ſtill the old Principle of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> that reigns.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds. They love not a life of perfect holineſs, though they are forced to ſubmit to ſome kind o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Religiouſneſs, for fear of being dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If they had their freeſt choice, they had rather live in the Love of the creature, than in the love of God; and in the pleaſures of the fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, than in the holy courſe that pleaſeth God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34706:27"/>The third ſtate, is the ſtate of <hi>Love:</hi> and none but this is a ſtate of true <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and of Juſtification and Salvation. When we reach to this, we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere: we have then the Spirit of Adoption, diſpoſing us to go to God as to a Father.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Love</hi> is not in the ſame degree in all the ſanctified. Three degrees of it we may diſtinctly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. 1. Oft-times in the beginning of a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, though the ſeed of Love is caſt into the ſoul, and the Convert had rather enjoy God, than the world, and had rather live in perfect holineſs, than in any ſin, yet <hi>Fear</hi> is ſo active, that he ſcarce obſerveth the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Love</hi> of God within him: He is ſo taken up with the ſenſe of ſin and miſery, that he hath little ſenſe of love to God, and perhaps may doubt whether he hath any or none.</p>
            <p>2. When theſe <hi>Fears</hi> begin a little to abate, and the ſoul hath attained ſomewhat of the ſenſe of Gods Love to it ſelf, it Loveth him more obſervably, and hath ſome leiſure to think of the riches of his grace, and of his Infinite excellencies, and attractive goodneſs, and not only to Love him becauſe he Loveth us, and hath been Merciful to us, but alſo becauſe he is Goodneſs it ſelf, and we were made to Love him. But yet in this <hi>middle</hi> degree of Love, the ſoul is much more <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſenſibly</hi> exerciſed in minding it <hi>ſelf</hi> than God, and in ſtudying its <hi>own</hi> preſervation, than the honour an intereſt of the Lord. In this ſtate it is, that Chriſtians are almoſt all upon the inquiry after marks of Grace in themſelves; and asking [<hi>How ſhall I know that I have this or that grace, and that I perform this or that duty in ſincerity, and that I am reconciled to God, and ſhall be ſaved?</hi>] Which are needful que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, but ſhould not be more inſiſted on, than que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about our duty and the Intereſt of Chriſt. In
<pb facs="tcp:34706:28"/>
this ſtate, though a Chriſtian hath the Love of God yet having much of his ancient <hi>Fears,</hi> and Self-love, and the Love of God being yet too weak, he is much more in ſtudying his <hi>Safety</hi> than his <hi>Duty;</hi> and asketh oftner, How may I be ſure that I am a true believer? than, What is the duty of a true believer? There is yet too much of <hi>Self</hi> in his Religion.</p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>third</hi> degree of Love to God, the ſoul is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily and obſervably carryed quite above it ſelf to God; and mindeth more the Will and Intereſt of God, than its own Conſolation or Salvation: Not that we muſt at any time lay by the care of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if it were a thing that did not belong to us, or that we ſhould ſeparate the ordinate Love of our ſelves from the Love of God, or ſet his Glory and our Salvation in an oppoſition: But the Love of God, in <hi>this Degree,</hi> is <hi>ſenſibly predominant,</hi> and we refer even our <hi>own Salvation</hi> to his <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Will:</hi> In this Degree, a Chriſtian is grown more deeply ſenſible; <hi>he is not his own,</hi> but <hi>his</hi> that made him and redeemed him; and that his principal ſtudy muſt not be for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for God; and that his <hi>own</hi> intereſt is in it ſelf an inconſiderable thing, in compariſon of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Lord, and that Rewarding us with Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is Gods part, and loving and ſerving him is ours (aſſiſted by his grace;) and that the diligent ſtudy and practice of our duty, and the lively exerciſe of Love to God, is the ſureſt way to our Conſolation.</p>
            <p>In our <hi>firſt corrupt</hi> eſtate we are <hi>careleſs</hi> of <hi>our ſouls,</hi> and are taken up with earthly cares. In our eſtate of <hi>Preparation</hi> we are <hi>careful for our ſouls,</hi> but meerly from the principle of <hi>Self-love.</hi> In our <hi>firſt Degree</hi> of the <hi>ſtate of ſaving grace</hi> we have the Love of God in us; but it's little obſerved, by reaſon of the paſſionate fears and cares of our own ſalvation that moſt take us
<pb facs="tcp:34706:28"/>
up. In our ſecond degree of holy Love, we look more ſenſibly after God for himſelf, but ſo that we are yet <hi>moſt</hi> ſenſibly minding the Intereſt of our own ſouls, and enquiring after aſſurance of ſalvation. In our third Degree of ſaving grace, we ſtill continue the care of our ſalvation and an <hi>ordinate ſelf-love;</hi> but we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the Happineſs of <hi>Many,</hi> even of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his Will,</hi> is incomparably more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and deſirable than our own felicity: And therefore we ſet our ſelves to pleaſe the Lord, and ſtudy what is acceptable to him, and how we may do him all the ſervice that poſſibly we can, being confident that he will look to our felicity while we look to our duty; and that we cannot be miſerable while we are <hi>wholly his,</hi> and devoted to his ſervice. We are now more in the <hi>exerciſe of Grace,</hi> when before we were more in <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> whether we have it: Before we were wont to ſay, <hi>O that I were ſure that I love God in ſincerity!</hi> Now we are more in theſe deſires: <hi>O that I could know and love him more! and ſerve him better! that I knew more of his holy will, and could more fully accompliſh it! and O that I were more ſerviceable to him! and O that I could ſee the full proſperity of his Church, and the glory of his Kingdom!</hi> This high degree of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, doth cauſe us to take our <hi>ſelves</hi> as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> as <hi>All;</hi> and as before converſion we were careleſs of our <hi>ſouls,</hi> through ignorance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or ſecurity, and after converſion were <hi>careful of our ſouls,</hi> through the power of convincing awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace; ſo now we have ſomewhat <hi>above our ſouls</hi> (much more our bodies) to mind and care for: ſo that though ſtill we muſt examine and obſerve our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and that <hi>for our ſelves,</hi> yet <hi>more for God</hi> than <hi>for our ſelves:</hi> When we are mindful of God, he will not be
<pb facs="tcp:34706:29"/>
unmindful of us: When it is our care to pleaſe him, the reſt of our care we may caſt <hi>on</hi> him, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to care for us. Even when we ſuffer <hi>according to his will, we may commit the keeping of our ſouls to him in well doing as to a faithful Creator,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 19, And it is not poſſible in this <hi>more excellent way</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31) to be guilty of a careleſs neglect of our ſalvation, or of the want of a neceſſary Love to our ſelves; For the higher containeth the lower, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection containeth thoſe degrees that are found in the imperfect: This neglect of our <hi>ſelves</hi> through the Love of God, is conſequentially the moſt provident ſecuring of our ſelves: This careleſneſs is the wiſeſt care: This ignorance of good and evil for our ſelves, while we know the Lord, and know our duty, is the wiſeſt way to prevent the evil: To be <hi>ſomething</hi> in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> is to be Nothing: But if we be Nothing in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and God be All to us, in him we ſhall be <hi>ſomething.</hi> Be not wanting to God, and I am ſure you cannot be wanting to <hi>your ſelves.</hi> He will <hi>Reward,</hi> if you'l Obey.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you hitherto the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of <hi>Self-denial:</hi> O that I could next ſhew you the Nations, the Churches, that are ſuch indeed as I have deſcribed! But when I look into the world, when I look into the Churches of all ſorts, and conſider men of all degrees, my ſoul is even amazed and melted into grief; to think how far the forwardeſt profeſſors are ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their holy Rule and pattern! O grievous caſe! how rare are <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> men? Nothing in the world doth more aſſure me, that the number that ſhall be ſaved are very few: When nothing is more evident in Scripture, than that none but the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and nothing more evident in the world, than that <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> men are very few. Would
<pb facs="tcp:34706:29"/>
God but excuſe men in this one point, and take up with preaching and praying, and numbring our ſelves with the ſtricteſt party, then I ſhould hope that many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively would be ſaved. Would he give men leave to ſeek themſelves in a Religious way, and to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous only from a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> principle, and would he but abate men this <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> and the <hi>ſuperlative Love of God,</hi> I ſhould hope true godlineſs were not rare. But if <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> be the mark, the nature of a Saint, and this as effected by the <hi>Love of God,</hi> then alas, how thin are they in the world! and how weak is grace even in thoſe few! It is the daily grief of my ſoul to obſerve, how the world is captivated to it SELF; and what ſway this odious ſin doth bear among the forwardeſt profeſſors of Religion; and how blind men are that will not ſee it; and that it hath ſo far prevailed that few men lament it, or ſtrive againſt it, or will bear the moſt ſuitable remedy. Alas, when we have prevailed with careleſs ſouls, to mind their ſalvation, to read and pray, and hold communion with the godly, and ſeem well qualified Chriſtians, how few are brought to <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial!</hi> and how ſtrong is <hi>Self</hi> ſtill in thoſe few? What a multitude that ſeem of the higheſt form, in zeal, and opinions, and duties, delude themſelves with a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> kind of Religiouſneſs? And it grieveth my ſoul to think, how little the moſt excellent means prevail, even with Profeſſors themſelves, againſt this ſin! What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of labour ſeemeth to be loſt, that we beſtow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt i? When I have preached over all theſe following Sermons againſt it, (though grace hath made them effectual with ſome, yet) <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> ſtill too much bears ſway in many that heard them. O what a rooted ſin is this! How powerful and obſtinate! Men that ſeem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to hear, and like the Sermon, and write it, and repeat it when they come home, and commend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It was (doubtleſs) from too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> even of Profeſſors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the ſucceſsfulneſs of temptations in this kind, that Satan did tell God ſo boldly, that <hi>Job</hi> would ſin if he were but touched in his <hi>ſelf-intereſt, Job</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11. &amp; 2. 4, 5. [<hi>Doth</hi> Job (ſaith he) <hi>fear God for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing! haſt not thou made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide?

confidence had Satan, even againſt ſuch a ſervant of the Lord, [<hi>That there was none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, that feared God and eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evil</hi>] c. 1. 8. And though the power of grace in <hi>Job</hi> did ſhame the boaſts of Satan, yet how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he prevail with men that ſeem Religious? How truly may he ſay of many among us [<hi>Now they ſeem godly, but let the times turn, and godlineſs undo them in the world, and then ſee whether they will be godly: Now they ſeem faithful to their Paſtors and Brethren; but give them a ſufficient reward, and ſee whether they will not play the</hi> Judas: <hi>Now they ſeem peaceable humble men: but touch them in their ſelf-intereſt, croſs them in their commodity or reputation by an injury, yea or by juſtice or neceſſary reproof; and then ſee what they will prove</hi>] O that the Devil could not truly boaſt of thouſands that by a few foul words, or by croſſing their <hi>ſelf-willedneſs,</hi> he can make them ſpeak evil of their neighbours, and fill them with malice and bitterneſs againſt their trueſt friends. Oh where are the men that maintain their Love, and Meekneſs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord any longer than they are pleaſed, and their wills and intereſts are complyed with, or not much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted?</p>
            <p>Beſides what I have more largely ſpoken of this maſter common ſin, in the following Diſcourſe, take notice here of a few of the diſcoveries of it.</p>
            <p>1. Obſerve but the <hi>ſtriving that there is for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Dignity, and Riches,</hi> and this even among Profeſſors of Religion, and judge by this whether they are <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> men. Who is it for but themſelves that men make ſuch a ſtir, for Offices and Honours, and places of Superiority? Surely if it were for the good of others, they would not be ſo eager and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. We cannot perceive that their Charity is ſo h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

as to make them ſo Ambitious to be ſerviceable to their Brethren. If that be it, let them keep their ſervice till it be deſired or much needed, and not be ſo eager to do men good againſt their wills, and without neceſſity. As <hi>Greg. Mag.</hi> ſaith of the Miniſtry, [<hi>Si non ad elationis culpam, ſed ad utilitatem adipſci deſiderat, prius vires ſuas cum eo quidem ſubiturus onere metia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: ut &amp; impar abſtineat, &amp; ad id cum metu cui ſe ſufficere exiſtimat accedat.</hi>] Men uſe not to be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of duty or trouble. He that deſireth Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ultimately and principally for himſelf, deſireth Tyranny, and not a lawful Government, whoſe ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end is the common good. And will not the wrath of the King of Kings be kindled without ſo much ado, nor hell be purchaſed at cheaper rates, than all the contrivance, cares and hazards, that ambitious men do draw upon themſelves? <hi>O ambitio,</hi> (<hi>inquit</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus) <hi>ambientium crux, quomodo omnes torques? Omnibus places, nil acrius cruciat, nil moleſtius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietat, nil tamen apud miſeros mortales celebrius ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiis ejus.</hi>] Wonderful! that ſuch abundant warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tameth not theſe proud aſpiring minds! They ſet up or admired them but yeſterday, whom they ſee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down and deſpiſed to day, and ſee their honour turned to ſcorn, and yet they imitate their folly! They ſee the ſordid relicts of the moſt renouned Conquerours, and Princes levelled with the dirt; and yet they have not the wit to take warning, and humble themſelves that they may be exalted! They know how death will ſhortly uſe them, and read of the terrors that pride and ambition bring men to; but all this doth not bring them to their wits. When Death it ſelf comes, then they are as ſneaking ſhrinking worms as any: and the worm of ambition that fed upon their hearts in their proſperity, doth breed a gnawing worm in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
<pb facs="tcp:34706:31"/>
which will torment them everlaſtingly. But (<hi>ut Juvenal.</hi>)</p>

But if they think they are lightly or hardly thought of, or hear of any that ſpeak againſt them, or diſhonour them in the eyes of men, you ſhall ſee how little they can <hi>deny themſelves.</hi> O how the hearts of many that ſeemed god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, will ſwell againſt them that ſpeak to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement? What uncharitable, unchriſtian deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will a little injury produce? What bitter words! What eſtrangedneſs, and diviſion, if not plain hatred, and reviling, and revenge! Yea, it were well (in compariſon) if a due Reproof, from neighbours or from Miniſters (that are bound to do it by the Lord) would not draw forth this ſecret Venom, and ſhew the world the ſcarcity of <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> Let others ſpeak never ſo well of God, and of all good men, and be never ſo faithful or ſerviceable in the Church, yet if they do but ſpeak ill of them (though it's like deſervedly and juſtly) theſe <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men cannot abide them.

How contemptuouſly do they think and ſpeak of the perſons, the judgements, the writings, the reaſonings of any that are againſt them? Nay uſually they will not be perſwaded ſo much as once to read the writings that contradict them. Or if they do, it is with ſo much prejudice and partiality, that they have in their minds confuted them, before they read or underſtand them, and inſtead of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weight of arguments, and comparing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cauſe with cauſe, they only ſtudy what to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their adverſary (for ſo they account thoſe that would croſs or confute their opinions.)</p>

And as if we continued in an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of our ſelves, becauſe we are not of their party: when yet we deny no Proteſtants to be our Brethren, nor refuſe local Communion with them, ſo they will grant it us on Scripture-terms: which if they will not, we will yet hold communion with them in ſeveral Congregations. But thus it appeareth how ſtrong <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> is in the world; and how charitable men are to thoſe of their own opinions or parties, and how eaſily many do take liberty to ſpeak their pleaſure againſt any that are not of their mind.</p>
            <p>8. Obſerve alſo how <hi>forward men are to Teach, and how backward to be Learners,</hi> and then judge of their <hi>Self-denial.</hi> Why are ſo many unwilling to enter by the way of Ordination? but (too commonly) becauſe they judge better of their <hi>Own</hi> abilities than <hi>Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> do, and therefore ſuſpect that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the <hi>Ordainers,</hi> or diſgraced at the leaſt, while they think highly of themſelves. But if they
<pb facs="tcp:34706:38"/>
were <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> men, they would think the ſober, faithful Paſtors, much fitter Judges of their abilities than themſelves, and would not run before they are ſent. Many that reproach the Miniſters as deceivers, will needs be themſelves the Teachers of the people: As if they ſhould ſay, <hi>(We ſilly ignorant ſouls) are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and fitter to be Teachers than you: come down and let us take your places.</hi>] In conference you may obſerve that moſt are forwarder to <hi>ſpeak</hi> than to <hi>hear:</hi> which ſhews that they over-value their own underſtandings. And ſo much are Proud men delighted to be thought the Oracles of the world, that if you will but ſeem to hearken to them, and learn of them, and yield to their Opinions, you win their hearts, and ſhall be the men that have their commendations. Inſomuch that ſome late ambitious perſons, that have thought to riſe by the art of diſſimulation, have found that there is no way for the deceiving of the people, and procuring the good will of moſt, like this; even to ſeem to be of every mans opinion that they talk with, and to make every Sect and Party believe that they are their friends, and of their mind: Eſpecially, if you will ſeem to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their arguments, and give them the glory of your convictions and illuminations, you will then be the dearly beloved of their hearts. In all this you may ſee the rarity of <hi>ſelf-denial:</hi> Yea in the very work of God, too many of the moſt zealous godly Miniſters, that have been the inſtruments of converting many ſouls, are toucht a little with the temptation to this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> looking too much to their <hi>own</hi> part in the work.</p>
            <p>9. Obſerve but how commonly with men called Chriſtians, the <hi>intereſt of Chriſt is trodden in the dirt, when it ſeemeth to croſs any intereſt of their own.</hi> An Argument drawn from the commands of God, or the
<pb facs="tcp:34706:38"/>
neceſſity of the Church, or of the ſouls of men, ſeems nothing to them, if their Honour, or Gain, or Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſafety, do ſtand up againſt it, and be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with its concluſion. Hence it is that the ſouls of Hypocrites do cheat themſelves by a Carnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs, ſerving God only in ſubſerviency to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hence it is that Hypocrites do moſt ſhew themſelves in matters of <hi>ſelf-intereſt:</hi> In the cheap part of Religion, they ſeem to be as good as any: as zealous for their party and opinions, (which they call the Truth) and as long and loud in prayer, and for as ſtrict a way of Diſcipline with others: But touch them in their Eſtates or Names: Call them to coſtly works of Charity, or to let go their right for peace, or publick good, or to confeſs and lament any ſin that they commit, and you ſhall then ſee that they are but common men: and <hi>Self</hi> bears rule inſtead of Chriſt. Hence alſo it is, that ſo many perſons can bear with themſelves in any calling or trade of life that is but gainful, be it never ſo unjuſt, and will not believe but it is lawful, becauſe it is profitable; for they <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> that <hi>gain is godlineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. Hence it is that ſo many families will be ſo far Religious as will ſtand with their commodity; but no further: Yea that ſo many Miniſters have the wit to prove that moſt Duties are to them no Duties, when they will coſt them much labour or diſhonour in the world, or bring them under ſufferings from men: And hence it is that ſo many Carnal Polititians do in their Laws and Counſels alwaies prefer the intereſt of their bodies before Gods intereſt, and mens ſouls: Yea ſome are ſo far forſaken by common reaſon, and void of the Love of God and his Church, as to maintain that Magiſtrates in their Laws and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt let matters of Religion alone; as if that <hi>ſelf,</hi> even carnal <hi>ſelf</hi> were all their Intereſt, and all their
<pb facs="tcp:34706:39"/>
God: and as if they were of the Prophane Opinion [<hi>Every man for himſelf, and God for us all</hi>] or as if they would look to their <hi>own cauſe,</hi> and bid God look to <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Power of this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> it is that ſo many ☞ Princes and States turn perſecutors, and ſtick not to ſilence, baniſh (and ſome of the bloodier ſort, to kill) the Miniſters of Chriſt, when they do but think that they ſtand croſs to their carnal intereſts: And if you will plead the Intereſt of Chriſt and ſouls againſt theirs, and tell them, that the baniſhment, impriſonment, ſilencing or death of ſuch or ſuch a ſervant of the Lord, will be injurious to many ſouls, and therefore if they were guilty of death in ſome caſes, they ſhould reprieve them, as they do women with child, till Chriſt be formed in the precious ſouls that they travail in birth with (ſo their Lives be not more hurtful by any contrary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which death only can reſtrain, which is not to be ſuppoſed of ſober men) yet all this ſeems nothing to a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Perſecutor, that regards not Chriſts intereſt in compariſon of his own. ☞ <hi>Self</hi> is the great Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Perſecutor of the Church.</p>
            <p>10. Obſerve alſo how few they be that <hi>ſatisfie their ſouls in Gods Approbation, though they are miſ-judged and vilified by the world:</hi> and how few that rejoyce at the proſperity of the Goſpel, though themſelves be in Adverſity: moſt men muſt needs have the Hypocrites reward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 2. even ſome commendation from men: and too few are fully pleaſed with his eye that ſeeth in ſeret, and will reward them openly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 4, 6. And hence it is that injurious cenſures and hard words do go ſo near them, and they make ſo great a matter of them. Thoſe times do ſeem <hi>beſt</hi> to <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men, which are moſt for them: If <hi>they</hi> proſper, and
<pb facs="tcp:34706:39"/>
their party proſper, though moſt of the Church ſhould be a loſer by it, they will think that it is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time: But if the Church proſper, and not they, but any ſuffering befall them, they take on as if the Church did ſtand or fall with <hi>them. Self-intereſt</hi> is their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by which they judge of times and things.</p>
            <p>11. Obſerve alſo how <hi>eagerly men are ſet to have their Own wills take place in publick buſineſſes, and to, have their own opinions to be the Rule for Church and Common-wealth:</hi> and then judge by this of their <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial.</hi> Were not <hi>ſelf</hi> predominant, there would not be ſuch ſtriving who ſhould Rule, and whoſe will ſhould be the Law: but men would think that others were as likely to Rule with Prudence and Honeſty as they. How eager is the Papiſt to have his way by an Univerſal Monarch? How eager are others for <hi>one</hi> Eccleſiaſtical National Head? How eager are the Popular party for their way? as if the welfare of all did lie in their ſeveral modes of Government. And ſo confidently do the Libertines ſpeak for theirs, that they begin now to make motions that our <hi>Parliament-men</hi> ſhall be hanged or beheaded as Traitors, if any ſhould make a motion in (a free) Parliament, againſt the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Liberty which they deſire. Wonderful! that men ſhould ever grow to ſuch an over-weening of themſelves, and over-valuing their own underſtandings, as to obtrude ſo palpable and odious a wickedneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Parliaments ſo confidently, and to take them for Traitors, that will not be Traitors or groſly diſobedient againſt the Lord? <hi>Self-denial</hi> would cure theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory demands, and teach men to be more ſuſpicious of their own underſtandings.</p>
            <p>12. Laſtly, Obſerve but <hi>how difficult a thing it is to keep Peace (as in families and neighbourhoods) ſo in Churches and Common-wealths;</hi> and judge by this of
<pb facs="tcp:34706:40"/>
mens <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> Husbands and Wives, brothers and ſiſters, maſters and ſervants, live at variance, and all through the conflicts that ariſe between their contrary <hi>ſelf-intereſts.</hi> If a beaſt do but treſpaſs on a neighbours grounds; if they be but aſſeſſed for the State, or poor, above their expectations; if in any way of trading their commodity be croſt; you ſhall quickly ſee where <hi>ſelf</hi> bears Rule. This makes it ſo difficult a work to keep the Churches from Diviſions. Few men are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the <hi>Univerſal</hi> Intereſt, becauſe they are capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to their <hi>own:</hi> And therefore it is that men <hi>fear not</hi> to make parties and diviſions in the Church: and will tear it in pieces to ſatisfie their <hi>intereſt</hi> or <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> zeal: Hence it is that Parties are ſo much multiplied, and keep up the buckler againſt others, becauſe that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> makes all <hi>Partial.</hi> Hence it is that people fall off from their Paſtors, or elſe fall out with them, when they are croſt in their opinions, reproved for their ſins, or called to conſeſs or make reſtitution, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that they may ſacrilegiouſly deſraud the Church of Tithes or other payments that are due. Hence it is alſo that members ſo oft fall out with one another, for foul words, or differences of judgement, or ſome point or other of <hi>ſelf-intereſt:</hi> Nay ſometimes about their very ſeats in the place of Worſhip; while every man is for <hi>himſelf,</hi> the Miniſters can hardly keep them in Charity and Peace.</p>
            <p>And is any of this agreeable to our holy Rule and Pattern? No man can think ſo that hath read the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but he that is ſo blinded by <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> as not to underſtand what makes againſt it. And here, beſides what is largelier ſpoken after, let me tell of a few of the evils of this ſin, and the contrary benefits of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34706:40"/>1. The Power of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> keeps men ſtrangers to themſelves: They know not their Original nor Actual ſins, with any kindly humbling knowledge. The very nature of Original ſin doth conſiſt in theſe two things: <hi>Privatively,</hi> in the want of our Original Love, or Propenſity to God as God: I mean, the Privation of the Root, or Habit, or Inclination, to Love God for himſelf, as the Beginning or End of us and all things, and the abſolute Lord, and infinite, ſimple, ineſtimable Good. And <hi>Poſitively,</hi> in the inordinate Propenſity or <hi>Inclination</hi> to <hi>our ſelves:</hi> as for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and not as duly ſubordinate to God: The ſoul having unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and rebelliouſly withdrawn it ſelf from God, in point of Love and ſubjection, it become its own Idol, and looks no higher than it ſelf, and Loveth God and all things but for it ſelf (and principally for its carnal pleaſure:) And the Propenſity to this, with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſouls Inclination to God, is Original ſin; the Diſpoſition ſuited to the actual ſin that cauſed it, which was a <hi>retiring from God</hi> to <hi>ſelf.</hi> He that feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not this evil in himſelf, hath no true knowledge of Original ſin. And it's the want of the ſenſe of this great evil, (and ſo the want of being acquainted with their hearts) that cauſeth ſo many to turn Pelagians, and to deny the being of Orignal ſin.</p>
            <p>2. Both <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and the want of a true diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, doth breed and feed abundance of errours, and teach men to corrupt the whole body of Practical Divinity, and to ſubvert many Articles of faith, which ſtand in their way. How comes the world to be all in a flame about the Univerſal Reign of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> but from the dominion of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs?</hi> Whence is it that the Nations of the earth have been ſo troubled for Patriarchs, Metropolitans, and Dioceſans that muſt do their work by others, and for many things that (at
<pb facs="tcp:34706:41"/>
beſt) can pretend to be but humane, indifferent, changeable forms, but from the prevalency of <hi>Self?</hi> Whence is it that mens conſciences have been enſnared, and the Churches troubled, by ſo many Ceremonies of mens invention, and the Church muſt rather loſe her faithfulleſt Paſtors, than they be permitted to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did? Hath not <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> done this? It is <hi>ſelf</hi> that hath taught ſome to plead too much for their own ſufficiency, and to deny the need of ſpecial Grace. And ſo far hath it prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome of late, as to lead them Doctrinally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that God is the Ultimate End of man, and to be Loved for himſelf, and above our ſelves and all things; but only (they ſay) he is our <hi>finis cujus vel rei</hi> to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>amore concupiſcentiae:</hi> In a word, it is this woful principle that hath corrupted Doctrine, Diſcipline and Worſhip, in ſo many of the Churches.</p>
            <p>3. We ſhall never have Peace in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, while <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> bears ſway. Every mans Intereſt will be preferred before the publick Intereſt, and riſe againſt it as oft (which will be oft) as they ſeem inconſiſtent. This is the <hi>Vice</hi> that informeth <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> whether it be <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy,</hi> when <hi>ſelfiſh intereſt</hi> is preferred before the Common Intereſt. This makes our people think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too wiſe or too good to learn, or to be guided by their Paſtors, and every man (of this ſtrain) ſeems wiſe enough to lead off a party of the Church into a mutiny againſt the Paſtors and the reſt. This makes the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Reconcilers unſucceſsful, while <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> engageth ſo many wits, and tongues, and pens and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, againſt the moſt neceſſary equal terms, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of ſuch as would Reconcile, Were it not for theſe <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men, how ſoon would all our rents be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? how ſoon would all our wars be ended? and all
<pb facs="tcp:34706:41"/>
our heart-burnings and malicious oppoſitions be turned into charitable conſultations for an holy peace? If once men were carryed above themſelves, they would meet in <hi>God</hi> the Center of <hi>Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is for want of <hi>ſelf denial</hi> that we undergo ſo many diſappointments, and ſuffer ſo much diſquietment and vexation. Were our wills more entirely ſubjected to the will of God, ſo that <hi>his will</hi> were preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our own, we ſhould <hi>Reſt</hi> in his will, and have no contradictory deſires <hi>to be</hi> diſappointed, and no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er left for ſelf-vexation. Had we no diſeaſe, we ſhould feel no pain: and it is our <hi>ſelf-will</hi> rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of God that is our diſeaſe. <hi>Self-denial</hi> removeth all the venom from our hearts: Perſecution, and poverty, and ſickneſs may touch our fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, but the heart is fortified ſo far as we have his Grace. O how happily doth it quiet and calm the mind, when things befall us that <hi>would</hi> even diſtract a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> man! O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man, where God is <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> is <hi>Nothing!</hi> There Duty, and Love, and Joy are <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs</hi> is nothing; Theſe are not our matters now; Partly becauſe we are above them, and partly becauſe they belong not to our care, but to his Povidence. Let us do our Duty and adhere to him, and let him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of us as he ſees meet. Who would much fear a Tyrant or any other enemy, that ſaw God and Glory, which faith can ſee? Did we ſee the glorious Throne of Chriſt, we ſhould be ſo far from trembling at the bar of Perſecutors, that we ſhould ſcarce ſo much regard them as to anſwer them; the infinite Glory would ſo potently divert our minds. As we ſcarce hearken to our childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s impertinent babblings, when we are taken up with great Affairs; ſo if a Tyrant talk to us of <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:34706:42"/>
our ſelves, as Faith and Love ſhould advance the ſoul.</p>
            <p>I have further ſhewed you in the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, how <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> diſableth all Temptations; how it conduceth to all eminent works of Charity, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the ſecret works of the ſincere: It is of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation: It is thething that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are condemned for want of: It is the wiſdom of the ſoul, as being the only way to our own ſecurity: And it is the holineſs and juſtice of the ſoul (as it is conjunct with the Love of God) in that it reſtoreth to God his own: The excellency of Grace is manifeſted in <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial.</hi> To do or ſuffer ſuch little things as <hi>ſelf</hi> is not much againſt, is nothing: But to be <hi>Nothing</hi> in our ſelves, and God to be our All, and to cloſe with our firſt and bleſſed End, this is the nature of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Alas, poor <hi>England,</hi> (and more than <hi>England,</hi> even all the Chriſtian world) into what confuſion and miſery hath <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> plunged thee! Into how many pieces art thou broken, becauſe that every hypocrite hath a <hi>ſelf</hi> to be his principle and end, and forſakes the true Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal End! How vain are our words to Rulers, to <hi>Souldiers,</hi> to Rich and Poor, while we call upon them to Deny <hi>themſelves!</hi> And muſt we loſe our labour? and muſt the Nation loſe its peace and hopes? Is there no remedy, but <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> muſt undo all? If ſo, be it known to you, the principal <hi>loſs ſhall be your own;</hi> ☞ and in ſeeking your <hi>ſafety, liberty, wealth</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> you ſhall <hi>loſe them all, and fall into miſery, ſlavery and diſdain.</hi> Deny <hi>your ſelves,</hi> or <hi>ſave your ſelves,</hi> if you can. God is not engaged to take care of you, or preſerve you, if you will be your own, and will be reſerving or ſaving your ſelves from him. ☞ And though you may <hi>ſeem to proſper in ſelf-ſeeking waies, they will end, yea ſhortly
<pb facs="tcp:34706:42"/>
end, in your confuſion.</hi> You have ſeen of late years in this Land, the Glory of Self-ſeekers turned to ſhame. But it's greater <hi>ſhame</hi> that's out of ſight. The word and works of God have warned you. If yet the Cauſe and Church of God ſhall be neglected, and your <hi>ſelves</hi> and your <hi>own</hi> affairs preferred, and men that ſhall not be tolerated to abuſe you, ſhall be Tolerated to abuſe the ſouls of men, and the Lord that made them; and if God muſt be denyed, becauſe you will not deny your ſelves, you ſhall be <hi>denyed</hi> by Chriſt, in your great extremity, when the remembrance of theſe things ſhall be your torment. Hearken and Amend; or prepare your anſwer: for behold the Judge is at the door.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE already ſpoken of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the foregoing Diſcourſe, both opening to you the true nature of it, and the reaſons of its neceſſity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading men thereunto. But leſt ſo great a work ſhould miſcarry with any for want of a more particular explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhould next open the three great parts of the work diſtinctly and in order: that is, 1. <hi>From what</hi> it is that we muſt Turn: 2. <hi>To whom</hi> we muſt Turn: 3. And <hi>By whom</hi> we muſt Turn. For though I touched all theſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34706:50"/>
in the foregoing Directions, and through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; yet I am afraid leſt ſo brief a touch ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe I ſhall handle at this time from this Text, medling with no more but what is neceſſary to our preſent buſineſs.</p>
               <p>You may eaſily perceive that the Doctrine which Chriſt here proclaimeth to all that have thoughts of being his followers, is this, that [<hi>All that will be Chriſtians, muſt Deny themſelves, and take up their Croſs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt, and not reſerve ſo much as their very lives, but reſolve to reſign up all for him.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Self-denyal is one part of true Converſion:</hi> For the opening of this I muſt ſhew you; 1. What is meant by <hi>Self;</hi> and 2. What by <hi>Denying</hi> this <hi>Self:</hi> and 3. The Grounds and Reaſons of the point: and 4. I ſhall briefly apply it.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Self,</hi> is ſometime taken for the very perſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſoul and body ſimply conſidered: and this is called Natural or Perſonal <hi>Self.</hi> 2. <hi>Self</hi> is taken for this Perſon conſidered in its capacity of earthly comforts, and in relation to the preſent bleſſings of this world that tend to the proſperity of man as in the fleſh: And this may be called <hi>Earthly Self</hi> (yet in an innocent ſenſe.) 3. <hi>Self</hi> is taken for the Perſon as corrupted by inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinful ſenſuality; which may be called <hi>Carnal Self.</hi> 4. <hi>Self</hi> may be taken for the Perſon in his ſanctified eſtate; which is <hi>Spiritual Self.</hi> 5. And <hi>Self</hi> may be taken for the perſon in his Naturals and Spirituals Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, as he is <hi>capable of a Life of Everlaſting Felicity;</hi> which is the <hi>Immortal</hi> Self.</p>
               <p>II. By <hi>Denying</hi> Self, is meant diſclaiming, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, diſowning, and forſaking it. <hi>Self</hi> is here lookt on partly as <hi>a party dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unct from Chriſt, and withdrawn from its due ſubordination to God,</hi> and partly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34706:50"/>
as <hi>his Competitor and oppoſite:</hi> and accordingly it is to be denyed, partly by <hi>a neglect,</hi> and partly by <hi>an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I come to tell you how far <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I muſt tell you wherein the diſeaſe of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> doth conſiſt; and for brevity we ſhall diſpatch them both together.</p>
               <p>And on the Negative, 1. To be a natural Individual perſon diſtinct from God our Creator, is none of our diſeaſe, but the ſtate which we were created in. And therefore no man muſt under pretence of ſelf-denyal either deſtroy himſelf, or yet with ſome Hereticks aſpire to be eſſentially and perſonally one with God, ſo that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſonality ſhould be drowned in him as a drop is in the Ocean.</p>
               <p>2. The diſeaſe of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> lyeth not in having a Body that is capable of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſting ſweetneſs in the Creature, or in having the Objects of our ſence in which we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, nor yet in all actual ſweetneſs and delight in them; nor in a ſimple love of life it ſelf: For all theſe are the effects of the Creators Will. And therefore this <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal</hi> doth not conſiſt in a hatred or diſregard of our own lives; or in a deſtruction of our appetites or ſenſes, or an abſolute refuſal to pleaſe them in the uſe of the Creatures, which God hath given us.</p>
               <p>3. Yea though our Natures are corrupted by ſin, <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal</hi> requireth not that we ſhould kill our ſelves, and deſtroy our humane natures that we may thereby deſtroy the ſin. Self-murder is a moſt hainous ſin, which God condemneth.</p>
               <p>4. Our ſpiritual <hi>ſelf,</hi> or <hi>ſelf</hi> as ſanctified muſt not be ſo denyed, as to deny our ſelves to be what we are, or have what we have, or do what we do: we may not deny Gods Graces; nor deny that they are in us as the ſubject, nor may we reſtrain the holy deſires which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34706:51"/>
God exciteth in us; or deny to fulfil them, or bring them towards fruition, when opportunity is offered us.</p>
               <p>5. We may not deny to accept of any mercy which God ſhall offer us, though but a common Creature: nor to uſe any talent for his ſervice if he chooſe us for his ſtewards; much leſs may we refuſe any ſpiritual mercy, that may further our Salvation: It is not the <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> required by Chriſt, that we deny to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or to be ſanctified by the ſpirit, or to he delivered from our ſins and enemies; or that we deny to uſe the means and helps that are offered us, or to accept of the priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt: Much leſs to deny our ſalvation it ſelf, and to undo our own ſouls. In a word, it is not any thing that is really and finally to our hurt or loſs.</p>
               <p>But (as to the Affirmative) I ſhall ſhew you what the diſeaſe of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> indeed is, and ſo what <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> is. 1. When God had created man in his own Image, he gave him a holy <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of ſoul, which might <hi>incline</hi> him to his <hi>Maker</hi> as his <hi>only Felicity and Ultimate End.</hi> He made him to be bleſſed in the ſight of his Glory, and in the everlaſting Love of God, and delight in him, and praiſes of him. This excellent employment and glory did God both fit him for, and ſet before him.</p>
               <p>But the firſt temptation did entice him to adhere to an inferiour good, for the pleaſing of his <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the advancement of <hi>him ſelf</hi> to a carnal kind of felicity in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> that he might be as God in knowing good and evil. And thus man was ſuddenly taken with the Creature as a means to the pleaſing of his <hi>carnal ſelf,</hi> and ſo did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God his true felicity; and retired into <hi>himſelf</hi> in his eſtimation, affection, and intention; and delivered up his Reaſon in ſubjection to his ſenſuality, and made <hi>himſelf</hi> his Ultimate End.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34706:51"/>With this ſinful <hi>inclination</hi> are we all born into the world; ſo that every man according to his corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth terminate all his deſires in <hi>himſelf:</hi> and what ever he may <hi>notionally</hi> be convinced of to the contrary, yet <hi>practically</hi> he makes his earthly life and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pleaſure which he expecteth therein, to be his felicity and end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Self-denyal</hi> now is the cure of this: It carryeth a man from <hi>himſelf</hi> again, and ſheweth him that he was never made to be his own felicity or end; and that the fleſh was not made to be pleaſed before God; and that it is ſo poor, and low, and ſhort a felicity, as indeed is but a name and ſhadow of felicity, and when it pretends to that, a meer deceit. It ſheweth him how unreaſonable, how impious and unjuſt it is, that a Creature and ſuch a Creature, ſhould terminate his deſires and intentions in <hi>himſelf:</hi> And this is the principal part of ſelf-denyal.</p>
               <p>2. As God was mans <hi>ultimate End</hi> in his ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, ſo accordingly man was appointed to <hi>uſe all Creatures in order to God,</hi> for <hi>his</hi> Pleaſure and Glory. So that it was the work of man to do his Makers will, and he was to uſe nothing but with this intention.</p>
               <p>But when man was faln from God to <hi>himſelf,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards uſed all things for himſelf, even his carnal ſelf; and all that he poſſeſſed was become the proviſion and fuel of his luſts; and ſo the whole creation which he was capable of uſing, was abuſed by him to this low and <hi>ſelfiſh end,</hi> as if all things had been made but for his delight and will.</p>
               <p>But when man is brought to <hi>Deny himſelf,</hi> he is brought to <hi>reſtore the Creatures</hi> to their <hi>former uſe,</hi> and not to ſacrifice them to his fleſhly mind; ſo that all that he hath and uſeth in the world, is uſed to another end (ſo far as he denyeth himſelf) than formerly it was; even for God and not him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34706:52"/>3. In the ſtate of Innocency, though man had natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an averſneſs from death and bodily pains, as being natural evils, and had a deſire of the welfare even of the fleſh it ſelf; yet as his body was ſubject to his ſoul, and his ſenſes to his Reaſon, ſo his bodily eaſe and welfare was to be eſteemed and deſired and ſought, but in a due ſubordination to his ſpiritual welfare, and eſpecially to his Makers Will. So that though he was to value his Life, yet he was much more to value his everlaſting life, and the pleaſure and Glory of his Lord.</p>
               <p>But now when man is faln from God to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> his Life and earthly felicity is the ſweeteſt and the deareſt thing to him that is. So that he preferreth it before the Pleaſing of God and everlaſting life: And therefore he ſeeketh it more, and holdeth it faſter as long as he can, and parteth with it more unwillingly. As <hi>Innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> had an <hi>appetite</hi> to the objects of ſenſe; but <hi>corrupted nature</hi> hath an <hi>enraged, greedy, rebellious</hi> and <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> appetite to them: ſo <hi>Innocent nature</hi> had a <hi>love</hi> to this natural earthly life and the comforts of it: but <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature</hi> hath ſuch an <hi>inordinate love</hi> to them, as that all things elſe are made but ſubordinate to them, and ſwallowed up in this gulf: even God himſelf is ſo far loved as he befriendeth theſe our carnal ends, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth our earthly proſperity and life.</p>
               <p>But when men are brought to <hi>Deny themſelves,</hi> they are in their meaſures reſtored to their firſt eſteem of Life and all the proſperity and earthly comforts of life. Now they have learned ſo to love them as to love God better; and ſo to value them as to prefer everlaſting life before them; and ſo to hold them and ſeek their preſervation as to reſign them to the will of God, and to lay them down when we cannot hold them with his Love, and to chooſe death in order to life everlaſting, before that life which would deprive us of it. And this is the principal inſtance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34706:52"/>
of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> which Chriſt giveth us here in the Text, as it is recited by all the three Evangeliſts that recite theſe words, [<hi>He that ſaveth his life ſhall loſe it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And what ſhall it profit a man to win all the world and loſe his ſoul?</hi>] By theſe inſtances it appears, that by <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> Chriſt doth mean a ſetting ſo light by all the world, and by our own lives, and conſequently, our carnal Content in theſe, as to be willing and Reſolved to part with them all, rather than with him and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life: even as <hi>Abraham</hi> was bound to love his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but yet ſo to prefer the Love and Will of God, as to be able to ſacrifice his Son at Gods Command.</p>
               <p>And the Lord Jeſus himſelf was the livelieſt Pattern to us of his Self-denyal that ever the world ſaw: Indeed his whole life was a continued practice of it. And it hath oft convinced me that it is a ſpecial part of our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when I have conſidered how abundantly the Lord hath exerciſed himſelf in it for our example. For as it is deſperate to think with the <hi>Socinians</hi> that he did it <hi>only</hi> for our Example; ſo it is alſo a deſperate Error of others, to think that it was only for ſatisfaction to God, and not at all for our Example. Many do give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Fleſh-pleaſing,</hi> upon a miſconceit that Chriſt did therefore deny his fleſh, to purchaſe them a liberty to pleaſe <hi>theirs.</hi> As in his Faſting and Temptations, and his ſufferings by the reproach and ingratitude of men, and the outward Poverty and Meanneſs of his condition, the Lord was pleaſed to deny himſelf; ſo eſpecially in his laſt Paſſion and death. As I have ſhewed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, he loved his natural life and peace: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in manifeſtation of that, he prayeth, <hi>Father, if it be thy Will, let this Cup paſs from me:</hi> But yet when it came to the comparative practical Act, he proceeded to chooſe his Fathers Will with death, rather than life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and therefore ſaith, [<hi>Not my Will</hi> (that is, my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34706:53"/>
ſimple love of life) <hi>but thy Will be done.</hi>] In which very words he manifeſteth <hi>another will</hi> of his own, beſides that, which he conſenteth ſhall not be done, and ſheweth that he preferred the pleaſing of his Father in the Redemption of the world, before his own life. And thus in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he cauſeth all his Members to do: ſo that life, and all the comforts of life, are not ſo dear to them as the love of God and everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>4. When God had created man, he was preſently the <hi>Owner</hi> of him, and man underſtood this that he was <hi>God's,</hi> and not <hi>his own.</hi> And he was not to claim a <hi>Propriety in himſelf,</hi> nor to be affected to himſelf as his <hi>own,</hi> nor to live as his <hi>own,</hi> but as <hi>His</hi> that made him.</p>
               <p>But when he fell from God, he arrogated practically (though notionally he may deny it) a propriety in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and uſeth himſelf accordingly.</p>
               <p>And when Chriſt bringeth men to deny themſelves, they ceaſe to be their <hi>own</hi> in their conceits any more; Then they reſign themſelves wholly to God as being wholly his. They know they are his, both by the right of Creation and of Redemption: And therefore are to be diſpoſed of by him, <hi>and to glorifie him in body and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which are his,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20. Rom. 14. 9. To be thus heartily devoted to God as his own, is the form of Sanctification; and to live as <hi>God</hi>'s own, is the truly Holy life.</p>
               <p>5. As man in Innocency did know that he was not his <hi>own;</hi> ſo he knew that <hi>nothing that he had was his own;</hi> but that he was the Steward of his Creator, for whom he was to uſe them, and to whom he was accountable.</p>
               <p>But when he was fallen from God to himſelf, though he had loſt the <hi>Right of a Servant,</hi> yet be graſpeth at the Creature, as if he had the <hi>Right of a Lord:</hi> He now takes his Goods, his Lands his Money to be his <hi>own:</hi> and therefore he thinks he may uſe them for himſelf, and give
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34706:53"/>
God only ſome ſmall Contribution, leſt he ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb his Poſſeſſion: he ſaith as the impious ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 4. [<hi>Our lips are our own; who is Lord over us?</hi>] Though all of them know ſpeculatively that all is Gods, yet practically they take it and uſe it as their own.</p>
               <p>But when Grace teacheth them to deny themſelves, it ſtrippeth them naked of all that they ſeemed Proprietors of; and maketh them confeſs that nothing is their <hi>own,</hi> but all is <hi>Gods;</hi> and to God they do devote it, and uſe it for him, and give him his own: which the firſt Chriſtians ſignified by ſelling all, and laying at the Apoſtles feet. And therefore he asketh God what he ſhall do with it, and how he ſhall uſe it; and if God take it from him, he can bleſs the name of the Lord with <hi>Job, Job</hi> 1. 21. as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he taketh but his <hi>own:</hi> and can ſay with <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 18. He knows that God may <hi>do with his own as he liſt.</hi> Mat. 20. 15. and that he can have nothing but of <hi>his</hi> bounty; and therefore that it is his Mercy that leaveth him any thing; but it were no wrong to him if he took away all. And thus he underſtandeth that he is but a Steward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt uſe all that he hath for him that he received it from. If he have Children, his deſire is to know which way they may be moſt ſerviceable to God: and to that he will devote them. If he have Wealth, or Honour, and Power among men, his care is to know which way he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them for his Maſters uſe, and ſo he will imploy them. If he have Wit and Learning, his care is to ſerve God by it. If he have ſtrength and time, he is thinking which way to improve them for his Lord. And if vain Companions, or the World, or fleſhly Delights would draw him to lay them out for them, he remembers that this were to waſte his Maſters ſtock upon his enemies. So that though the ſanctified man hath all things, yet he knows that he hath nothing. All things are his as Gods Steward: but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34706:54"/>
nothing is properly and ultimately his <hi>own.</hi> All things are <hi>his</hi> for God; but nothing is <hi>his</hi> for his Carnal-ſelf, nor ultimately for his perſonal or natural ſelf. Upon this ground he gives the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh a Denyal, when they would have his Time, his Tongue, his Wit, his Wealth, or any thing that he poſſeſſeth: he telleth them [<hi>They are none of mine, but God's: I received them, and I muſt be accountable for them. I had them not from you, and therefore I may not uſe them for you: I muſt give to God the things that are God's: that which is yours I will readily yield you. Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that every one have his own.</hi>] And thus <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal</hi> doth take off the ſanctified from giving that which is God's unto themſelves.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But do we not lawfully uſe his Mercies for our ſelves? Is not our Meat, and Drink, and Cloaths, and Houſes, and Goods our own, and may we not uſe them for our ſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Improperly</hi> they are our <hi>own:</hi> ſo far our <hi>own,</hi> as that our Fellow-ſervants may not take them from us without our Lords conſent: as every ſervant may have a peculiar ſtock entruſted in his hands, or may have his tools to do his work with, which indeed are his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; but are <hi>his to uſe.</hi> But as to a ſtrict <hi>Propriety</hi> they are none of ours, but God is the only Proprietary of the world.</p>
               <p>And for the uſe of them, it may be for our ſelves in ſubordination to God, but never ultimately for our ſelves. We may not uſe one Creature, but ultimately and principally for God. When we eat or drink, we muſt never make the pleaſing of our Appetite our end, but muſt do it to ſtrengthen, and chear, and fit our ſelves for the ſervice of God, and therefore we muſt firſt ask God, and not our Appetite, what, and how much we muſt eat and drink: And we muſt no further pleaſe our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34706:54"/>
Appetite, than the pleaſing of it doth fit us for the ſervice of God. It is the expreſs Command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31 [<hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye eat or drink, or what ever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi>] You may not wear your Cloaths meerly and ultimately for your bodies, but only to fit your bodies for Gods ſervice: and therefore you muſt advice with his Word, and with your end, what you ſhould put on. You may not provide a houſe to dwell in, nor Friends, nor Riches, nor any thing elſe for the pleaſing of your fleſh, as your ultimate end, but for the ſervice of your Lord. For you muſt <hi>put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make no proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. 14.</p>
               <p>6. As man had his Being and well-being from God, ſo is it God only that can <hi>preſerve</hi> and <hi>continue them.</hi> Innocent man underſtood this, and therefore lived in a <hi>Dependance</hi> upon God; looking to his hand for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of his wants, and caſting all his care upon him, and truſting him wholly with himſelf, and all, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting his own mind with cares and diſtruſtful fears, but quieted and contented his mind in the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and All-ſufficienly of God.</p>
               <p>But when man was fallen to himſelf from God, he deſired preſently to have his portion or ſtock in his <hi>own</hi> hands, and grew diſtruſtful of God, and began to look upon himſelf as his <hi>own preſerver;</hi> (in a great meaſure) and therefore he fell to carking and caring for himſelf, and to ſtudious contrivances for his own preſervation and ſupplies. He ſearched every Creature for himſelf, and laboured to find in it ſome good for himſelf, as if the care of himſelf had been wholly divolved on himſelf. I have been as much troubled to underſtand that Text in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22. as any one almoſt in the Bible, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unſatisfied with ſome ordinary expoſitions; and yet it is too hard for me. But this ſeems to me the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34706:55"/>
moſt probable Interpretation; that in his eſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency <hi>Adam</hi> was as a Child in his Fathers houſe, that was only to ſtudy to pleaſe his Father, and to do the work that he commanded him, but not to take any thought or care for himſelf: for while he was obedient, it was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part to preſerve him and provide for him, to keep off death and danger, and ſupply all his wants. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though man had the <hi>faculty or power of knowing</hi> more perfect than we have now, yet he did not need to trouble himſelf about theſe matters of <hi>Self,</hi> becauſe they belonged to God: and conſequently had not the <hi>actual conſideration of knowledge</hi> of them: for that would have been but a vain and troubleſome knowledge and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him: For though the knowledge of all things <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to be known, was part of his perfection, yet the <hi>actual knowledge</hi> of many things <hi>unneceſſary</hi> and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or tempring, may be part of a mans infelicity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. And ſo <hi>he that increaſeth knowledge increaſeth ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> Eccl. 1. 18. As man that foreknoweth his own death, is through the fear of it all his life time ſubject to bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. and the fear is more grievous than the death it ſelf; when a beaſt that knoweth not his death is freed from thoſe fears. Indeed in our faln eſtate there is ſome uſe for more of this kind of knowledge than before; But in innocency man needed only to know his maker, and his will and works, and the Creature as his utenſils, and the glaſs in which he was to be ſeen, and to fear with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the death which he had threatned, meerly <hi>as threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him.</hi> But by the temptation of Satan, man grew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be paſt a child, at his Fathers finding, and under his care, and would take care and thought for himſelf and know what <hi>was good or evil for himſelf</hi> as to the natural man: and ſo far turned his eye to the Creature to ſtudy it <hi>for himſelf,</hi> when he ſhould have ſtudied God in it: and to ſearch after <hi>good and evil to himſelf</hi> in it, which he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34706:55"/>
ſhould have ſearched after the attributes of God in it, and daily gazed with holy love and admiration upon his bleſſed face that ſhined in this glaſs: and ſo he would <hi>uſe</hi> the Creature directly for <hi>himſelf,</hi> which he ſhould have <hi>uſed</hi> only for <hi>Gods ſervice.</hi> And thus I conceive man did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by his fall attain to much more <hi>actual knowledge</hi> as to the number of objects than he had before: which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was indeed in it ſelf conſidered Phyſically good, but not Good to him as any part of his felicity, or his vertue, but rather by participation his ſin and miſery, as being unſuitable to his condition. It was better with him when he knew <hi>One God,</hi> and all things in God as they conduced to the Love and Service of God, and were ſuitable to his ſtate, than when he turned his mind from God, and fell to ſtudy the Creature in it ſelf, and for himſelf, as Good or Evil to himſelf, and ſo loſt himſelf and his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a crowd of unneceſſary and miſuſed objects: Like a fooliſh Patient that having a moſt judicious and faithful Phyſitian that will take care of his health, and provide him the beſt and ſafeſt remedies, doth grow to an eager deſire to be acquainted <hi>himſelf</hi> with the nature of each medicine and to be skilful in the cure of his own diſeaſe, that he may truſt his Phyſitian no longer, but may be his own Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian: and therefore hearkneth to a ſeducer that tells him [<hi>The Phyſitian doth but keep thee in ignorance, leſt thou ſhouldſt be as wiſe as he, and able to cure or preſerve thy ſelf, hearken to me, and I will teach thee to known all theſe things thy ſelf, and ſo thou maiſt take care of thy ſelf.</hi>] So man was ſeduced by Satan to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the fatherly care of God, by a deſire <hi>himſelf</hi> to be wiſe for <hi>himſelf</hi> in the knowledge of <hi>all that</hi> in the Creature which might be directly <hi>good or evil to himſelf,</hi> ſo taking on <hi>himſelf</hi> the work of God, and caſting off the work that God had ſet him, and withdrawing himſelf from his neceſſary dependence on his Maker. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34706:56"/>
much of this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs knowledge</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he did attain: but with the woful loſs of the Divine knowledge of the Creature, and of the filial ſoul-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting knowledge of God: yea and of himſelf, as in his due ſubordination to God. This ſeems the ſence of this text, and this is the caſe of faln mankind.</p>
               <p>Naturally now every man would fain have his ſafety and Comforts in his own hand. He thinks them not ſo ſure and well in the hand of God: O what would a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man give that he had but his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>health</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> hand, and might keep them as long as <hi>he</hi> ſaw good! When he is poor, he had rather it were in <hi>his</hi> hand to ſupply his wants, than in <hi>Gods;</hi> for he thinks it would go better with him. When he is ſick, he had far rather it were in his <hi>own</hi> hand to cure him, than in Gods, for then he ſhould be ſure of it. If he be in any ſtrait, he cannot be content with a bare promiſe for his deliverance; but unleſs he ſee ſome probability in the means, and work, and unleſs he be acquainted with the particular way by which he muſt be delivered he is not ſatisfied: for he cannot truſt God, ſo well as himſelf. Is not this the caſe of all you that are carnal? Would you not think your caſe much ſafer and better if it were in your own hands, than you do now it is in Gods! What would you not give, that you were but as able to give eaſe, and heath and wealth, and honour, and life to your ſelves, as God is! Hence it is that you ſo anxiouſly contrive for your ſelves, and trouble your ſelves with needleſs cares; becauſe you dare not truſt God, but think you are faln to your own care and finding. You think your ſelves quite undone when you have nothing left you but God and his Promiſe to truſt upon, and when you ſee nothing in your ſelves and the Creature to ſupport you. And thus are all men <hi>faln from God to themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Sanctification teacheth men that <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34706:56"/>
according to its meaſure, doth heal them of this diſeaſe. Though ſome actual knowledge of good and evil, and ſome care of our natural <hi>ſelves</hi> be now become a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty, as ſuited to our lapſed ſtate, which yet had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>been</hi> but through ſin: Yet that which is <hi>ſinful,</hi> ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal doth deſtroy. It ſheweth man that he is every way inſufficient for himſelf, and that he is not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his own felicity: nor doth it belong to him, but to God, to preſerve him and ſecure his welfare. He ſeeth what a folly it is to depart from the tuition of his Heavenly Father, and as the Prodigal Son to deſire to have his portion in his own hands. Experience tells him with ſmart and ſorrow that he hath not been ſo good a preſerver of himſelf, nor uſed himſelf ſo well as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be in the ſame hands any longer that have ſo abuſed him: Yea he knoweth that it was God that indeed preſerved him, while he was over Solicitous about it himſelf, and would needs have the managing of his own affairs. He now believes that he can be no where ſafe but in the hands of God, and no way ſufficiently provided for but by his wiſdom, love and power: Nor dare he truſt himſelf hereafter with himſelf or any Creature! He finds that he hath but turmoiled and diſtracted his mind by undertaking the management of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: and that he hath brought himſelf into a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and loſt himſelf and ravelled his own affairs: when if he had committed himſelf to God, and been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his Wiſdom, Love, and Power, all had been kept ſafe and ſound, and man had not been loſt, nor his eſtate thus ſhattered and overthrown. And therefore the <hi>returning ſelf-denying</hi> convert is brought to an utter <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of <hi>himſelf,</hi> and reſolved hereafter to truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon nothing below All-ſufficiency and Infinite Love. He is ſo offended with himſelf for his former ſelf-deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and for undoing himſelf ſo fooliſhly, that he calls
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34706:57"/>
himſelf to account and into judgement for it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth himſelf as a Traytor to God, and a Murderer of himſelf, and will no more be in the hands of ſo treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a delinquent: But as the eyes of a ſervant are on the hand of his Maſter, ſo are his eyes on God for all ſupplies. And this is the part of the work of the ſpirit of Adoption, who teacheth us to cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as Children, not to be very careful for our ſelves, but to run to our Father in all our wants, and tell him, what we ſtand in need of and beg relief: and <hi>to be careful for nothing: but in every thing by prayer with ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and thanksgiving to make knownour requeſts to God,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. And this acquieſcence of the ſoul in the love of God, is it that <hi>keepeth our hearts and minds in that Peace of God which paſſeth underſtanding,</hi> verſ. 7. ſo that the more ſelf-denyal, the leſs is a man <hi>dependant on himſelf,</hi> or troubled with the cares of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: and the more doth he caſt himſelf on God, and is careful to pleaſe him that is his true Preſerver, and then quietech and reſteth his mind in his All-ſufficiency and infinite wiſdom and love; and ſo is a meer dependant upon God.</p>
               <p>7. Moreover; It is the Prerogative of God as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Owner of us, to be the ſole <hi>Diſpoſer</hi> of <hi>man</hi> and of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>other</hi> Creatures: and to chooſe them their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and give them their ſeveral Talents, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the events of all their affairs, as pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; And innocent man was contented with this order, and well pleaſed that God ſhould be the abſolute Diſpoſer of him and all.</p>
               <p>But when man turned from God to ſelf, he preſently deſired to be the Diſpoſer of himſelf; and not of <hi>himſelf</hi> only, but of all the Creatures within his reach. How fain would <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> corrupted man be the chooſer of his own condition? His will is againſt the will of God, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34706:57"/>
he uſually diſliketh Gods diſpoſal. If he had the matter in his own hands, almoſt nothing ſhould be as it is; but ſo croſs would they be to God that all thing would be turned upſide down: If it were at their will, there's ſcarce a poor man but would be Rich: and ſcarce a Rich man but would be richer: The Servant would be maſter: The Tenant would be a Landlord: The Husbandman and Tradeſman would be a Gentleman: the Labourer would live an eaſier life: His houſe ſhould be better: his cloathing ſhould be better; his fare ſhould be better: his Proviſion ſhould be greater, his credit or honour with men ſhould be more; the Gentleman would be a Knight, and the Knight a Lord, and the Lord would be a King, and the King would be more Abſolute and have a larger Dominion: Nay <hi>every man</hi> would be a King, and learn the doctrine of the Jews, and many of this age among us, to expect that the world ſhould be ruled by them; and they ſhould reign as Lords and Princes in the earth. If it were with <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men as they would have it, there's ſcarce a man that would be what he is, nor dwell where he doth, nor live at the rates that now he liveth at. The weak would be always ſtrong; and the ſick would be well and always well; and the old would be young again; and never taſte the infirmities of age; and if they might live as long as they would, I think there's few of the unſanctified that would ever die, nor look after Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as long as they could live on earth. O what a brave life ſhould I have, thinks the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> unſanctified wretch, if I were but wholly at my own Diſpoſal, and might be what I <hi>would be,</hi> and have what I <hi>would</hi> have! What would men give for ſuch a life as this? Had they but their own <hi>wills,</hi> they would think themſelves the happieſt men on earth: that is, if they could be delivered from the will of God, and be from under his diſpoſal, and get the reins into their own hands!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:34706:58"/>Nay this is not all, but the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> perſon would be the diſpoſer of all the world within his reach, as well as of himſelf. He would have Kingdoms at his <hi>diſpoſe,</hi> and all things carried according to his Will: He would have all his neighbours have a <hi>dependance</hi> upon him; Very bountiful he would be, if he were the Lord of all: For he would be the great Benefactor of the world, and have all men beholden to him, and depend upon him. If he ſee things that little concern him, he hath a will of his own that would fain have the Diſpoſal of them. If he hear of the affairs of other Nations, ſome will he hath of his own which he would have fulfilled in them, at leaſt ſo far as any of his own intereſt may be involved in the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>But when Sanctification hath brought men to <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal,</hi> then they diſcern and lament this folly: They ſee what ſilly giddy worms they are to be <hi>Diſpoſers</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or of the world: They ſee that they have neither wiſdom, nor goodneſs, nor power ſufficient for ſo great a work. They then perceive that it were better make an Ideot the Pilot of a Ship, or an Infant to be their Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian when they are ſick, or the Diſpoſer of their eſtates, than to commit themſelves and the world to their diſpoſe. They ſee how fooliſhly they have endeavoured or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to rob God of his prerogative: And therefore they return from themſelves to him, and give up all by free conſent to his ſole Diſpoſal, that ſo he may do with his own as he liſt. He finds that he hath work enough to do of his own, and is become too unfit for that: and therefore he dare no more undertake the work of God, for which he is infinitely unfit. He finds that the more he hath his <hi>own will,</hi> the worſe it goes with him: and therefore he will give up himſelf to God and ſtand to <hi>his will:</hi> If he feels that Providence doth croſs his fleſh, and that he hath Poverty when the fleſh would have riches, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34706:58"/>
ſlame when that carnal <hi>ſelf</hi> would have honour, and labour when the fleſh would have eaſe, and ſickneſs when the fleſh would have health, he would not for all that have the work taken out of the hand of God, but truly ſaith, <hi>Not my will but thine be done:</hi> and believeth that Gods diſpoſal is the beſt; and that his Father knows well enough what he doth; And if it were put to his choice, whether God or he ſhould be the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of his eſtate and honour and Life, he had rather it were in Gods hands than his own: and would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the charge, if it were offered him. Alas, thinks he, I am almoſt below a man and am I fit to make a God of? I come off ſo lamely in the duty of a Creature as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves damnation: and am I fit to arrogate the work of the Creator?</p>
               <p>8. Moreover it is the high Prerogative of God to be the <hi>Soveraign Ruler</hi> of the world; to make Laws for them, which muſt be obeyed; and to reward the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and puniſh the diſobedient. God is King of all the earth; even King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and all ſhall obey him, or be judged by him for their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>But ſin turned man into a <hi>Rebel</hi> againſt Heaven, and a <hi>Traitor</hi> to his Maker: ſo that now the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man <hi>diſliketh</hi> Gods Government, at leaſt in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and would Govern himſelf. The Law of God contained in his Word and Works he murmurs at as too obſcure, or too preciſe and ſtrict for him. He finds that it croſſeth his Carnal intereſt, and ſpeaks not good of him but evil, and therefore he is againſt it as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be againſt him and his pleaſure, profit, and honour in the world. If men had but the Government of themſelves, what a difference would there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their way and Gods? If corrupt unſanctified ſelfiſh man might make a Law for himſelf in ſtead of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34706:59"/>
the Word of God, what a Law would it be? and how much of the Law of God ſhould be repealed? If ſinners might make a Scripture, you ſhould find in it no ſuch paſſages as theſe, [<hi>Except a man be Converted, or born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven: without Holineſs none ſhall ſee God.</hi>] If <hi>ſelf</hi> might make Laws, you ſhould not read in them [<hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die; but if by the Spirit ye mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>] Nor ſhould you there find, that <hi>the Gate is ſtrait, and the way is narrow that leads to life, and few there be that find it;</hi> or that <hi>the righteous are ſcarcely ſaved</hi>] As all the Scripture is now for Holineſs, and againſt Prophaneneſs, Ungodlineſs, and Senſuality; if <hi>ſelf</hi> had the framing of it, it ſhould all be changed, and it ſhould at leaſt ſpeak peace to fleſhly-minded men: All thoſe true and dreadful paſſages that ſpeak fire and brimſtone againſt the unſanctified, and threatned everlaſting torments, ſhould be razed out; and you ſhall find no talk of <hi>damnation</hi> in the Scripture for ſuch as they: no talk of <hi>the worm that never dyeth, or the fire that is never quenched,</hi> or of [<hi>Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity; I know you not</hi>] or that [<hi>the way of the ungodly ſhall periſh</hi>] or that [<hi>God doth laugh at them, becauſe he ſeeth that their day is coming</hi>] Abundance of the Bible would be wiped out, if Carnal <hi>ſelf</hi> had but the altering of it: Nay it would be quite made new, and made a contrary thing: the Articles of our Creed would be changed: the Petitions of our Rule for Prayer would be moſt altered: every one of the ten Commandments would be altered, as I ſhall after ſhew. Idolatry ſhould be no ſin, but the principal Law; for <hi>ſelf</hi> would be ſet up as the Idol of the world: <hi>will-worſhip</hi> would be no ſin; men would he held guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that take the name of God in vain: The Lords day ſhould be a day of mirth and carnal pleaſure: every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34706:59"/>
would be the Soveraign; and every Inferiour the Superior; Revenge would be made lawful for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though not for others: Fornication and Adultery would be no mortal ſin; Stealing would be made tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves; it ſhould be lawful to them to do any wrong to the name and reputation of another: in a word, every man would do what he liſt, and his will ſhould be his Law, and himſelf ſhould be his own Judge; a gentle tender Judge no doubt. Thus would <hi>ſelf</hi> Rule.</p>
               <p>But ſanctification brings men to <hi>Deny</hi> this <hi>ſelf;</hi> and to lay down the Arms of Rebellion againſt God; and to ſee how unfit we are to Rule our ſelves; that we are too fooliſh, and ſinful, and partial to make Laws, and too partial alſo and tender to execute them; and that as we were made to obey, ſo obey we muſt, and come again into our ranks, and willingly ſubject our ſelves to the Soveraign of the world. Self denyal teacheth a man to have his own Carnal wiſdom and reaſonings that riſe up againſt the Laws of God; and to Love them the worſe becauſe they are thus his own; and to love the Laws of God the better, becauſe they are God's, and becauſe they are againſt his <hi>Carnal ſelf.</hi> The ſtamps of God on them doth make them currant with him, when if they had but the private ſtamps of <hi>ſelf,</hi> he would diſown them as counterfeit or treaſonable. He hath indeed a fleſh that is reſtrained by Gods Laws, and ſtriveth againſt them; but he thinks never the worſe of the Law for that, but approveth and liketh it in the inner man: and if he might have his choice, he would not blot out one Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor one Direction, nor one Article of Faith, nor a tittle of the Law, becauſe that <hi>ſelf</hi> is not the Chooſer in him; but he hath learned to ſubmit to the will and wiſdom of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And though he <hi>love himſelf,</hi> and have a nature that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34706:60"/>
is unwilling of ſuffering, and feareth the diſpleaſure of God, and the threatnings of his holy Law: yet doth he unfeignedly juſtifie the Law, and acknowledge it to be holy, and juſt, and good; and would not have the very threatnings of it to be repealed and blotted out, if he had his choice: for he knows that the Determinations of God are the beſt, and that none but he is fit to govern, and therefore he deſires that he himſelf may be taught better to <hi>obey,</hi> and not that he may <hi>rule;</hi> and wiſheth that he were more conformed to the Law; and not that the Law were conformed to him; and fain he would have his own will brought up to Gods, but wiſheth not Gods will to be crookened and brought down to his. As far as men have <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> this is ſo.</p>
               <p>9. Moreover, as it is Gods Prerogative to be the <hi>Soveraign Ruler</hi> of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>of all others</hi> as well as us. But when ſin had ſet up <hi>ſelf,</hi> man would not only Rule himſelf, but would <hi>rule all others.</hi> An eager deſire there is in the unſanctified <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> heart, that he might be Ruler of Town and Country, and all might be brought to do his will. And hence it is that there is ſuch reſiſting and grudging at good Governors, and that men are ſo ambitious and fain would be higheſt, becauſe they would have their own wills fulfilled by all, and therefore would have power to force men to it: Hence it is that there is ſuch a ſtir in the world for Crowns and Kingdoms: and few men have ever been heard of, that have refuſed a Scepter when it was offered them, yea or that would not ſtep out of their way for it, and wound their Conſciences, and hazard all their hopes of Heaven for it, if they found themſelves in a likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of obtaining it; becauſe where <hi>ſelf</hi> doth raign at home, it would raign alſo over all others. Nothing more pleaſeth the Carnal mind, than to have his will, and to have all men do what he would have them, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34706:60"/>
to ſee all at his beck, and each man ſeeking to know his Pleaſure, ready to receive his word for Law. This is the reign of <hi>ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſanctification teaching men <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> doth make them look fiſt at the Doing of <hi>Gods will;</hi> and would have all the world obedient to that; and for their <hi>own</hi> wills, they reſign them abſolutely to Gods, and would not have men obey them but in a due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the Lord. As they affect no Dominion or Government but for God, ſo they deſire not men to obey their wills any further than it is neceſſary to the obedience of Gods will, to which they are ſerviceable and conform. The ſelf-denying ſanctified man hath as careful an eye up and down the world for Gods intereſt, as the <hi>ſelf-ſeeker</hi> hath for his own: And as eagerly doth he long to hear of the ſetting up of the Name, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Will or Laws of God in the world, as the ambitious man longs for the ſetting up of his own. And it as much rejoyceth the holy ſelf-denying man to hear that Gods Laws are ſet up and obeyed, and that the world doth ſtoop to Jeſus Chriſt, as it would rejoyce the Carnal <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> wretch to be the Lord and Maſter of all himſelf, and his will become the Law of the world. An Holy ſelf-denying man would be far gladder to hear that <hi>Africa, America,</hi> and the reſt of the unbelieving part of the world were Converted to Chriſt by the power of the Goſpel, and that the Heathens were his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the Kingdoms of the world become the Kingdoms of Chriſt, than if he had Conquered all theſe himſelf, and were become the King or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the world. For as <hi>ſelf</hi> is the chief intereſt of an unſanctified man; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>will</hi> of God is the chief Intereſt of the ſanctified: for the hath deſtroyed the contradictory Intereſt of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it, and hath taken God for his End, and Chriſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34706:61"/>
for the Way, and conſequently for his higheſt Intereſt: ſo that he hath now no buſineſs in the world but Gods buſineſs; he hath no honour to regard but Gods honour; he hath none to exalt but the King of Kings; he knows no gain but the pleaſing of God; he knows no content or pleaſure but Gods pleaſure: for the life that he now lives in the fleſh, he lives by faith of the Son of God, that hath loved him and given himſelf for him; and thereby hath drawn him out of himſelf to the Fountain and End of Love; and ſo it is not he that lives, but Chriſt liveth in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, it is the high Prerogative of God, to have the <hi>honour and Power and Glory aſcribed to him, and be praiſed as the author of all Good to the world:</hi> and his Glory he will not give to another: Man and all things are Created, and preſerved and ordered for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Nor ſhall man have any Glory but in the Glorifying of his Lord: when we fell ſhort of Glorifying the Lord, we alſo fell ſhort of the Glory which we expected by him.</p>
               <p>But when ſin turned man from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>himſelf,</hi> he became regardleſs of the honour of God, and his mind was bent on his <hi>own Honour,</hi> ſo that he would have every knee bow to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and every eye obſerve him, and every mind think highly of him, and every tongue to praiſe and magnifie him: It doth him good at the heart, to have vertue, and wiſdom, and greatneſs aſcribed to him, and an excellency in all; and to have all the good that is done aſcribed to him, and to be taken to be as the Sun in the firmament that all muſt eye, and none can live without, and to be eſteemed the benefactor of all. When he hears that men extol him and ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him but well, and great things; and when he ſees them all obſerve and reverence him, and take him as an Oracle for wiſdom, or as an Angel of God, O how this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34706:61"/>
pleaſeth his unſanctified <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> mind! Now he hath his End, even that which he would have; and verily ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they have their reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when Sanctification hath taught men to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſee then that they are vile and miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and loath themſelves for all their abominations; and are baſe in their own eyes, and humble themſelves before the Lord, and abhor themſelves in duſt and aſhes, and ſay, <hi>To us belongeth ſhame and confuſion of face; Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give the glory,</hi> Pſal. 115. 1. Dan. 9. 7, 8. The holy <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> ſoul deſireth no glory and honour, but what may conduce to the glory and honour of his Lord: His heart riſeth againſt baſe flattering worldlings, that would rob God and give the honour to him: nor can they do him a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure than to aſcribe that to him belongeth only to God, or to bring to him or any Creature, his Makers due. If God be honoured, he takes himſelf as honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he be never ſo low: If God be diſhonoured, he is troubled, and his own honour will not make him repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As he liveth himſelf to the glory of God, and doth all that he doth in the world to that end; ſo would he have others do ſo too: And if God be moſt honoured by his diſgrace and ſhame, he can ſubmit.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you the true Nature both of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and of <hi>ſelf-denyal.</hi> But obſerve that I deſcribe it as it is in it ſelf: but yet there is too much ſelfiſhneſs in the beſt, which may hinder the fulneſs of theſe effects. But <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> is predominant in all the ſanctified, though it be not perfect.</p>

               <p>III. ANd now you have ſeen the Deſcription of ſelf-denyal, and I hope, if you have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed it, you know what it is that is required; I ſhall next ſhew you ſome of the Reaſons of its Neceſſity, and prove it to you beyond diſpute that it is no indifferent thing, nor the high attainment of ſome few of the Saints, but a thing that all muſt have that will be ſaved, being of the very eſſence of holineſs it ſelf; ſo that it is as poſſible to live without life; as to be Holy without ſelf-denyal; and as poſſible to be ſaved whether God will or no, as to be ſaved without <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant degree. And if any of you thing ſtrange that ſalvation ſhould be laid on ſo high a duty, and that no man can be a true Diſciple that denyeth not himſelf, even to the forſaking of his Life, and all, when God requireth it, I ſhall ſhew you that Reaſon that ſhould eaſily ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Till a man Deny <hi>himſelf,</hi> he <hi>denyeth</hi> God, and doth not indeed believe in him, and love him, and take him to be his God. And I hope you will grant that no man can be ſaved that believes not in God, nor Loveth him, nor takes him for his God: He that will deny God and yet think to be ſaved, muſt think to be ſaved in deſpight of God. The firſt Article of our faith, and of our Baptiſmal Chriſtian Covenant, is to Believe in God the Father, and take him for our God, and give up our ſelves to be his people. But this no man can do without ſelf-denyal. For by all that I have ſaid in the deſcription of it, you may ſee that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34706:62"/>
to God, and would rob him of all his high Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and God ſhould be no God, if the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ſinner had his will: and he doth not heartily conſent that he ſhall be God to him. I have formerly told you, that <hi>ſelf</hi> is the God of wicked men, or the worlds great Idol: And that the inordinate Love of Pleaſure, Profits and Honour, in Trinity, is all but this <hi>ſelf love</hi> in Unity; and that in the Malignant Trinity of Gods enemies, the fleſh is the firſt and foundation, the world the ſecond, and the Devil the third: Every man is an Idolater ſo far as he is ſelfiſh. God is not a bare name: He that takes away his Eſſence or Attributes and Prerogatives, and yet thinks he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, becauſe he leaveth him his name and Titles, doth as bad as they that ſet up an Image, and worſhip that inſtead of God, or that worſhip the Sun or Moon as Gods, becauſe they ſomewhat repreſent his Glory: for ſure a bare Name hath as little ſubſtance as an Image; much leſs can you ſay it hath more than the Sun. Now <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ungodly men do all of them rob God, and give his honour and prerogatives to themſelves, and put him off with empty Titles: They call him their God, but will not have him for their End, their Portion and Felicity, nor give him the ſtrongeſt Love of their hearts: They will not take him as their Abſolute Owner; and devote themſelves and all they have to him, and ſtand with a willing mind to his Diſpoſe. They will not take him for their Soveraign, and be Ruled by him, nor deny themſelves for him, nor ſeek his honour and intereſt above their own. They call him their Father, but deny him his honour; and their Maſter, but give him not his fear, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. They depend not on his hand, and live not by his Law, and to his Glory; and therefore they do not take him for their God. And can you expect that God ſhould ſave thoſe that deny him and would dethrone him? that is, his very enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:34706:63"/>Reaſ. 2. Yea more than ſo; <hi>God will not ſave thoſe that make themſelves their own Gods, when they have rejected him.</hi> But all theſe unſanctified <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men, do make themſelves their own Gods: for in all the ten par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before mentioned, they take to themſelves the Prerogatives of God. 1.

And they would be honoured and admired by all, and have the praiſe aſcribed to them. And if all this be not to ſet up themſelves as Gods or Idols in the world, I know not what is. Certainly God is ſo far from having a thought of ſaving ſuch vile Idolaters (in this Condition) that they are the principal objects of his high diſpleaſure, and the faireſt Marks for his Juſtice to ſhoot at: and he is engaged to pull them down and tread them into hell: ſhould God ſtand by and ſee a company of rebellious ſinners ſit down in his Throne, or uſurp his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Divine Prerogatives, and let them alone, yea and advance them to his Glory? No, he hath reſolved that <hi>he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted, and he that exalted himſelf ſhall be brought low.</hi> And what higher <hi>ſelf-exaltation</hi> can there be, than to make our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves

               <p>Reaſ. 3. <hi>No man can be a Chriſtian that takes not Chriſt for his Lord and Saviour; But no man without this ſelf-denyal can take Chriſt for his Lord and Saviour:</hi> and therefore no man without ſelf-denyal can be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and ſo be ſaved. He that makes <hi>himſelf</hi> his <hi>End,</hi> cannot make Chriſt as Chriſt his way: for Chriſt is the way to the <hi>Father,</hi> and not to <hi>Carnalſelf.</hi> Nay the buſineſs that Chriſt came upon into the world, was to pull down and ſubdue this <hi>ſelf.</hi> Moreover whoever taketh Chriſt for his Saviour, muſt know from what it is that he muſt ſave him; and that is principally from <hi>ſelf:</hi> And no man can take Chriſt for his Saviour that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth not <hi>ſelf-confidence,</hi> and is not willing to be ſaved from the Idolatry of <hi>ſelf-exaltation.</hi> No man can take Chriſt for his Maſter or Teacher, that comes not into his ſchool as a little child, renouncing the guidance of <hi>Carnal-ſelf,</hi> and ſenſible of his need of an heavenly Teacher. No man can take Chriſt for his King and Lord, and give up himſelf to him as his own and as his Subject, that hath not learned to deny that <hi>ſelf</hi> that claims propriety and ſoveraignty in his ſtead. There is no Antichriſt nor falſe Chriſt that ever was in the world, that doth more truly oppoſe Chriſt, and reſiſt him in all the parts of his office, than Carnal <hi>ſelf.</hi> It is this that will not ſtoop to his Righteouſneſs, or to his Guidance, and to his teaching and holy Government. <hi>Self</hi> is the <hi>falſe Chriſt</hi> or Saviour of the world, as well as the <hi>falſe God.</hi> And therefore there can be no ſalvation, where <hi>ſelf</hi> is not denyed and taken down.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 4. <hi>He that believeth not in the Holy Ghoſt, and taketh him not for his Sanctifier, cannot be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or be ſaved. But no man without this ſelf-denyal believeth in the Holy Ghoſt, and taketh him for his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier:</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:34706:64"/>
And therefore without this <hi>Self-denyal</hi> no man can be a true Chriſtian or be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The very nature of ſanctification conſiſteth in the turning a man from <hi>himſelf</hi> to God: in deſtroying <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and devoting the ſoul to God by Chriſt. And therefore it is paſt diſpute, that none but the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying are ſanctified: and therefore none b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Reaſ. 5. <hi>No man is a true Chriſtian and in a ſtate of ſalvation, that denyeth, renounceth or rejecteth the word of God.</hi> But all men that have not <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> (that hear the word of God) do renounce, deny it or reject it: and therefore no man without <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> is a true Chriſtian or can be ſaved. In the Scriptures it is that we <hi>have eternal life:</hi> its they that muſt <hi>make us wiſe to ſalvation:</hi> the man that will be <hi>bleſſed,</hi> muſt <hi>meditate in them day and night,</hi> Pſal. 1. 3. And it is <hi>not the hearers but the Doers of them that are bleſſed.</hi> But nothing is more clear, than that the voice of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calleth aloud on all men to deny themſelves; and that the ſcope of it is to cry down <hi>ſelf,</hi> and ſet up God in Jeſus Chriſt. It is the very drift and meaning of it from end to end to take down <hi>ſelf,</hi> and abaſe men in their own eyes, and bring them home to God from whom they are revolted.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 6. <hi>No man can be a Chriſtian or be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaving Grace.</hi> But no man without <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> hath ſaving Grace. For it is the nature of every Grace to carry man from <hi>himſelf</hi> to God by Chriſt. It is the work of <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> to humble proud man, and break the heart of <hi>carnal ſelf.</hi> It is the work of faith, for a <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> ſoul to paſs out for hope and life to Chriſt. It is the work of <hi>Love</hi> to carry us quite above <hi>our ſelves</hi> to that infinite
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34706:64"/>
goodneſs which we love: it is the nature of <hi>holy fear</hi> to confeſs our guilt and inſufficiency, and to ſuſpect our ſelves, and dread the fruit of our own ways. Confidence doth bottom us upon God, and Hope it ſelf doth imply a Deſpairing in <hi>our ſelves.</hi> Thankfulneſs doth pay the homage to him that hath ſaved us from our ſelves. And every grace hath <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> as half its very life or ſoul. And therefore it is certain that no man hath any more grace than he hath <hi>ſelf-denyal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reaſ. 7. <hi>They that reject the Miniſtry and the fruit of all the Ordinances of God, are not true Chriſtians, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved:</hi> But ſo do all among us that have not <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal.</hi> For the uſe of the Miniſtry is to call home ſinners from <hi>themſelves</hi> to God. The uſe of every <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, is to get or keep down <hi>carnal ſelf</hi> and exalt the Lord. <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is nothing but <hi>ſelf-abaſing:</hi> and he muſt <hi>confeſs,</hi> that will have the faithful and juſt God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him: for <hi>he that covereth his ſin ſhall not proſper,</hi> 1 John 1. 9. Prov. 28. 13. <hi>Prayer</hi> is a confeſſion of our own emptineſs, inſufficiency and unworthineſs, and a flying from <hi>our ſelves</hi> for help unto another. In <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we come as condemned priſoners for a pardon, as it were with ropes about our necks, and ſtrip our ſelves of the rags of our filthineſs, that by the blood of the lamb we may be waſhed from our blood, and our ſins may be buried as in the depth of the Sea. In the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> we renew the ſame Covenant, and receive the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed pardon; and ſtill fly from <hi>our ſelves</hi> to Chriſt for life; and renounce our <hi>carnal ſelves</hi> by ſolemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as a people coming home to God. So that never was any Ordinance of God, effectual and ſaving on the ſoul of any, further than it brought them to <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> or preſerved, exerciſed or manifeſted it.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 8. <hi>He that can do no work ſincerely, nor go one ſtep in the way of life, is no true Chriſtian nor in a ſtate life.</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34706:65"/>
But this is the caſe of all that have not <hi>ſelf-denyal.</hi> For <hi>ſelf</hi> is their Principle, Rule and End: and he that hath either a falſe Principle, Rule or End, cannot be ſincere in any of the means; much leſs when he is out in all of theſe. A <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> man is ſeeking <hi>himſelf</hi> in his very <hi>Religion;</hi> and is ſerving <hi>himſelf</hi> when he ſeemeth to be ſerving God. And indeed he doth not any ſervice ſincerely unto God, becauſe he makes not God his End; And therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accepted.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 9. <hi>No man is a true Chriſtian or can be ſaved, that ſticks in the depth of his natural miſery, in his lapſed ſtate:</hi> But ſo do all men that have not <hi>ſelf-denyal:</hi> for it is <hi>ſelf</hi> that they are faln to, and muſt be ſaved from.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 10. <hi>No man can be a true Chriſtian and be ſaved, that is not a member of the Holy Catholick Church and the Communion of Saints.</hi> But ſo is none but the <hi>ſelf-denying;</hi> for every true member of the Church hath a publick ſpirit, preferring the Churches intereſt to his own, and ſuffering with fellow members in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having a care of one another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. But the <hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> unſanctified perſon is a ſtranger to this diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 11. <hi>He that is led by the greateſt enemy of God and his own ſoul, is not a true Chriſtian, nor in a ſtate of life.</hi> But ſo is every man that hath not learned to deny <hi>himſelf.</hi> For <hi>ſelf</hi> is the greateſt enemy of God and us. Eſcape but your own hands and you are out of danger. All the Devils in Hell cannot deſtroy you, if you would not be your own deſtroyers.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 12. Laſtly, <hi>It is a plain contradiction to be ſaved without ſelf-denyal.</hi> For as its <hi>ſelf</hi> that we muſt be <hi>ſaved from</hi> both as our <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> and greateſt enemy: ſo to <hi>ſtick</hi> in <hi>ſelf</hi> is ſtill to be loſt and miſerable, and therefore not to be ſaved. So that the caſe is as plain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34706:65"/>
as a caſe can be, that no man can be a true Chriſtian or Diſciple of Chriſt without ſelf-denyal; and conſequently none without it can be ſaved. I have been the briefer upon the Arguments, becauſe the matter of ſome of them may come to be fullier opened anon in the Application.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. AND now we have ſeen from the words of Chriſt the abſolute Neceſſity of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, and that there is no true Chriſtianity nor ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without it; let us next take a view of our ſelves, and of the world, and Judge of our condition by this certain Rule.</p>
               <p>Look well into your ſelves, and into the world, and tell me whether you find not cauſe to lament, 1. That true Chriſtianity is ſo rare a thing, even among the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, ſeeing ſelf-denyal is ſo rare. 2. That Grace is ſo weak and ſmall in the moſt of the regnerate, ſeeing ſelf-denyal is ſo little and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
               <p>O if the name of Chriſtians would prove us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and the magnificent Titles we give to Chriſt would prove that we are his true Diſciples; if reading, and hearing, and outward duties, and a cheap Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs would ſerve turn, we have then great ſtore of Chriſtians among us: If Chriſt would have left out but this one point of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> from his Laws and conditions of ſalvation, what abundance of Diſciples would he have had in the world? and how many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions might have come to Heaven, that now muſt be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34706:66"/>
ſhut out? It is this point that hindereth all ſorts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Infidels from being Chriſtians. The Jews will believe in no Chriſt but one that will reſtore their Temple and outward glory, and make them great and Rulers of the world: and therefore they will not be the ſervants of that Chriſt that calleth them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all theſe things, and of life it ſelf for the hopes of an inviſible Kingdom. The Mahometans had rather believe in <hi>Mahomet</hi> that giveth them leave to pleaſe their luſt, than in Chriſt that calleth them to mortification and ſelf-denyal, and tells them of nothing but ſuffering and patience, duty and diligence, till they come into another world: The Idolatrous Heathens abhor Chriſtianity when they hear how much they muſt do and ſuffer, and all for a reward in the life to come. Its an informing inſtance that <hi>Pet. Maffaeus</hi> gives us in his Indian Hiſtory of the firſt King of <hi>Congo</hi> that was baptized: He quickly received the Articles of faith, and the form of Worſhip, and the outſide and cheaper part of Religion; and ſo did many of his Nobles and followers: But when he was called to confeſſion, and underſtood that he muſt leave his gluttony, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and whoredom, and oppreſſion, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate pleaſures, he would be a Chriſtian no more; his Nobles perſwading him, that the forſaking of all this mirth, and pleaſure, and delights of the fleſh, and taking up ſo ſtrict a life, was too dear a price to pay for the hopes of a life to come, and it was better keep the pleaſure they had, and put another life to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And thus Chriſtianity had been quickly baniſhed that Kingdom again, if it had not taken deeper rooting in his Son and Heir <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and made him venture his Crown and Life for the ſake of Chriſt. And thus is it at the heart with the moſt, even of Baptized perſons, and thoſe that take themſelves to be Chriſtians: Becauſe it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34706:66"/>
the Religion of the Country, and they are taught that there is no ſalvation without it, they will be Baptized, and be called Chriſtians, and ſay their Prayers, and come to Church, and ſay they believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and they will go as far with you in Religion as they can without <hi>denying themſelves:</hi> but for the reſt, which is the life and truth of Chriſtianity, they will not underſtand it, or believe that it is of ſuch neceſſity: God forbid ſay they, that none ſhould be Chriſtians and ſaved but thoſe that thus <hi>deny themſelves,</hi> and take up their croſs and forſake all they have, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not Life it ſelf from Chriſt: They ſay they believe in Chriſt, and yet they ſay, God forbid his word ſhould be true; or God forbid we ſhould believe Chriſt that hath ſpoken this in the Goſpel! See what kind of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians multitudes are! <hi>Every man and woman on earth, that take themſelves for true Chriſtians, and yet do not deny themſelves, even life and all for the ſake of Chriſt and the hope of everlaſting glory, are meer ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and no true Chriſtians at all. He that will ſave his life, ſaith Chriſt, ſhall loſe it;</hi> that is, He that in his coming to Chriſt, and Covenanting with him, will put in an exception for the ſaving of his Life, and will forſake all for Chriſt if he be put to it, <hi>except Life</hi> it ſelf, this man is no true Diſciple of Chriſt, and ſhall be ſo far from ſaving his life, that he ſhall loſe both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Life, and all: and the Juſtice of God ſhall take from him that Life which he durſt not reſign to the will of mercy; and he ſhall loſe that for nothing which he would not loſe for Chriſt and Heaven. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for that man to be Chriſts Diſciple, that loveth his life better than Chriſt and the hopes of Life everlaſting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37, 38. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 25, 26, 33. Some <hi>Self-denyal</hi> there may be in the unſanctified: Many of them would leave a little pleaſure or profit rather than be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34706:67"/>
damned; and many had rather ſuffer a little than venture upon eternal ſufferings. But I beſeech you remember that this is the loweſt degree of <hi>Self-denyal</hi> that is ſaving, to ſet more by Chriſt and the hopes of glory than by all this world and life it ſelf; and to be habitually reſolved to forſake life and all, rather than to forſake him. No leſs than this is proper <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> or will prove you Chriſtians, and in a ſtate of life. This was the tryal that Chriſt put one to, that had thought to have been his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 21. [<hi>Yet lackeſt thou one thing: ſell all that thou haſt and diſtribute to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven, and come and follow me</hi>] Not that every man muſt actually ſell all, but every man muſt ſet more by Heaven than all, and therefore part with all when Chriſt would have him; and he that is not thus reſolved, let him go never ſo far in all other things, doth yet <hi>lack one thing,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>one thing</hi> as he ſhall never be ſaved without. For the meaning of the text is, that Chriſt would try by this command, whether he ſet more by any thing than him, and whether he ſet more by Heaven or Earth; and ſo would have us all to judge of our ſelves by the ſame evidence <hi>within,</hi> though he put not all on the ſame way of diſcovering it. Many a man can deny <hi>ſelf</hi> the ſuperfluities of pleaſure, and as this rich man did, can avoid enormous crimes, and ſay of whoredom, and theft, and drunkenneſs, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and groſs deceit, <hi>All theſe have I avoided from my youth.</hi> Education may moderate ſome <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and natural temper may further that moderation: and cuſtom and good company and holy precepts may yet do more: and wit may teach men to do or ſuffer ſomewhat rather than to run on the wrath of God: and therefore many thouſands may deny <hi>ſelf</hi> the pleaſure of ſome inordinate luſt, or of ſome recreation, or exceſs in meat or drink, and yet be far from denying life and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34706:67"/>
all, and ſo from the true ſelf-denyal of a Chriſtian: Nay a man may <hi>deny ſelf</hi> for <hi>ſelf</hi> in many particulars, and ſo may <hi>pleaſe ſelf</hi> more than he <hi>denyeth</hi> it. Many a civil ingenuous Gentleman and other perſons will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the diſgraceful ſins of Drunkenneſs, filthy ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whoredom, Incivility, notorious Prophaneneſs, even becauſe they <hi>are diſgraceful,</hi> and therefore are againſt the Intereſt of <hi>ſelf;</hi> ſo much as <hi>ſelf</hi> can poſſibly ſpare, a carnal heart may be brought to part with. But ſtill <hi>ſelf</hi> is alive and predominant within them, ſtill it is the Ruling end and Principle. But to go out of <hi>ſelf</hi> to God, and reſign up our <hi>ſelves</hi> to him, and poſſeſs no intereſt but <hi>him</hi> and in <hi>him,</hi> and to have nothing that we eſteem or love, or care for, in compariſon of him, knowing that for him we were made, redeemed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſanctified, and therefore deſiring to be wholly and only his, and to have no credit, no goods, no life, no <hi>ſelf,</hi> but what is <hi>his,</hi> for his ſervice, at his will and at his Diſpoſal and Government and proviſion; this is the true <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> which the ſpirit of God worketh in a prevailing though not a perfect meaſure, in every gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious believing ſoul.</p>
               <p>But alas Sirs, how ſtrange is this in the world, and how weak and low in the ſouls where it is found! And what matter of Lamentation would a ſurvey of the world, or of our ſelves preſent us with! Is not SELF the great Idol which the whole world of unſanctified men doth worſhip? Who is it that ruleth the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, but <hi>carnal ſelf?</hi> For what is all the ſtir and ſtirrings, the tumults and contentions of the world but for <hi>ſelf?</hi> This ruleth Kingdoms, and this is it that raiſeth wars, and what is it except the works of Holineſs but <hi>ſelf</hi> is the author of?

Among all the Nobles and great ones of the earth, that abound in riches, how few are there that were not ſet a work by <hi>ſelf</hi> and ruled by it, in the getting or keeping or uſing their riches, dignities and honours? Look on the great Revenews of the Nation, and of the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether God or <hi>ſelf,</hi> have the more of it. One man hath many thouſands a year, and another hath many hundreds, and how much of this is devoted to God, and how much to <hi>carnal ſelf?</hi> And the poor that have but little, would think us <hi>injurious</hi> to them if we ſhould call to <hi>them</hi> for any thing for God, who have not enough for <hi>themſelves;</hi> when indeed God muſt have all, and <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt have nothing, but what it hath by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from God again, and that for God, and not for <hi>ſelf</hi> but as ſubſervient unto him. Alas, of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds a year, which the inhabitants of a Country poſſeſs among them, how little hath God that ſhould have all, and how much hath <hi>ſelf</hi> that ſhould have nothing? O dreadful reckoning when theſe Accounts muſt be all caſt up! Judge by the uſe of all whether <hi>ſelf</hi> have not yet Dominion of all? If men throw out to God his tenth, which is none of their own; or if they caſt him now and then ſome inconſiderable alms, when in his member he is fain to beg for it firſt, they think they have done fair, though <hi>ſelf</hi> devour all the reſt. Is it more think you for God or <hi>ſelf</hi> that our Courts of Law are filled with ſo many Suits, and Lawyers have ſo much employment? Is it more think you for God or <hi>ſelf</hi> that Merchants compaſs Sea and Land for commodity? Who is it that the Souldier fights for? is it for God or <hi>ſelf?</hi> Who is it that the Tradeſman deals for, that the Plowman labours for, that the Traveller goes for? is it more for God or <hi>ſelf?</hi>

Nay moſt men are ſo dead to God, and alive only to <hi>themſelves,</hi> that they know not what we mean when we tell them, and plainly tell them, what it is to live to God, and what it is to ſerve him in all their affairs; and to eat, and drink, and do all things for his glory; but they ask in their hearts as <hi>Pharaoh, [Who is the Lord, that I ſhould ſerve him?</hi>] And when they read theſe paſſages about <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> and about referring all to God, they will not underſtand them: for they are unacquainted with God, and know no other God <hi>indeed</hi> but <hi>ſelf,</hi> though in <hi>name</hi> they do.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEſide all the generals already mentioned, it will not be amiſs to give you ſome particular Inſtances of the power of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and the rareneſs of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> in the world, that you may ſee what cauſe of lamentation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
               <p>1. How ready and ſpeedy, how effectual and diligent, how conſtant and unwearied are they in the ſervice of <hi>ſelf?</hi> and how ſlow and backward, how remiſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, how unconſtant and tired are they in the works that are meerly for God, and their ſalvation? Do I need to prove it to you? You may as well call for proof whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are men in the world? I were beſt for inſtance begin next home. Many Miniſters think it a drudgery and a toil that God requireth at their hands to confer with every family in their Pariſhes, and inſtruct them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34706:69"/>
privately in the matters of ſalvation. But ſee what <hi>ſelf</hi> can do: If the ſame men have but their tithe to gather, they will not think it a needleſs thing, to go or ſend to every family, and ſpeak with them all about their own buſineſs. At leaſt if it were any conſiderable ſum, they would not loſe it for want of ſpeaking for.</p>
               <p>Our neighbours do many of them think it much that we ſhould call them to be perſonally Inſtructed or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized, and they will not come at us; but ſay, [What needs all this ado? have we not teaching enough at Church? Its Children that muſt be Catechized, and we are paſt Children.] You ſee how little intereſt God and their Miniſters and their own ſalvation hath in them: But will you ſee what <hi>carnal ſelf</hi> can do more? Had I but money enough, I would undertake to make them come to me, and follow me as a horſe will follow his provender! Had I but ten pound a piece to give them, yea or but ten ſhillings, I do not think I ſhould have any refuſe to come and fetch it, unleſs it were thoſe that now are the forwardeſt in ſeeking relief for the wants of their ſouls. Had I but the eſtates or lives of all theſe men in my power, how eaſily would they be ruled and how diligently and ſubmiſſively would they attend, that now for God and their everlaſting life, diſdain to come and ſeek inſtructions. And yet theſe men would ſcarce believe you, if you ſhould tell them that <hi>ſelf</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> is made their God, and that God himſelf is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed and rejected by them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, a long time I have been perſwading all the families in the Town and Pariſh, to read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and daily call upon God together: I have proved it their duty from Scripture, and this doth not prevail. But ſee what <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſelf</hi> can do? If theſe men were but ſure of ten or twenty ſhillings a time, for every Morning and Evening that they pray together, I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34706:70"/>
warrant you, what ever the heart did, the lips ſhould be taught to do their part. O how buſie would all the Town and Pariſh be to learn to pray, that now look not after it? I do not believe that there is ever a houſe among them all that would not very ſhortly ſet up prayer, if they were but paid for it after theſe rates? Judge now whether <hi>God</hi> or <hi>ſelf</hi> bear ſway among theſe men, and whether ſoul or body be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we have too many drunkards in the Town, that no means that we can uſe will reſtrain and keep ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. They love the drink, and they cannot forbear; and tell them of Gods word, that doth threaten them with damnation, and they will for all that be drunk the next day. But if one of theſe wretches might have but ten pound a week on condition he would forbear, I do not think for all this but he could forbear: Or if he were ſure that for every cup of drink, he ſhould drink after it a cup of piſs or gall, I warrant you he would ſoon begin to abate.</p>
               <p>We have abundance of ignorant ſenſual men that for love of ſin refuſe Church-Government, and will not come under it. But if the Magiſtrate would but make a Law, that all men ſhall he members of a particular Church and ſubmit to diſcipline, or forfeit but twenty ſhillings a month, how few refuſers ſhould we have in all the Town or Country?</p>
               <p>We have many that ſeldom come to hear in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies; but let the Parliament make a Law that they ſhall pay for their reſuſal, and how readily will it bring the moſt of them? (unleſs they have hopes that the Law will not be executed) And judge now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſelf</hi> or <hi>God</hi> have greater Intereſts in theſe mens hearts.</p>
               <p>I ſee but one piece of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> among this ſort of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34706:70"/>
people in this Town, and that this: Though the officers are to give the money to the poor which they have from ſwearers, drunkards, unlicenſed and abuſive Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, prophaners of the Lords day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet that ſort of the poor themſelves do hate thoſe officers that are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their duties. This is ſtrange, that the love of money doth not change them. But whether it be that they can deny their fleſh for the Devil, though not for God; and in <hi>enmity</hi> to godlineſs, though not to <hi>further</hi> it; or whether it be that the officers do uſe to give their mony to an honeſter ſort of poor, and theſe have none of it, I cannot well tell.</p>
               <p>And having given ſo many ſad inſtances of the power of <hi>ſelf</hi> and ſcarcity of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> in others, I hope the Magiſtrates will not take it ill if we help them to diſcern this enemy in themſelves, nor be offended that they come laſt, unleſs it were in a more honourable cauſe. I hear the beſt and wiſeſt men that I can meet with, complain that in moſt places, Ale-houſes flouriſh under the Magiſtrates Noſes; and that whoredom, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prophaning the Lords days, ſhall ſeldom be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but when they are very much urged to it, nor then neither if it will but diſpleaſe a neighbour, or friend, eſpecially if it be a worſhipful ſwearer or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard that is to be puniſhed. We ſee in moſt places that its more than the Juſtice can do to put down one Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of many that they conſeſs ſhould be ſuppreſſed; and I doubt but <hi>few</hi> can keep them from <hi>increaſing:</hi> Men ſay that there is ſo much ado before they can have Juſtice from many of them, and thoſe that ſeek it are counted but for buſie troubleſome fellows, that many are ready to let all alone: And whence is all this, that men <hi>in Power</hi> can do ſo little againſt thoſe that have <hi>no Power</hi> to reſiſt them? Why Alas the cauſe is plain: <hi>Self</hi> is againſt it: They have none but God and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34706:71"/>
and a few preciſe fellows to perſwade them to it: and they have no greater motives, than what is fetcht from Heaven and Hell to move them to it: and theſe are but ſmall matters with them (I ſpeak of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified) It muſt be one that hath greater intereſt in them than God that muſt perſwade them to it: It muſt be more powerful matters than the promiſes of Heaven and the Threatnings of damnation that muſt prevail with ſuch moderate Gentlemen as theſe. And who is it that can do this that God and their ſalvation may not do? Why even <hi>ſelf, carnal ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> If you know but how to engage their own <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I warrant you it will go better on. Let but every informer be well p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ion of ſuch laws, and how roundly would the work go on? Then they would not ſay [<hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it,</hi> or <hi>We are not bound to look after them.</hi>] Do you think I wrong them or ſpeak without proof? I will leave it to your judgement when I have given you but theſe few inſtances. Let but the Plague break out in the Town, and infect but a quarter as many houſes as here are infectious Alehouſes that harbour tiplers and drunkards, and ſee whether the Magiſtrates of this or any Town will not a little better beſtir themſelves, and ſend to ſearch after infected places, and nail up their doors, and write on them [<hi>Lord have mercy on us</hi>] that all may take warning and keep away: They will not here be offended with Informers, nor ſay, [<hi>Am I bound to look after them?</hi>] And why are they not as zealous againſt ſin as againſt the plague? Great reaſon! <hi>Self</hi> is for ſin; and <hi>God</hi> only is againſt it: but <hi>ſelf</hi> is againſt the Plague, becauſe it is concerned in it: ſin doth but hurt the ſoul, and bring men to Helfire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the plague deſtroys their body; and this is the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34706:71"/>
greater matter with them, becauſe they have <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> to judge of it; but they have not faith to believe the other.</p>
               <p>Again, let but one houſe in the Town be on fire, and all are up to quench it, and the Bell is rung, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate doth not think that he wants a Call himſelf to look after it. And when the fire of Hell is kindling in an Ale-houſe, that's nothing, but muſt be let alone: <hi>there</hi>'s no ſuch zeal, nor no ſuch haſte. And why ſo? Why one they <hi>ſee in good ſadneſs,</hi> and perceive that it is <hi>fire indeed:</hi> but the other they <hi>believe in jeſt,</hi> as if it would prove but a painted fire.</p>
               <p>Again, let but an ungodly fellow ſlander the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or call him all to naught, eſpecially if he give him but two or three boxes on the ear, and ſee whether he will let that man alone. But let the ſame man abuſe the name of God, and break his Laws, and with too many he may be let alone, unleſs they be urged to do Juſtice. And how comes this difference? Why <hi>ſelf</hi> is toucht in one, and it is but God (<hi>But God!</hi> O Atheiſts!) that's touched in the other. <hi>Self</hi> can do more with them than God can do (Remember ſtill when I ſay that <hi>ſelf</hi> can do more with them than God, that I ſpeak not of what God <hi>could</hi> do by his Omnipotency if he would; but of the final Cauſality, or the ſmall intereſt that God hath in their hearts by holy Faith and Love.)</p>
               <p>Again, let but a ſervant rob the Magiſtrate, and carry his money and goods to an Ale-ſeller to reſet; and try whether he will look after him and the Ale-ſeller. And why not as ſoon and as zealouſly when Ale-ſellers reſet mens ſons and ſervants, and drown mens underſtandings and turn them into beaſts? Why? becauſe in one it is but God and mens ſouls that are concerned: (a matter of nothing) but in the other it is <hi>ſelf,</hi> (a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:34706:72"/>Shall I give you but one inſtance more, that the Ale-ſellers themſelves will take my part in, ſo far as to bear me witneſs that its true! Here are Farmers of the Exciſe that have power to know what Ale-houſes are in the Town, and their gain lyeth on it: and there ſhall ſcarce a man in Town or Country ſell Ale ſo ſecretly but they will know it; nor ſell a Barrel but what they are acquainted with. They do not ſay, [<hi>I am not bound to go ſearch after them:</hi>] nor that they be not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them and to bring them to pay Exciſe. But the <hi>Juſtices</hi> (too commonly) can overlook abundance that the Exciſe-men can find; and they cannot make one of twenty pay, when the other can; And whats the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Why one works for <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>money,</hi> and the other works but for God and his own and other mens ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (a ſmall matter!) See then beyond denyal what <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>money</hi> can do with ſuch men, when God and mens ſalvation can do next to nothing.</p>
               <p>But I muſt deſire you not to miſtake me, and think I ſpeak this of any honeſt godly Magiſtrate, and abuſe the good by joyning them with the bad! No: far be it from me to be ſo injurious. For its evident that they can be no good men, nor have any true Love of God in their ſouls, that are ſuch in a predominant ſenſe as I have here deſcribed. It is not in my thoughts to lay this blame on any honeſt Godly Magiſtrate: for none but the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would do as I have mentioned, and prefer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord, and the bodies of men before the ſouls.</p>
               <p>And, alas, if the Soveraign Powers of the Nations of the world were not too ſick of the ſame diſeaſe, gain would not be accounted Godlineſs, but Godlineſs the greateſt gain: and carnal Policie would not go for Piety, but true Piety would go for the ſureſt Policie: It would not be ſo common in moſt Nations to have the Truth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34706:72"/>
and Cauſe of Chriſt diſowned, and his ſervants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, and their lives and blood to be made a ſacrifice to <hi>carnal Self</hi> and worldly Intereſts. Nor would the breaches of the Churches be ſo long unhealed, and grow wider and wider, and few much regard them, but all have their own work to do which muſt be looked after. Yea and the Cauſe of Chriſt and the Goſpel muſt be trod down if it ſtand in the way of their own: And the Churches muſt be ſet on fire by their wars and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Intereſts. And if <hi>Self</hi> were not too ſtrong among us, we ſhould not have had ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence at doctrinal and practical abominations, nor ſo much delay or neglect of healing the diſcompoſed Churches, and uniting the divided Chriſtians, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it more effectually than we have done. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I deſire to ſpeak to none but thoſe that are within my hearing, I will return home to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>The holy ordering and inſtructing of families, and ſuppreſſing ſin in Children and ſervants, is one of the moſt effectual works, for the building up of the Church, and the glory and ſtability of the Common-wealth. O if Parents and Maſters would but ſanctifie their houſes to the Lord, and teach their families the will and fear of God, and do their beſt (by puniſhment, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction will not ſerve) to hinder ſin, how faſt would Reformation then go on? And what hindreth? why car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Self: If it were but for wordly commodities they would do more: Would you have me prove it? Let experience ſpeak. Let a ſervant or child go prayerleſs to their work, and few regard it: but they will not go without meat, or drink, or cloaths. The Maſter will ſuffer them to neglect Gods ſervice; but if they neglect his own, and ſhould do him no more or better ſervice than they do to God, they ſhould ſoon hear of it, and be turned out of door: and they were no ſervants for him.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34706:73"/>
They will teach their children to do their <hi>own</hi> work, or ſet them Apprentices to learn it; but the work of God and their ſalvation, they ſhall for them have little teaching in, how plainly ſoever God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 18, 19. &amp; 6. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
               <p>Let a ſervant or child reproach his Maſter or Parent, or call them all to naught, and they think not fit to put up that (nor indeed is it) but let them ſwear by the name of God or break his Laws, and they can patiently bear with it, and a cold rebuke like <hi>Eli</hi>'s will ſerve turn. They can get them into field or ſhop to work together, but they cannot get them before and after to prayer together. And why is all this? Why one is for <hi>Self,</hi> and the other is for God: One is for the <hi>body,</hi> and the other is for the <hi>ſoul.</hi> So that you ſee what <hi>Self</hi> can do, and how commonly it is the maſter of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Towns and Countries, becauſe it is the maſter in mens ſouls.</p>
               <p>God muſt be loved above <hi>all,</hi> and our neighbour as our <hi>ſelves:</hi> But if God were allowed but ſo much love as a very neighbour ſhould have, it would not be all ſo ill with the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> world as now it is. But becauſe I have been ſo long on this firſt diſcovery of the power of <hi>Self,</hi> and the ſcarcity of <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> I will be ſhorter in the reſt that follow.</p>

               <p>2. ANother inſtance Diſcovering the Reign of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs in the world, is, <hi>The great Power that it hath to form mens Opinions and Conceptions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Though the underſtanding naturally be inclined to Truth, yet a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> by as upon the ſoul, eſpecially on the <hi>will,</hi> doth commonly delude it, and make the vileſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſeem to be Truth to it, and the moſt uſeful Truth to ſeem an error. The Will hath much command over the Underſtanding: and when <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is become the very habit, the byas, the nature of the will, you may eaſily conjecture how it will pervert the underſtanding. But what need we more than experience to ſatisfie us. Do you not ſee that where <hi>ſelf</hi> is but deeply engaged, the judgement is bribed or overmaſtered, and carried from the Truth? So that as the eye that looks through a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured glaſs, doth ſee all things as if they were of the ſame colour as the glaſs: So the underſtanding that is maſtered by a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> inclination, thinks every thing is truth that ſavoureth his <hi>ſelf-intereſt.</hi> And here I ſhall offer you ſome more particular inſtances.</p>
               <p>1, We all ſee that almoſt all the world is of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Opinion which hath the countenance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that they live under, and the perſons that have greateſt power on their reputation; or at leaſt which is conſiſtent with their ſafety, if not riſing and proſperity in the world. The Turks are commonly Mahometans: the ſubjects of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Auſtria, &amp;c.</hi> are generally Papiſts: thoſe in <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp;c.</hi> are generally Lutherans: thoſe of <hi>Scotland,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34706:74"/>
England, Helvetia, &amp;c.</hi> are commonly Calviniſts (as they are called.) I know the power of education is great, and hearing evidence only on one ſide, may byas a well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meaning man: But Papiſts and Proteſtants (as to the learned part) have the Books of the contrary-minded at hand: And therefore that Opinions ſhould run in a ſtream, and whole Countreys almoſt be of a party, muſt needs be much from the power of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> becauſe they are ſwayed by them that have the power of their reputation, and eſtates and liberties in the world.</p>
               <p>2. Moreover, when a man is by cuſtome grown <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited,</hi> or by the power of Pride is wiſe in his own eyes, how hard a matter do we find it to convince ſuch men by the cleareſt evidence! They will not ſee, when they can hardly wink ſo cloſe as to keep out the light. <hi>It is their opinion,</hi> and therefore ſhall be ſo: and they will hold it becauſe it is their own.</p>
               <p>3. Eſpecially if it be an Opinion of a mans own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is doubly his own, both as he is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver and poſſeſſor, how cloſe will he ſtick to it, too commonly beyond the evidence of truth, becauſe that <hi>ſelf</hi> hath ſo gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>n intereſt in it?</p>
               <p>4. Yea, if a man be but deeply engaged for it, either by laborious Diſputes, or confident owning it, or any way, ſo as that his credit lyeth on it, how tenacious will he be of it, becauſe of the powerful intereſt of <hi>Self?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And if it be but an Opinion that ſeems to befriend any <hi>former Opinion</hi> that we have much engaged for, how much doth <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> uſually appear in our inordinate propenſity to it?</p>
               <p>6. Alſo if we live in dayes of perſecution, how eaſily do we receive thoſe Opinions that would keep us from priſon and fire? Or if any ſuffering lye upon it, we commonly take that ſide to be right, that is ſafeſt to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34706:74"/>
fleſh, (except when <hi>ſelf</hi> would be advanced by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſufferings) And in proſperity, if there be any controverſie ariſe, which our gain is concerned in, how eaſily believe we the thriving opinion? If any Oath, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, or Duty be impoſed on us by thoſe that have Power to do us harm, the generality are for it, be it what it will. In all theſe caſes it is commonly <hi>Carnal Self</hi> that is the Judge.</p>
               <p>And how far <hi>Self</hi> commands in ſuch caſes, you may ſee by theſe diſcoveries following.</p>
               <p>1. In ſtudying the caſe, mens thoughts run almoſt all one way. They ſtudy what to ſay for their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how to anſwer all that is againſt them: but they ſtudy but very little what may be ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d on the other ſide. They ſit at their ſtudies with a byaſſed will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining or commanding their underſtanding what to do, even to prove that to be true, which they would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be true, whether it be ſo or not.</p>
               <p>2. And hence it is that the weakeſt Arguments on their own ſide do ſeem ſufficient, if not invincible; and they ſtand wondering at the blindneſs of all thoſe men that cannot ſee the force of them: But no Arguments ſeem to have any weight, that are brought againſt them. And all this is from the power of <hi>ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Yea, ſometimes when they are ſilenced and know not what to ſay for their opinions, nor how to anſwer the Arguments for the contrary, yet they can ſay, <hi>We are of this mind, and we will be of this mind.</hi> And why, but becauſe it is eſpouſed to them and their own?</p>
               <p>4. And hence it is, that if a man be but an admirer of us, or of our own opinion in other things, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to receive an opinion from him than from another.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Mens great averſneſs to coſtly or troubleſome duties.</head>
               <p>3. ANother diſcovering inſtance of the rarity of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> is this, <hi>The great averſneſs of men to any coſtly, or troubleſome, or ſelf-denying duty,</hi> how neceſſary ſoever, how plainly ſoever revealed in the Scripture, and how generally ſoever acknowledged by the Church: As if <hi>ſelf</hi> had a Negative voice in the making of Laws for the Government of the world, and none muſt be binding without its conſent. I ſhall come down to ſome more particular inſtances.</p>
               <p>1. The great duty of charitable relieving our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in neceſſity to the utmoſt of our power, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made almoſt nothing of in the world. And men cheat their ſouls by thinking <hi>they are paſſed from death to life, becauſe they love the brethren</hi> with ſuch a cold and barren love as will neither lay down eſtate for them,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34706:75"/>
nor venture life for them, but think they are ſure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe they can ſay as the believers that <hi>James</hi> mentioneth, [<hi>Depart in peace: be you warmed and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but give them not that which is neceſſary thereto</hi>] <hi>James</hi> 2. 16. Though it be told them plainly by Chriſt himſelf that it is not a fruitleſs uneffectual love, but that which cauſeth them to feed and cloath and viſit the Saints, that muſt ſtand them inſtead at judgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and the Apoſtle asketh them, <hi>How the love of God can dwell in that man that ſeeth his brother have need, and ſhutteth up the bowels of his compaſſion from him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 17. Yet do men think that by dropping now and then a penny, they have diſcharged all this great duty. And when they ſee many wayes by which they might promote the Goſpel, and help the Church, and ſerve God with their eſtates, yet <hi>ſelf</hi> will not let them ſee the meaning of the plaineſt Scriptures that do require it.</p>
               <p>2. When men ſhould practiſe the great duty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving injuries, treſpaſſes and debts, and of loving our enemies, and bleſſing them that curſe us, and praying for them that hate and perſecute us, how ſtubbornly doth <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> reſiſt theſe duties. What abundance of words may you uſe in vain, with moſt men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to any of this work? No: they <hi>muſt</hi> have their <hi>right;</hi> and that which is their <hi>own,</hi> though it be to the undoing of their brother. Paſſion and revenge even boil within them, and the thoughts of an injury ſtick in their minds; and if they do take on them diſſemblingly to forgive it, yet they cannot forget it, nor heartily love a brother that diſpleaſeth them, much leſs an enemy: And all this is from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and ſhews that it prevaileth above God in the ſoul, and therefore ſhews a graceleſs heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:34706:76"/>3. When the Miniſters of the Goſpel themſelves ſhould be painful in their great and neceſſary work, and ſhould <hi>watch over all the flock,</hi> Acts 20. 28. <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man, and teaching every man in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that they may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Col. 1. 28. <hi>condeſcending to men of the loweſt ſort,</hi> and teaching them <hi>in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> what reaſonings and ſhifts will <hi>ſelf</hi> bring in to reſiſt ſo great and excellent a duty, and prove it no duty, and that God will give them leave to ſpare their pains; and all becauſe of the Powerful intereſt of <hi>ſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. And let the ſame Miniſters have a diſordered flock, that hath ſcandalous members, eſpecially if they be great <hi>ones,</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> and how rarely will they do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them, in plain reproof, and in caſe of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and continuance in ſin, by Publick Admonition and Rejection? what ſhiftings and cavillings will they find againſt this diſpleaſing work of Diſcipline? even when they will reproach a man themſelves whoſe <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> is againſt Diſcipline, and when they have preacht and written and diſputed ſo much for it: and almoſt all parties are agreed of the neceſſity of it in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; yet when it comes to practice, it cannot be done without procuring mens hatred and oppoſition; and laying us open to much incommodity; and therefore <hi>ſelf</hi> doth perſwade us to forbear; and whether God or <hi>ſelf</hi> have the more ſervants even yet in a reformed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, I leave you to judge as your obſervation of the congregations through the Land ſhall direct you. But were it not for <hi>ſelf</hi> I ſhould undertake to do more for diſcipline and perſonal Inſtruction with moſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, by one Argument, than I have done by a volume, and you might ſee an unanimous concurrence in the work, and conſequently a great alteration in the Churches.</p>
               <p>5. And whence is it but from <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> that plain and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34706:76"/>
cloſe Application in our Sermons is taken to be an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thoſe that think themſelves concerned in it? If a Miniſter will ſpeak alike to all, and take heed of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with their ſores, they will patiently hear him: but if he make them know that he meaneth <hi>them</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and deal cloſely with them about their miſerable ſtate or againſt any ſpecial diſgraceful ſin, they fall a rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at him, and reproaching him behind his back, and perhaps they will ſay, They'le hear him no more. O ſaith the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ungodly wretch, [<hi>I know he meant me to day: had he no body but me to ſpeak againſt?</hi>] As if a ſick man ſhould be angry with the Phyſitian, for giving directions and medicines to him in particular, and ſay, [<hi>Had he no body to give Phyſick to but me? Were there not ſick men enough in the Town beſides me?</hi>] When Chriſt told the Deſpiſers of the Goſpel of the certain and dreadful deſtruction that was near them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 41, 44, 45. its ſaid that [<hi>When the chief Prieſts and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees had heard his Parables, they perceived that he ſpake of them!</hi> (A hainous buſineſs) <hi>and therefore they ſought to lay hands on him, but that they durſt not do it for fear of the multitude.</hi>]</p>
               <p>6. Nay, let a Miniſter preach but any ſuch doctrine as ſeems conſequentially to be againſt <hi>Self,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude hardly of them, and they are ready to ſay as <hi>Ahab</hi> of <hi>Micaiah</hi> [<hi>I hate him: for he propheſieth not good of me, but evil,</hi>] 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 8. Let us but tell them how few will be ſaved; what holineſs and ſtriving and diligence is neceſſary, though we have the expreſs word of God for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. yet becauſe they think that it makes againſt their carnal peace, they cannot abide it: Plain truth is unwelcome to them, becauſe it is rough, and grates upon the quick, and tells them of that which is troubleſome to know: Though they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34706:77"/>
                  <hi>muſt</hi> know their ſin and danger and miſery, or elſe they can never ſcape it; yet they had rather venture on Hell, than hear the danger. And as a ſortiſh Patient, they love that Phyſitian better that will tell them there is no danger, and let them dye, than he that will tell them, [<hi>your diſcaſe is dangerous; you muſt bleed or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or purge, or you will dye</hi>] O what a wrong they take it to be told thus? If a Miniſter tell one of them that hath the death marks of ungodlineſs in the face of his Converſation [<hi>Neighbour, I muſt deal plainly with you: your ſtate is ſad: you are unſanctified and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified, and in the ſlavery of the Devil, and will be loſt for ever, if you dye before you are converted and made a new creature; and therefore turn preſently as you love your ſoul,</hi>] its ten to one but he ſhould have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful anſwer inſtead of thanks and obedience. And all this ſhews that <hi>ſelf</hi> bears the rule. I will give one inſtance from the Goſpel, that will tell you plainly the power of <hi>ſelf.</hi> In <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you read of an excellent Sermon preached by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, ſo that all did wonder at his gracious words: yet few were converted by it, but they fell on cavilling againſt him becauſe of his ſuppoſed Parentage and Breeding: Whereupon Chriſt telleth them that <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> though moſt excellent Prophets, were ſent but for the ſake of a few, and therefore it was no wonder if of all that multitude it was but a few that ſhould be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaved by him. This very doctrine ſo netled theſe wretches, that the Text ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. that [<hi>all they in the Synagogue when they heard theſe things were filled with wrath, and roſe up and thruſt him out of the City and led him to the brow of the hill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their City was built that they might caſt him down headlong.</hi>] See what entertainment ſuch doctrine had even from Chriſt himſelf! As if they ſhould have ſaid,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34706:77"/>
                  <hi>what! are we all unconverted and ungodly, ſhall none be ſaved but a few ſuch as you! Self</hi> was not able to bear this doctrine, they would have had his life for it.</p>
               <p>7. Again, let but a Miniſter or private Chriſtian, deal cloſely with ungodly men or Hypocrites about their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins, by private reproof, and ſee whether <hi>Self</hi> be not Lord and King in them. O how ſcurvily they will look at you? and their hearts do preſently riſe againſt you with diſpleaſure, and they meet you with diſtaſte and paſſion, and plead for their ſins, or at leaſt excuſe or extenuate them; or bethink themſelves what they may hit you in the teeth with of your own: Or if malice it ſelf can faſten nothing on you, they let fly at profeſſors, or thoſe that they think are of your mind and way: in a word, they ſhew you that they take it not well that you meddle with them, and let not their ſin alone, and look to your ſelves, for all that God hath expreſly commanded us, Lev. 19. 17. [<hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſin upon him.</hi>] And Heb. 3. 13. [<hi>Exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daily while it is called to day, leſt any be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the deceitfulneſs of ſin</hi>] So <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16. Try but plain dealing with your neighbours one twelve mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with as much prudence and love and lenity as will ſtand with faithfulneſs; and when you have done I dare leave it to your ſelves to judge, whether God or <hi>ſelf</hi> have the more ſervants in the world, and whether <hi>ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> and Sanctification be not very rare.</p>
               <p>8. Yet further, you ſee it is the duty of Chriſtians to admoniſh and faithfully reprove one another: but becauſe moſt men take it ill, and plain dealing will diſpleaſe and loſe a friend, how few even of profeſſors will be brought to perform it? yea, of thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Miniſter ſhould reject the offendor, when it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34706:78"/>
cannot be done till after admonition and impenitency thereupon. No, this is a troubleſome duty, and <hi>ſelf</hi> will not give them leave to do it.</p>
               <p>9. Moreover: You know that Church-Government and Diſcipline is an undoubted Ordinance of Chriſt which the Church hath owned in every age: (though in the execution ſome have been negligent, and ſome inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:) and that open ſcandalous ſins muſt have open confeſſion and repentance, that the ill effects may be hindered or healed, and the Church ſee that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is capable of their communion, and that the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution may be open and well grounded. And yet let any man (except the truly penitent and godly) be called after a ſcandal to ſuch a neceſſary confeſſion, and how hardly are they brought to it? What cavilling ſhall you have againſt the duty? They will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is their duty; not they! And why ſo? is it becauſe it is not plainly required by God? No, but becauſe it tends (they think,) to their diſgrace; and <hi>ſelf</hi> is againſt it: and when you have ſhewed them ſuch reaſons for it that they cannot anſwer; yet, the ſum is, they will not believe it; or if they believe it, they will not do it. What! will they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the laughing ſtock, and talk of the Countrey? No they will never do it; and it is an injury, they think, for God or man to put them upon it. God commands: and <hi>ſelf</hi> forbids: God bids them, yield, leſt they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in impenitency: <hi>ſelf</hi> bids them, not to yield, leſt they ſhame themſelves before men: God perſwadeth, and <hi>ſelf</hi> diſſwadeth? and which is it that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prevails (Though to avoid the ſhame of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>ſelf</hi> alſo will ſome time make them yield) Did but the Magiſtrate by a penalty of ten or twenty pound upon refuſers perſwade them to this, not one of a hundred would then refuſe: but when God urgeth them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34706:78"/>
with the threatning of Hell, the wages of impenitency, they make little or nothing of it: as if they could eſcape it by not believing it, or ſome way or other could deal well enough with him: Judge by the performance of this one duty, Whether God or <hi>Self</hi> have more Diſciples.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, let me inſtance in one duty more; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a deceitful Tradeſman, or oppreſſing Land-lord, or any one that gets unlawfully from another, is told from the word of God, that it is his duty to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, either to the perſon, or to his poſterity, (or to God by the poor, if neither can be done;) and to give back all that ever he thus unjuſtly came by, though he have been poſſeſſed of it (without diſgrace) never ſo long: See what entertainment this doctrine will have with the moſt. <hi>Self</hi> will not loſe the prey that it hath got hold off, till death ſhall wring it out of its jaws, and Hell make them wiſh they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver medled with it, or elſe had penitently and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reſtored it. O what abundance of objections hath <hi>ſelf</hi> againſt it! and no anſwer will ſatisfie from God or man. Of a thouſand unjuſt getters, how many do reſtore, and ſay as <hi>Zachaeus,</hi> Luke 19. 8. [<hi>Behold Lord, the half of my goods, I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I reſtore him four fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, let us inſtance in a duty of leſſer <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> than this of Reſtitution. If two do but fall out, and one give railing words to the other; or if one ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his neighbour and do him wrong; though it be undoubtedly the will of Chriſt that he penitently ask him forgiveneſs that he hath wronged, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 34. yet proud-hearted <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men will refuſe it? What! will they ſtoop to ſuch a fellow, and ask him forgiveneſs (ſpecially if it be their inferior?) No, they ſcorn it:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34706:79"/>
never talk to them of it more: they will never do it: And why ſo? would not God have them do it? Hath not he ſaid, <hi>He that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted?</hi> Yea, but what tell you them what God ſaith, and what Scripture ſaith, as long as <hi>ſelf,</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>pride</hi> are againſt it. Judge now by theſe ten duties that I have named, whether <hi>God</hi> or <hi>ſelf</hi> be King with moſt.</p>

               <p>4. ANother Diſcovering inſtance of the Dominion of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and the ſcarcity of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> is, <hi>The exceeding tenderneſs of our ſelves in any caſe of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the great matter that we make of it, and our diſpleaſure againſt all that are the cauſes of it, be it never ſo juſt. I ſhall here alſo give you ſome more particular inſtances.</p>
               <p>1. When did you ever ſee an offender (at leaſt very few) that Juſtified the Judge, and heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that his puniſhment is due (unleſs ſome few at the Gallows, when the ſight of death takes down their pride?) But at moſt every one that ſuffereth for his fault doth repine at it, and at them that cauſed it, and think they have wrong, or are hardly dealt with. If all the Swearers, Curſers, Prophaners of the Lords day, Drunkards, or Ale-ſellers that reſet them, or are otherwiſe guilty, were accuſed by their Neighbours, and puniſhed by the Magiſtrate but according to the Law, how many of all theſe is there that would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the accuſers, and with the Magiſtrate, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34706:79"/>
think himſelf wronged, and bear them a grudge in his mind that did it? And why ſo? Is it not juſt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of God and man? Muſt we make a ſtir in chooſing Parliament-men? and muſt they ſit there moneth after moneth, and uſe their utmoſt skill and diligence to make ſuch Laws as are neceſſary for the common good? and when all is done, muſt not theſe Laws be executed? why then it were better ſpare the Parliament-men the labour of ſitting about them, and our ſelves the trouble of chooſing us Parliament-men, than do all this for nothing. What is every Ale-ſeller, or Drunkard, or Swearer, or Prophane perſon, wiſer than all the Parliament and the Prince? or are they all bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and juſter, and honeſter than they? No; but its <hi>ſelf</hi> that ſtands up againſt all. Its in vain to tell them of Kings, or Parliaments, or Laws, or common good, as long as you go about to croſs the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and trouble them in their private intereſt; ſet but <hi>ſelf</hi> againſt <hi>all,</hi> and all goes down before it as nothing. There's ſcarce a Thief or Murderer that's hanged, but thinks he hath hard meaſure; becauſe it is againſt <hi>himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Nay, it is not only <hi>penalties,</hi> but <hi>words</hi> that men are very ſenſible of, if they be but againſt <hi>themſelves.</hi> An angry or diſgraceful ſpeech, or any contempt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, doth ſeem a great matter againſt them; and they have aggravations enough to lay upon it. So tender are they of <hi>themſelves,</hi> that you may ſee how little they deny <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Yea, Gods own Corrections do ſeem ſo heavy to them, that they murmur and are impatient under them. A little loſs or croſs to <hi>ſelf</hi> doth lye as a mountain on them. Poverty, or ſickneſs, or diſgrace, or troubles, do make them complain, as if they were almoſt quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: and all this ſhews how little they have learned to deny themſelves.</p>

               <p>5. ANother Diſcovering inſtance of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>ſelf,</hi> is, <hi>The ſtrange Partiality of mens practical Judgements when the Cauſe is their own; and the equity of their judgements when the Caſe is another mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particular inſtances of this, you may take up thoſe that were mentioned before. Il'e give you but a few.</p>
               <p>1. Take but a dull and backward Miniſter, (for I know you will expect I begin next home) and he that is moſt averſe to particular Inſtruction, and Diſcipline, and Self-denying duties, will be content that <hi>another</hi> man ſhould perform them, and will commend and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll him for a worthy man: except he perceive that anothers diligence diſgraceth his <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and then indeed he may poſſibly repine at it.</p>
               <p>2. A man that will not come near us to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed or Catechized, will yet let his children or ſervants come. Why what's the matter? doth he more regard their ſalvation than his own? or hath he not a ſoul to ſave or loſe as well as they? and hath he not need of teaching? Yes: but they are not <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> If they learn a Catechiſm, it is no trouble to him: If their ignorance be opened, he takes it to be leſs diſhonour to him than if he ſhew his own. He can yield to their ſubmiſſion without <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> but not to his <hi>Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:34706:80"/>3. Take a common glutton or drunkard, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear, but muſt needs have that which the fleſh deſires, and they can be content that <hi>another</hi> man be temperate and ſober: and if a neighbour ſhould have the Cup before him, as they have, or a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to their appetite, they could be content that they let it alone; yea, they can tell them that it is the beſt way, and give them good counſel; and yet when the caſe is <hi>their own,</hi> it is otherwiſe. I have known drunkards that would perſwade their children to take heed of it, and ſwearers that would whip their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for ſwearing, and perſons that would not read or pray, that would be content to have their children do it. And why is all this? why that which goes by their <hi>own</hi> throats, muſt coſt them <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> in the diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their greedy appetites; but that which goes by the throat of another doth coſt them nothing: <hi>ſelf</hi> is not ſo much againſt their childrens abſtinence and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as their own.</p>
               <p>4. The ſame Magiſtrate that will not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and diſpleaſe his neighbours, by ſuppreſſing Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and puniſhing vice, will perhaps be content if it were done by <hi>another;</hi> ſo that <hi>ſelf</hi> might have none of the trouble and ill will.</p>
               <p>5. Some men that will not inſtruct their families, nor pray with them morning and night, will confeſs it is well done of others that do it.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34706:81"/>
to commend Holineſs in others: but to practiſe it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt coſt them <hi>ſelf-denyal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. If another man be ſo ingenuous as to forſake an old ſelf-eſpouſed opinion, which their reputation ſeems to lye upon, and this upon their arguing, or in conformity to their minds, they will commend his great <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> and ſincerity: But yet they will not do ſo themſelves, where the caſe is perhaps more clear and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>7. Take a man that is never ſo worldly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, that gives not to the poor any conſiderable part of his eſtate, nor doth nothing worth the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning for the Church, and yet this man will conſent that <hi>another</hi> ſhall be as bountiful and charitable as he will: when you can hardly ſcrue a groat out of his purſe, he will be content if <hi>another</hi> will give an hundred. And he will commend the liberal, and ſpeak well of them, when he will not imitate them. And why is this? why it <hi>coſteth him nothing</hi> for another to be liberal; and therefore he can adviſe it, or conſent to it without ſelf-denyal: but <hi>ſelf</hi> is againſt it when he ſhould do it <hi>himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Take the moſt <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> unſanctified man, that cannot love an enemy, nor forgive a debt, or a wrong, and he will yet commend it in <hi>another,</hi> and adviſe them to it, and ſpeak well of thoſe that will do ſo by <hi>him:</hi> And why is this? why it coſteth him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to have another man love an <hi>enemy,</hi> or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a debt or wrong; but he cannot <hi>himſelf</hi> do it without ſelf-denyal.</p>
               <p>9. Thoſe men that love not to be toucht themſelves by the Miniſters application, can yet endure well enough that <hi>others</hi> be dealt as ſharply with as may be; And they are glad to hear any ſharply reproved whoſe ſins they do diſlike. The Covetous man loves to hear us reprove
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34706:81"/>
the drunkard, and the drunkard is content to have the Covetous reprehended: Erroneous profeſſors, dividers and hypocrites do hate the Miniſter that reprehendeth their own ſin, and can ſcarce endure to hear him, but ſay, he is bitter, or a preſecutor, or raileth at the godly (alas that wickedneſs ſhould have ſo impudent a plea!) But they can freely give us leave to deal as plainly as we will with the openly prophane: ſcarce any ſect can endure you to ſpeak againſt their own miſtakes: but you may ſpeak as freely againſt the <hi>contrary minded</hi> as you pleaſe. How eaſily can Papiſts endure one to ſpeak againſt Proteſtants? or Anabaptiſts endure one to ſpeak againſt Infant-baptiſm? And the openly prophane can well enough endure to have Sects, and Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks reproved: And why is all this, but from the Dominion of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and the ſcarcity of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> in the world? To have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother rebuked, toucheth not <hi>Self,</hi> and therefore may be born.</p>
               <p>The poor man loves to hear us preach againſt the Vices of the rich, and to reprehend the luxury of Gentlemen, and the cruelty of oppreſſors: The ſubject too often loves to hear the Rulers faults laid open: The Countryman loves to hear the Courtiers, the Miniſters, but ſpecially the Lawyers faults laid open: Here you may ſpeak freely: but <hi>Self</hi> muſt be let alone, upon pain of their diſpleaſure, and many a reproach.</p>
               <p>10. So alſo in caſe of perſonal cloſe reproof: thoſe that cannot endure it themſelves, do think it the duty of others to endure it, and expect that others ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them; and if any will ſay, [Neighbour, I thank you for your plain and friendly dealing, and having ſo much compaſſion on my ſoul, as to help to ſave me from my ſins: I confeſs I am a vile unworthy ſinner; but by the grace of God I will do ſo no more: or if I be any more overtaken, I pray you tell me of it, and let me
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34706:82"/>
not alone in it.] I ſay if another ſhould anſwer them thus and thank them for their reproof, they would think the better of him, and take it well. But yet they will not do ſo themſelves: for it coſteth <hi>Self</hi> nothing to have another ſubmit and humble <hi>himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So thoſe that are moſt backward to the admoniſhing of others, leſt they loſe their love, can like to have a a Miniſter or another do it: For that doth not put them to deny themſelves.</p>
               <p>12. Nay take a ſcandalous profeſſor, that is drawn to publick Confeſſion as a Bear to the Stake, and if it were <hi>another mans caſe,</hi> he would think it but reaſonable and meet, and would perſwade him to it. If another had committed the ſame ſin againſt God as he hath done, or had ſlandered, or wronged him, and would freely, without urging, confeſs in the Congregation with tears in his eyes, that he hath ſinfully provoked God, and offended the Church, and wronged his Brother, and laid a ſtumbling block in the way of the ungodly, and the weak, and diſhonoured his holy profeſſion, and is never able to make ſatisfaction for ſuch heinous ſins, and is unworthy any more to be a member of the Church, and to have any communion with Chriſt or them; and ſhould earneſtly intreat them to pardon him, and pray for him, and retain him in their Communion, and intreat God to pardon him; Would not the ſtander by think this were well done, and a better way to his recovery than to refuſe it? And all is, becauſe that <hi>ſelf</hi> is not touched in another mans caſe; unleſs he apprehend it like to become his own; and then he may be againſt it, and ſcorn at this, as too preciſe a Courſe.</p>
               <p>13. Take alſo the extortioner, or any man that hath defrauded or injured another; and that will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to make Reſtitution of all that he hath got amiſs: and let this man hear of the caſe of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34706:82"/>
will ſay, It was well done: Or let anothers caſe be propounded to him, and he can tell them that [<hi>Reſtitution is the ſafeſt way: whatever it coſt you, its fit that every man ſhould have his own.</hi>] <hi>Self</hi> will give him free leave to conſent to another mans Reſtititution; but not to his own.</p>
               <p>14. Moreover; Suppoſe that perſecution were afoot, and a man muſt either knowingly ſin againſt God, or loſe his Eſtate, and part with all that he hath in the world, and burn at a Stake for the cauſe of Chriſt: The <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> unſanctified perſon will not be perſwaded that this is his duty, or at leaſt, he will not be perſwaded to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it: He cannot ſuffer, nor burn: He will truſt God with his ſoul, rather than men with his body; (as ſuch ſpeak that deſpiſe God, and reject him, and prefer the world before him, and call this <hi>truſting</hi> him.) But if this were <hi>another</hi> mans caſe, they could tell him that its better diſpleaſe men than God, and that its better venture a ſhort life, than an endleſs life; and that it is little profit to win all the world, and loſe his own ſoul; and that it is the wiſeſt way to make ſure work for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and not to venture on endleſs miſery: And they could conſent that another ſhould rather ſuffer than ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why elſe do they commend the Martyrs for it? And what is the reaſon of this ſtrange partiality? Why <hi>Self</hi> is the great Ruler, and God hath but the name. <hi>Self</hi> is partial in their <hi>own</hi> cauſe, but not in another mans: and therefore they can conſent to his ſuffering without <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial:</hi> And hence comes the difference.</p>
               <p>15. Moreover, when Offenders murmur at their puniſhment, ask but the ſtanders by, and they are of another mind. When the Ale-ſeller thinks he is wronged if he be put down: ask but the poor women whoſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands uſe to be drunk there, and whoſe children, lack meat, and drink, and clothes, becauſe the Alehouſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34706:83"/>
devours that which ſhould buy them, and they will be quite of another judgment, and think you love not God nor the Country, if you will not ſuppreſs them.</p>
               <p>16. Alſo when you hear men extenuating their ſin, and excuſing it; put but the caſe as another mans, and let them not underſtand that it is their own, and you ſhall hear another judgment. So <hi>Nathan</hi> came about <hi>David,</hi> and put but a far lower caſe as anothers about the robbing a poor man of his only Sheep, and he could preſently ſay and ſwear, [<hi>As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely die, becauſe he had no pity:</hi>] and his anger was greatly kindled againſt the man, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 5, 6. But why was he not as angry with himſelf for a greater ſin? O <hi>ſelf</hi> had got the better in that grievous fall, till grace broke his heart by true repentance. So when <hi>Judah</hi> heard of <hi>Thamars</hi> fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he commandeth [<hi>Bring her out that ſhe may be burnt,</hi>] Gen. 38. 24. But when he underſtood that it was by <hi>himſelf,</hi> the caſe was altered.</p>
               <p>17. Let a man that his provoked by injuries and ill words, have as bad by <hi>himſelf</hi> done or ſpoken againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and he can make but a ſmall matter of them, or think they ſhould be eaſily put up or pardoned: when yet the ſame words ſpoken againſt him, do ſeem intolerable.</p>
               <p>18. Let a man ſpeak with others in poverty, ſickneſs, or any affliction, and what good counſel can he give him to ſubmit to God, and take all patiently! But let the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering be his own, and he cannot take the counſel that he gives.</p>
               <p>19. Nay more; men are not only partial for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but for any that are <hi>neer themſelves,</hi> or that <hi>ſelf</hi> is related to. Let another mans Son or Servant do evil, and you can be content that he be rebuked or corrected: But if it be a Son, or Kinſman, or Servant of your <hi>Own,</hi> the caſe is altered; its then a wrong to puniſh,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34706:83"/>
him, becauſe of his relation to <hi>you.</hi> Let a Stranger do amiſs, and you can give way to Juſtice: But if the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or Ale-ſeller, or Swearer be your <hi>friend,</hi> then he muſt be born with and forgiven, and the juſtice muſt be intreated for him.</p>
               <p>Let a ſcandalous, or inſufficient Miniſter, or School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter be offered to any place: If he be a Stranger, you can be content that he be rejected: but if he be a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Child, or Friend of <hi>yours,</hi> what an alteration doth this make in the caſe! then he muſt be born with, or tried, and you hope he will mend, and his faults are made the leaſt of, &amp; his virtues more than indeed they are.</p>
               <p>Nay any man that doth but love <hi>your ſelves</hi> and honour <hi>you,</hi> and think highly of <hi>you,</hi> ſhall have a favourabler conſtruction for all his words, and actions, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than one that you imagine is againſt you or hath low thoughts of you, or is againſt your interest, or your opinion.</p>
               <p>Sirs, I have run into abundance of inſtances, but not a quarter ſo many as might be given; and all is to meet with the turnings and windings of this Serpent <hi>ſelf;</hi> and to let you ſee (if light it ſelf can make you ſee, againſt the blinding power of <hi>ſelf</hi>) how rare <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is in the the world, and what a large Dominion <hi>ſelf</hi> obtaineth.</p>
               <p>I would here have added ſome more Diſcoveries, as 6. From the exceſſive care, and coſt, and labour that almoſt all the world is at for <hi>ſelf?</hi> and the little they are at for God, or the good of others, 7. The large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that is expended on <hi>ſelf,</hi> in compariſon of God and others. 8. The Zeal of men to vindicate <hi>ſelf,</hi> but the little Zeal for God or others. 9. The rigorous Laws that are made in the cauſe of <hi>ſelf:</hi> (Thieves and Traitors muſt die): and the remiſsneſs of Law-givers in the cauſe of God: Blaſphemy, Malignity, and Impiety is not ſo roughly handled. 10. The firmneſs of men to carnal
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34706:84"/>
                  <hi>ſelf,</hi> and their great mutability and unfaithfulneſs to God. But I had rather omit ſomewhat, than to be too tedious, and therefore I go no further in theſe Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſave only to add a few of thoſe Aggravations that ſhew you the <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>ſelfs</hi> Dominion, as you have ſeen the ſad diſcoveries of the reality of it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The great Power and prevalency of ſelfiſhneſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</head>
               <p>ANd that you may ſee what cauſe we have for our Lamentation: Conſider the greatneſs of ſelfiſh Tyranny in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider what a Power it is that <hi>ſelf</hi> beareth down in the world: The Commands of the God of heaven are overcome by it. The promiſes of eternal life, are trod under foot by it. The threatnings of endleſs torments are nothing to it. It caſts by Heaven: it ventures upon Hell: It tramples upon the precious blood of Chriſt: It will not hear the voice of wiſdom it ſelf: Nor the voice of goodneſs and mercy it ſelf: It refuſeth him that ſpeaks from heaven: Love it ſelf is not lovely where <hi>ſelf</hi> is Judge: It quencheth all the motions of the Spirit: it deſpiſeth Miniſters: It turneth mercies into wantonneſs and ſin: Like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> it breaks all bonds that are laid on it: and till it be weakned it ſelf, there is no holding, no ruling, no ſaving the ſoul, thats ruled by it.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider alſo the exceeding Number of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Truly if there were no other proof, that the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and the ſaved are very few, this one is ſo full and ſad a proof, that it tempteth me ſometime to think them much fewer than willingly I would do. Alas, how few <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> perſons do you meet with in the world;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34706:84"/>
yea in the Church! yea among the ſtricter Profeſſors! Look over all the world, and ſee how few you can find at work for any one but for <hi>carnal ſelf?</hi> If you obſerve the Courts, and ſee whoſe work is done moſt there; and look into the Armies of the world, and ſee who it is that ruleth there: if you look upon the affairs of Nations, and the wars of Princes, and their confederacies, and ſee who it is that rules in all; how little will you ſee (ſave here and there) but <hi>carnal ſelf?</hi> It is <hi>ſelf</hi> that makes the cauſe and manageth it: It is <hi>ſelf</hi> that maketh Wars and Peace. Come down into our Courts of Juſtice, and whoſe voice is loudeſt at the bar, but <hi>ſelfs?</hi> and who is it commonly elſe that brings in the Verdict? at leaſt who is it elſe that made and followeth on the quarrel? How many cauſes hath <hi>ſelf</hi> at an Aſſize, for one that God hath? Come lower into the Country and who is it that plows and ſows; who is it that keeeps Houſe or Shop but <hi>ſelf?</hi> I mean what elſe but carnal ſelf is the Principle? what elſe but carnal <hi>ſelf</hi> is the End? what elſe but the will of <hi>ſelf</hi> is the Rule? and what elſe but <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> commodity, or pleaſure, or honour are the matter, or ſome proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is made for theſe; and conſequently what elſe but <hi>ſelf-reſpect</hi> is the form? For the End informeth the means as means; and therefore all that is done for <hi>ſelf</hi> is <hi>ſelf-ſervice</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeeking.</hi> In a word, as God is <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all</hi> to the ſanctified, ſo <hi>ſelf</hi> is as <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all</hi> to the ungodly. And alas how great a number are all theſe!</p>
               <p>3. Conſider that it is a ſin that is <hi>nearer</hi> us objectively than any other ſin; And the nearer the more dangerous. Alas that a man ſhould turn his own ſubſtance into poiſon &amp; feed upon it to his own deſtruction! If you have drunk poyſon, you may caſt it up again, or nature may do much to work it out: but if your own blood, and humours, and ſpirits be turned into venom, that ſhould nouriſh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your life, what then ſhall expell this venom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:34706:85"/>4. Moreover it is the moſt <hi>obſtinate</hi> diſeaſe in the world. No duty harder (except the Love of God) than <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> O how many wounds will <hi>ſelf</hi> carry away and yet keep life, and heal them all. How commonly do we convince ſome carnal Gentlemen, that <hi>One thing is needful,</hi> and that its a better part than Earth, and honour, and ſenſuality that muſt be choſen, or elſe they are undone; and that the more they <hi>have,</hi> the more they muſt forſake, and the more <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is required to their ſalvation; (and that all their lands, and wealth, and honours, and all their wit, and parts, and intereſt muſt be at the ſervice of their Maker and Redeemer; and that when they have <hi>all</hi> in the world that they can get, that <hi>all</hi> muſt become Nothing, and God muſt become all; their treaſure muſt become the droſs and dung, and Chriſt muſt become their treaſure, or they are loſt? I ſay, how oft do we convince men of all eſtates of theſe important evident truths? And yet this <hi>ſelf</hi> is ſtill alive, and keeps the garriſon of the heart; and all that we can have from moſt of them, is, as the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 23, 24. to be <hi>very ſorrowful</hi> that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have heaven at eaſier rates, and that Chriſt will not be a ſervant unto <hi>Self,</hi> or they cannot have two Maſters! They <hi>go away ſorrowful</hi> (but away they go) <hi>becauſe they are rich;</hi> which makes Chriſt ſay upon this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>How hardly ſhall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> But when the Diſciples were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his obſervation, he lets them know that it is <hi>Self</hi> and not <hi>Riches</hi> that is indeed the deadly enemy. It is the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> that <hi>truſt</hi> in Riches, and love and uſe them for <hi>themſelves,</hi> and deny not <hi>themſelves,</hi> and devote not all to God, that will be kept out of Heaven by them; Or in Chriſts own words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. It is [<hi>he that layeth up treaſure for Himſelf, and is not rich towards God.</hi>] Conquer ſelf and Conquer all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:34706:85"/>5. Moreover <hi>ſelf</hi> is the moſt <hi>conſtant</hi> malady; the ſin that doth moſt <hi>conſtantly</hi> attend us. Many actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſins may be laid by, and we may for the time be free from them. But <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is at the heart, and lives with us continually; It parteth not from us ſleeping or waking: It goes to the worſhip of God with us: it will not ſtay behind in the holieſt ordinance: It will not forbear intermixing it ſelf in the pureſt duties; but will defile them all. So that above all ſins in the world, its this that muſt have the ſtricteſt, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt watch, or elſe we ſhall never have any peace for it.</p>
               <p>6. Yea this <hi>ſelf</hi> doth lamentably ſurvive even in the ſanctified ſoul, among the ſpecial graces of the Spirit, and lamentably diſtempereth the hearts and lives of too many of the godly themſelves. Not that any godly man is <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> in a predominant ſenſe; or that <hi>ſelf</hi> is higher or more powerful in his heart than God: for that's a contradiction: ſuch a man <hi>cannot</hi> be a godly man (without Converſion:) But yet the very remnants of conquered <hi>Self,</hi> what a ſmoak do they make in our Aſſemblies, and what noiſom ſcent in the lives of many godly men? what a ſtir have we ſometimes with thoſe that we hope are godly, before we can get them to an impartial judgment; to lament their own fowl words, or other miſcarriages, and to humble themſelves, or freely to forgive another that hath wronged them! eſpecially to confeſs diſgraceful ſins in any ſelf-denying manner? How cloſe ſtick they to their own conceits? how lamentably do they improve them, to the contempt of Miniſters, &amp; trouble and diviſion of the Church? How wiſe are they in their own eyes, and how hardly yield they to any advice that croſſeth <hi>Self?</hi> How hardly are they brought to any dear and coſtly duty? How much do they indulge their appetites and paſſions? and how cheap a Religion do many think to come to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34706:86"/>
heaven with? we can ſcarce pleaſe ſome of them, they are ſo <hi>ſelfiſh:</hi> either becauſe we croſs them in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, or in their wayes; or becauſe we allow them not ſo much ſpecial countenance and reſpect as <hi>ſelf</hi> would have: or deny them ſomewhat which <hi>ſelf</hi> deſires. If they have any uſe for us, if we leave not more publick or greater work which god hath ſet us on, and allow them not that part in our time or labours, or other helps, which God and Conſcience will not allow them, they are offended &amp; take it ill, that <hi>ſelf</hi> is not preferred before God and the publick ſervice. Their <hi>ſelves</hi> are ſo dear to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> that they think we ſhould neglect all to ſerve them.</p>
               <p>Let the moſt uſeful Miniſter live in a place that hath the plague, or other contagious mortal ſickneſs; and moſt that are viſited, will take it ill if the Miniſter come not to them, though they know that his life is hazarded by it, and that his loſs to the whole Church is more to be regarded than the content or benefit of particular perſons; and it is not the pleaſing of them, nor their benefit by him then, that will countervail the Churches loſs of him. What is this but too much preferring <hi>ſelf</hi> (I hope not habitually, but) in that act, before the Church and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God?</p>
               <p>Let a Miniſter or any other man reſolve to beſtow all that God hath given him for his ſervice, on the poor, or pious uſes: Perhaps he ſhall diſpleaſe as many as he pleaſeth, becauſe he hath not enough for all: and if he give to nineteen, the twentieth will ſay [He paſt by me; and I am never the better.] And thus this inſatiable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable <hi>ſelf</hi> will hardly be pleaſed; And among the godly how much doth it prevail! O how many Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> can tell by ſad experience, how much of <hi>ſelf</hi> ſurviveth in Profeſſors! ſo much that we can hardly rule them or keep them from breaking all to pieces, and every man running away of his own. The ruine of <hi>England</hi>'s
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34706:86"/>
expected Reformation; the fall of our hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in too great a meaſure, the multiplying of ſects: the ſwarms of errors: the rage againſt the faithfulleſt Miniſters: the neglect of Diſcipline, and obſtinate refuſal of penitent confeſſions, and humbling, ſelf-denying duties: the backwardneſs to learn: the forwardneſs to be teachers; the high eſteem of weak parts, and weaker grace: the commonneſs of backbiting, cenſuring, and ſlandering, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that are not of their fond opinions: the riſing deſigns of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the tenderneſs of their reputations: the contendings for preheminence, all theſe, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do too loudly tell the world how much of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and how little ſelf-denial is in many that ſeem godly.</p>
               <p>7. But yet this is not the higheſt diſcovery of the power of <hi>Carnal ſelf.</hi> Though its ſad to think that it ſhould be ſo potent in any that have grace: yet its ſadder to think, that it hath too much Power in the wiſeſt and moſt learned Magiſtrates and Miniſters, that ſhould be the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it in the reſt. A Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate is for the common good. Political ſocieties conſiſting of Soveraign and Subject, are therefore called <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> from the final Cauſe, which is the common good, or weal of all: ſo that it is eſſential to a Magiſtrate to be for the common good. And yet <hi>ſelf</hi> creeps in, and makes ſuch work with many of them, that its hard to judge whether it have left them the eſſence of the Magiſtracy, and whether they ſhould be called Magiſtrates or no.</p>
               <p>But yet its ſadder, that the Learned, Godly Preachers of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> ſhould have ſo little of it, as too many have. Alas, that Miniſters do not remember how ill Chriſt took the firſt contendings among his Diſciples, who ſhould be the greateſt; that they do not imprint upon their minds the image of Chriſts ſetting a child before them, and after girding himſelf, and waſhing their feet. I think thoſe men that make a Sacrament of this, do err much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34706:87"/>
leſs than thoſe that forget it. And I ſuſpect that our contrariety to this example, will tempt ſome ere long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this contrary extream, and it may be ſet up as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeed. O woful caſe! to be daily lamented by all the compaſſionate members of the Church: that the Learned, Zealous Paſtors of it, are the leaders, fomenters, and continuers of her diviſions: and when they have opportunity to ſeek for healing, they want a will; and ſo much of <hi>ſelf</hi> ſurviveth in them, that though God call to them for Peace and Unity, and the bleeding Church is begging it of them on her knees; yet ſelf hath ſuch power over them, that God is not heard, and the Church cannot be regarded; but Peace, and Piety, and all muſt be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the will and Intereſt of <hi>ſelf:</hi> As if they were the Prieſts of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and the honour of God, and Peace of the Church were the daily ſacrifice which they have to offer! Not a motion can be made for Reformation or Unity, but ſome <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Miniſters riſe up to ſtrangle it, under pretence of mending the terms. Not a conſultation can be held, but <hi>ſelf</hi> creeps in, yea openly appears, and ravels the work, and will needs be the doer of all thats done, or nothing muſt go on thats done againſt it.</p>
               <p>O Bleſſed Nation, if <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> were more eminent &amp; predominant therein! O pretious Miniſtry, and Great, and Honourable, if we truly ſought our honour in the habit of children, and by being the ſervants of all! O happy Churches, abounding in Holineſs and Peace, if once the Paſtors and People were better skilled in the practice of <hi>ſelf-denial!</hi> I muſt confeſs, to the praiſe of Gods grace, many ſuch Miniſters and people I have had the happineſs to converſe with! and how ſweet the fruit hath been both to them and me, both they and I are ready to confeſs. But one <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> unmortified Miniſter, is enough to diſturb a whole ſociety, and break the good endeavours of many: And alas how many ſuch are abroad, that talk of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34706:87"/>
almoſt nothing but their opinions, or parties, or carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and are not in the harveſt as Reapers to gather, but as wild beaſts that are broken in to make ſpoil, or <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes to ſet all on fire; running up and down from Country to Country with fire-brands at their tails, and ſtings in their mouths, which they call by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend name of Zeal.</p>
               <p>But you may think I have been long in diſcoveries, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, and complaints; and therefore I will go no further in that ſort of work, but only to adjoyn theſe three or four practical conſectaries following.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Conſect.</hi> 1. SO common and Potent is <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> in the world, that its enough to convince a rational Conſiderate man, of the truth of the doctrine of the fall of man, and of Original corruption, againſt all the objections that all the <hi>Socinians</hi> or <hi>Pelagians</hi> in the world do make againſt it. He that thinks that God made man in this diſtempered, diſtracted ſtate that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> doth hold the world in, hath unreaſonable thoughts of the workmanſhip of God. He that ſeeth even children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can ſpeak or go ſo ſelfiſh as they are, &amp; all mankind without exception to be naturally as ſo many Idol gods in the world, and can believe that this is the Image of God, in which they were created, doth make the Image of Satan to be the Image of God: No wiſer, no better is the Doctrine that denieth Original ſin, when <hi>ſelf</hi> hath ſuch a tyrannical, univerſal raign in all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſect.</hi> 2. So deep rooted, and powerful, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal is this abominable vice, that it muſt teach us what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34706:88"/>
to expect in all places we live in, and may help us to make the trueſt Prognoſticks, or probableſt conjectures of any mutations where the will of man is like to be the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner. Know once but where <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> lies, and you may know what almoſt all men will endeavour, and might write a probable Prognoſtication of the changes that are like to be in States, and Kingdoms, and any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the world, were it not for the interpoſition of two greater Powers that have got the victory of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and that is <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Divine-over-ruling Providence.</hi> I ſay were it not that theſe ſtep in, and croſs <hi>ſelf,</hi> and hinder its deſigns, you might fore-ſee in <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> the changes that are made in humane affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſect.</hi> 3 And ſo Potent and common is the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>ſelf</hi> that it may warrant an honeſt, moderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity and jealouſie of almoſt all men, in caſes where the intereſt of ſelf is much concerned. Let him be never ſo ingenuous, let his parts and profeſſion be never ſo promiſing, let his former engagements to you be never ſo great,, let him be your own Brother; yet be not too confident of him, if his carnal <hi>ſelf</hi> be concerned or engaged againſt you. For you ſhall ſee by experience, as long as you live, that <hi>ſelf</hi> will ſtill bear Dominion in the moſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſect.</hi> 4. Above all, every wiſe and godly man ſhould herein maintain the greateſt Jealouſie of his own heart: Keep the heart above all keepings; and keep out <hi>ſelf</hi> above all ſins whatever: Take heed of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> as ever you would <hi>be</hi> Chriſtians, and <hi>live</hi> as Chriſtians, and have the Peace of Chriſtians. And to that end be alwayes ſuſpicious of every cauſe, opinion, controverſie, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, where ſelf is much concerned. The very names of SELF and OWN ſhould ſound in a watchful Chriſtians ears as very terrible, wakening words, that are next to the names of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan;</hi> and at leaſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in them much cauſe of ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI. Uſe 2.</hi> To try our ſelf-denial: the ſincerity of the leaſt degree. <hi>Uſe 2.</hi> Of Exhortation.</head>
               <p>BEloved hearers, I have now before me as great a ſin and danger to deter you from (even ſelfiſhneſs and its effects) and as great a Duty to offer to your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment (even <hi>ſelf-denial</hi>) as any (ſave one) that I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainnted with in the world. The raiſing up the ſoul to God is indeed the greateſt work: But the mortifying of the fleſh, and the Denying of ſelf, is ſurely the next to it, being a real part of the change. You hear Miniſters tell you of the odiouſneſs, and danger, and ſad effects of ſin: but of all the ſins that ever you heard of, there is ſcarce any more odious and dangerous than this, and yet I doubt there are many that never were much troubled at it, nor ſenſible of its malignity. My principal requeſt therefore to you is, that as ever you would prove Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and be ſaved from ſin and damnation that follows it; take heed of this deadly ſin of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and be ſure you be poſſeſſed with true ſelf-denial: and if you have it, ſee that you uſe and live upon it.</p>
               <p>And for your help herein, I ſhall 1. Tell you how your <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> muſt be tried; and 2. How it muſt be exerciſed; and 3. I ſhall give you ſome further Reaſons to perſwade you to it; and 4. Some Directions for the procuring and ſtrengthening it.</p>
               <p>1. The trial of your <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> may be performed by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34706:89"/>
the help of the Signs that have been given you before. In the ten particulars mentioned in the beginning, you may ſee what is <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and what <hi>is ſelf-denial.</hi> But for your further ſatisfaction, I ſhall only tell you in a few words, how the leaſt meaſure of true <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> may be known. And, in one word, that is thus: <hi>Wherever the Intereſt of Carnal ſelf is ſtronger and more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant habitually than the Intereſt of God, of Chriſt, of everlaſting life, there is no true ſelf-denial or ſaving grace: But where Gods Intereſt is the ſtrongeſt, there</hi> ſelf-denial <hi>is ſincere.</hi> If you further ask me, How this may be known? Briefly thus.</p>
               <p>1. What is it that you <hi>Live</hi> for? what is that Good which your mind is principally ſet to obtain? and what is that End which you principally deſign and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain, and which you ſet your heart on, and lay out your hopes upon? Is it the Pleaſing and glorifying of God, and the everlaſting fruition of him? Or is it the Pleaſing of your <hi>fleſhly mind</hi> in the fruition of any inferiour thing? Know this, and you may know whether <hi>Self</hi> or God have the greateſt intereſt in you. For that is your God, which you Love moſt, and Pleaſe beſt, and would do moſt for.</p>
               <p>2. Which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you ſet moſt by? the means of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the Glory of God; or the Means of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for <hi>Self</hi> and Fleſh? Do you ſet more by Chriſt and Holineſs, which are the way to God? or by Riches, Honour, and Pleaſures, which gratifie the fleſh? Know this, and you may know whether you have true <hi>Self-denial?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If you are truly <hi>ſelf-denying,</hi> you are ordinarily Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, and his word and ſpirit, and not by Carnal <hi>Self.</hi> Which is the Rule and Maſter of your lives? whoſe Word and Will is it ordinarily that prevails? When God draws, and ſelf draws, which do you follow in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34706:89"/>
tenor of your life? Know this, and you may know whether you have true <hi>Self-denial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. If you have true <hi>Self-denial,</hi> the drift of your lives is carried on in a ſucceſsful oppoſition to <hi>carnal Self,</hi> ſo that you not only refuſe to be ruled by it, and love it as your God, but you fight againſt it, and tread it down as your enemy: So that you go armed againſt <hi>Self</hi> in the courſe of your lives, and are ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Self</hi> in every duty; and as others think, it then goes beſt with them, when <hi>Self</hi> is higheſt, and pleaſed beſt; ſo you will know that it then goeth beſt with you, when <hi>Self</hi> is loweſt, and moſt effectually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
               <p>5. If you have true <hi>Self-denial,</hi> there is nothing in this world ſo dear to you, but on deliberation you would leave it for God. He that hath any thing which he loveth ſo well that he cannot ſpare it for God, is a <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh</hi> and unſanctified wretch. And therefore God hath ſtill put men to it, in the trial of their ſincerity, to part with that which was deareſt to the fleſh. <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt be tried by parting with his only Son. And Chriſt makes it his ſtanding rule, [<hi>He that forſaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Diſciple</hi>] <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 33. Yet it is true that fleſh and blood may make much reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a gracious heart; and many a ſtriving thought there may be, before with <hi>Abraham</hi> we can part with à Son, or before we can part with wealth or life: But yet on deliberation ſelf-denial will prevail, and there is nothing ſo dear to a gracious ſoul, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpare at the will of God, and the hope of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. If with <hi>Peter</hi> we ſhould flinch in a temptation, we ſhould return with <hi>Peter</hi> in weeping bitterly, and give Chriſt thoſe lives that in a temptation we deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. For Habitually God is deareſt to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:34706:90"/>6. In a word, true ſelf-denial is procured by the <hi>Knowledge and Love of God,</hi> advancing <hi>him</hi> in the ſoul to the debaſing of <hi>ſelf.</hi> The illuminated ſoul is ſo much taken with the Glory and Goodneſs of the Lord, that it carrieth him out of <hi>himſelf</hi> to God, and as it were eſtrangeth him from <hi>himſelf,</hi> that he may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; and this makes him vile in his own eyes, and abhor <hi>himſelf</hi> in duſt and aſhes; He is loſt in <hi>himſelf;</hi> and ſeeking God, he finds <hi>himſelf</hi> again in God. It is not a Stoical Reſolution, but the Love of God and the Hopes of Glory that make him throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the world, and look contemptuouſly on all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo far as they are meer proviſion for the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Search now, and try your hearts by theſe evidences, whether you are poſſeſſed of this neceſſary grace of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial.</hi> O make not light of the matter Sirs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not of it, till you find good grounds. For I muſt tell you that <hi>ſelf</hi> is the moſt treacherous enemy, and the moſt inſinuating deceiver in the world. It will be within you when you are not aware of it, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer you when you perceive not your ſelves much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with it, and of all other vices is both the hardeſt to <hi>find</hi> out, and the hardeſt to <hi>caſt</hi> out; the hardeſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and the hardeſt to cure. Be ſure therefore in the firſt place that you <hi>have ſelf-denial:</hi> and then be ſure that you uſe it and live in the practice of it. And for this I muſt give you more particular advice.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> In what reſpect ſelf muſt be denyed.</head>
               <p>II. AND here I beſeech you take heed of <hi>Self</hi> in all theſe following reſpects. 1. You muſt Deny <hi>Self</hi> as it is Oppoſite to God, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor with him, and the Idol of the ſoul and of the world; and this is in all the <hi>ten</hi> reſpects which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the beginning, and therefore ſhall not now rehearſe. And this is the principal part of <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Self</hi> muſt be denyed as it is but conceived as <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from God; and would be an End in a divided ſenſe from God. For <hi>our ſelves</hi> and all things elſe are created contingent, dependent beings, and muſt not be once thought of as if we were either our own beginning, or end, or in any capacity, but ſubſervient unto God. <hi>Self</hi> becomes a <hi>Satan,</hi> when it would caſt off its due ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to God, and would be any other than the workmanſhip of God, depending on him, and ruled by him, and living to him, loving him, deſiring him, and ſeeking after him, and either mourning when we miſs him, or rejoycing when we find Communion with him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Self</hi> muſt be <hi>denyed</hi> as it ſtands up againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and blindly and proudly quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with that word which faith relyeth upon for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſalvation. <hi>Carnal ſelf</hi> is both the moſt incompetent Judge of the word of God, and of ſpiritual affairs, and alſo the moſt forward, and arrogant, and audacious, for all it is ſo incompetent. And this is the damnable fountain of unbelief. That <hi>ſelf</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Judge of the word and waies of God, is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34706:91"/>
evident: for 1. It is a natural enemy to them, and an enemy is no competent Judge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. [<hi>Becauſe the Carnal mind is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>] Deny therefore this enemy the power of judging the word of God. Ill-will never ſaith well. Enmity is credulous of all evil, and overlooks the good, and is accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with falſe ſurmiſes, and wreſteth every word, and ſuſpecteth or maketh an evil ſence where there was none: there is not a worſe expoſitor in the world. And therefore no wonder if ſuch a nature of enmity can find matter of quarrel with the very Scripture it ſelf, and with an holy life, yea with God himſelf; for it is him eſpecially that the enmity is againſt.</p>
               <p>2. Moreover ſelf is a party, and therefore an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge. It is ſelf that the Scripture principally ſpeaks againſt: All over the Goſpel there are the words of diſgrace, and the arrows of death directed againſt the very heart of <hi>Carnal ſelf.</hi> God there proclaimeth and manageth an open war againſt it. And ſhall a party be the judge? ſhall the traiterous delinquent be the judge? A child will hardly ſpeak well of the rod, whatever he do by the Corrector: but it's not to be expected that a thief ſhould love the halter or the gallows. Gods word is the weapon that ſelf muſt be ſlain by; and therefore ſelf is an incompetent judge of it.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover <hi>ſelf</hi> is quite <hi>blind</hi> in the matters of God: <hi>the natural man diſcerneth them not, nor can do, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. And the ignorant and blind are incompetent judges.</p>
               <p>4. And the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> man is no good <hi>ſtudent</hi> in the Laws of God; even when he readeth the <hi>letter,</hi> he doth not mind or ſavour the ſpirit of them. Rom. 8. 5. [<hi>For they that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh: but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34706:91"/>
the ſpirit.</hi>] A fair world it would be, if every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſhould judge the Privy Council and the Judges of the Land! or if every thief ſhould ſit upon his accuſer and his Judge, and every traitor ſhould judge the Prince. And a thouſand-fold more inſufficient is <hi>ſelf</hi> to judge the Word of God.</p>
               <p>And yet as inſufficient as it is, it is exceeding arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and ſteps up into the judgment-ſeat, at every Chapter that is read or heard: and if this blind and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Judge be unſatisfied, forſooth the Scripture muſt be dark or contradictory, or what he pleaſes. This horrible preſumptuous arrogancy of <hi>ſelf</hi> is it that hath opened ſo many mouths againſt the bleſſed Doctrine of Salvation, and made ſo many wretched Apoſtates in the world, and caſt ſo many others into doubtings of that word by which at laſt they muſt be judged, and which ſhould have been the ground of their faith and hope.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover, <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denyed as it ſtands up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. When Chriſt is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his wonderful Condeſcenſion, in his Incarnation, and mean deſpiſed life, and in his ignominious death, Proud <hi>ſelf</hi> is offended at ſo low a Saviour, and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Humiliation which his own neceſſities did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and deſpiſeth Chriſt becauſe he became deſpiſed and a man of ſorrows in our ſtead. When he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as the remedy of a miſerable ſoul, and as our only Life, and Righteouſneſs, and Hope, <hi>Self</hi> doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſoul to undervalue him: It will not eaſily be convinc'd of ſo much miſery as to need ſuch a remedy: it is too <hi>well</hi> to value ſuch a Phyſician: it is too righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to value the righteouſneſs of a Mediator. It hath too much Life and Hope at home, in its own ſuppoſed innocency or ſufficiency, to ſet much by the Hopes that Chriſt hath purchaſed, and to Live in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:34706:92"/>O down with <hi>ſelf</hi> that Chriſt may be Chriſt to you. How ſhall he come in, while <hi>Self</hi> is the Porter that keeps the door? How ſhall he pardon you, when <hi>Self</hi> will not ſuffer you to feel the want and worth of pardon? How ſhall he bind up your hearts, when Self will not ſuffer them to be broken? How ſhall he cloath you with his righteouſneſs, while ſelf keeps on your own defiled rotten rags? Down therefore with ſelf, that Chriſt may be exalted. Away with your own conceited righteouſneſs, that he may be your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; down with your <hi>Selfiſh</hi> fooliſh wiſdom, that the ſuppoſed fooliſhneſs of God may be your wiſdom. Level this mountain, which Satan hath built up in enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the holy mountain of the Lord.</p>
               <p>5. Moreover, <hi>Self</hi> muſt be denyed as it is the great reſiſter of the Holy Ghoſt. The ſanctifying ſpirit hath no greater enemy, at leaſt, except the Devil himſelf. One half of the work of ſanctification, is to deſtroy this Carnal ſelf. And therefore no wonder if hence it find the chief reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Not an holy motion can be made to the ſoul but <hi>ſelf</hi> is againſt it. No work hath the ſpirit to do upon us, but <hi>ſelf</hi> is ready to gainſay it, and contradict it, and work againſt it: when ever therefore this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle is contending againſt the ſpirit of God, diſhonouring holineſs, diſſwading you from duty, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading you to ſin, down with it and deny it, as you would be true to the ſpirit and your ſelves.</p>
               <p>6. Moreover, <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denyed as it traiterouſly complyeth with the enemies of Chriſt and your own ſalvation: when it takes part with Satan, and pleads for ſin, and ſaith as wicked men ſay, and entreth a conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with all that would undo you, and all this under pretence of your own good. When ever it ſpeaks for ſin, you may be ſure it ſpeaks againſt God and you, and therefore it's reaſon you ſhould deny it. <hi>Self</hi> alſo muſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34706:92"/>
be denied when it riſeth up againſt the ſuppoſed tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or difficulty of duty: when it grudgeth at an holy life, &amp; ſaith, [What a ſtir is here? what a weary life is this? what do I get by ſerving God?] Now <hi>ſelf</hi> is playing the traitor againſt God and you; and therefore deny it.</p>
               <p>7. Moreover, when <hi>ſelf</hi> doth riſe up againſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and make you believe that they are intolerable; and that it is unreaſonable for a man to forſake all that he hath for fear of a ſinful word or deed, when we ſin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, when we have done our beſt; it's time now to ſtop the mouth of <hi>ſelf;</hi> for it plays the Devils game a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and you, and would perſwade you to prefer a ſhort, uncertain, miſerable life, before eternal life, and to give up your ſelf to wilful ſin, becauſe God beareth with the ſins of mens infirmity. It's reaſon that you ſhould deny ſo unreaſonable an enemy to God &amp; you.</p>
               <p>8. Moreover, <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be <hi>denyed</hi> when it ſtands up againſt the Ordinances of God. When it pleadeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the arguments of the word, and findeth fault with the Law that it ſhould obey, and quarrelleth with prayer and all holy duties, and would make all inſtituted means uneffectual for your ſaving good; it's time now that you deny it.</p>
               <p>9. When <hi>ſelf</hi> doth riſe up againſt the <hi>Officers</hi> of Chriſt, and would make you believe your teachers fools, and you are wiſe; that they are beſide the truth, and you are in the right; or that they ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you out of malice or ſingularity, or ſome ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and ſo would deprive you of the ſaving benefit of their Doctrine and Office, it's time now to deny ſelf, if you know but what belongeth to your peace. And though I grant that you muſt not follow a Teacher into a certain ſin and error; yet when it is not God but <hi>ſelf</hi> that riſeth up againſt your Teachers, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you with a ſpirit of bitterneſs, diſobedience,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34706:93"/>
contradiction and malignity, this <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denyed.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, as <hi>ſelf</hi> is againſt the good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or humane Societies, it muſt be denyed. For we muſt love our Neighbour as our ſelves: that is, both ſelf and neighbour muſt be loved in a due ſubordination to God, as means to his Glory, and in this notion of a <hi>means,</hi> the Love ſhould be equal; though there is alſo a Natural Love in order to ſelf-preſervation put into us by the Creator, which our Love to every Neighbour is not to equal in degree; yet our love to Societies ſhould exceed it; and our Love to a Neighbour ſhould come ſo near it, that we ſhould <hi>diligere proximum proxima delictione,</hi> love him as a ſecond <hi>ſelf,</hi> and ſo ſtudy his welfare, as to promote it to our power, and not to covet or draw from him for our ſelves, nor do him any wrong. This is the ſenſe of the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and ſum of the ſecond Table.</p>

               <p>HAving ſeen in what reſpects and upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it is that <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denyed; I am next to tell you the particulars of that <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> intereſt that muſt be denyed, and the parts that are contained in this need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work.</p>
               <p>And here you muſt remember what ſaving faith is, that ſeeing how <hi>ſelf</hi> oppoſeth it, you may know wherein it muſt be denyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:34706:93"/>Saving faith is ſuch a Belief in Chriſt for Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, and the everlaſting fruition of him in Glory, as makes us for ſake all the things of this world, and give up our ſelves to the conduct of the word and ſpirit, for the obtaining of it.</p>
               <p>When a man can ſtrip himſelf of all the pleaſures and profits, and honours of this world, firſt in his eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and love, and reſolution, and then in the actual forſaking of them at the Call of God, becauſe of the firm belief and hope that he hath of the fruition of God in Glory, as purchaſed and promiſed by Jeſus Chriſt; this is a Chriſtian, a Diſciple of Chriſt, a true believer; and none but this. And (as I have told you) as God in Unity, and Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt in Trinity, is the Object of our ſaving faith; ſo <hi>Carnal Self</hi> in unity, and Pleaſure, Profits, and Honours in trinity muſt be renounced and denied by all true Chriſtians; as being that which we turn <hi>from,</hi> when we turn to God. So that in brief to deny <hi>your ſelves,</hi> doth generally conſiſt in denying all your own <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>Intereſts</hi> whatſoever as they are againſt God the Father, Son, or Spirit, or ſtand not in a due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to him: And this <hi>Intereſt</hi> which you muſt deny, conſiſteth in your Pleaſures, Profits, and Honour: Of theſe therefore I ſhall ſpeak diſtinctly, though but briefly.</p>
               <p>I. You muſt begin at the denial and mortification of your Corrupt and <hi>ſelfiſh Diſpoſition,</hi> or elſe you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well <hi>deny</hi> your <hi>ſelfiſh intereſt.</hi> It is not enough to <hi>keep under</hi> this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> by denying it ſomewhat that it would have: but the <hi>ſelfiſh Inclination</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf muſt be ſo far mortified and deſtroyed, that it ſhall not reign as formerly it did. For this which we call <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs</hi> is not your very <hi>Perſons,</hi> nor any ſpiritual or right natural deſire of your owngood: But it is the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34706:94"/>
adhering of the ſoul to your ſelves, by departing from God to whom you ſhould adhere: and ſo a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying over Gods intereſt and honour to your ſelves. Holineſs is an <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>Dedication</hi> to God: by which two we are ſaid to be <hi>ſeparated</hi> to him. And wickedneſs is an Inclination, and Addictedneſs, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedneſs to our ſelves above God, or as ſeparated from God: And this <hi>Inclination, Diſpoſition,</hi> or <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of man to <hi>Himſelf</hi> inſtead of God, is it that I call <hi>ſelf</hi> or <hi>ſelfiſhneſs;</hi> and this <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt it ſelf be firſt deſtroyed, as to the predominant degree.</p>
               <p>And therefore let us Firſt obſerve wherein this <hi>ſelfiſh Diſpoſition</hi> doth conſiſt, which muſt be deſtroyed; and then Secondly, wherein the <hi>ſelfiſh Intereſt</hi> doth conſiſt that muſt be denied.</p>
               <p>And firſt the <hi>ſelfiſh Diſpoſition</hi> conſiſteth in theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts that follow.</p>
               <p>1. The principal part of it conſiſteth in an inordinate <hi>Self-love:</hi> This is a corruption ſo deep in the heart of man, that it may be called his very <hi>Natural Inclination,</hi> which therefore lieth at the bottom, below all his Actual ſins whatſoever; and muſt be changed into a <hi>New Nature</hi> which principally conſiſts in the <hi>Love of God.</hi> This is Original ſin it ſelf, even in the heart of it. This ſpeaks what man by Nature <hi>is:</hi> even an inordinate <hi>ſelf-lover;</hi> And as he is, ſo he will act. In this all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vice in the world is virtually contained: even as all grace is in the <hi>Love of God:</hi> which made the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay, that Love is the Form of all Grace: not as they are this or that Grace in particular; not of Faith as Faith, nor of Hope as Hope; but of Faith, Hope, &amp;c. as vital or gracious acts: becauſe the reſpect to the End is eſſential to the means as a means: and therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God as the End, is Eſſential to Faith, Hope, &amp;c. as a means to him: and therefore that Grace (of Love)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34706:94"/>
which is terminated on the End, muſt have an eſſential participation, concurrence, or influence on thoſe that are directly terminated on the Way or Means; and muſt convey ſomewhat of its very eſſence to them; and ſo far as they partake of that eſſence of Love, ſo far are they indeed thoſe ſpecial Graces which carry the ſoul to God its End: And in this ſence we may allow the diſtinction between <hi>Fides, Spes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>formata charitate</hi> (which is true Chriſtian Faith and Hope,) and <hi>Fides, Spes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>informis,</hi> which is but an opinion and dream. And ſo it is in the body of ſin: When <hi>ſelf-love</hi> doth reign, it is the Heart of wickedneſs: And though every ſin hath its own ſpecifick nature; yet all are virtually in <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and are ſo far mortal, or prove men grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as they are informed by the eſſential Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>ſelf-love:</hi> For <hi>ſelf</hi> being the End, informeth all the means as they reſpect it. I ſay the more to you of this, becauſe indeed it is a weighty truth, for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the true nature of Grace and ſin; and I doubt many are in the dark for want of underſtanding &amp; conſidering it. A man that feareth and Loveth God, and an unſanctified man may be both overtaken with the ſame ſin; perhaps a groſs one, as <hi>Noahs,</hi> and <hi>Davids,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> was: and yet this may be a mortal ſin in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; I mean ſuch as proves him in a ſtate of death, and yet not ſo in the gracious perſon. The wicked will deride this in their ignorance, as if we made God partial; but it's no ſuch matter: The Papiſts cannot endure it, but ſuppoſe <hi>Peter, David,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> were quite without the Love of God, and ſo were again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified men: but this is their error. It was not from the Power of reigning <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and the Habitual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Love of God, that theſe men (or any Saints) did ſin: but from a particular act of mortified <hi>ſelf-love</hi> by a ſurprize upon the neglect of the actual exerciſe of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34706:95"/>
the Love of God. But all the ſins of unſanctified men, or at leaſt their common ſins, are from the <hi>Habitual reign of ſelf-love,</hi> and the <hi>Habitual abſence of the Love of God:</hi> And therefore the ſins of the Saints are, as the Schoolmen ſpeak of the graces of the ungodly, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:</hi> they be not Mortal ſins in the ſenſe aforeſaid, becauſe they be not naturalized, informed, animated, by the malignity and venom of the Mortal End and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which is <hi>Habitual reigning ſelf-love:</hi> But thoſe of the wicked are ſins informed by this <hi>inordinate ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> as an habitual reigning ſin; and therefore being animated by its malignity are mortal: Yet ſay not that this makes God partial, and not to hate the ſame ſin in one as he doth in another. For two things muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in: 1. Where the heart is ſanctified, ſuch ſins are ſtrangers: perhaps <hi>one</hi> Godly man of <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twenty</hi> may <hi>be</hi> guilty of one of them, as <hi>Noah</hi> was of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs once in all his life (ſince his converſion:) For it will not ſtand with grace to live in them. For ſuch as a mans Love, and Inclination, and nature is, ſuch will be the drift of his Life. And would not you have God make a difference between thoſe that ſin <hi>once,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>live</hi> in it? 2. Beſides, will not any honeſt man make a great difference of the ſame acts according as they come from different hearts? you will not take a paſſionate word from a Father, Husband, or Wife, ſo ill as the ſame word from a malicious enemy. If an unthrifty Son ſhould ſpend you twenty ſhillings waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, you will not proſecute him as you would do a thief or an enemy that takes it from you violently. Wilful murder and caſual man-ſlaughter, have not the ſame puniſhment by the Law of the Land. If you will make ſuch a difference your ſelves, of the ſame words or deeds as they come from different meanings and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, quarrel not with God for doing that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34706:95"/>
which you confeſs is juſt and neceſſary to be done.</p>
               <p>1. The Faculty where this Diſpoſition is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated, is the Will: which in man is the Heart of Morality, whether <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil.</hi> And the Principal Act is, an Inordinate <hi>Adheſion</hi> of man to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and <hi>Complacency</hi> in <hi>himſelf:</hi> And this is the inordinate <hi>ſelf-love</hi> that muſt be firſt mortified.</p>
               <p>2. The next faculty that <hi>ſelf</hi> hath corrupted, is the <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> and here we firſt meet with the ſin of <hi>ſelf-eſteem,</hi> which is the ſecond part of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> to be mortified. It is not more natural for man to be ſinful, vile, and miſerable, than to think himſelf vertuous, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and honourable. All men naturally over-value themſelves, and would have all others alſo over-value them. This is the ſin of Pride. But of this I muſt ſpeak by it ſelf.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Self-conceitedneſs muſt be denied.</head>
               <p>3. THe next part of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> to be mortified, is in the ſame faculty, and it is called <hi>ſelf-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And it conſiſteth of two parts: the firſt is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> opinions or conceits that are properly our own: and the ſecond is, to think better of thoſe conceits than they do deſerve.</p>
               <p>Naturally men are prone to ſpin themſelves a web of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions out of their own brain, &amp; to have a Religion that may be called their <hi>own:</hi> And it's their <hi>Own</hi> in two reſpects: 1. Becauſe it is of their own deviſing, and not of Gods revealing or appointing: 2. Becauſe it ſuiteth with their own carnal ends and intereſts. Men are far rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34706:96"/>
to make themſelves a faith, than to receive that which God hath formed to their hands. And they are far readier to receive a Doctrine that tends to their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commodity, or honour, or delights, than one that tends to ſelf-denial, and to abaſe themſelves, and exalt the Lord. 2. And when they have hatched or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch opinions which are peculiarly their Own, they are apt to like them the better, becauſe they are their own, and to value them becauſe of the Intereſt of <hi>ſelf.</hi> O Sirs, that you did but know the commonneſs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> in the world! Even with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſeem humble, and verily think that it is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God that beareth the greateſt ſway in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, yet <hi>ſelf</hi> doth there erect its throne. O how ſecretly &amp; ſubtilly will <hi>ſelf</hi> inſinuate, and make you believe that it's a pure ſelf-denying light which guideth you, andt hat what you hold is meerly by the cogent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth, or the illumination of the Spirit, when it is but a Viper that <hi>ſelf</hi> hath hatched and doateth on, becauſe it is her <hi>own.</hi> Becauſe the Papiſts have gone too far in teaching men to depend on the Church and on their Teachers, therefore <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> takes advantage of their error, to draw men into the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extream, and make every Infant-Chriſtian to think <hi>himſelf</hi> wiſer than his moſt experienced Brethren and Teachers; and every raw unſtudied Chriſtian to think <hi>himſelf</hi> wiſer than thoſe that have been ſearching into the word of truth by ſtudy and prayer almoſt all their days: and therefore to cry down that learning, wiſdom and ſtudy, which they are unacquainted with; that ſeeing they have it not themſelves, they may at leaſt be thought as wiſe men without it, as thoſe that have it, and ſo may provide for the reputation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>ſelf:</hi> O what ſad work hath this great ſin of <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> made in the world! In too many
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34706:96"/>
places men make it their Religion to ſtrive who ſhall be greateſt for wiſdom and abilities in the eyes of men: and it is the very work of their Prayers, and conference, and teaching, to exerciſe <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs,</hi> and to make it appear that they are ſome body in knowledge: Hence is it that they are ſo apt to fall upon novelties w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> either few receive, or none before themſelves deviſed, that being ſingular, <hi>ſelf</hi> may be the more obſerved, and they may have ſomething which may be called their Own: Hence alſo it is that they are ſo little ſuſpicious of their own opinions, never bending their ſtudies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to try whether they are of God or not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to maintain them, and to find out all that can be ſaid for them, and againſt the contrary minded: Hence is it that men have ſuch light and contemptuous thoughts of the judgment of thoſe that excel them in knowledge, and that the voice of <hi>Corah,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſpirators, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 3. is grown ſo common in the mouths of ignorant proud profeſſors, [<hi>Ye take too much upon you</hi> (ſay they to their Guides and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers) <hi>ſeeing all the Congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherefore then lift ye up your ſelves above the Congregation of the Lord?</hi>] It is the Holineſs of the Congregation, and all its members, and the preſence of God himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that is pleaded againſt the Superiority of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> as if with ſo Holy a people, that had God himſelf to be their Teacher and Guide, there were no need of men to be <hi>lift up above the Congregation of the Lord.</hi> But it was <hi>ſelf</hi> that was <hi>intended,</hi> what ever was pretended. From this <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> alſo it is that the weightieſt common truths that <hi>ſelf</hi> hath no ſpecial intereſt in, are ſo little valued and reliſhed, and inſiſted on; and that a leſs and more uncertain point which <hi>ſelf</hi> hath eſpouſed, ſhall be more reliſhed, inſiſted on, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34706:97"/>
contended for: Hence alſo is moſt of the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of men in their own Opinions; that when the point is doubtful, if not certainly falſe, in the eyes of wiſer men than themſelves, yet <hi>the fool rageth and is confident,</hi> Prov. 14. 16. He can carry on a conceit of his <hi>Own</hi> with as brazen a face, and proud contempt of other mens arguments, as if he were maintaining that the Sun is light, and other men pleaded to prove it dark: when, alas, it is <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> that is the <hi>life,</hi> the ſtrength, the goodneſs of the cauſe. Hence alſo it is that men are ſo quarrelſom with the words and ways of others, that they can ſcarce hear or read a word, but theſe pugnacious animals are ready to draw upon it, as if they had catch'd an advantage for the honouring of their valour, and were loth to loſe ſuch a prize and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for a victory and triumph: Hence it is that hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing at the ſayings and doings of others, is the firſt, and moſt common, and moſt ſenſible part of their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. And that they can make hereſies and monſters not only of tolerable errors, but of truths themſelves, if they have but the inexpiable guilt of croſſing the wiſdom of theſe <hi>ſelf-conceited</hi> men. Hence it is that opinions of their own are more induſtriouſly cultivated and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly cheriſhed, by a double if not a tenfold proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Zeal and diligence, than common truths that all the godly in the world have as much intereſt in as they, though the common truths be incomparably the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And hence it is that men are ſo tenacious of that which is their Own, when they eaſilier let go that which is Gods; and muſt have all come to them, and every man deny his own judgment, except themſelves; and that it muſt be the glory of others to yield to them, and their glory to yield to none, but to have all men come over and ſubmit to them. All theſe are the fruits and diſcoveries of <hi>ſelf</hi> as it reigns in mens underſtandings,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34706:97"/>
who poſſibly may think that it's Chriſt and the Spirit that's there exalted.</p>
               <p>Yet miſtake me not: I do not ſay or think that a man ſhould forſake a certain truth for fear of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>ſelf-conceited,</hi> nor that he muſt preſently cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate his own underſtanding to a learneder man, or the ſtronger, or more numerous ſide, for fear of being <hi>ſelf-conceited.</hi> Much leſs muſt I deny that grace of God that hath made me ſavingly wiſe by his illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that was formerly fooliſh, diſobedient, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the days of my ignorance. The world muſt give us leave to triumph over our <hi>own</hi> former folly with <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. and ſay with the ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> that we were no better than mad when we were enemies to the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 11. and with the man in <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 25. [<hi>One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I ſee.</hi>] It's no ſelf-conceitedneſs for a man that is brought from the blind diſtracted ſtate of ſin, into the light of the ſanctified, to know that he is wiſer than he was before; and that he was formerly beſides himſelf, but now is come to his underſtanding again. Nor is it any ſelf-conceitedneſs for the meaneſt Chriſtian to know that a wicked man is more fooliſh than he; or for a Miniſter or any man that God hath cauſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in knowledge, to hold faſt the truth he knows, and to ſee and modeſtly oppoſe the errors of another, and to know that in that he is wiſer than they. God doth not require that we ſhall turn to every mans opinion, and reel up and down from ſect to ſect, and be of the opinion of every party that we come among, and all for fear of thinking our ſelves wiſer than they. <hi>David</hi> knew <hi>he had more Underſtanding than his Teachers: Pſal.</hi> 119. 98, 99. and true believers fear not to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 19. &amp; 3. 19. &amp; 2. 3. And <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34706:98"/>
would not forbear the reproving of <hi>Peter,</hi> for fear of being thought to be <hi>ſelf-conceited, Gal.</hi> 2. ſome men are ſo deſperately <hi>ſelf-conceited</hi> that they take every man to be <hi>ſelf-conceited</hi> that is not of <hi>their</hi> conceits.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>ſelf</hi> is mens inſtructor, and chooſeth their Text, and furniſheth them with matter, and nothing is ſavoury but what is either ſuited to the common intereſt of <hi>ſelf,</hi> or which it hath not a ſpecial intereſt in; when men are abſolutely wiſe in their own eyes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively wiſer than thoſe that know much more than they; when <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> ſerves inſtead of evidence to the receiving, retaining, or contending for a point; when men think they know that which indeed they do not know; and obſerve the little which they do know, more than an hundred fold more that they are ignorant of; doubtleſs here's <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> with a witneſs; and they that will not ſee it in a lower degree, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſhould ſee it in ſuch a caſe as this. He that will not believe that a man is drunk when he reels and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mereth, may know it when he lieth ſpewing in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>Well Sirs, I beſeech you ſee that <hi>ſelf</hi> in the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> be mortified and pulled down. It's the throne of God, the Lanthorn of holy truth, the temple of the Spirit; and ſhall <hi>ſelf</hi> Rule there? The <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> is it that guideth the ſoul and all the actions of your lives: and if <hi>ſelf</hi> rule there, what a Ruler will you have? and what a caſe will heart and life be in? If your eye be dark, your Light be dark, how great will be your darkneſs: and if it be <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> it is certainly ſo far dark. O believe the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 12. [<hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</hi>] For a meer fool that is ignorant only for want of teaching, hath no ſuch prejudice againſt the truth, as the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34706:98"/>
have: Nor is it ſo hard to make him know that he is ignorant: nor yet to make him willing to Learn: He that knoweth himſelf to be blind, is willing to be led. Moreover the ſelf-conceited have much to unlearn, before they can be fit to receive the truth in a ſaving maner.

We cannot humble men for ſin, nor reclaim them from it, till they know the ſin, and the danger of it: and <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedneſs</hi> will not let them know it, no nor let them come to us to be taught: but they are wiſe enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: and if we tell them of the ſin and danger, they are <hi>wiſer</hi> than to believe the Word of God or us!

So is it with the <hi>ſelf-conceited,</hi> that have a ſuperficial knowledge, while they are empty at the bottom, and by the heat of pride, that little they have boileth over to their loſs.

But it is the humble ſoul that hath the ſolid comforts. From the duſt of Humiliation, we have the cleareſt ſight of Glory, and conſequently, the ſweeteſt taſts of it. As high as the rain comes from, it is the loweſt valleys that receive it moſt, and retain it.

Humility cheriſheth the fear of God, and makes us ſay, <hi>How ſhall we do this evil?</hi> or neglect this duty? But Self-conceitedneſs and Pride is blind and bold, and deſtroyeth in mens apprehenſions, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things ſacred and common, the holy and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: It diſpoſeth them to ſuch an unreverent boldneſs with holy things, as uſually ends in a prophane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: ſo that ſuch can at laſt deſpiſe holy Ordinances which they ſhould live upon.

O what a bleſſed feeling it is, to feel ones ſelf in the arms of Chriſt! Our common compaſſion that makes us run to take up one that falls before us, is a ſpark of that compaſſion in Chriſt: who meddles with him that walks before us? but a man that falls down in a ſwoon, we are all ready to lay hands on!

He that in his agony had an Angel to miniſter to him, will not leave the <hi>ſelf-denying,</hi> humble ſoul, without his Angel, or ſome way of relief that is ſutable to the neceſſity.

If you feel no great matter at home to trouble you, you are too Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to be Juſtified by Chriſt. If you groan not under your ignorance and unbelief, you are too wiſe to be Chriſt's Diſciples. If you mourn not under the load

and pain of ſin, you are too well to be Chriſt's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. If you are readier to juſtifie and excuſe your ſelves, than to condemn your ſelves, and had rather hear your ſelves praiſed, than reproved, admoniſhed, or inſtructed, and like <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> love to have the preheminence, you are too high for Chriſt to take any acquaintance with you; and too full of <hi>ſelf</hi> to have any room for his Love, and Spirit, and heavenly Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He that gave us the Parable of the importunate widdow, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 2, 3. would have us underſtand that bare neceſſity is not enough to fit us for relief (for then the worſt of men ſhould be the fitteſt:) but it muſt be Neceſſity ſo felt, as to humble us, and drive us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with God. The Prodigal was miſerable when he was denied the husks; but he never felt his Fathers embracements till he came to <hi>himſelf</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying <hi>himſelf,</hi> and returning to his Father. And this the <hi>ſelf-conceited</hi> will not be perſwaded to. The firſt that muſt touch Chriſt after his Reſurrection, is not a King, nor a Lord, no nor a man, but a woman that had been a ſinner. When ſhe held him by the feet, Love did begin <hi>low</hi> in humility, but it tended higher, and ended higher. Chriſt hath told us that where much is forgiven there will be much love. For there's moſt of the fruits of God's love, and leaſt of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and moſt to abaſe <hi>ſelf.</hi> It is not poſſible that love to Chriſt ſhould dwell or work in any but the humble, that feel at the heart that they are unworthy of love, and worthy of everlaſting wrath. The <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Self conceited</hi> cannot love him; for they cannot be much taken with Chriſt's love to them, except as the Phariſee in a way of <hi>ſelf-flattery.</hi> But the poor ſoul that was loſt, will heartily love him that ſought and found him; and he that was dead, will love when he finds himſelf alive; and he that was condemned both by God and conſcience, will
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34706:101"/>
ſurely love the Lord that ranſomed him! And it is the apprehenſions that men have of <hi>themſelves</hi> that much cauſeth all this difference. The <hi>ſelf-abhorring ſelf-judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelf-denying</hi> ſinner is melted with the love of God in Chriſt, becauſe it is to ſuch a worthleſs, ſinful wretch. <hi>What Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the blood of Chriſt, the pardon of ſin, the ſpirit of grace, the priviledges of a child, and everlaſting glory for ſuch an unworthy wretch as I, that have ſo long offended thee, and ſo much neglected thee and lived ſuch a life as I have done, and am ſuch an empty unprofitable worm?</hi> [<hi>O what a wonder of mercy is this!</hi>] But the full ſoul loaths the honey-comb. The ſelf-conceited unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinner looks as mindleſly at Chriſt, as a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man at the Phyſitian, or an innocent man at a pardon.</p>
               <p>And that good that is in the Proud and <hi>Self-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> doth ſeldom do much good to others, (much leſs to themſelves.) As ſuch do but ſerve themſelves, ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily God doth not bleſs their endeavours: but as they are perverted, they are the likeſt to pervert others, and propagate their ſelf-conceitedneſs: Two words from an humble <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> man, doth oftentimes more good than a Sermon from the <hi>ſelf-conceited.</hi>

               <p>I admoniſh you therefore in the name of God, that you take heed of this part of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and mortifie it. It will elſe keep out God, and almoſt all that is good. If you are proud and <hi>ſelf-conceited,</hi> you will hear a Miniſter rather to cavil with him, than to be edified: and when any thing from God doth croſs your fooliſh wiſdom, you will but ſlight it, or make a jeſt at it: And if any truth of God do ſtrike at the heart of your <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, you will but fret at it, and ſecretly hate it, and perhaps, as the Devils open ſouldiers, publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it; and as the Jews did againſt <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. even gnaſh the teeth at the Preacher, or as they did

                  </gap>, is no better than <hi>ſelf-will.</hi> A will that is not dependent on Gods will, is an Idol, uſurping the prerogative of God; for it is proper to him to be dependent upon none, and to have a will that is not ruled by a Superior will. Little do the moſt know how great a ſin this is, to be <hi>ſelf-willed.</hi> You have a will to ſomething or other continually; and it is your <hi>will</hi> that ruleth the reſt of your faculties and actions: but what is it that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth your will? whence do you fetch the riſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your deſires? Is it from <hi>Gods will,</hi> or is it not? You pray to God [<hi>Thy will be done</hi>] and do your own wills anſwer theſe prayers? or are they hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſſembling words? If indeed it be Gods will that you would have fulfilled, then will the knowledge of that will of God determine your own wills. As a ſervant dependeth on his Maſters will, for all the work that he is to do, and doth not what he will him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34706:103"/>
but what his Maſter will have him do; and as a Scholar dependeth on his Maſters will, and learneth only ſuch books and leſſons as he ſets him; ſo muſt we depend on the will of God; and know what is his will, before we give way to any will of our own. The reaſon why you chooſe any trade or calling or courſe of life, ſhould be the will of God. If you are in Poverty, and deſire to be richer, and that to pleaſe your own wills, and not that you think that it would be any more pleaſing to God, this is <hi>ſelf-willedneſs.</hi> If you deſire any change in your condition, if you undertake any thing in the world, know why you do this: whether it be principally becauſe you think it is the will of God, or becauſe it is your own will; I tell you again, you ſhould not have one wiſh or deſire in your ſouls, till you can prove or find that God would have it ſo: and if your own wills be made the abſolue ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of your ways, you make Gods of your ſelves, and God will deal with you accordingly.</p>
               <p>2. Yea if you do think the will of God is according to your will, and you are moved the more to it on that account, yet if your own wills do lead and make the firſt choice, and Gods will be brought in but to follow and incourage yours, this is ſtill Self-willedneſs and Self-idolizing. This is the common trick of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. They firſt give way to their own <hi>ſelf-will,</hi> and then they will go to Scripture for ſomewhat to bear them out; and will needs believe that God's is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to theirs, that ſo they may go on with peace of Conſcience. They go for counſel to God as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> did, not ſincerely to know the will of God with a reſolution to obey it, but with a deſire that God would conform his will to theirs. I tell you if the matter be never ſo much commanded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and never ſo agreeable to the will of God, yet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34706:104"/>
if you deſire and do it from your ſelves, and not for this reaſon, becauſe it is the will of God, and do not let Gods will lead your own, but let your own will lead, and Gods will follow, this is no better than <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willedneſs,</hi> were the matter never ſo good in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>3. If the end that moveth your will, be not the ſervice and glory of God, but only your own Intereſt, this is but <hi>ſelf-will.</hi> God giveth you leave to look to your ſelves as his ſervants in a due ſubſerviency to him: But if you will principally look at your own intereſt, and make light of Gods, and fetch the reaſon of your will and deſires from your own ends and commodity, rather than his Glory, this is an ungodly <hi>ſelfiſh-will.</hi> And yet alas, how many are there that know not any better frame of <hi>will</hi> than this? If they were truly to give an account of the principal reaſon and motive of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of their hearts, why they would have this, or why they would do that, muſt they not confeſs it is for themſelves, becauſe it ſerveth their own ends or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and becauſe it pleaſeth their own wills, and not becauſe it furniſheth them better to ſerve and pleaſe the will of God. If you ask men in their buying, and ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and marrying, and trading, and dealing with men, why it is that they do this or that; can they truly ſay, I do it becauſe I think in this way I can do God the beſt ſervice, and the Church or Commonwealth moſt good; and this is my chief reaſon? Alas, I fear they are too few that have any higher principal end and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than ſelf. <hi>Self-will</hi> is the ſpring of their whole Converſations, that ſets them upon all they do. Nay doubtleſs, in the very duties of Religion, in praying, hearing, reading and the like, they are but ſerving ſelf, while they take on them to ſerve God; and their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt devotions is but ſuch a ſerving of God, as flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers

And much more is it <hi>ſelf-willedneſs,</hi> when men contradict the <hi>Will</hi> of God: when Scripture ſaith <hi>One</hi> thing, and they another: when they diſreliſh Gods Laws, and diſlike the work that he ſets them on; when they have a <hi>Will</hi> to that which God forbids, and would fain be doing with unlawful things; yea and it doth not ſatisfie their corrupt deſires to ſee that the expreſs will of God is againſt them; this is <hi>ſelf-will</hi> in a high degree.</p>
               <p>5. So alſo when mens <hi>wills</hi> are to that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the honour and intereſt of God; which would hinder this Goſpel, and the ſaving mens ſouls, and is diſpleaſing to him, this is <hi>ſelf-willedneſs</hi> in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what it is to be <hi>ſelf-willed.</hi> And now do but conſider whether this part of <hi>ſelf</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly denied in the world. Among the millions of deſires that are in mens hearts, how few of them are kindled by the commands of God, or moved by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Glory? How commonly are the word and ways of God diſtaſtful to the world? How ill do men like the diſpoſals of his providence? And what a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is there in their wills againſt him? And were it not that God is above them and unconquerable, and they know that ſtriving will not help them, you ſhould have moſt of the world in open war againſt the God of Heaven: I ſpeak no more than I am able to prove. The Dominion of <hi>ſelf</hi> is ſo great in the wills of all that are unſanctified, that their <hi>wills</hi> are utterly againſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34706:105"/>
the Will of God; and it's meerly, becauſe there's no remedy, that they ſubmit to him ſo far as they do. Thoſe very perſons that think they love and ſerve him as well as the preciſeſt, would be in arms againſt him before to morrow, and pull God out of Heaven if it were in their power: Or if they had but as much hope to prevail againſt God, as they have againſt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, what work would be in the world? I know theſe men will not believe this by themſelves: No, <hi>ſelf</hi> is too ſtrong in them to let them ſo far know themſelves; But the Caſe is plain. For as God himſelf tell us, that ever ſince the fall an Enmity is put between Chriſt and this ſerpentine ſeed; ſo we ſee it manifeſted by daily ſad experience. How generally is the Will of God diſliked by the world? What hath God ſpoke againſt in his Word but ſin? and what elſe hath he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Meſſengers to Cry out againſt? And yet what is there that more pleaſeth the minds of the moſt? And how ſtubbornly do they reſiſt not only God, but Magiſtrates and Miniſters that would draw them from it? what is it that God commendeth to the world ſo ſo much as an Holy and Heavenly life? And what is the Heart of moſt men more againſt? and how much do they ſtrive againſt all our perſwaſions that would bring them to it? and how obſtinately do they reſiſt us, if not deride and ſcorn that Holineſs which the will of God hath ſo abundantly commended to them? His whole Word ſpeaks for it: his Prophets, Apoſtles, and all his ſervants are examples of it; his Son Jeſus Chriſt in his ſacred perſon, and office, and holy life, hath yet more notably commended it to the world; and it was a principal part of his buſineſs in the fleſh, to ſet men a pattern of Holineſs and <hi>Self-denial:</hi> And yet many ſcorn it, &amp; hate it, and moſt diſlike it, and even fight againſt this holy <hi>Will</hi> of God, that is, againſt God

It is thine ſubjectively, but it is Gods as the principal Efficient and End. O that you did but know what your <hi>Own</hi> wills are, and what they have done againſt you, and what they may yet do, if they be not mortified! You would not then be ſo indulgent to them, and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and pleaſe them, and be ſo deſirous to have your own <hi>wills</hi> as you have been. To this end I pray you conſider but of theſe particulars following.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>will</hi> of man is the terreſtial Throne of God. It is there that he muſt reign. The will is to Rule all the inferiour faculties; and God is to rule the will. And ſhall <hi>ſelf</hi> preſume to dethrone the Lord, and ſit down in his place? He that rules the will rules the man. And ſhall <hi>ſelf</hi> be thy Ruler? And will God put up all this?</p>
               <p>2. It is God only that hath the Soveraign authority, and <hi>ſelf</hi> hath nonebut under him. We are not our own; and therefore have nothing to do with <hi>our ſelves</hi> but at the Will of God that is our Owner. Take heed therefore of this Uſurpation.</p>
               <p>3. Thy own will is a corrupt and ſinful will, and therefore unfit to be thy governor: what wilt thou chuſe an unjuſt, a wicked and unmerciful governor, that is inclined to do evil? Why ſuch is thine own <hi>Will;</hi> But the <hi>Will</hi> of God is perfectly good, that hath not the leaſt inclination to evil, nor poſſibility of ſuch a thing. Be ruled by it, and you are moſt certain to have the moſt juſt, and holy, and faithful, and merciful ruler in the world. To prefer <hi>ſelf-will</hi> before the Will of God, is as the Jews, to prefer a murderer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas,</hi> before the Lord of life.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover, Our <hi>own wills</hi> are guided by a dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: and therefore ready on every occaſion to turn aſide. Though the will commandeth, yet the underſtanding guideth it: And therefore as the dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34706:106"/>
is commonly at a loſs, or quite miſtaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judging evil to be good, and good to be evil: ſo the will muſt be an unhappy governor, that followeth the direction of ſo ignorant a Counſellor: But if you will deny your <hi>Own wills,</hi> and be ruled by the Will of God, you need not fear miſleading, ſeeing his wiſdom is infallible and infinite. Chuſe not a blind guide then, when you may have the conduct of wiſdom it ſelf; when God is content to be your Governor, prefer not ſuch fooliſh ſinners as <hi>your ſelves</hi> before him.</p>
               <p>5. Moreover, Your <hi>ſelf-will</hi> hath almoſt undone you already: It hath been the cauſe of all your ſin and miſery: Never any hurt befell you, or any man on Earth, but from <hi>ſelf-will.</hi> And yet will you follow it ſtill, and take no warning, as if it had not done enough againſt you? But on the contrary, you were never hurt in all your lives by following the <hi>Will</hi> of God: unleſs it be ſuch a hurt as the ſearching or cleanſing of a ſore, without which it cannot be healed; or ſuch a hurt as the taking of Phyſick, without which you can have no cure. Tell me if you can, when ever the Will of God did wrong you? when did you ſpeed the worſe for the following of his counſel? Look back upon your lives, and tell me whether all your ſmart and loſs have come from your following Gods Will, or your own; and which you think you have more cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of.</p>
               <p>6. There is none followeth <hi>ſelf-will</hi> to the end, but is everlaſtingly undone by it: It leadeth directly to the diſpleaſing of Gods Will, and ſo to Hell: But on the contrary, there is none that ſincerely and finally follow the Will of God, that ever do miſcarry: He is the ſafeſt Conductor: He never led a ſoul to hell. All that follow him, live with him: For whither ſhould he lead them but to himſelf? And where God is,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34706:107"/>
there is life and glory. To obey his Will, is to pleaſ his Will: And to pleaſe him, is our very end. It can not go ill with them that pleaſe the Lord and Judge of all the word, the diſpenſer of all Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>7. Your <hi>own wills</hi> are ſo mutable as well as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided, that they will bewilder you and toſs you up and down in perpetual diſquietneſs; though I know you think that is the only way to your content, and nothing will content you unleſs you have your <hi>will.</hi> But you are lamentably deluded; your <hi>wills</hi> are like the <hi>will</hi> of a man in a ſever, that would fain have cold water, which pleaſeth him in the drinking, but afterwards may be his death. You love that which hurteth you; yea that which is no bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r than poyſon to your <hi>Souls.</hi> You would ſoon undo your ſelves, if you had your own <hi>wills.</hi> It is none of the leaſt of Gods mercies to you to croſs your wills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to deny you that which you have a mind to. You will not let your Children eat or drink what <hi>they will,</hi> but what <hi>you will,</hi> that know better what's good for them. A patient can deny his <hi>own will</hi> for his health, and ſubmit himſelf to the <hi>will</hi> of his Phyſician. And ſhould not you much more ſubmit to God? yea you ſhould <hi>deſire</hi> him to deny your own wills, when ever he ſeeth them contrary to <hi>his Will,</hi> and to your own good: Had you but the skill of judging aright of Gods dealings, I am perſwaded that upon the review of your lives, you would find, that God hath ſhewed you more mercy in the croſſing of your wills, then in accompliſhing them. Be not therefore too eager for the time to come, to have what you <hi>Love,</hi> till you are ſurer that you <hi>Love</hi> nothing but that which is good for you, and which you <hi>ſhould</hi> love. The preſent contenting of diſeaſed <hi>ſelf-will,</hi> is but the breeding after-diſquietneſs, But in the <hi>Will of God</hi> you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34706:107"/>
may have ſull and durable content. For his <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>always</hi> for good, and therefore hath nothing that ſhould cauſe your diſcontent. His will is ſtill the ſame &amp; unchangeable; and therefore will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot diſquiet you by mutations. He knows the end at the beginning, and ſets you upon nothing but what he is ſure will comfort you at the laſt. It belongeth to <hi>his will</hi> and not to <hi>yours</hi> to diſpoſe of you and all your affairs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is all the reaſon in the world, that Gods Will ſhould be ſet up, and in it you ſhould reſt your ſelves content, and that <hi>ſelf-will</hi> ſhould be denied as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber of your quietneſs.</p>
               <p>8. Moreover, <hi>Self-will</hi> is Satans will, &amp; ſtirred up by him againſt the Lord. How elſe do you think the Devil rules the children of diſobedience, but by <hi>ſelf-conceit</hi> and <hi>ſelf-will?</hi> If therefore you would deny the Devil, deny <hi>ſelf-will;</hi> for in being ruled by it, you are ruled by him; and in pleaſing it, you pleaſe him. God himſelf tells you this in plain expreſſions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. They that <hi>walk in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and ſo <hi>are dead in them, according to the courſe of this world, and in the luſts of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind, theſe</hi> the Holy Ghoſt there tells you, <hi>do walk according to the Prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. It is the very perfection and felicity of man, to be conformed to the <hi>Will</hi> of God, and to reſt with full content therein; And it is the corruption and miſery of man, to have a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> miſguided Will of his own, and ſtrive againſt his Makers Will. And ſo far as you ſtick in your own wills, and are ſet upon them, and muſt have them fulfilled, and cannot reſt in the Will of God, ſo far are you ſtill unſanctified, and unſaved, and in the power of your great diſeaſe. And ſo far as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34706:108"/>
you are dead to <hi>ſelf-will,</hi> and look up to the Will o God both for direction and content, and will that which he willeth, even becauſe he willeth it, and would have you will it, and can reſt your ſouls in this as full ſatisfaction [It is my Fathers Will, and therefore beſt.] So far are you ſanctified and reſtored to God.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, let me tell you, that it's beſt for you to deny <hi>ſelf-will</hi> in time, and give your <hi>wills</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of God. For when you have done all that you can, God <hi>will</hi> have <hi>his</hi> Will, and you ſhall not have your own will long. You may ſtrive againſt the <hi>Will</hi> of God, but you ſhall not fruſtrate it. You may break his Laws, but ſhall not ſcape his judgments. You may rebel againſt his <hi>commanding will,</hi> but you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his <hi>puniſhing will.</hi> When you have done your worſt, it's Gods will that muſt ſtand; and ſuch a will as is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the pleaſure of your wills. But <hi>Self-will</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of long continuance: its content is ſhort. Now you will have your <hi>will,</hi> let God ſay what he will to you: you Love to pleaſe your appetite in meats and drinks; you love to be carnally merry, and ſpend your time in vain ſports and pleaſure; you love to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and humoured by all, and to be honoured and counted ſome body in the world; you love to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, for the time to come, &amp; to be wealthy that you may take out of a full heap; or at leaſt not want for the contentment of your fleſh: and therefore you muſt have your <hi>wills,</hi> &amp; have that you <hi>love,</hi> if you can tell how to get it: But <hi>how long</hi> will you have <hi>your wills? How long</hi> will you have that you love, though God forbid it? When death comes, will you have it then? when you lie in pain expecting every hour to appear in another world, will you then have your <hi>wills?</hi> when you are in Hell, will you then have your <hi>wills,</hi> or that you love? O Sirs,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34706:108"/>
                  <hi>Self-will</hi> is ſhort-lived, as to its delights and pleaſure: But the Will of God is everlaſting. And therefore if you take up with your own wills, how ſhort will be y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur content! but if you look for content in the Will of God, you will have everlaſting content. Your own wills may be croſt by every trifle; Any man that is greater than you can croſs them: yea thoſe that are under you can croſs them. The pooreſt beggar can rob you, or ſcorn you, or raiſe a ſlander of you, or twenty ways can croſs your <hi>ſelf-wills;</hi> A hundred accidents may croſs them. Your very Beaſt can croſs you; and almoſt any thing in the world can croſs you; much more can God at any time croſs you; and croſs you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he will: ſo that in your own wills there is no reſt nor happineſs. But if you could bring your <hi>wills</hi> to <hi>Gods,</hi> and take up your full content in this [<hi>It is the Will of God,</hi>] then what a conſtant, invincible content might you have! Then all the world could not diſturb you and rob you of your content, becauſe they cannot conquer the Will of God: Hiswill ſhall be done; and ſo you ſhould alway have content.</p>

ANother part of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> to be mortified and denied, is, <hi>ſelfiſh Paſſions.</hi> The ſoul is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Paſſions by God, partly for the exciting of the <hi>will</hi> and other faculties, that they do not ſluggiſhly neglect their duties; and partly to help them in the execution when they are at work: So that they are but the wheels or the ſails of the reaſonable ſoul, to ſpeed our motion for God and our Salvation, and not to be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34706:109"/>
employed for <hi>carnal ſelf.</hi> When Paſſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſanctified and uſed for God, they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch and ſuch particular Graces, and the fervour of them is an <hi>holy Zeal;</hi> But when they are uſed for <hi>carnal ſelf</hi> they are our vices; and the heat of them is but fury, or carnal zeal, and the height of vice. But how rare is it to meet with men that are meek and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in their own cauſe, and paſſionate in a holy zeal for God? I know many are paſſionate in diſputes and other exerciſes about Religion, and think that it's pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zeal for God, when <hi>ſelf</hi> is at the bottom of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ruleth as well as kindleth the fire, when they ſearce diſcern it, and little know what ſpirit they are of: But pure <hi>zeal</hi> for God, conjoyned with <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> is exceeding rare. How few can ſay that their <hi>Love</hi> to God, is greater and hotter than their <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> The <hi>Deſires</hi> of men are ſtrong after thoſe things that ſupply their own neceſſities, and pleaſe their own corrupted wills: but how cold are they after the honour of God? How <hi>averſe</hi> are men from that which hurteth the fleſh! as to go into a Peſt-houſe, or to take deadly poyſon, or to ſuffer any pain: but few are ſo <hi>averſe</hi> to the breaking of the Law of God. A hard word or a little injury done to themſelves, will put them into a <hi>paſsion,</hi> ſo that their anger is working out in reproach, if not in more revenge: but God may be abuſed from day to day, and how <hi>patiently</hi> can they bear it? There's few carnal minds but can more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently hear a man ſwear, or curſe, or ſcorn at Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a holy life, than hear him call them Rogue, or Knave, or Thief, or Lyar, or any ſuch diſgraceful name. It ſeems an intolerable diſhonour with ſelfiſh perſons that are advanced by Pride to be great in their own eyes, for a man to give them the lye, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their Parentage, or make them ſeem baſe: but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34706:109"/>
they can hear twenty oaths and reproaches of the truths or ways of God as quietly and patiently as if there were no harm in them. Their own enemies, whom God commandeth them to love, they hate at the heart: but the enemies of God and holineſs, whom <hi>David hated with a perfect hatred,</hi> Pſal. 139. 21, 22. do little or nothing at all offend them. It is not thus with <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> gracious ſouls. When <hi>David</hi> heard <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> curle him, he commanded his ſouldiers to let him alone, for God had bidden him; that is, by that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting providence on <hi>David</hi> he had occaſioned it, and by the withdrawng of his reſtraint he had let out his malice, for a trial to <hi>David.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a man to go along by him curſing him, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him as a Traitor, and a man of blood, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones at him; and he rebuked <hi>Abiſhai</hi> that would have taken off his head, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9, 13. But when the ſame <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>wicked,</hi> the <hi>frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> the <hi>ſlanderer,</hi> the <hi>proud,</hi> the <hi>lyar,</hi> and the <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> he reſolveth that he will <hi>not know them, they ſhall not dwell in his houſe, nor tarry in his ſight; he hateth them; they ſhall depart from him; he will cut them off, and early deſtroy him from the Land, and from the city of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 101. So was it with <hi>Moſes:</hi> when God was offended by the Idolatry of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he was ſo zealous that he threw down the Tables of Stone, in which God had written the Law, and broke them: but when <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake againſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> he let God alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the cauſe, and only prayed for them; for ſaith the Text, [<hi>He was very meek above all the men that were on the face of the earth.</hi>] Numb. 12. 3. <hi>Phinehas</hi> his zeal for God did ſtay the plague, and was imputed to him for righteouſneſs: when the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> zeal of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> was called but a curſed anger, and brought a curſe on them inſtead of a bleſſing from their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34706:110"/>
dying Father, that they ſhould be <hi>divided in</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſcattered in</hi> Iſrael; and left them the name of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of cruelty,</hi> Gen. 49. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Take warning then from the word of God; &amp; uſe your paſſions for God that gave them you; but when it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe of <hi>ſelf,</hi> be dead to paſſion as if there were no ſuch thing within you. If the wrong be done to <hi>you,</hi> think then with <hi>your ſelves,</hi> [<hi>alas, I am ſuch a ſilly wretched worm that a wrong done to me is a ſmall matter, in compariſon of the leaſt that's done to God: it is not great enough for indignation or paſsion:</hi>] Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it's Gods work to right your wrongs, and your work to lament and hinder the abuſe of God. And therefore if men curſe you, or revile you, or ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, if Gods intereſt in your reputation command you to ſeek the clearing of it, then do it, but not for <hi>your ſelf,</hi> but for God: but otherwiſe, be as a dead man that hath no eyes to ſee an injury, nor no ears to hear it, nor no heart to feel it, nor no underſtanding to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, nor no hands to be revenged for it: This is to be mortified, and dead to <hi>ſelf.</hi> When Paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſtir within you, ask <hi>What's the matter? who is it for? and who is it that is wronged?</hi>] If it be God, ask counſel of God, what he would have you to do, and let your paſſion be well guided and bounded, and then it will be acceptable holy zeal: but if it be but <hi>ſelf</hi> that's wronged, remember that <hi>you are not your own;</hi> and therefore take no thought of the buſineſs, but leave God to look to his <hi>own,</hi> and do with it as he pleaſe: If you are <hi>his,</hi> your cauſe is <hi>his,</hi> and therefore let him look to it that is concerned in it more than you; and that hath ſaid, [<hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.</hi>]</p>

               <p>6.

God ſhould be the Spring, the End, the Sum of all our thoughts; If we find a thought in our minds, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth not of God, yea that is not ſent by him, and doing his work, we muſt diſown it, apprehend it, &amp; caſt it out. But alas how contrary is the caſe with the moſt? As <hi>ſelf</hi> is advanced higheſt in their imagination, ſo doth it there attract and diſpoſe of the thoughts. What are all the thoughts of unſanctified men employed for, but for <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>theirs?</hi> Their fantaſies hunt about the world; but it's their own game and pleaſure that they range about. The thoughts of one man run upon his covetouſneſs, and another man's upon his filthy luſts, and another man's on his ſports and pleaſures, and anothers upon his honour &amp; reputation with men! They feed the imaginations of their mind upon almoſt nothing but <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> things! ſometimes delighting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the very <hi>thoughts</hi> of mens eſteem of them, or of their worldly plenty, or of their ſinful luſts and

pleaſures, and ſometime troubling <hi>themſelves</hi> with the <hi>thoughts</hi> of their wants, or low condition, or croſſes, or injuries from men: ſometime <hi>contriving</hi> how they may attain their deſires; and carking and caring for accompliſhing their <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ends: morning and evening, at home and abroad, as the thoughts of the ſanctified are on God, and heaven, and the way thereto: ſo the thoughts of the unſanctified are all upon <hi>ſelf,</hi> and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of ſelf, and the means thereto. O cleanſe your minds Sirs, of this great <hi>ſelf-pollution:</hi> Keep them more clean and chaſte to God. Deny <hi>ſelf</hi> this room in your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and waſte not <hi>thoughts</hi> and precious time, on ſuch unjuſt and unprofitable imployment. It is an impertinency, to be ſo much ſolicitous about the charge of God, and to care ſo much when he hath bid us, <hi>Be careful for nothing:</hi> It is a debaſing of our minds to feed them ſo long on ſo low an object, when they might be taken up with God. <hi>Care not therefore what you ſhall eat or drink, or wherewith you ſhall be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for after all theſe things do the ſelfiſh</hi> unſanctified <hi>Gentiles ſeek; and our Father knoweth that we have need of all theſe things: but ſeek ye firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added to you,</hi> Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Inordinate Appetite to be denied.</head>
               <p>7. THe laſt part of <hi>ſelf</hi> to be denied is your <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Appetites,</hi> excited by the ſenſes, commonly called the <hi>ſenſitive Appetite.</hi> Theſe are not to be themſelves deſtroyed; for the Appetite is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and neceſſary to our welfare: but the inordinate deſire is to be denied, and the Appetite reſtrained, and no further ſatisfied than is allowed by the word of God; and by this means the inordinancy of it may come to be mortified. Though <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> hath defiled the whole man, yet <hi>ſenſual pleaſure</hi> is the chief part of its intereſt, and therefore by the ſenſes it commonly works, and theſe are the doors and windows by which iniquity entreth into the ſoul. And therefore a principal part of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> conſiſteth in <hi>denying</hi> the <hi>ſenſitive Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how far is this Appetite to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When ever it craveth any thing that is forbidden: This is paſt doubt. It muſt not be pleaſed to the diſobeying of God. 2. When it ticeth us <hi>towards</hi> that which is forbidden, and would be feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>baits and occaſions</hi> of ſin; unlefs the thing deſired be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it is here to be denied. For ſin and Hell are dangers that no wiſe man will draw too near to. 3. When ever the pleaſing of the ſenſe <hi>conduceth not to Gods ſervice,</hi> and doth not fit or furniſh us for our duty, it is unlawful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may not the Creatures be received for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> as well as for Neceſſity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's an ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed queſtion: As if Delight it ſelf were never <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> Neceſſity is either <hi>Abſolute,</hi> as of thoſe things
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34706:112"/>
without which we cannot be ſaved; or it is only to our <hi>bettering</hi> and the greater <hi>ſecuring</hi> of our ſalvation: and ſo it's taken for that which is any way uſeful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to it; directly and indirectly. We may and muſt make uſe of the creatures, 1. Not only for our <hi>own Neceſſity,</hi> but principally for the ſervice and glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. And 2. not only for our <hi>Abſolute</hi> neceſſity, but alſo when they in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure further us in or to the ſervice of God; ſo be it they be not on any other account unlawful. 3. We may uſe the Creatures for delight, when that Delight it ſelf is a means to fit us for the work of God, and is ſincerely ſought for that intent. But we may not uſe them for any other Delight, but that which it ſelf is neceſſary or uſeful to Gods ſervice. Reaſons are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. 1. Becauſe we ſhould elſe make that Delight our ultimate end, which is as bad as brutiſh; for either it muſt be an <hi>End,</hi> or <hi>Means.</hi> If it be not uſed as a means to God as our ultimate end, it muſt be our ultimate end it ſelf, which is no better than to take his place. 2. That action is idle, and conſequently a ſinful miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of our faculties which doth not conduce to the end that we were made for, and live for. 3. It is a miſimploying of Gods creatures, and a ſinful caſting them away to uſe them for any end which is not it ſelf a means to the great end of our lives. All is loſt that is no way uſeful to God and our ſalvation. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the end of their Creation and of ours. 4. It is a ſinful robbing God of the uſe of his talents, if we uſe them for any end that is not ſubſervient to himſelf as the chief end. For certainly he made all things for himſelf, and that which is not imployed for him, is taken from him injuriouſly. All men muſt anſwer for the mercies which they have received; whether they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34706:112"/>
have ſo uſed them for God, as that they can give him his own with the improvement.</p>
               <p>5. The ſenſitive Appetite by reaſon of its inordinacy, is grown a Rebel againſt God and Reaſon; and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to him and to our ſelves. And no man ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily pleaſe or feed ſo dangerous an enemy. Sin doth moſt make its entrance this way; and moſt men lie in ſin before our eyes, by pleaſing their ſenſes: And ſhall we run our ſelves on ſuch a great and viſible, danger, againſt the warning of ſo many experiences? Yea we know that we have been often this way over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken our ſelves, and that abundance of ſin hath crept in at theſe paſſages; and yet ſhall we plead for liberty to undo our ſelves? The godly are ſo conſcious of their weakneſs and proneneſs to ſin, that they are jealous of themſelves; and therefore it beſeemeth not ſuch to do any thing needleſly that may tempt them to it, and is ſo likely to prove a ſnare. If <hi>Paul muſt beat and tame his body to bring it into ſubjection, leſt when he had preached to others, he ſhould be caſt away himſelf,</hi> (1 Cor. 9. 27.) much more have we need to be watchful that are more weak. We are commanded expreſly to <hi>make no proviſion for the fleſh, to ſatisfie the luſts (or deſires) thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. 14. And therefore they that eat, or drink, or do any thing elſe for the meer <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the deſires of the fleſh,</hi> and for its delight, do break this expreſs command of God. And how is it ſaid, that <hi>they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts or deſires thereof,</hi> if they may uſe the Creatures meerly to delight and pleaſe the fleſh? This is not <hi>Crucifying its affections and deſires,</hi> Gal. 5. 24.</p>
               <p>Jobs <hi>Covenan` with the eyes</hi> that they gaze not on alluring objects, (<hi>Job</hi> 31. 1.) was an act of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:34706:113"/>
that others need as well as <hi>Job.</hi> Such a Covenant with our taſt, and with our ears, and with every ſenſe, that they move not but by the conſent of God and Reaſon, and let not in any ſin into the ſoul, is a moſt eminent part of this neceſſary duty. <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murder did firſt make its entrance at the eye. Had <hi>Noah</hi> more jealouſly watch'd his Appetite, he had not by Drunkenneſs been a warning to poſterity. It was <hi>Achan's</hi> eyes that betrayed his heart to the gold, &amp; ſilver, and rich attire, though an accurſed thing, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 20, 21. What ſin almoſt doth not enter at ſome of theſe ports?</p>
               <p>Be ſure therefore that no ſenſe be without its guard: <hi>Accuſtom</hi> your ſelves to <hi>deny</hi> them, and the conqueſt will be eaſie. It is not to deny them any thing that is uſeful to you for Gods ſervice, and a true means to your holy Ends, that I adviſe you to; but only that which would betray you by delighting in them. It is not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the body, but to <hi>tame</hi> it, <hi>keep it under, and bring it into ſubjection:</hi> and this <hi>muſt</hi> be done. To move to this, conſider yet further theſe three or four things more diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>1. It is for want of this part of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> that the world is ſo full of <hi>ſcandals,</hi> and the Conſciences of men ſo full of wounds, and Profeſſors walk ſo unevenly with God, and ſeem to be but as other men. Here one drops into tipling, if not ſtark drunkenneſs; and there another into wantonneſs, if not fornication: and many live in gluttony, and never ſee it nor repent of it; and many are drowned in covetous deſires and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; and ſome give up themſelves to ſenſual pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes; and all becauſe they do not make this Covenant with their ſenſes, nor have everyet learn'd to <hi>deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> but becauſe it pleaſeth them, they think it is not diſpleaſing to God; and that it's no ſin, but a part of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34706:113"/>
their Chriſtian liberty: yea many of them think that by this Doctrine of ſelf-denial, we would deny them the uſe of the mercies of God, and conſequently hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from thankfulneſs for them. And thus they make a Religion of pleaſing the fleſh, which is the deadly enemy to God and Religion. They imagine a <hi>Liberty purcaſed</hi> them to <hi>Pleaſe</hi> it, and fulfill its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and they meaſure out mercies as they pleaſe it, and they would return God a fleſhly thanks for theſe mercies, and offer him a ſacrifice as the Heathens did to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus;</hi> when as the Goſpel knoweth no mercy, but either eternal mercy, or that which is a means to it: nor will it call that a mercy which hath not a tendency to God: nor did Chriſt purchaſe us an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> liberty, but what is <hi>from ſin</hi> or <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and is <hi>for his Service:</hi> He did not <hi>ſuffer in the fleſh</hi> to procure us liberty unprofitably to indulge and pleaſe the fleſh, and to ſtrengthen our enemy, and by uſe to give it the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, when this maſtery is the damnation of moſt of the world. If Chriſtians had learn'd more to deny their ſenſes, they would walk more blameleſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively in the world: if they would keep at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the bait, and when they cannot do ſo, yet ſhut up theſe doors, that it may be at a diſtance from their minds, how ſafely would they walk that now are ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at every creature that is given for their relief! The objects of ſenſe are theſe lower things, ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the objects of faith, that the more we love the one of them, the leſs we ſhall regard the other: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe are always working againſt each other. And as the objects of faith are then moſt ſweet and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with us, when faith is ſet moſt fully upon them; ſo the objects of ſenſe are then moſt powerful to draw us from God, when the doors of ſenſe are ſet wide open, and the appetite let looſe upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:34706:114"/>2. And you may further obſerve that almoſt all the <hi>groſſeſt</hi> ſins in the world, do begin with ſome little li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſenſes, which at firſt we take for a lawful or indifferent thing. The filthieſt whoredoms do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually begin in luſtful looks, and thoughts and ſpeeches, and ſo proceed to laſcivious behaviour, and ſo to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs it ſelf. And the glutton and the drunkard are firſt enſnared by the eye, and then by taſting, and ſo proceed by little and little to exceſs: ſee therefore that you keep as far from the baits of ſenſuality as you can: and lay a command upon your ſenſes to forbear: if you look upon it, you are next to touching it; and if you touch it, you are next to taſting it, and if you taſte it, you are like to let it down; and if you let it down, you are like to venture again and let down more: and all muſt up again or you are loſt. And therefore keep out the firſt beginnings, and think with your ſelves, If ſin be the poyſon of my ſoul, the digeſting of it will be my ruine: and if I cannot digeſt it, why ſhould I let it down? and if I may not let it down, what reaſon have I to be taſting it? and if I ſhould not taſte it, why ſhould I touch it or be medling with it? and if I may not meddle with it, why ſhould I look upon it or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them that would entice me to it? ſo that the Denying of your ſenſes and your Appetite, is the ſure and eaſie way to prevent thoſe dreadful gripes that elſe may follow.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover, if you deny not your ſenſitive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, you will never be acquainted with <hi>heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi> The ſoul cannot move two contrary ways at once, towards earth and towards heaven. When you gaze upon this world and feed your appetites with fleſhly delights, you have no heart nor mind to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights above. It is the ſoul that <hi>retires</hi> from creatures, and ſenſual objects, that is free for God, and ready to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34706:114"/>
entertain the motions of Grace. Not that I would have you turn Hermits and Monks, and forſake the company of men &amp; all worldly buſineſs; No, it is an higher and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler courſe that I propound to you: even in the midſt of the world to live as without the world, &amp; as if there were nothing before you for ſenſuality to ſeed upon: To live ſo fully to God in the world, that you may ſee God in all the creatures, and converſe with him in thoſe ſame objects, by which the ſenſual are turned from him: and to live in the greateſt fulneſs of all things, as if there were nothing but penury <hi>to your fleſh,</hi> and ſeeing God in all, and uſing all for God, and denying <hi>ſelf,</hi> where you have <hi>opportunity</hi> to pleaſe it; this is the moſt noble life on earth. But if you find that you <hi>cannot</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this, and that you <hi>cannot</hi> deny your ſelves the delights of earth, unleſs you withdraw from the ſight of the objects; <hi>do ſo</hi> and ſpare not, ſo far as may conſiſt with your ſerviceableneſs to God and humane Society: But ſtill you ſhall find that whether earthly delights are preſent or abſent, your minds muſt retire from that which doth allure and gratifie the fleſh, if ever you would enjoy Communion with God, and taſte of the delights of an heavenly converſation.</p>
               <p>4. And by pleaſing your ſenſes, you will <hi>increaſe</hi> their <hi>vitious inordinate deſires.</hi> The more you gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them, the more they'l crave: you feed your diſeaſe by yielding to ſuch deſires; but never think to quiet it by contenting it. The more the fleſh hath, the more it would have. The only way to abate the rage of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual deſires, is to deny them, and uſe them conſtantly to that denial. <hi>The ſafeſt food and raiment is that which beſt ſtrengthneth and furniſheth us for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, with the leaſt content and pleaſure to our ſenſual appetites and deſires.</hi> And the ſame I muſt ſay of houſe, and lands, and labours, and friends, and all the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34706:115"/>
Creatures; that's the beſt ſtate of life in which God is ſerved and pleaſed beſt, with the leaſt content and pleaſure to the fleſh. Carnal delights and ſpiritual are ſo contrary; the one ſo droſſie and ſordid, and the other ſo ſublime and pure, that they will not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together; but the delights of the fleſh do corrupt or weaken the ſpiritual delights.</p>
               <p>5. Laſtly Conſider, what a <hi>baſe unmanly</hi> thing it is, for a man to be a ſlave to his ſenſitive appetite. As truly as the horſe was made to be ruled by the rider, and all the bruits to be under man; ſo was the appetite &amp; all the ſenſes made to be ruled by reaſon; &amp; no ſenſe ſhould be pleaſed till Reaſon do conſent: a <hi>beaſt</hi> hath no rule for his eating &amp; drinking but his appetite; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>mans reaſon</hi> is to moderate him: But a <hi>man</hi> hath a better guide than appetite or ſenſe to follow: you ſhould not eat a bit or drink a drop <hi>meerly</hi> becauſe the <hi>appetite</hi> would have it, but <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt be adviſed with, and God muſt give advice to Reaſon. A Swine that will drink whey till he burſt his belly, is blameleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew not the danger, and had not Reaſon to reſtrain him: But a man that hath Reaſon, and yet will eat, and drink, and ſleep, and uſe the Creatures meerly to pleaſe the appetite of his fleſh, is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable: What muſt the light of Reaſon be put out, or put under the cover of ſenſual concupiſcence? muſt a nature that is kin to Angels, be enſlaved to that which is kin to beaſts? Unworthy is he of the honour or glory of a <hi>Saint,</hi> that caſteth away the honour of his <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> and makes himſelf a very beaſt. What elſe doth that wretch, that when he ſeeth a diſh before him that he loves, doth never ask whether it be wholeſom or unwholeſom, bute eats it as an Horſe doth his provender, meerly becauſe his appetite would have it: Yea perhaps though he know, or be told that it is unwholeſom, yet as long as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34706:115"/>
it pleaſes his taſte, he cares not? And what elſe doth that wretch, that when he ſees the cup, muſt needs be taſting: he loves it, and that's reaſon enough with him.

Would one of theſe Gentlemen-gluttons, Drunkards, or Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, or any of our voluptuous Epicures, that muſt needs have that they love, be contented to become a <hi>ſervant to a Beaſt?</hi> would you take a Dog or a Swine for your Maſter, and ſerve them, and obey them, and do what your brutiſh Maſter would have you? why what's the matter that many of our worſhipful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Beaſts do not ſee that they do as bad? What is your own fleſhly ſenſual Appetite any better than that of a Beaſt? A Dog hath as good a <hi>ſcent</hi> as you; and a Swine hath as good a taſte or ſight as you, and alſo as ſtrong a luſt as you.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Self-intereſt, And 1. Pleaſure, And 1. Of the Taſte to be denied.</head>
               <p>2. I Have told you what the <hi>ſelfiſh Diſpoſition</hi> is that muſt be mortified and denied; and now I muſt tell you what is the <hi>ſelfiſh Intereſt</hi> that muſt be denied: Having deſcribed <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> from the <hi>Faculties,</hi> I muſt now deſcribe it by its <hi>Objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſelfiſh Intereſt</hi> conſiſteth in this Trinity of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Pleaſure, Profit, and Honour,</hi> not ſpiritual, but carnal; not heavenly, but worldly Pleaſure, Profit, and Honour: ſometime all theſe are comprehended in the word [<hi>Pleaſure</hi>] alone; and then it is taken more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively, and not only for ſenſual Pleaſure, called voluptuouſneſs, as it is here in this diſtribution. And ſometime all is comprehended in the term [<hi>world</hi>] and <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> in the word [<hi>fleſh</hi>] the <hi>world</hi> being that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot with which the fleſh commits adultery. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15, 16. [<hi>Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world. If any man Love the world, the Love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the Luſt of the fleſh, the Luſt of the eyes, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the world: and the world paſſeth away, and the Luſt thereof: but he that doth th will of God abideth for ever.</hi>] To theſe three heads therefore we ſhall reduce all that we have to ſay of this matter.</p>
               <p>I. The <hi>ſelfiſh, fleſhy Pleaſure</hi> that muſt be denied, conſiſteth in theſe particulars following, which I ſhall but briefly touch, becauſe they are ſo many. 1. One Principal part of <hi>Senſuality</hi> or <hi>Self-intereſt,</hi> conſiſteth in <hi>meats and drinks</hi> to pleaſe the Appetite. So far as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34706:116"/>
theſe are taken to fit us for Gods ſervice, and uſed to his Glory, ſo far they are ſanctified, as before was ſaid: but when they are meerly to pleaſe the appetite, they are offered to an enemy, and are the fuel of luſt. Do you ſee any thing that your Appetite deſireth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meats or drinks, whether for quality or quantity? Take it not, touch it not, meerly upon that account: but enquire whether it tend to the ſtrengthning and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your bodies or minds for the ſervice of God: and if ſo, take it; if not, let alone. If your appetite had rather have Wine than Beer, or ſtrong Beer than ſmall, take it not meerly upon that account: If your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite would fain have one cup more, when nature hath as much as is profitable, deny that appetite. If your appetite would fain be taſting of any thing that is not for your health, deny that appetite. If it would fain have one bit more, when you have as much before as is wholeſom or uſeful to you, deny that appetite: Or elſe you are guilty of <hi>fleſh pleaſing,</hi> and plain Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is it not lawful at a feaſt to taſte of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſh, or eat another bit, when I think that nature needs no more? what perplexities then will you caſt men into, to know juſt how many morſels they may eat?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is gluttony and no beter to take the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God in vain, and ſacrifice them to a devouring throat, which ſhould be uſed only for his ſervice. That which is a mans ultimate end is his God. What would you have plainer than expreſs words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that tell you that <hi>whether you eat or drink it muſt be all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. and that the fleſhly do <hi>make their bellies their Gods?</hi> Phil. 3. 18. And therefore when you have taken as much as ſuiteth with your end, the ſervice and glory of God, you muſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34706:117"/>
not take more for <hi>another</hi> end, the pleaſing of your fleſhly deſires. But for the ſcruples that you mention, about the juſt proportion, we need not be diſquieted with them: For God hath given us ſufficient means to direct us, to know what is for our good, and what is ſuperfluous; and it is our duty in an even and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way to uſe our Reaſon and keep as near the due proportion as we can; and when we know that this is our deſire and endeavour, it were a ſin againſt God to trouble our ſelves with continual or cauſleſs ſcruples or fears, leſt we do exceed or miſs the rule. For what can we do more, than go according to the beſt skill we have, and if for want of skill we ſhould a little miſtake, it is pardoned with the reſt of our daily infirmities; and to trouble and diſtract our ſelves with cauſeleſs fears would more unfit us for Gods ſervice, than ſome degree of miſtake in the proportion would do, and ſo would be as great a ſin as that which we feared. And therefore our way is quietly and comfortably, without diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fears or ſcruples, to do our beſt, and uſe our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> and remember that we have to do with a Father that knows the fleſh is weak when the ſpirit is willing. But yet wilfully to caſt away one cup or one morſel, on the pleaſing of our appetites, when it no way fits us for the ſervice of God, and will do us no other good, this is not <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> but ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But nature knows beſt what's good for it ſelf, and therefore that which it deſireth is to be judged beſt: A Beaſt liveth as healthfully as a man, that obeyeth his appetite only. Is it not lawful to take either meat or drink on this account, that the Appetite is pleaſed with it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some Beaſts would preſently kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in pleaſing their appetites, if man that is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34706:117"/>
did not rule; reſtrain and moderate them. A Swine will burſt himſelf with whey in half an hour. A Beaſt in new after-graſs will ſurfeit, if he be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No Beaſt knows poyſon from food, but would ſoon periſh by it, in obeying his appetite. 2. And yet as a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt hath no Reaſon, ſo he is better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to live without Reaſon, than man is. His appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is not ſo corrupted by ſin as ours is! Original ſin hath depraved and enraged our appetites. And if man had not more uſe for his reaſon than a Beaſt even in ordering his natural actions, God would not have given him reaſon to rule his appetite, and commanded him to uſe it herein. And who knows not that if a man did follow his appetite alone as Beaſts do, he were like to murder himſelf the next day or week, or at leaſt in a very little ſpace? The appetite would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carry us to that for quality, or quantity, or both, that would caſt us into mortal diſeaſes and ſoon make an end of us: And in thoſe diſeaſes, the pleaſing it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually would be certain death. And indeed this is a beaſtly doctrine, that man that hath reaſon to rule his ſenſual inclinations, ſhould lay it by and pleaſe his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite without it like a brute! what more do all Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Drunkards, and Whoremongers, but follow ther fleſhly deſires? And if the <hi>deſires</hi> of the fleſh might be followed, who would not be ſuch as they, in ſome meaſure? That which is <hi>no ſin</hi> in a Beaſt, is a hainous ſin in a man, becauſe man hath reaſon to rule his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and a Beaſt hath none; and therefore is not capable of ſin. And for the body, it's certain that moſt of the diſeaſes in the world are bred and fed by the pleaſing of the appetite; and I think that there's few that are laid in their graves, but this was the cauſe of it, though the ignorant know it not, and the ſenſual are loth to believe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:34706:118"/>And for the queſtion, <hi>whether we may not take any meat or drink purpoſely to pleaſe the appetite?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, yes, as a means to fit us for duty: but not as your chief end. 1. Sometimes, eſpecially in weak bodies, the very Pleaſing of the Appetite doth recreate nature, and further ſtrength. 2. And ſometime the appetite ſhews what ſort of food nature will beſt cloſe with and concoct, ſo that as to the quality if Reaſon have nothing againſt it, it hath ſomething for it; becauſe it is a ſign that it's like to be beſt digeſted, which is moſt deſired. And ſo if you thus far follow the appetite, as a ſign di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting your reaſon what is beſt, and take nothing ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately to pleaſe it, but by pleaſing it to preſerve the health or vigour of your bodies for Gods ſervice; thus you may do and yet be <hi>ſelf-denying:</hi> for this is not a ſenſual ſerving of your fleſh. But if you will 1. Take that which reaſon tells you is unhealthful in quality; 2. Or that which reaſon tells you is either hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or but needleſs and unprofitable in the quantity. 3. Or have maſtered your reaſon ſo far by your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, that you will not believe that is hurtful or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs which you love, but judge what is good for you, meerly by your appetite as a beaſt. 4. Or if you make the pleaſing of your appetite your chief End, in any meat or drink that you take; all this is beſtiality, ſenſuality, carnality, guloſity, and contrary to true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Live therefore like men and not like beaſts; like Chriſtians, and not like Atheiſts and Epicures: He hath as baſe a god as moſt of the vileſt heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that makes his belly his god. He that cannot deny <hi>himſelf</hi> a delicious cup or morſel, would ill deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Kingdom if it were made the bait of ſin. He that will not diſpleaſe his <hi>appetite</hi> in ſo ſmall a matter, would leardly leave his eſtate, or liberty, or life, if he were put
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34706:118"/>
to it, either to ſin, or leave them. As he is a faithful ſervant to God indeed, that will not diſpleaſe him in the ſmalleſt matter; ſo he is moſt fully obedient to the fleſh, that cannot deny it the <hi>leaſt</hi> thing that it deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Though I know that the ſmalneſs of the matter doth often ſo relax the cautelouſneſs even of the godly, that they venture on a ſmall thing who would not on a greater: yet even with them it is ſome aggravation of the ſin, that they cannot bear ſo ſmall a matter as the diſpleaſing of their appetites in ſuch a trifle: and that they cannot deny <hi>themſelves,</hi> where they may do it at ſo cheap a rate; and that they have the hearts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God, and wrong their ſouls for a cup or a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which their appetite hath a mind to. He ſets little by Heaven or the favor of God, that will venture it for ſo ſmall a thing. It hath oft times abated my compaſſion to dying men, when I have known that their death was cauſed by a wilful obeying their ppetite againſt the perſwaſion of their Phyſitian; and be the perſon never ſo dear to me, I feel that there is ſomewhat in nature that inclineth us to conſent to the ſufferings of the <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> or abateth our pity of them in their miſery. It was an aggravation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin that a forbidden morſel could entice him to venture on the wrath of God, and the ruine of himſelf and his poſterity. And it will be a double aggravation of your ſin, if you will take the ſame courſe, and take no warning by him, or by the ſinning world, that hath followed him to this day [when the woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eye, and a tree to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make one wiſe, ſhe took of the fruit thereof and did eat] <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. <hi>Thus entred ſin, and death by ſin.</hi>

2. ANother part of <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> to be denied is, the pleaſing of luſtful venereous inclinations. Not only in avoiding the groſs act of adultery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication it ſelf; but alſo in avoiding the pleaſing of any of the ſenſes by laſcivious actions that lead to this: eſpecially ſome men that are naturally prone to luſt, have need to ſet a work both faith and reaſon, and ſometime call for help from others to quench theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous helliſh flames; For it is a ſin that God hath ſpoken terribly againſt, and that ſo often that intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth mans proneneſs to it, and expreſſeth Gods deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And ſeldom doth <hi>Paul</hi> rebuke it, but he reckoneth up the ſeveral kinds, that he may make it odious, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Gal. 5. 19. <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are, adultery, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, uncleanneſs, laſciviouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> The ſins which he would not have the <hi>Epheſians</hi> name, are, [<hi>fornication and all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither filthineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting, which are not convenient: becauſe no whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor covetous man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt and of God</hi>] ſo Col. 3. 5, 6. [<hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon earth; fornication, uncleanneſs, inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs which is Idolatry; for which things ſake the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobedience</hi>] 1 Cor. 6 9, 10.

[<hi>But chiefly them that walk after the fleſh in the luſt of uncleanneſs—Having eyes full of Adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from ſin.</hi>] Abhor therefore this filthy damnable ſin, which God abhorreth. And to that end pleaſe not the fleſh by any beginnings of it, or any thing that ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of it, or makes way to it. <hi>Chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs</hi> are mentioned by the Apoſtle among the <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the fleſhly luſts, Rom.</hi> 13. 13, 14. <hi>the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the luſts of the fleſh and wantonneſs</hi> was the courſe of the wretched Apoſtates, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 22. And Chriſt himſelf hath told you, that [<hi>he that looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in his heart</hi>] Mat. 5. 28. Suffer not therefore your eye to entice your hearts, by gazing on beauty or any alluring objects; touch them not, come not near them without neceſſity. The fire of luſt doth need no blowing up: but in ſome it needeth all that ever they can do to quench it. Fly therefore from the temptations and occaſions if you would eſcape; caſt not your ſelves upon opportunities of ſinning; Let temptations have as little advantage as you can. A weak Chriſtian may walk more evenly that flyeth from temptations, and keeps at a diſtance from that which would enſnare him, than a ſtrong Chriſtian that ſuffers the bait to be near him. <hi>Davids</hi> woful experience could tell you, what it is to give way to a wandring luſtful eye. When <hi>Joſephs</hi> reſolution may tell you what an advantage it is, to fly away and not to ſtand a parley with temptations. As ever you would ſcape this ſin, this horrible ſoul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſin, keep off from all opportunities of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34706:120"/>
it, and live not with temptations near you: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially take heed that you ſuffer not an unclean ſpirit to poſſeſs your thoughts; but caſt out the firſt impure cogitations with abhorrency. O the daily filthineſs that lodgeth in the thoughts and imaginations of ſome men! They can ſcarce look on a woman of any come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but they have preſently ſome filthy thought. If they attempted actual uncleanneſs, a chaſt perſon may eaſily reject them with deteſtation; but in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way of heart-filthineſs, they will commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with whom they pleaſe, and as many as they pleaſe, and as often as they pleaſe; but the ruine and ſin are only their own. As you love the favour of God, the credit of the Goſpel, and the peace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your own ſouls, deny your ſelves not only the luſts of uncleanneſs, but of unchaſte behaviour, and wanton dalliance, and the filthineſs of your thoughts. For how unfit is that mind to converſe with God, and to be employed in holy ordinances, that cometh but newly from thinking of filthineſs, and feeding on luſt!</p>

               <p>3. ANother part of <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> or ſenſuality to be denied, is, <hi>the uſe of wanton filthy diſcourſe, and of wanton books, and ſongs and ballads, commonly called Love ſongs.</hi> As theſe are the fruits of vain minds that do invent them, ſo do they breed and feed the like vanity in others. Indeed they are the Devils Pſalms and Liturgy, in which he is ſerved with mirth and jollity, by perſons of corrupt and ſenſual minds. They that will not be at the pains to learn a Catechiſm
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34706:120"/>
will learn a wanton ſong or ballad, which one would think ſhould be as hardly learn'd. When we deſire them to learn any thing that is neceſſary to their ſalvation, they tell us that they are no Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and they have weak memories, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn. But they can learn an idle tale, or a filthy ſong, though they are no Scholars, and though their memory be weak. Their weak memories are ſtrong enough to keep any thing that's naught; like a riddle that will not hold the corn, but it will hold the ſtraws and rubbiſh; or like a ſive that will not hold the milk, but it will hold the hairs and filth. And ſo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this ſin than many others, becauſe it is ſtudied for, and laboured for, and therefore is committed purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reſolvedly, and with delight, and not as ſome other ſins which men are tempted to by ſudden paſſions or ſurpriſals! What abundance of children are ſet to School to the Devil, and muſt beſtow many days and hours in learning their leſſons! and when they have learned them, he muſt hear them ſay them over, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more than once a day. As they are at work in their ſhops or fields, they are at it, either by wanton ſongs, or ribbald filthy talk: yea they be not aſhamed to ſing them as they go about the ſtreets: Mark this, you that are the ſervants of Chriſt! will you evermore be aſhamed of your Maſter or of his holy ſervice! will you be aſhamed to confeſs him in the open ſtreets, or to be heard at Prayer, or reading, or ſinging the Praiſe of God in your houſes; when the Devils ſervants are train'd up in their very childhood to ſing his Pſalms in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſtreets, and publickly to ſerve him without fear or ſhame! May not a man conjecture by their Education, what trade they are intended for? They that ſerve an apprenticeſhip to a trade, are ſure intended to live upon it. One would think by the talk and the ſongs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34706:121"/>
of our children in the ſtreets, that the parents had bound them apprentices to a brothelhouſe, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that their trade ſhould be fornication, whoredom, and all uncleanneſs! why elſe do they learn the art of talking of it, but in order to the art of practiſing it? Sure I am, they are the apprentices of Satan: &amp; a doleful caſe it is to think on; that as the Turks do take the children of Chriſtians, and breed them up to be their Army of Janizaries, to fight againſt Chriſtians as their ſtouteſt Souldiers, when they come to age; ſo the Devil and their own parents do take the children that in baptiſm were dedicatedonce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt telleth us <hi>that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> and therefore they cannot in reaſon blame us, if we judge of their hearts by their tongues: for though the tongue be too often better than the heart, it is ſeldom worſe. And ſurely if many of our wretched neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may be judged of by this rule of Chriſt, we muſt needs conclude that they have luſtful, filthy adulterous hearts? what elſe can we think of them when their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and ſongs are filthy, but that their hearts are filthy? Chriſt hath warranted us to conclude, that rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpeeches come from the abundance of a rotten heart.

               <p>4. ANother part of <hi>ſenſuality</hi> to be denied, is, <hi>Idle and worldly talk, which moſt men make their daily recreation.</hi> It is not to be made light of that Chriſt himſelf hath told you, that <hi>for every idle word men ſhall give account in the day of Judgment,</hi> Matth. 12. 36, 37. ſuch an account as that they ſhall be charged on you as ſins; and if they be not repented of, and pardoned through the blood of Chriſt, they will be your condemnation as well as greater ſins. By idle words is meant, not only all wicked, &amp; all lying words, which are vain in a high degree and worſe; but alſo uſeleſs unprofitable ſpeeches that tend not to any good, and which you have no call to ſpeak, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 9. And that which the Apoſtle calls [<hi>fooliſh talking</hi>] Eph. 5. 4. When that Chriſtian wiſdom is left out that ſhould guide and ſeaſon our ſpeech, and direct it to ſome good end: eſpecially when by vain jeſting men will make fools of themſelves to pleaſe others: or when they lay by Chriſtian gravity, and by jeſting affect to become ridiculous, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 4. much more when men jeſt with holy things, and ſpeak unreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, contemptuouſly or ſcornfully of the matters of God, which is impiety in an high degree: The ſame may be ſaid of proud boaſting words, and of multitude of words, even when the matter is good, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of words unſeaſonable and unprofitable; as alſo of raſh unconſidered words, that tend to ſtir up ſtrife and paſſion: as alſo cenſuring, back-biting, reproach, flattery, diſſembling, and many the like: but the thing that I principally ſpeak of now, is the pleaſing of a mans

                  <hi>ſelf</hi> by a courſe of idle unprofitable talk. And alas how common is this ſin! Not only the fooli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are guilty of it, but perſons of judgment, and gravity, and reputation. How many may you come in company with, before you ſhall have any edifying Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that tends to miniſter grace to the hearers? vanity is become the common breath of the greateſt part. What the better can any man be for their diſcourſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by taking warning by them, to avoid the vanity which we hear them guilty of? Even antient perſons with whom the words of wiſdom ſhould be found, (<hi>Job</hi> 12. 12.) and who ſhould be examples unto youth, are yet given up to idle talk; and an old ſtory is more ſavoury with them than heavenly diſcourſe: even Parents and Maſters that ſhould be examples to their families, will in their hearing multiply idle words, as if they would teach them to be vain as they are; when alas, the ſouls of thoſe about them have need of other manner of diſcourſe; and it's another task that God hath ſet them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. &amp; 11. 18, 19. Whence is it that Children learn a courſe of idle fooli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

For one word of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſalvation, that their families hear from moſt of them, they hear an hundred, yea a thouſand of the world and of unprofitable things. Had God but the Tithe of their words, we ſhould account them very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And they that cannot ſpare him the tithe of their words, I doubt do not allow him the Tithe of their affections, and would not allow him the tithe of their increaſe, if they could tell how to keep it. Not but that with ſome perſons, that are called to much worldly buſineſs, more than ten parts of their daily ſpeeches may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34706:123"/>
are ſanctified, and not unprofitable: and alſo they are glad to redeem what time they can for ſpeeches of an higher and more excellent ſubject.</p>
               <p>And the commonneſs of this ſin of idle talk, yea with many that we hope are godly, doth make me think that it's thought to be a ſmaller matter than it is; and I doubt this conceit is it that makes it to be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. And therefore I ſhall here give you ſome of the aggravations of this ſin, that you may hereafter judge of it as it is, and not be encouraged in it by falſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
               <p>A cuſtom of vain words, is a ſign of a vain and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mind: were the heart but full of better things, the tongue would be employed in better ſpeeches. Either the head, or heart, or both is empty and vain, in that meaſure as the tongue is vain, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 3. [<hi>A dream cometh through the multitude of buſineſs, and a fools voice is known by multitude of words</hi>] Eccleſ. 10. 12. [<hi>The words of a wiſe mans mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will ſwallow up himſelf</hi>] Eccleſ. 10. 14. [<hi>A fool is full of words</hi>] And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the tongue of the juſt and the heart of the wicked, Prov. 10. 20. [<hi>The tongue of the juſt is as choice ſilver: the heart of the wickd is little worth</hi>] See Pro. 17. 27, 28. Pſal. 37. 30, 31. [<hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom, and his tongue talketh of judgement</hi>] and whence is this [<hi>The Law of his God is in his heart: none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide.</hi>] It is a ſign that a man hath little <hi>feeling</hi> of the greatneſs of his own ſin, of the greatneſs of Gods Love in Chriſt, of the greatneſs of the joy that is ſet before him, of the greatneſs of duty that lyeth on him, when he can ſpend ſo much of his time in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of meer vanity. You cannot get a dying man, or a man that's taken up with any great important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to jeſt and prate with you of idle matters. It's
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34706:124"/>
only alienated idle minds that can give way to a courſe of idle words: nay it is a ſign that Conſcience is not ſo tender as it ought to be, when men can knowingly go on in a courſe of ſin: Doth not Conſcience ask you what you are doing, and whether this diſcourſe do tend to edification, and the cheriſhing of grace? What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences have you that look no better after your tongues, but will let them wander ſo long after vanity, before they call them to account? Do you remember Gods preſence, and withall his holineſs and jealouſie? Can you talk ſo idly and God ſtand by, and hear every word, and put down all? How can you be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly fearleſs of his preſence?</p>
               <p>2. The tongue of man is a noble member, called <hi>our glory,</hi> Pſal. 30. 12. &amp; 57. 8. given us for the Praiſe of our great Creator, and for other high and noble ends. And ſhould it be abaſed and abuſed to idleneſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? You will not take the cloaths that adorn your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cloath a Maukin, or ſweep the Oven, or wipe your diſhes with: and why ſhould you uſe your tongues to filth or baſe unprofitable things, that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you for the nobleſt uſes in the world, even the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, the edifying of your brethren, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of ſin, and your own ſalvation?</p>
               <p>3. Conſider, what abundance of great and needful employment you have for your tongues, and then tell me, whether you ſhould ſpare them to idleneſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? O what work hath that little member to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form! what matters have you to mind and talk of? what tranſcendent ſubjects? what matter of higheſt excellency, and greateſt neceſſity? you have a life of ſin to look back upon and lament: you have many a ſin to confeſs to others: you need much help againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and for the ſtrengthning and exerciſe of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: what need to make ſure of your title to ſalvation?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34706:124"/>
and to prepare for death, and to get ready the graces that you muſt uſe in you laſt neceſſities? and yet have you words to ſpare for vanity? What abundance of poor ſouls about you are ignorant, hard-hearted, ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, covetous, empty of grace, in a ſtate of death, and need all that ever you can do for their recovery, and all too little: and yet can you find in your heart to talk with them of vain unprofitable things? Alas Sirs, moſt of the perſons about you are within a ſtep of death, and going to the bar of God, and want nothing but one ſtroak of death to make them paſt help, and ſend them to damnation: And can you find in your hearts to talk idly with ſuch men? O cruel unmerciful people, that regard no more your neighbours miſeries! If you came to them at the point of death, or if their houſes were on fire, would you ſit down and tell them an old tale, or talk of the weather, or this trifle, or that? what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity would this be, and inſenſibility of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns caſe? And will you do ſo in a caſe ten thouſand fold greater? Can you find in your heart to ſtand jeſting &amp; prating with a poor unregenerate man that is within a ſtep of Hell? Have you not more need to call to him to look about him in time, and to remember eternity, and to turn and live? If you ſee but the nakedneſs of the poor, or the ſores of a Cripple, it ſhould move you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: And will not mens ignorance and ungodlineſs move you? Their miſeries cry aloud to you for pity, though themſelves are ſilent, [O help to ſave us from ſin and hell, as you have the hearts of men] and yet will you ſtop your ears, and fall a prating and jeſting with them? you rob them of the means that God hath commanded you to uſe for their recovery. God hath commanded, that [<hi>the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one another—Col.</hi> 3. 16. yea that you <hi>daily exhort one
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34706:125"/>
another while it is called to day, leſt any be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Nay you have the great myſteries of the Goſpel to diſcourſe of with the Godly; the glorious things of everlaſting life to make mention of to one another, yea you have the high praiſes of God to advance in the world, and all his bleſſed attributes to magnifie, and all his glorious works to praiſe, &amp; all the experiences of your own ſouls to lay open, &amp; his many &amp; great mercies towards you to admire and thankfully conteſs. And yet have you leaſure for idle talk? For <hi>number</hi> of objects, you have God and all his works in heaven and earth (that are revealed) to talk of; you have all his providences, all his judgments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all his mercies, and all his word: And is not this field large enough for your tongue to walk in, but you muſt ſeek out more work in vanity it ſelf? For Greatneſs, you have the greateſt things in all the world to mind and talk of: For neceſſity, you have the matters of your own and other mens ſalvation to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of: For excellency, you have God and his Image, and works, and ways, and heaven it ſelf to talk of: For delightfulneſs, you have the ſweeteſt objects in the world, even goodneſs it ſelf, ſalvation, &amp; the way to it, to be the matter of your diſcourſe. And leſt one thing ſhould weary you, you have a world of variety to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your ſpeeches on; even God, and all his works, and word, and ways before-mentioned. And is it not a ſhame to talk of vanity, yea to go ſeek for recreation in vanity, while all theſe ſtand by, and offer themſelves to the ſubjects of your wiſe, and fruitful, and delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt diſcourſe: Conſider whether this be wiſe or equal dealing.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover a courſe of idle talk, is a thief that robs us of our precious time. And he that knows what God is, or what duty is, or what his ſoul is, or what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34706:125"/>
everlaſting joy or torment is, will know that time is a commodity of greater worth than ſo contemptuouſly to be caſt away for nothing. O remember when thou art next in idle talk, Did God make thee for this? doth he continue thee among the living, and keep thee out of hell, and yet prolongeth thy days, that thou ſhouldeſt waſte thy time in idleneſs and vanity? Haſt thou ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins to mortifie, and ſo many other works to do, which heaven or hell lyeth on, and ſo ſhort and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a time to do them in, and yet haſt thou leaſure for idle talk?</p>
               <p>5. Moreover, this ſin is ſo much the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a rare or ſeldom ſin, but frequently committed and continued in. It is not like the ſin of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> that though greater, yet was but once committed: But this is made great by the number and continuance. How many thouſand idle words have you been guilty of in your time?</p>
               <p>6. And it is a ſin that tendeth to greater ſins. For idle words are the ordinary paſſage to backbiting, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, and contentious words, [Prov. 10. 19. <hi>In the multitude of words there wanteth not ſin, but he that refraineth his lips is wiſe</hi>] Thus <hi>a fools lips enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contention,</hi> Prov. 18. 6. [<hi>His mouth is his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and his lips are the ſnare of his ſoul</hi>] Eccleſ. 5. 7. [<hi>In the multitude of dreams, and many words, are divers vanities: but fear thou God</hi>] Eccles. 10. 12, 13. [<hi>The Lips of a fool will ſwallow up himſelf; the beginning of the words of his mouth is fooliſhneſs, and the end of his talk is madneſs</hi>] Idleneſs is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but worſe than Ideneſs is the end.</p>
               <p>7. It is a ſin that habituateth the ſpeaker and hearers both to vanity: uſe makes us diſpoſed to that which we uſe. It will grow ſtrange to you to ſpeak of better things when you are uſed to vanity. And the uſe of hearing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34706:126"/>
you, is an exceeding wrong to the ſouls of the hearers. And a ſmall matter confirmeth ſuch bad hearts as the moſt have, in the vanity that they are in. You caſt water on their graces and your own, if there were any. If any of them had better thoughts, your idle talk doth drown and divert them.</p>
               <p>8. And it is a ſin that hindreth abundance of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that holy conference might bring. It's a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thriving courſe for Chriſtians to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting experiences, and declaring the excellencies and loving-kindneſs of God, and exciting one another: and this you lay by and turn to vanity. Nay perhaps ſome other that is in the company may be purpoſed to ſet upon ſuch profitable diſcourſe, and your idle talk doth hinder them, and ſuppreſs the exerciſe of Gods graces for your good. At leaſt there may be much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter in them, that wants but vent, &amp; if you would but begin, it may be poured forth as precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Many wiſe and able men are too backward in beginning edifying diſcourſe, that yet are exceeding fruitful when you have once ſet them a work. And idle talk is the hinderer of this.</p>
               <p>9. And it is a very fruitleſs ſin. You offend God for nothing. What get you by an hours idle talk? or what have you to tempt you to it?</p>
               <p>10. And it is a wilful ſin, and uſually accompanied with much Impenitency, which makes it much the greater. Men uſe not to lament it, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to account for it, and ſay, what have I done? but go on in it as if it were no ſin.</p>
               <p>And now you ſee the greatneſs of the ſin, I beſeech you make more conſcience of it than you have done. And that you may avoid it, obſerve theſe brief Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Falſe Stories, Romances, and other tempting Books.</head>
               <p>5. ANother point of ſenſuality to be denied, is, <hi>The reading or hearing of falſe and tempting Books, and thoſe that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>only tend to pleaſe an idle fancy, and not to edifie.</hi> Such as are Romances, and other feigned histories of that nature, with Books of tales, and jeſts, and fooliſh complements, with which the world ſo much aboundeth, that there's few but may have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to this Library of the Devil. Abundance of old feigned Stories, and new Romances are in the hands, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of Children, and idle Gentlemen, &amp; filthy luſtful Gallants, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ty perſons that ſavour not greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but have ſpirits ſutable to ſuch gawds as theſe. But if they were only toyes, I ſhould ſay the leſs; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen by long obſervation the miſchief of them, I deſire you to note it in theſe few particulars.</p>
               <p>1. They enſnare us in a world of guilt, by drawing us to the neglect of thoſe many, thoſe great and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things that all of us have to mind and ſtudy. O for a man or woman, that is under a load of ſin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured of pardon and ſalvation, that is near to death, and unready to die, to be ſeen with a ſtory or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance in their hand! what a groſs incongruity is this? It's fitter the Book of God ſhould be in your hand: It's that which you muſt live by and be judged by. There's much that you are yet ignorant of, which you have more need to be acquainted with than Fables. Are you not ignorant of an hundred truths that you ſhould know, that God hath revealed to further your ſalvation: and can you lay them all by to read Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances?
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34706:128"/>
Are you travelling towards another world with a Play-book in your hand? O that you did but know what greater matters you have to mind and to to do? Do all that you have to do firſt, that's of a thouſand times more worth, and weight, and need; and then come to me, and I will anſwer your Objections, <hi>What harm is it to read a Play-book?</hi> Firſt, Quench the fire of ſin and wrath that is kindled in your ſouls; and ſee that you underſtand the Laws of God, and read over thoſe profitable Treatiſes of Divines, that the world aboundeth with, and your ſouls more need, and then tell me, what mind or time you have for Fables.</p>
               <p>2. Moreover it dangerouſly bewitcheth and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the minds of young and empty people, to read theſe books. Nature doth ſo cloſe with them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, that they preſently breed an inordinacy of affection, and ſteal away the heart from God, and his holy Word, and ways. It cannot be that the Love and delights of the heart can be let out on ſuch traſh as theſe, and not be taken off from God and the moſt needful things. That is the moſt dangerous thing to the ſoul, that works it ſelf deepeſt into the affections, and is moſt delighted in inſtead of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may well conclude that Play-books, and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Fables and Romances, and ſuch like, are the very poyſon of youth, the prevention of grace, the fuel of wantonneſs and luſt, and the food and work of empty, vicious, graceleſs perſons; and it's great pity that they be not baniſhed out of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover they rob men of much precious time, in which much better work might be done: much precious knowledge might be got while they are exerciſed in theſe Fables. Thoſe hours muſt be anſwered for: And there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not the worſt of you but then had rather be able to ſay, [<hi>I ſpent thoſe days and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34706:128"/>
hours in prayer, and meditating on the life to come, and reading the Law and Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Books which his Servants wrote for my inſtruction</hi>] than to ſay, [<hi>I ſpent it in reading Love-books, and Tale-books, and Play-books</hi>] All theſe conſidered, I beſeech you throw away theſe peſtilent vanities, and take them not in your hands, nor ſuffer them in the hands of your children, or in your houſes, but burn them as you would do a conjuring-book, &amp; as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 19. that ſo they may do no miſchief to any others.</p>

               <p>6. ANother part of <hi>fleſhly intereſt</hi> to be denied, is, <hi>vain ſports and paſtimes, and all unneceſſary Recreations.</hi> For this alſo is one of the harlots that the fleſh is defiled with.</p>
               <p>Recreations are lawful and uſeful if thus qualified. 1. If the matter of them be not forbidden: For there's no ſporting with ſin. 2. If we have an holy Chriſtian end in them, that is, to fit our bodies and minds for the ſervice of God: and do not do it principally to pleaſe the fleſh. If without diſſembling our hearts can ſay, <hi>I would not meddle with this recreation, If I thought I could have my body and mind as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If we uſe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations without need, as to the ſaid End; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them longer than they are uſeful to that End; and ſo do not caſt away any of our precious time on them in vain. 4. If they be not uncivil, exceſſively coſtly, cruel, or accompanied with the like unlawful
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34706:129"/>
accidents. 5. If they contain not more probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to vice than to vertue: as to Covetouſneſs, Luſt, Paſſion, Prophaneneſs, &amp;c. 6. If they are not like to be more <hi>hurtful</hi> to the ſouls of <hi>others that joyn with us, than profitable to us.</hi> 7. If they be not like to do more hurt by offending any that are weak or diſlike them, than good to us that uſe them. 8. If they be uſed ſeaſonably, in a time that they hinder not greater du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 9. If we do it not in company unfit for us to joyn with. 10. Eſpecially if we make a right choice of Recreations, and when divers are before us, we take the beſt; that which is leaſt offenſive, leaſt expenſive of time and coſt, and which beſt furthereth the health of our bodies, with the ſmalleſt inconvenience.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rules being obſerved, Recreations are as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as ſleep, or food, or Phyſick.</p>
               <p>But, alas, they are made another thing by the ſenſual, ungodly world. Sometime they muſt ſport themſelves with ſin it ſelf, in the abuſe of Gods Name, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Creatures: Tipling and prophane Courſes are ſome mens chiefeſt recreations: And though the Law of the Land forbid moſt of their ſports, and the Law of God commandeth them to obey all the Laws of men that are not againſt the Law of God, yet this is a matter of nothing to their conſciences. And let the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> be never ſo lawful, they make all impious by a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>end.</hi> It's none of their intention to ſtrengthen and fit themſelves for the ſervice of God, and an holy, righteous life, by their recreations: but it's meerly becauſe their fancy and fleſh is pleaſed in them: Even as the Drunkard, Glutton, or Whoremonger, that have no higher end than Pleaſure, and can give you no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account why they feed their luſt, but becauſe they Love it, and it's their delight: juſt ſo is it with ſportful youths and gallants. How few of many thouſands can
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34706:129"/>
you come to that are at Cards, Dice, or Dancing, that can truly ſay, they would not do any of this but for God, and to fit themſelves for his ſervice? Did you ever know ſuch a one? I believe in ſome better kind of Recreations you may know ſome ſuch; but ſcarce in theſe. Alas this ſin is not of ſo ſmall a ſtature as too many impenitent ſouls imagine. It's one of the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins of the Land, and I believe one that brought down the vengeance of the late war upon us: and yet it is not half cured after all. The Gentry of <hi>England</hi> that ſhould have been educated in Learning and the fear of God, and been the examples of the people in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and holineſs, have been lamentably brutified and drowned in this (with other parts of groſs) ſenſuality. Inſtead of ſerious Prayer, and holy Conference, and inſtructing of their Families, Cards and Dice took up the time, and curſing and ſwearing were the common attendants of them: and their Childrenn and Servants learned of them, and took the ſame courſe. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed more time in theſe, and in hunting, hawking, bowling, cocking, Stage-playes, and ſuch like, than they did in the ſerious worſhipping of God; yea than they did in the works of any lawful calling: For indeed they lived as without a calling, doing very little elſe but riſe, &amp; dreſs them &amp; complement thoſe about them, and drink, and eat, and ſo to their ſports at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and then to eating and drinking again, and ſo to their vain diſcourſes, and ſo to their beds again: and this was the ordinary courſe of their lives: <hi>They ſate down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play,</hi> Exod. 32. 6. 1 Cor. 10. 7. In the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> did they live, <hi>Pride, fulneſs of bread, and idleneſs,</hi> Ezek. 16. 49. They trod the ſteps of him that Chriſt had told them, did cry in vain for a drop of water to cool his tongue, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 19. gallantly clothed, and fared deliciouſly every
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34706:130"/>
day (or ſumptuouſly.) Their whole life almoſt was but a ſacrifice to their fleſh, to their belly, their fancies and their luſts: Till God broke in upon them in his wrath, and found them another employment, and ſhortned their ſtore, and diminiſhed their full eſtates and brought them into contempt and trouble; and yet how common is the ſin to this day? Iſa. 5. 11, 12, 13. [<hi>Wo unto them that riſe up early in the morning that they may follow ſtrong drink that continue till night, till wine inflame them; and the Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe, and Wine are in their feaſts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, nor conſider the operation of his hands: therefore my people are gone into captivity, becauſe they have no knowledge, and their honourable men are famiſhed, and their multitude dried up with thirſt: therefore Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure, and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoyceth ſhall deſcend into it,</hi>] Amos 6. 1, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Woe to them that are at eaſe in Zion,—that ſtretch themſelves on their Couches, and eat the Lambs out of the flock, and the Calves out of the ſtall, that chant to the ſound of the Viol, and invent to themſelves inſtruments of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick—that drink Wine in Bowls, and anoint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joſeph.]</p>
               <p>The precious time that this ſort of men lay out in their needleſs ſports and recreations, is more worth than all their eſtates; and if their ſin had no other ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation but this, I confeſs I ſhould take it for a far greater ſin than any that thieves are uſually hang'd for at the Gallows! what! for men that have received more from God than others, and are obliged more to him, and are capable of doing him more eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for ſuch as theſe to live like Epicures! and when
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34706:130"/>
they are haſtening to an endleſs life, to waſte the moſt yea almoſt all this precious time in Fleſh-pleaſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality! I think it is one of the greateſt ſins in the world! And no wonder that Chriſt made ſuch choice of ſuch an one as theſe, to acquaint them who they are that ſhall be damned, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. And if Converſion make not a wonderful change on them, they muſt look undoubtedly to ſpeed as he; and to have the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the cauſe of their miſery [<hi>Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented</hi>] Luke 16. 25.</p>
               <p>Abundance of them beſtowed more upon Hawks and Dogs, than would have maintained many poor fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: And play for large ſumms at Cards, and Dice, and Cockings, and Horſe-races. Covetouſneſs, &amp; Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and Paſſion, and Swearing, and Curſing, were the virtues that their ſports did exerciſe: and others muſt be their companions in the ſame impieties, that they periſh not alone. Unmerciful and oppreſſing they are in their very ſports, treading down the hedges and corn of poor men, in following their game, and never making them reparation for their loſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at them if they do but complain. No fitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for them, than the moſt impious Swearers, and ribbald filthy Speakers, and the like: who was offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, they cared not; but made it an additional part of their ſport, to caſt a ſcorn at thoſe that durſt not and would not be as bad as they. And all this is, when they have variety of civil, cheap, inoffenſive recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at hand, which might better have fitted a Chriſtians end.</p>
               <p>And the youthful part of the vulgar, are, in their degree, of the ſame ſpirit with thoſe Epicures, and of the like practice, as far as their eſtates and leiſure will
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34706:131"/>
allow them: Witneſs the eagerneſs of the rabble in following after Wakes, &amp; May-games, Cock-fightings, Dancing, Dice, and Cards, and ſuch like exerciſes. And more pleaſure they have in theſe than in Prayer, or Gods Praiſes, or holy Inſtructions, or Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As much as the moſt ſordid Whoremonger or Drunkard is enſlaved in his proper fleſh-pleaſing ſin, ſo much are our voluptuous youth and others addicted to gaming, ſports, and paſtimes, and enſlaved to this fleſh-pleaſing ſin of theirs. Ah poor people! Doth time run on ſo faſt, and are you haſting to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bar of God: and do you want <hi>paſtime?</hi> Is your work ſo great, and your time ſo ſhort and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and yet muſt you hunt about for <hi>paſtime?</hi> Muſt it go with you in heaven or hell for ever as you ſpend this haſty inch of time, and yet have you days or hours to ſpare for needleſs recreation? O what a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing is ſin, that can ſo bereave men of the uſe of reaſon, in that one thing for which their reaſon was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them! Yea we can ſcarce convince theſe poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſouls that they do amiſs; but they ſay, [<hi>What harm is there in cards or dice, or hunting, or bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſuch like rerceations? How ſhall we live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recreation? Anſw.</hi> But is there no harm in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fleſh-pleaſing, and in the loſs of precious time, to men that are ready to ſtep into eternity? O that ever men ſhould make ſuch a queſtion! Sppoſe your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations were the lawfulleſt in the world, in their own nature? Can there be a greater villany, than to ſet your hearts on them, and make a God of them, and caſt away pretious hours on them, in uſing them needleſly? Recreations are your phyſick, or your ſauce; &amp; therefore muſt not become your food, nor made a meal of They are only as whetting to the mower, which muſt never be uſed but when there's need: To ſpend half the day in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34706:131"/>
needleſs whetting, deſerves no wages. O did you know but what your work, and time, and what's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, you would be better husbands; and then you might ſo contrive your buſineſs, as to loſe no time in recreation. For either your calling puts you on the labour of the mind, as Students, or of the body, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring men. If ſtudy be your calling, you need no exerciſe of recreation but for your bodies, for variety of ſtudies is the beſt or ſufficient for the mind: And two hours walking is bodily recreation enough in a day, for almoſt any ſtudent that is in a capacity to labour: And if you be labouring men, or your calling lie in bodily motion, then you need no recreation for your bodies beſides your Callings, but only for your mind: And if you love God and his Word, what better Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for your minds can you deviſe, than thinking of the Love of God in Chriſt, and meditating on the Law of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. and calling upon him, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in his praiſes, and the Communion of his Saints? Is not <hi>a day in his Courts, better than a thouſand any where elſe?</hi> The Spirit of God by <hi>David</hi> ſaid ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 10. But alas it is this unmortified <hi>fleſh,</hi> and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing ſenſuality that blindeth you, that you cannot ſee the truth: or elſe all this would be as plain to you as the high way.</p>

               <p>7. ANother ſenſual vice to be denied, is, <hi>A love to vain ungodly Company.</hi> This is a ſin that I think none but utterly graceleſs men are much carried away with. For the Godly are all <hi>taught of God to love one another,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 9. and to <hi>delight in the Saints as the moſt excellent on Earth,</hi> Pſal. 16. 2, 3. and to take pleaſure in their communion: and to look on the ungodly with a differencing belief, as fore-ſeeing their everlaſting miſery, if they return not: ſo that it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly that I have now to ſpeak to. Some fall in love with the company of good fellows, as they call them: and ſome love the company of harlots, &amp; ſome of game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and moſt of merry pleaſant companions, and men that are of their own diſpoſition: and the love of ſuch company, ticeth them to the frequent committing of the ſin. They would not go to gaming but for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: They would not go to the Alehouſe but for company: and when they are there, perhaps they will ſwear, and drink, and mock at godlineſs for company. But are you willing alſo to go to hell for company? Is the company of thoſe ſinners, better than the company of God, and his favour? were it not better to be that while with him in prayer, or about his work? If you love a tipling fellow better than God, ſpeak out, and ſay ſo plainly, and never diſſemble any more, nor ſay that you love God above all, or that you are Chriſtians. Have you more delight in the Company of them that would entice to ſin, than in the Company of the godly that would draw you from it? This is a moſt certain mark, that yet you are the children of the Devil, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34706:132"/>
in a ſtate of damnation. It is not poſſible for a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified child of God to do ſo. See the deſcription of the man that ſhall be ſaved in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. [<hi>In his eyes a vile perſon is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord</hi>] Birds of a feather will flock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The company which you love, ſhews what courſes you love, and what you are. You delight in the company of thoſe that Chriſt will judge as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and how then will he judge of you? You delight moſt in the company of thoſe notorious fools, that know not the plaineſt and needfulleſt things in all the world: that know not that God is better than the world, and holineſs than ſin; and know not the way of their own ſalvation. If you are content to have the company of the ungodly for ever, you may take it here. But if you would not dwell in hell with them, do not go on in ſin with them. O when you ſhall ſee thoſe very men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by death, and haled at the bar of God, and caſt into damnation, then you will have no mind of their company? Then, O that you could but ſay, that you were none of them. Like a man that is enticed by thieves to joyn with them: but when the hue and cry overtakes them, and they are apprehended, how glad would he be then to be from among them! I tell you ſinners, if grace recover you, you ſhall wiſh in the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of your hearts that you had never ſeen the faces of thoſe men that enticed you to evil: but if grace do not recover you, you ſhall wiſh ten thouſand times in Hell that you had never ſeen their faces: but then your wiſhes will be in vain. In the name of God bethink your ſelves, whether your companions can bear you out at laſt, and ſave you from the wrath of God, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant your Salvation? Nay whether they can ſave themſelves; Alas you know they cannot: God ſaith, <hi>If you live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. and if
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34706:133"/>
theſe men ſay (as the Devil to <hi>Eve) you ſhall not die,</hi> are they able think you to make it good? What can they overcome the God of heaven? O Sirs, away as you love your ſouls, from ſuch mad and miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as this.</p>

               <p>8. ANother ſenſual delight to be denied, is, <hi>Pleaſing accommodations,</hi> in <hi>Buildings, Rooms, Walks, Gardens, Grounds, Cattle, and ſuch like.</hi> It's lawful to be thus accommodated, and lawful to deſire and uſe ſuch accommodations, with ſuch cautions as I gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about recreations. 1. If you do not with <hi>Ahab</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be accommodated by that which is another mans, coveting your neighbours poſſeſſions, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully procuring it. 2. If you be not at too much coſt upon ſuch things, expending that upon them that ſhould be laid out on greater and better things. 3. But eſpecially, if you deſire ſuch accommodations for right ends, ſincerely referring all to Gods honour, and deſiring them not principally to pleaſe your own fancy, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, but for the enabling you the better and more chearfully to ſerve God. Nothing but God may be loved for it ſelf. When the Pleaſing of the fleſh and fancy is the utmoſt thing we look at in any of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, they are wicked and idolatrous. Our houſes therefore muſt be fitted to Neceſſary uſes, and not to inordinate delights. Our Gardens, Orchards, Walks, and ſuch like muſt be firſt ſuited to Neceſſity, and then to ſo much Delight as is uſeful to us for the promoting
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34706:133"/>
of our holineſs; but not to any uſeleſs tempting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>But worldlings and ſenſual perſons will not be tied to theſe Chriſtian Rules. Alas, it's the furtheſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from their minds, to make Heaven the End of all their earthly poſſeſſions and accommodations. They may hypocritically talk of God and of ſerving him by their eſtates: but really it is the pleaſing of a fleſhly mind that is the thing which they intend. They have more delight in their houſes, and gardens, and lands, and cattle, than in God and the hopes of life everlaſting. They deſire fair houſes that they may be thought to be no mean perſons in the world, and that they may pleaſe their humours that run after creatures for felicity and content. I would deſire ſuch men to conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p>1. All theſe are but the baits of Satan to delight you and entangle your deſires, and find you work in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them, while you neglect far greater matters. Can you have while to look ſo much after ſuperfluities and delights in the world, when you have Neceſſaries yet to look after for your ſouls? Have you not greater things to mind than theſe, which theſe occaſion you to neglect?</p>
               <p>2. Do you really find that they conduce to your main end, even to make you more holy, or more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God? Nay do not your own Conſciences tell you, that they hinder you and croſs thoſe ends? And yet will go againſt your experience?</p>
               <p>3. If you are humble conſcionable Chriſtians, you feel cauſe enough already to lament, that your love to God and delight in him, is no more: And yet are you preparing ſnares for your ſouls, to ſteal away that little remnant of your affections, which you ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for God?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:34706:134"/>4. If you have any ſpark of Grace in you, you know that the fleſh and the world are your dangerous enemies; and you know that the way that the world doth undo men, is by ticing them to over-value it &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-love it; &amp; that thoſe that love it moſt, are deepeſt in a ſtate of condemnation; and the leſs men love it, the leſs they are hurt or endangered by it. And do you not know that you are liker to over-love a ſumptuous houſe, with gardens, orchards, and ſuch accommodations, than a mean habitation? Why ſhould you be ſuch enemies to your own ſalvation, as to make temptations for your ſelves? Have you not temptations enough already? Do you deal with thoſe you have ſo well, and overcome them ſo eaſily and ſo conſtantly, as that you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deſire more? If Chriſt your General <hi>ſend</hi> you upon a hotter ſervice, you may go on with courage, and expect his help: But if you will ſo glory in your own ſtrength, as to run into the hotter battle, and call for more and ſtronger enemies, it's eaſie to conjecture, how you will come off. If you are Chriſtians, know your ſelves, you know that in the meaneſt ſtate, you are too prone to over-love the world, and that under all Gods medicinal afflictions, you cannot be ſo wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, as you ought! Are you not daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to groan and complain to God under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of too much Love of the world, and too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in worldly things? If this be not your caſe, I ſee not how you can have any ſincerity of ſaving grace. And if it <hi>be</hi> your caſe, will you be ſo ſotti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, as to complain daily to God of your ſin, &amp; in the mean time to love and cheriſh it? to groan under your diſeaſe, and wilfully eat and drink that which you know doth increaſe it? What will you think of a man that will pray to God to ſave him from uncleanneſs, and yet will dwell no where but in a Brothel-houſe?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34706:134"/>
What do you better, that muſt needs have the world in the lovelieſt garb, and muſt needs have houſe, and grounds, and all things in that plight, as are fitteſt to entice the heart; and then will complain to God, that you over-love the world, and love him too little? To your ſhame you may ſpeak it, when you do it ſo will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and cheriſh the ſin which you thus complain of. If God call you into a ſtate of fulneſs and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, watch the more narrowly over your affections, and your practices: and uſe no more of the creatures for your <hi>ſelf,</hi> if you have ten thouſand pound a year, than if you had but an hundred: but do not ſeek and long for temptations: With not for danger, unleſs you were better able to paſs through it.</p>
               <p>4. Remember when your fancies deſire ſuch things, not only that it is an enemy that deſireth them, and to pleaſe your enemy is not ſafe for you: but alſo that it's the way that moſt have periſhed by, to have the world before them in too pleaſing and lovely a condition. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> caſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 30. that for glorying in his pompous buildings, was turned as a mad man among the Beaſts. Remember the rich mans ſad example, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. &amp; 16. and think whether it be ſafe to imitate them? If men muſt periſh for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the creature more than God, methinks you ſhould long moſt for that condition, in which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appeareth leaſt lovely, or is leaſt likely to ſteal your love from God, and in which you may love him and enjoy him moſt.</p>
               <p>5. And bethink you how unſuitable it is to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to deſire ſumptuous buildings, and enticing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations to your fleſh. Have you not taken God for your portion, and Heaven for your home? and are you not ſtrangers and pilgrims here? and is not God and everlaſting glory ſufficient for you? You profeſs
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34706:135"/>
all this, if you profeſs to be Chriſtians: and if you be not, you ſhould not profeſs that you are. And what! do you begin to repent of your choice? muſt you yet turn to the pomp and vanity of the world again? and will you quit your hopes of God and glory? Ah poor ſouls! what little need have you of ſuch great matters on earth? you have but a little to do with them! and but a little while to ſtay with them! and will not a mean habitation, and ſhorter accommodations ſerve you for ſo ſhort a time? Stay but a while, and your ſouls ſhall have houſe-room enough in heaven or hell, and a narrow grave of ſeven foot long will ſerve your bodies till the reſurrection. And cannot you make ſhift with an ordinary habitation and with ſmall &amp; common things till then? Naked you came into the world, and naked you muſt go out: make not then ſo great a ſtir in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and undreſſing, and feathering a neſt, that will be ſo ſoon pulled down.</p>
               <p>6. And it is a dangerous ſign that your time on earth is ſhort, when you have moſt content in outward things. I have told you once in another Diſcourſe (which I have ſince ſeen more of) that people that much ſet their hearts upon any earthly thing, do uſe to be ſnatcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death juſt when they have attained it, before they can have the comfort of poſſeſſing it. Juſt when their houſes are built; juſt when their debts are paid, and their eſtates cleared and ſetled; juſt when they have ſuch or ſuch a thing which they earneſtly deſired, then they are gone; as the fool in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. And you do but prepare for a double ſorrow, when you muſt leave all theſe. Do you think that the more you love or delight in any thing below, you will
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34706:135"/>
not be the lother to leave it? Do not think only of the preſent content, but ask your hearts; ſhall I be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger to part with a ſumptuous houſe, and commodious gardens, walks, and fields, than with a mean habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leſs pleaſing things? O how it tears the very heart of the worldling, when he ſees that he muſt for ever leave all that which he ſet ſo much by, and which hath coſt him ſo dear? If he ſet his heart but on a Horſe, or any creature, the loſs of it is a double ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Much more will he be wounded with the loſs of all, that his mind was ſo much ſet upon.</p>
               <p>Remember therefore Chriſtians, that as theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations are mercies which you muſt faithfully uſe, when they are caſt upon you; ſo they are ſnares not to be ſought after; and matter for your <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> to neglect. As they are Proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill its deſires, you muſt not know them. You have <hi>a building of God</hi> to mind and look after; <hi>a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</hi> and it better beſeemeth you, <hi>earneſtly to groan, to be</hi> ſo <hi>cloathed, that mortality may be ſwallowed up of life,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 4. Poſſeſs preſent things as not poſſeſſing them; and uſe them as not abuſing them, for the form of them paſſeth away.</p>

               <p>9. ANother Object of ſenſuality to be denied, is, <hi>Apparel, as deſired for this Carnal end.</hi> Though cloathing be a conſequent of ſin, yet now to man in this neceſſity it is a mercy and a duty, ſo be it we uſe it with ſuch cautions as in the foreſaid caſes is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. 1. That our end be the furniſhing our frail bodies for the work of God, and the preſerving them from that ſhame, &amp; cold, &amp; hurt which would unfit us for his ſervice. 2. And that our apparel be fitted as near as we can to theſe ends; that is, to healthful warmth, and comelineſs: and that under the name of comelineſs we do not fit them to carnal ends, to ſet us out to the eyes of men, and to raiſe their eſteem of our worth or comelineſs of perſon: but be ſatisfied if we avoid the ſhame of nakedneſs and contemptible unhandſomneſs. 3. To which end we ſhould ſee that we affect not to riſe above thoſe of our own rank, nor equal our ſelves in apparel with our ſuperiors: but go with the lower ſort of our condition. 4. And that we imitate not the faſhions of light and vain perſons; but keep company in our attire with the moſt wiſe and ſober, and grave perſons about us. 5. And that we beſtow no needleſs coſt upon our attire, becauſe we muſt be accountable for all that God entruſteth us with. 6. And that we change not cauſleſly. Thus muſt apparel be uſed: the cheapeſt that is warm and comely, according to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the graveſt perſons of our rank, and the loweſt of them.</p>
               <p>But, alas, this childiſh trifle the Devil hath made a bait of ſenſuality. The care that people have about it,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34706:136"/>
the coſt they beſtow on ſuperfluities, their deſire to go with the higheſt of their rank, to ſay nothing of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and imodeſt faſhions, do ſhew to what end it is that they uſe it. I deſire theſe kind of people to think of theſe few things that I ſhall ſay to them.</p>
               <p>1. This vanity of apparel, is the certain effect of the vanity of your mind: you openly proclaim your ſelves to be perſons of a fooliſh, childiſh temper, and poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: Among the moſt ungodly people, they that have but common wiſdom, do look upon this vanity of inordinate apparel as quite below them. And therefore it's commonly taken to be the ſpecial ſin of women, and children, and light-headed, ſilly empty men. Thoſe that have no inward worth to commend them to the world, are ſilly ſouls indeed, if they think any wiſe folks will take a ſilken coat inſtead of it? It is wiſdom, and holineſs and righteouſneſs that are the ornaments of man; and that's his beauty which beautifieth his ſoul. And do you think that among wiſe men fine clothes will go inſtead of wiſdom, or vertue, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? You may put as fine clothes upon a fool as upon a wiſe man: and will that think you make him paſs for wiſe? When a gallant came into the Shop of <hi>Apelles</hi> that famous painter, to have his picture drawn, as long as he ſtood ſilent, the Apprentices carried themſelves reverently to him becauſe he ſhone in gold and ſilver lace: but when he began to talk, they perceived that he was a fool, and they left their reverence, and all fell a laughing at him. When people ſee you in an extraordinary garb, you draw their obſervation towards you, and <hi>one</hi> asketh, <hi>Who is yonder that is ſo fine?</hi> and <hi>another asks, Who is yonder?</hi> and when they perceive that you are more witleſs and worthleſs than other folks, they will but laugh at you and deſpiſe you. Exceſs in apparel, is the very <hi>ſign</hi> of folly, that is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34706:137"/>
hang'd out to tell the world what you are, as a <hi>Sign</hi> at an Inn-door acquaints the paſſenger that there he may have entertainment. You draw folks to ſuſpect that all is not well with you where there needs all this ado. It's ſure a ſorry houſe that nedeth many props: and a diſeaſed body that needeth ſo much medicining: And a deformed face that needeth painting: And what is gaudy attire to the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch as painting is to the face? If I ſee artificial teeth in your heads, I muſt think that you want the Natural ones that were better. If I perceive your breath to be ſtill ſweetn'd by art, I ſhall ſuſpect that it would ſtink without it. And if I ſee people inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately careful of their apparel, I muſt needs ſuſpect that there is ſome ſpecial cauſe for it: all is not well where all this care and curioſity is neceſſary. And what is the deformity that you would hide by this? Is it that of your mind? Why you bewray it more? you tell all that ſee you, that you are empty, ſilly ſouls, as plainly as a Morrice-dancer, or a Stage-player doth tell folks what he is by his attire. Is it the deformities of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that you would hide this way! I confeſs that's the beſt excuſe that can be made for this exceſs: For apparel will do more to hide the deformities of the body than of the mind. But the <hi>ſhape</hi> of your clothes is fitteſt for this (ſo far it is fit to be attempted:) For the <hi>bravery</hi> of them will do little, but draw mens obſervation the more upon your infirmity. If you ſay that you <hi>have</hi> no ſuch extraordinary neceſſity; then I muſt ſay that you do your ſelves wrong to tice people to ſuſpect it.</p>
               <p>2. And alſo you make an open oſtentation of Pride, or Luſt, or both, to all that look upon you. In other caſes you are careful to <hi>hide</hi> your ſin, and take it for an hainous injury if you be but openly told of it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: How comes it then to paſs that you are here
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34706:137"/>
ſo forward your ſelves to make it known, that you muſt carry the <hi>ſigns</hi> of it open in the world! Is it not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to Rogues and Thieves, that have been burnt in the hand or forehead, or muſt ride about with a paper pin'd on their backs declaring their crimes to all that ſee them; So that every one may ſee, <hi>yonder is a thief,</hi> and <hi>yonder is a perjured man?</hi> And is it not much like it for you to carry the <hi>badge</hi> of pride or luſt abroad with you in the open ſtreets and meetings? Why do you deſire to be ſo fine, or neat, or exceſſive comely? Is it not to draw the eyes and obſervations of men upon you? and to what end? Is it not to be thought either Rich, or beautiful, or of an handſom perſon? And to what end deſire you theſe thoughts of men? Do you not know that this deſire is Pride it ſelf? You muſt needs be ſome body; and fain you would be obſerved and valued; and fain you would be noted to be of the beſt or higheſt rank, that you can expect to be reckoned of: And what is this but Pride? And I hope you know that Pride is the Devils ſin, the firſt born of all iniquity; and that which the God of heaven abhors! ſo that it were more credit for you in the eyes of men of wiſdom to proclaim your ſelves beggars, ſots, or ideots, than to proclaim your pride. And too oft it ſhews a pang of <hi>luſt</hi> as well as pride: eſpecially in young perſons: and few are ſo forward to this ſin as they. This bravery and fineneſs is but the fruit of a procacious mind; it's plainly a wooing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring act: It is not for nothing that they would fain be eyed, and be thought comely or fair in others eyes! ſomewhat they want: you may conjecture what! And even married people, if they love their credit, ſhould take heed by ſuch means of drawing ſuſpicion upon themſelves. Sirs, if you are guilty of <hi>folly, pride</hi> and <hi>luſt,</hi> your beſt way is to ſeek of God an effectual cure,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34706:138"/>
and to uſe ſuch means as <hi>tends</hi> to cure it; and not ſuch as tend to cheriſh it, and increaſe it; as certainly fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in clothing doth: But if you will not cure it, for ſhame conceal it, and do not tell every one that ſees you what is in your heart: what would you think of one that ſhould go up and down the ſtreet, telling all that meet him, [I am a thief, or I am a fornicator] would you not think that he were a compound of foolery and knavery? And how little do you come ſhort of this that write upon your own backs, [<hi>Folly, Pride and Luſt</hi>] or tell them by your apparel, [<hi>Take notice of me: I am fooliſh, Proud, and luſtful?</hi>]</p>
               <p>3. And if you be ſo ſilly as to think that bravery is a means of <hi>honour,</hi> you ſhould withall conſider that it is but a ſhameful <hi>begging</hi> of honour from thoſe that look upon you, when you ſhew them not any thing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or deſerve it. Honour muſt be forced by deſert and worth, and not come by begging; for that is no honour that's given to the undeſerving. It is but the ſhadow of deſert, and will conſtantly follow it among the wiſe and good, but never go without it. Your bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very doth ſo openly ſhew your <hi>deſire</hi> of eſteem and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that it plainly tells all wiſe men that you are the leſs worthy of it. For the more a man deſireth eſteem, the leſs he deſerves it. And you tell the world by your attire that you deſire it: even as plainly and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly as if you ſhould ſay to folks in the ſtreets [<hi>I pray think well of me, and take me for an handſome come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon, and for one that is above the common ſort.</hi>] Would you not laugh at one that ſhould make ſuch a requeſt to you? Why, what do you leſs, when by your attire you beg eſtimation from them? And for what I pray you, ſhould we eſteem you? Is it for your cloaths? Why I can put a ſilver lace upon a mawkin, or a ſilken coat on a poſt, or on an Aſs. Is it for your come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34706:138"/>
bodies? why a wicked <hi>Abſolon</hi> was beautiful, and the baſeſt harlots have had as much of this as you: A comely body, or beautiful face doth oft <hi>betray</hi> the ſoul, but never <hi>ſaveth</hi> it from hell. And your bodies <hi>are</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the comelier for your dreſs, whatever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may <hi>ſeem.</hi> Is it for your vertues that you would be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Why <hi>pride</hi> is the greateſt enemy to vertue, and as great a deformity to the foul as the Pox is to the body: And he that will think you ever the <hi>honeſter</hi> for a new ſute, or a ſilver lace, doth as little know what honeſty is as your ſelves. For ſhame therefore give over beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>eſteem,</hi> at leaſt by ſuch a means as inviteth all wiſe men to deny your ſuit; But either let honour come without begging for, or be without it.</p>
               <p>4. Conſider alſo that exceſs of Apparel doth quite contradict the End that proud perſons do intend it for. I confeſs it doth ſometime enſnare a fool, and ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the deſires of the luſtful: But it ſeldom attaineth the ends of the proud: For their deſire is to be the <hi>highlier</hi> eſteemed, and almoſt all men do think the <hi>meanlier</hi> of them. Wiſe men have more wit, than to think the Taylor can make a <hi>wiſe</hi> man or woman, or an <hi>honeſt</hi> man or woman, or an <hi>handſom</hi> man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Good men pity them, and lament their folly and vice, and wiſh them wiſdom and humility. In the eyes of a wiſe and gracious man, a poor ſelf-denying, humble, patient, heavenly Chriſtian, is worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of theſe painted poſts and peacocks. And it ſo falls out that the ungodly themſelves do fruſtrate the proud perſons expectations. For as covetous men do not like covetouſneſs in another, becauſe they would get moſt themſelves, ſo Proud perſons like not Pride in others, becauſe they would not have any to vie with them, or overtop them, and be look'd upon and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before them. None look with ſuch ſcorn and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34706:139"/>
envy at your bravery, as thoſe that are as ſilly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as your ſelves, who cannot endure that you ſhould excel them in vanity; ſo that good and bad do ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſe or pity you for that which you think ſhould procure your eſteem.</p>
               <p>5. Conſider alſo, that Apparel is the fruit or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of ſin, that laid man naked and open unto ſhame: and is it fit you ſhould be proud of that which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to hide your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ame; and which ſhould humble you by minding you of the ſin that cauſed the neceſſity of it?</p>
               <p>6. And you ſhould bethink you better than moſt Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants do, what account you mean to make to God for the money that you lay out in exceſs of bravery, will it think you be a good and comfortable account, to ſay, [<hi>Lord, I laid out ſo much to feed and manifeſt my Pride and Luſt</hi>] when ſuch abundance of pious and charitable uſes did call for all that you could ſpare? Many a Lord, and Knight, &amp; Gallant beſtoweth more in one ſuit of cloaths, or in one ſet of hangings, or in the ſuperfluous dreſs of a Daughter, than would keep a family of poor people for a 12 moneth, or than would maintain a poor Scholar for higher ſervice than ever they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will do; And many a poor boy or girl goeth without a Bible, or any good books, that they may lay out all they have on their backs.</p>
               <p>7. Laſtly, I beſeech you do not forget what it is that you are ſo carefully a doing; and what thoſe bodies are that you ſo adorn, and are ſo proud of, and ſet out to the ſight of the world in ſuch bravery. Do you not know your ſelves? Is it not a lump of warm and thick clay, that you would have men obſerve and honour? When the ſoul that you neglect is once gone from them, hey will be ſet out then in another garb That little ſpace of earth that muſt receive them, muſt be defiled with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34706:139"/>
their filthineſs and corruption: and the deareſt of your friends will have no more of your company, nor one ſmell or ſight of you more if they can chooſe: There is not a carrion in the ditch that is loathſomer than that gallant painted corpſe will be a little after death. And what are you in the mean time? Even bags of filth, and living graves, in which the carkaſſes of your fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures are daily buried and corrupt. There is ſcarce a day with moſt of you, but ſome part of a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs is buried in your bodies, in which as in a filthy grave, they lie and corrupt, and part of them turneth into your ſubſtance, and the reſt is caſt out into filthy excrements. And thus you walk like painted ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres: Your fine clothes are the adorned covers of filth, and flegm, and dung. If you did but ſee what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the proudeſt Gallant, you would ſay the inſide did much differ from the outſide. It may be an hundred worms are crawling in the bowels of that beautiful damſel or adorned fool that ſet out themſelves to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for their bravery. If a little of the filth within do but turn to the ſcab or the ſmall pox, you ſhall ſee what a piece it was that was wont to have all that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trimming.</p>
               <p>Away then with theſe vanities, and be not children all your days; nay be not proud of that which your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren themſelves can ſpare! Be aſhamed that ever you have been guilty of ſo much dotage, as to think that people ſhould honour you for a borrowed bravery, which you put off at night, and on in the morning! O poor deluded duſt and worms-meat! lay by your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and know your ſelves: Look after that which may procure you deſerved and perpetual eſteem, and ſee that you make ſure of the honour that is of God. Away with deceitful ornamens and gawds, &amp; look after the inward real worth. Grace is not ſet out and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34706:140"/>
by fine clothes, but clouded, wronged and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by exceſs. It is the inward glory that is the real glory. The Image of God muſt needs be the chiefeſt beauty of man: Let that ſhine forth in the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your lives, &amp; you will be honourable indeed. <hi>Peter</hi> telleth you of ſuch a converſation of women as may <hi>win their unbelieving husbands without the word:</hi> And what is it? [<hi>while they behold your chaſt converſation coupled with fear: whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward adorning, of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel: but the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a meek and quiet ſpirit which is in the ſight of God of great price. For after this manner in old time, the holy women that truſted in God adorned themſelves, being in ſubjection to their husbands,</hi> 1 Per. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

ſenſuality. And becauſe that Idleneſs and Sloth is ſo great and common a ſin, &amp; yet made ſo light of by the moſt, I ſhall briefly tell you the miſchiefs of it, and the Reaſons that ſhould make you hate it.</p>
               <p>1. Slothfulneſs doth <hi>contradict the very end of our creation and preſervation, and the frame of our nature;</hi> and ſo provoketh God to cut us off and caſt us as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs into the fire. Who dare ſo wrong the wiſdom of God, as to ſay or think that he made us to do nothing! If a man make an houſe, it is to dwell in; if he make a watch, it is to tell him the hour of the day, and every thing is for its proper uſe: And is man made to be idle? what man, that is the nobleſt inferior creature, and an active creature, fitted for work, and the higheſt work! ſhall he be idle? Juſtly may God then hew him down as a dead and withered tree, and ſuffer him no more to cumber his ground.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Slothfulneſs is a ſin that loſeth the precious gifts of God.</hi> Our faculties and our members are his gifts and talents, which he hath committed to us to uſe for his ſervice; ſo are our goods and all that we have: and ſhall we hide them in a napkin, or idly neglect to uſe them? O what abundance of excellent mercies lie uſeleſs and idle, becauſe you are idle that ſhould uſe them? Every hour that you loſe in idleneſs, what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculties, and large proviſions are all laid by? As much as in you lieth, you make the whole creation to <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>work</hi> in vain. Why ſhould the Sun ſhine an hour or minute for you in vain? Why ſhould the Earth bear you an hour in vain? why ſhould the ſprings and rivers run for you an hour in vain? why ſhould the air refreſh you an hour in vain? why ſhould your pulſe beat one ſtroke in vain? or your lungs once breathe a breath in vain? ſhall all be at work for <hi>you</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:34706:141"/>
to further <hi>your</hi> work, and will you think that idleneſs is no ſin?</p>
               <p>3. Moreover, <hi>Lazineſs and ſloth is a ſin that loſeth you much precious time.</hi> All the time is loſt that you are idle in. Yea when you are at work, if you do it ſlothfully, you are loſing much of your time. A dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perſon will go further, and do more in an hour than the lazy fleſh-pleaſer will do in two. When the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is praying, or reading, and working in his calling, he is but loſing half his time, which diligence would redeem. And is our time ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ort and precious, and yet is idleneſs an excuſable ſin? what, loiter ſo near night! ſo near eternity, when we have but a little time to work! O work while it is day, for the night is coming when none can work. Were it but for this, that ſloth doth ſteal so much of our time, I muſt think it no better than an hainous Thievery.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>And by this means we rob our ſelves.</hi> We might be getting ſome good all the time that we are idle; or doubly advantage our ſelves, if ſloth did not keep us company in our work. <hi>The ſlothful is brother to him that is a great waſter,</hi> Pro. 18. 9. ſlothfulneſs is ſelf-murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; men die while they lie ſtill and wiſh. It's a ſin that famiſheth ſoul and body, <hi>Prov. 21. 25. The deſire of the ſlothful killeth him, becauſe his hands refuſe to labour.</hi> It's the common cauſe of beggery and want: and what comfort can you have under ſuch afflictions which you bring upon your ſelves? If you want food or rayment, if your wives and children are in want, how can you think that God ſhould take care of you and afford you relief, when you bring this on your ſelves by pleaſing your fleſh which is his enemy? If a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier get hurt by trucking with the enemy, he may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look that his General ſhould hang him than relieve him. And how ſhould good men be moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34706:141"/>
you? If God do improveri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h you, and you come to want by innocency or a righteous cauſe, they muſt needs be ready to relieve you: But if Sloth, or Pride, or Gluttony, or Drunkenneſs bring you to it, till you repent, I ſee not how they ſhould relieve you, at leaſt any further than to keep you alive. For if you are ſet topleaſe your fleſh by idleneſs, muſt I joyn with you to pleaſe it by ſuch ſupplies as ſhall cheri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> you in your ſin? No, one fleſh-pleaſer is enough for one man! If you will pleaſe it either by Idleneſs or by Luxury your ſelves, expect not that others ſhould pleaſe it by your relief, and make proviſion for your ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If I may not make proviſion for my own fleſh to ſatisfie its luſts, neither muſt I do it for another.</p>
               <p>But that's not the worſt, <hi>ſlothfulneſs is the common cauſe of mens damnation;</hi> when they ſee a temptation and danger before them, ſlothfulneſs hindereth them from reſiſting it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When Heaven is offered them, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs makes them ſit ſtill and loſe it. They muſt <hi>Run,</hi> and <hi>Strive,</hi> and <hi>Fight,</hi> and <hi>Conquer,</hi> and theſe are not works for a <hi>ſlothful</hi> perſon; eſpecially when they muſt be continued to the death. So that it's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that moſt men in the world are undone ſoul and body, by the ſin of ſloth.</p>
               <p>5. And <hi>by this you rob others as well as your ſelves:</hi> You owe the world the fruit of your labours: You rob the <hi>ſouls</hi> of men to whom you ſhould do good. You rob the <hi>Church</hi> that ſhould be bettered by you: You rob the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of which you are a member, and ſhould have benefit by you. You <hi>owe</hi> your labours to Church and Commonwealth and the ſouls of men, and will you not pay ſo great a debt? You deſerve no room in the Church or Commonwealth, but to be cut off as an unprofitable member, if you bring no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them. They ſay the Bees will not ſuffer a drone
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34706:142"/>
in the Hive. Nay, if you be hired ſervants, you plainly rob your Maſters if you are ſlothful, as much as if you ſtole their money or goods. If you buy an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſheep of a man, and he let you have but fourſcore, doth he not rob or cheat you? And if a man buy a years or a days labour of you, and you let him have but half a years labour, or half a days labour, becauſe of your ſloth, do you not defraud or rob him of the other half? So that the idle are thieves to themſelves, to the Church and the ſouls of men, to the Commonwealth and thoſe that they are related to; even to their wives and children, for whom they ſhould provide due main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance by their labour.</p>
               <p>6. And <hi>you are injurious to the honeſt poor, in that you diſable your ſelves from relieving them:</hi> when God commandeth you to <hi>work with your hands,</hi> not only for your ſelves, but <hi>that you may have to give to them that need,</hi> Eph. 4. 28. What if all men ſhould do as you do, how would the poor be maintained, and the Church and Commonwealth ſerved?</p>
               <p>7. Yea worſt of all, <hi>you are guilty of robbing God himſelf.</hi> It is him that you owe your labours to, and the improvement of all the talents which he lendeth you: And idleneſs is unſaithfulneſs to the God of Heaven that ſetteth you on work: Even in working for men, you muſt do it ultimately for God, <hi>Col. 3. 22, 23. [Not with eye-ſervice as men-pleaſers, but in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, fearing God: and whatſoever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord you ſhall receive the reward of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, for ye ſerve the Lord: But he that doth wrong, ſhall receive for the wrong which he hath done.]</hi> If it be an offence to wrong man, what is it to wrong God? and if you may not be ſlothful in the work of a man, what a crime is it to be ſlothful in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34706:142"/>
work of the God of Heaven? The greater your Maſter is, the more hainous it is to be lazy in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Remember the curſe on them that do the work of the Lord deceitfully, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 10. All work that you have to do, is the work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>8. And conſider, <hi>That the Idle forfeit the protection and proviſion of God; even their daily bread.</hi> For muſt he ſupport and feed you to do nothing? His own rule is that <hi>if any man will not work neither ſhould he eat,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 10. And if he may not eat, we may not relieve him.</p>
               <p>9. And if idleneſs had not been an hainous ſin, the Apoſtle would never have commanded us <hi>to avoid the company of ſuch,</hi> as if they were unfit to converſe with Chriſtians, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>10. Conſider <hi>what abundance of work we have to do, and of how great importance!</hi> O what a deal have we to do for our poor ſouls, and for many about us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all our bodily employment in the world! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, every man that knows why he is a man, and what it is, in an inch of time to work for everlaſting, ſhould never find an hour for idleneſs in his life, but ſtill cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>How ſhort and ſwift is time, and how great and long is the work!</hi> A man that had all the Town on fire about his ears, or a man that were fighting for his life, or a man that were in a leaking veſſel ready to ſink under him, might better be lazy, than a man that is at work for an endleſs life.</p>
               <p>11. Moreover, <hi>Idleneſs is a baſe kind of vice:</hi> It is the imitation of a block or a ſtone that lieth ſtill, when that which hath life will be in action.</p>
               <p>12. And it is uſually <hi>a Continual ſin,</hi> or at leaſt makes up a great part of the lives of many that are addicted to it: A drunkard will not <hi>always</hi> be drunk; and a lyar
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34706:143"/>
will not <hi>always</hi> be lying; But a ſlothful perſon will be moſt <hi>commonly</hi> ſlothful.</p>
               <p>And, to conclude, lay all this together, and think what a reckoning a ſlothful perſon is like to have, that by his ſin is alway running behind-hand, and will have the neglected time, and means, and mercies of almoſt all his life to anſwer for.</p>
               <p>And now you ſee the greatneſs of this ſin abhor it, and awake from it. You have much to do, and ſouls to ſave; and the eaſe of your fleſh and fleſhly minds is one thing that muſt be denied, before it can be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. The ſlothful is ſtill craving, <hi>yet a little ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and yet a little eaſe: and he is ſtill upon delays, even when he is convinced of his danger and his duty: when he knows that he muſt turn or die, yet he is delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and putting off till another time: And ſo the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and garden of the ſluggard, are grown over with nettles and weeds: And he hath ſcarce a duty to do but there is a thorny hedge or a Lion in the way. Deny this eaſe, and be up and doing.</p>
               <p>And there are three ſorts of perſons that have eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial need of this advice. The firſt is thoſe that by the flegmatick diſtemper of their bodies, are more prone to heavineſs and ſlothfulneſs than others. The more ſuch are diſpoſed to it, the more ſhould they watch againſt it, and reſiſt it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort are Beggars, and other idle wandring perſons, that make a Trade of Idleneſs, and worſe: ſuch alſo as Ballad-ſingers, Stage-players, Juglers, Cheaters, and moſt Ale-ſellers that ſpend their time in tipling and talking with their gueſts; and other idle perſons, that will ſpend whole hours together in twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and talking idly, and of other mens matters. All theſe live in a courſe of fleſh-pleaſing, and of hainous ſin:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34706:143"/>
and muſt better learn to deny the fleſh, before they can be the true Diſciples of Chriſt. This is not the life that God called you into his vineyard for, no nor that he ſent you into the world for, to waſte your ſhort and precious days in potting, and piping, and prating, and other ways of idleneſs; Nor ſhould ſuch be ſuffered in a Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The third ſort, are too many Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, that think becauſe they have enough to maintain them, that it is lawful to live an idle life. Or if they do any thing that's profitable to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is rather as a recreation, than as a Calling: Now and then an hour in the midſt of their peaſures and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the moſt. It is a miſerable life that this ſort of perſons live: even in the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> (which cry for the vengeance of <hi>Sodom</hi>) <hi>Pride, Fulneſs of bread, and Idleneſs.</hi> As if theſe perſons that have moſt wages ſhould do God the leaſt work: and they that have moſt of his ſtock in their hands ſhould make the leaſt uſe of it; or thoſe that are obliged to God by the greateſt mercies, ſhould do leaſt in manifeſting their thankfulneſs or fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity! what incongruities are theſe? Who ſhould be ſo buſie and laborious, as thoſe that have the greateſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make, and thoſe that are to be exemplary to the reſt? Truly Gentlemen, I muſt deal plainly with you, that Idleneſs and the expreſſion of it among the moſt of you, in hunting, and hawking, and bowling, and complementing, and viſitations, and vain diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and exceſs of drinking, and tedious meals, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the common ſhame of your order; and muſt be corrected before your honour or conſciences can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: And I am ſo far from any partiality in this cenſure of you, that I muſt tell you, if I knew one<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my own profeſſion that were guilty but of the tenth part of ſome of your Idleneſs, I would do my beſt to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34706:144"/>
rid the Church of him, and have him caſt out among the ſenſual. And you may do well ſometime to ask your ſelves, whence it comes to paſs that Negligent idle Miniſters muſt be ſequeſtred and turned out of all, and Idle Magiſtrates let alone? One reaſon is becauſe Gentlemen can better cheap compel a Miniſter to pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs than themſelves, and puniſh Miniſters for negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence than themſelves. And another reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all faithful Miniſters themſelves in love to the Church are the ſeekers of this ſeverity: but Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are few of them ſo ſelf-denying &amp; forward to ſeek for ſuch ſeverity againſt the idle and negligent of their own order. But doth not your calling require dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as well as ours? It is a brutiſh, ungrateful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of any man to think that he may live idly, becauſe he is rich. The richeſt men in the world are bound to as diligent labour as the pooreſt, though not in the ſame kind. And yet I can perceive that moſt of the poor are even of the ſame mind; and when they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hardeſt, they are idle in Gods account, becauſe they would live idly if they could. It is no thanks to them that they labour; for it is <hi>neceſſity</hi> that doth <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain</hi> them. I can hear them ſay, that they would not work, at leaſt but little, if they had but money enough. God will judge theſe as Idle perſons, becauſe he takes the will for the deed. You muſt labour in obedience to God, and work as his ſervants, and that with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and delight, and deny that <hi>ſelf</hi> and fleſh that would have eaſe, if ever you would have the heavenly reward.</p>

ANother ſelfiſh Intereſt to be denied, is <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in proſperity, and ſeeing our ſelves thrive, and our deſigns ſucceed for worldly things.</hi> The <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of theſe things doth not ſo much delight, as the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> of our endeavours to attain them. The very thoughts of Proſpering in our undertakings, and of being in a thriving courſe, and likely to reach ſome higher things which are in our eye and hope, is the greateſt part of the content of Worldlings. Men think that the world can do no more for them than it can, and is ſweeter than it is; and therefore they are very eager in ſeeking it, and pleaſe themſelves much with the thoughts of their ſuppoſed felicity: But when they have reach'd the matter of their deſires, they find it is not the thing they took it for. But in the mean time they feed themſelves with fancies and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and think that though this doth not content them, which they have attained, yet ſuch or ſuch a thing more would do it: and when they have that, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>more</hi> would do; and ſtill though they come ſhort of the felicity they expect, yet it pleaſeth them that they think they are in the <hi>way</hi> to it, and ſee their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſeem to proſper. The poor man that hath a deſire but to reach to a competency, doth pleaſe himſelf much when he perceiveth that he is fair for it.

See that <hi>you do not promiſe your ſelves too much in the creature;</hi> feed not your carnal fancies with vain hopes. Think not too highly of a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtate. Judge not of it as it accommodateth the fleſh, but as it either helps or hinders you for God and heaven: And then you'l perceive that it is an heavy charge and burden to the beſt, if not a dangerous temptation. O if you knew but how dear the moſt do pay for their proſperity, you would pity them, and have lower thoughts of proſperity.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Seek not after proſperity too eagerly. Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> and then if other things be caſt in or added to you, take them thankfully, but with <hi>ſelf-ſuſpicion</hi> and holy fear; but run not after them. <hi>Labour not for the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, but for that which endureth to everlaſting life, Joh.</hi> 6. 27. and then take your daily bread as from your Fathers proviſion.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Children and Relations how to be denied.</head>
               <p>12. ANother <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> intereſt is in <hi>friends and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and other near and dear Relations,</hi> and this is alſo to be <hi>denied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that you ſhould imitate thoſe unnatural Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that tell us that Fathers and Mothers, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Husbands, &amp; Princes, &amp; Wives, and Subjects, are all Carnal Relations that muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned any further than Juſtice binds us to a retribution to parents or others that have been at pains or coſt upon us: No, this is worſe than heatheniſh impiety, and not only againſt the fifth Commandment, but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the plaineſt paſſages through the Scripture: To be without natural affection, and diſobedient to parents, is part of the Character of thoſe impious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of whom <hi>Paul</hi> propheſied, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3. If Chriſtian ſervants have Heathens to their Maſters, they muſt not therefore caſt off the yoak, but count them worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſphemed: And if they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Maſters, they muſt not deſpiſe them becauſe they are brethren, but the rather do them ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are faithful. This is the doctrine of the Goſpel, which ſtabliſheth and not diſſolveth our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: and <hi>if any teach otherwiſe, he is proud, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, but doating about queſtions and ſtrifes of words,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. Believing wives muſt ſtay even with unbelieving husbands, and win them to Chriſt by an eminent ſubjection, chaſtity, modeſty, and piety, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13, 14. And the like may be ſaid of other relations. God calls
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34706:147"/>
us not as Popiſh votaries conceive, to renounce and ſeparate from our natural or other near relations, on pretence of being devoted to him. The words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. are abuſed by them. It's true, we muſt <hi>know no man after the fleſh,</hi> no not Chriſt himſelf; that is, as eſteeming them principally for carnal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies (as perſonage, greatneſs, birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) or to carnal advantages and ends, or preferring the body and common relations before the inward ſpiritual worth and ſpiritual relations: And thus we muſt not know either parents, or children, or husbands, or wives after the fleſh; nor ſhould a Chriſtian know or do any thing after the fleſh as a Carnal man: but yet as we ſtill continue our Relation to Chriſt as his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Servants, and Members, and Redeemed ones, for all that we know him not after the fleſh; ſo muſt we continue our Relations to others, and be faithful in the duties of thoſe Relations, and this after the Spirit and for God.</p>
               <p>So that by this you may ſee, that it is our Relations, carnally conſidered that are the fleſhly intereſt which we muſt not know; that is, As they are look'd upon as any part of that <hi>ſelf,</hi> or of the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of that <hi>ſelf</hi> which would be its own End and God, and which is oppoſite to God, or not ſubordinate to him. To look upon your children more as <hi>yours</hi> than as <hi>God's,</hi> is a carnal ſelfiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>thought: To love them inordinately, and more becauſe they are your own, than becauſe they are Gods, and to love your own intereſt in your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more than Gods intereſt in them, is a ſelfiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding them after the fleſh: Grace doth not deſtroy nature, nor natural Relations or affections; but it ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth them all to God and carrieth us above it, and deſtroyeth it as glorious intuition deſtroyeth gracious knowing in part, that is, by perfecting it. Before
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34706:147"/>
Sanctification we know, eſteem, regard, and love our parents, children, husbands, wives, meerly as thus related to us, and in theſe Carnal reſpects, and riſe no higher: and if we had converſt with Chriſt himſelf, and eat and drank in his preſence, and loved him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, it would have been but by a ſelfiſh, carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, eſteem, and love: But now we are ſanctified, as God is exalted, and <hi>ſelf denied</hi> and annihilated, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or ſeparated from God, ſo are all things that belong to ſelf: And therefore if we had loved parents or Chriſt himſelf but with ſuch a carnal ſelfiſh love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet now we love them with higher love, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth ſelf and all to God. And thus even <hi>ſelf</hi> is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed (as oppoſite to God and ſeparate from him) as thereby to be exalted as united and ſubſervient to him. And ſo is the love of friends, Relations, or Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (if we had loved him as a natural Kinſman or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſome did that yet believed not in him) it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but by an exalting, perfecting deſtruction. Juſt ſo far as <hi>ſelf</hi> is dead, ſo far <hi>Carnal knowledge</hi> and <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> in friends is dead, and their dearneſs to us for that <hi>intereſt,</hi> and ſelf and they are all advanced and dedicated unto God. And thus it is that the Apoſtle would be underſtood, and thus it is that <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denied in your Relations; but becauſe much duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth herein, I ſhall moreover tell you the ſeveral parts of it in a few Directions which ſhall moſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to other Relations, but principally to parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are apteſt to exceed.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>See that it be God more than your ſelves that you love in your Children, and other Relations.</hi> And to that End, ſee what of God is in them, as they are his creatures, as devoted to him, as any way gifted by him for his ſervice, and as ſanctified if they are ſuch. He that loveth any creature for it ſelf, and doth not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34706:148"/>
principally love God in them, loveth them but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>2. See therefore that you <hi>value and love thoſe moſt that have moſt of God in them, and the beſt of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.</hi> Love a crooked, deformed child, that is Godly, better than the moſt comely, or beautiful, or witty, that is ungodly. When Parents have a humorous, unreaſonable love to one child above the reſt without deſert, or to a worſe before a better, this is but a carnal ſelfiſh Love.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Love none exceſſively,</hi> but with a moderate love: ſuch as ſhall allow God and holineſs the preheminence; ſo that when you have the moſt love for your Relations, you may have more for God, at leaſt in the Eſtimation, Reſolution, Adheſion of your ſouls to him, if not in the paſſionate part of Love.</p>
               <p>4. See that you <hi>ſubject them to the Government of Chriſt:</hi> Labour to win all other relations to him: and devote your children to him betimes that they may be his as ſoon as yours. Whiles they have no wills of their own to uſe, they are to chooſe with your wills: that is, you are to make choice for them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you unfeignedly Dedicate them to God, you have ſmall reaſon to doubt of his acceptance. This all parents do <hi>virtually,</hi> that are Godly: For he that is himſelf devoted to God by ſanctification, doth with himſelf devote all that he hath, and virtually all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he ſhall have. And if he <hi>underſtand</hi> himſelf, he will do it <hi>actually.</hi> And hence it is that the Seed of Believers (yea of one Believer) are ſaid to be Holy: Not only or chiefly, becauſe they are yours, born of your bodies; nor meerly from a promiſe of God, that hath no preſuppoſed reaſon from the ſubject: But becauſe they are the children of one that hath devoted himſelf, and all that he hath, to God; and if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34706:148"/>
himſelf, doth actually offer, devote and dedicate his child to God in the ſolemn Baptiſm, Ordinance and Covenant. And God will ſure accept all that upon his own invitation is conſecrated and offered to him.</p>
               <p>5. See that you <hi>ſubmit them heartily to the diſpoſe of God.</hi> So that whatever he do with them, for ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or health, for poverty or riches, for honour or diſhonour, for life or death, you can patiently bear it, and ſay as <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do as ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 18. Murmur not if God afflict and take them away, even at once, as he did the ſons of <hi>Job,</hi> or if he ſhould afflict you in them as he did <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Amnon</hi> and <hi>Abſalom.</hi> Remember that as the Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Life it ſelf is the point by which Chriſt under the Goſpel doth try mens faith, ſo it was the reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an only ſon, which was next to life, by which he would try <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Incarnation of Chriſt. If therefore you will be children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you muſt walk in the ſteps of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and remember that your children are not your own; and be content that God do with his own as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Make God their portion, as much as in you lieth, and ſeek more for a ſpiritual than temporal felicity for them,</hi> and acquaint them with their Creator in the days of their youth: as believing that thoſe of them that are the Holieſt are the Happieſt.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Devote your children to ſuch callings and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which they are likelieſt to be moſt ſerviceable to God:</hi> Conſider their diſpoſitions and parts; and then never ask what kind of life is the moſt honourable or gainful for them, but in what way and courſe of life they may moſt ſerve God, and be moſt uſeful to his Church: And to that let them be devoted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:34706:149"/>8. <hi>Favour them not in ſin:</hi> and ſuffer them not to diſhonour God that they are devoted to: Remember <hi>Eli's</hi> example. Gentle reproofs inſtead of neceſſary ſevere correction, is called by God, <hi>A deſpiſing him, and preferring his ſons before him:</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 29, 30. even becauſe his <hi>ſons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 13. Take heed as you love your ſelves or them, of taking their parts againſt God, or againſt correction, and excuſing the ſins by which they do diſhonour him.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Give them not for their carnal advancement in the world that part of your eſtate which is due to God.</hi> You owe it all to him: and in the diſpoſing of it, he hath limited you to begin at home, &amp; provide ſo for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that they may have their daily bread, and ſo much more as they are in likelyhood the fitteſt ſtewards to improve for God. But if you ſee the publick ſtate of the Church or Commonweal to ſtand in need of your aſſiſtance, and you ſhall then give almoſt all to your children to make them rich and great in the world, and put off the works of greater moment with ſome poor inconſiderable alms or Legacy, this is to prefer <hi>ſelf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; even as it is imagined to ſurvive in your progeny, even when natural <hi>ſelf</hi> can no longer enjoy it. It's a wonder, how ſo many men ſeeming holy and devoted to God, can quiet their conſciences in ſuch a palpable ſin as this. If one of them have two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or three hundred pound a year, it's a wonder if he leave an hundred a year of it to any pious or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe; but if he leave forty or fifty pound to the poor, or build ſome ſmall Almes-houſe, he thinks he hath done well; all the reſt muſt go to leave his ſon in equal dignity and riches in the world as himſelf. But of this I ſpoke before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:34706:149"/>10. Laſtly, be ſure that you be very <hi>ſuſpicious of ſelf when the caſe of your children or any dear Relation is before you.</hi> For <hi>ſelf</hi> is near you, and will ſtick cloſe, and will not eaſily be thruſt out of your Counſels, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aken off: And therefore in your own caſe, and your <hi>Childrens</hi> caſe, or the caſe of your near friends, you will have much ado to overcome the cunning and ſtrong temptations to Partiality, if you were the holieſt Saint on earth: (though overcome them you will in the main if you have true grace:) But if you are dead profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, it's twenty to one but they will overcome you; and you will ſhew the world that you are ſelfiſh hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and more for your Children and Friends than God.</p>
               <p>Let me here give a few inſtances in this warning. 1. How oft have we ſeen it here and elſewhere, that people that make ſome ſhew of Religion, and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to have vice puniſhed, and diſcipline exerciſed, yet when it falls on any <hi>children,</hi> or <hi>near relations</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> they are as much <hi>againſt</hi> it as they are for it on others; yea riſe up with paſſion and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Officers, Miniſters, or others that are the cauſes of it. As one Hypocrite is tried when he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſuffer for Chriſt himſelf, ſo others ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Hypocrites ſooner, by preferring their children, yea their ſinful children, yea the preſent eaſe, or profit, or credit of their children, before their duty and the honour of God: And they will rather have God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, ſin unpuniſhed, and their childrens own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hazarded, than they will have them juſtly and regularly chaſtiſed: yea ſome of them riſe up as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant enemies againſt them that do it.</p>
               <p>2. Again, When God hath convinced you of duty, if a carnal friend, a husband or a parent do but contradict it, and perſwade you from a known duty or a holy life,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34706:150"/>
how commonly do men obey, becauſe forſooth they are their friends that do perſwade them?</p>
               <p>3. Moreover, When the caſe falls out that a man cannot follow God and his duty, and be true to his ſoul, but he is like to loſe his friends; how commonly is God denied, that friends may not be denied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience wounded, and duty bawk'd, that the favour of friends may not be loſt. O ſaith one, <hi>they are the friends that I live by, my livelihood is in their hands, I am undone if they caſt me off!</hi> Well! take them, and make thy beſt of them, and keep them as long as thou canſt; if thou canſt live better without God than them, or canſt ſpare Gods favour better than theirs, and they are better friends to thee than Chriſt is, and would be, take thy courſe, and judge at laſt whether the friend that thou didſt chuſe, or that thou didſt neglect and abuſe, was the better, and would have ſtood thee in more ſtead in thy deepeſt ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>remities. Chriſt hath reſolved you once for all, that he that loveth Father, or Mother more than him, is not worthy of him, and cannot be his Diſciple: Nay if he hate not Father, Mother, and all; that is, If he will not caſt them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and forſake them as men do hated things, rather than forſake Chriſt and the glory which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. 33. And therefore ſeeing Chriſt hath thought meet to inſtance in the forſaking of carnal friends for his ſake, as a duty of all that will be his Diſciples, you may ſee that this is a very conſiderable part of your ſelf-denial. And doubtleſs it is a point that Chriſtians are uſually put to the tryal in or elſe Chriſt would not have inſtanced in it. Few turn to Chriſt, but their carnal friends will turn from them. No grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemies to a man in the matters of his ſalvation (except carnal ſelf) than carnal friends: and therefore either God or they muſt be denied. For when God
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34706:150"/>
is for holineſs and they againſt it; when they are for ſinful pleaſures and gain, and God againſt it, both cannot be pleaſed; and therefore one of them muſt be denied, God or they.</p>

But in this alſo <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denied by all that will be Chriſts Diſciples: for he forgiveth none but thoſe that can heartily forgive another: And that we may know that this is a part of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> of great neceſſity, he hath put it into our prayers, and will not have us ſo much as ask for forgiveneſs our ſelves, if we cannot forgive; that we may know, that ſeeing it is not to be asked for on lower terms, it is not to be hoped for. The forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace of God in Chriſt doth ſo melt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the hearts of all true Chriſtians, that it diſpoſeth them in their meaſure to imitate him in forgiving: And they cannot find in their heart to take another by the

The grace that is moſt gloriouſly manifeſted in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel muſt needs make the deepeſt impreſtion on the ſoul, and conſequently conform the ſoul into its image: and doubtleſs this is love, and compaſſion, and <hi>forgiving mercy:</hi> and therefore he that cannot <hi>love his enemy, bleſs them that curſe him, and pray for them that hate and perſecute him,</hi> and return good for evil, can be no child of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44, 45, 46. It is an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane oblivion of our own condition for a man to ſeek revenge of another for a trifle, (for it can be no greater as it is againſt ſuch ſimple worms as we) when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and hainous ſins have been forgiven us. Doth God remit to us the everlaſting torments, and ſhall we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on another the venom of our private ſpleen? I know the furious Bedlams and malicious wretches do take all this but for unſatisfactory talk, &amp; it is not words that will ſerve their turns to repair their honour, and eaſe their deviliſh rancorous minds. Fleſh and blood ſay they, cannot endure it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And therefore <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nor corruption inherit incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50. Grace can do more than fleſh and blood; and if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forgive, you cannot be forgiven. If it be ſo hard to you to <hi>ſorbear,</hi> yea to <hi>love</hi> an enemy, it ſhall be as hard for you to be ſaved, and eſcape the portion of the enemies of God; and if the word of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be but wind with you, the word of his promiſe ſhall be as uneffectual to your ſalvation, as the word of his precept and perſwaſion was uneffectual to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and obedience. As God is Love, ſo his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ones are turned into Love. Love is their new nature: and Love is not of a Revengeful diſpoſition.

               </head>
               <p>14. ANother piece of Carnal pleaſure to be denied, is, the <hi>Delight men have in reading unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Hiſtories, and hearing News that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, and medling with other mens matters where we have no Call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With ſome fancies this is a notable part of carnal delight: Many School-boys, and young effeminate wits are as much poyſoned and carried away with read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Romances, feigned hiſtories and tale-books, and play-books, as by almoſt any piece of ſenſuality. O the precious hours that have been loſt upon this traſh and trumpery; but of this I ſpoke before: that which now I ſpeak is, even true Hiſtory and Reports, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of meer <hi>News,</hi> to pleaſe a buſie ranging mind. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is a very profitable ſtudy if it be uſed for right ends, and be rightly choſen. It's a very great help to underſtand the Scriptures, and to know the former and preſent ſtate of the Church; and ſee the wonderful works of providence, that otherwiſe would be as loſt to us. It is not fit that the wondrous works of God ſhould die with thoſe that have ſeen them, and not be tranſmitted to poſterity. God ſhould have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34706:152"/>
of his glorious works, from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and how ſhall that be if all be forgotten? He that knoweth nothing of any age but that which he lives in, is as fooli as he that knows nothing of any Country or Town but that which he lives in. Some Hiſtory is eſſential to our faith; and much more is integral to it; &amp; yet much more is very ſerviceable to it. He that hath not ſome competent acquaintance with Church-Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will be at great diſadvantages in the holding and defending his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith it ſelf againſt an Infidel, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion againſt a Papiſt. And he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the preſent ſtate of the world, and of the Church through the world, doth ſcarce know how to order his affections, or compoſe his prayers even in thoſe greateſt petitions, about the honour &amp; Kingdom &amp; will of God. They cannot grieve with the Church in grief, nor mourn with it when it mourns: ſo that it is a great duty of a Chriſtian to labour to underſtand by Hiſtory the former and preſent ſtate of the Church: And it is a great mark of a gracious ſoul that longs to hear of the proſperity of the Saints, and free progreſs of the Goſpel; and a mark of a graceleſs perſon that careth not for theſe things.</p>
               <p>But when Hiſtory is not uſed to acquaint us with the matters of God, or to ſurniſh us with uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but to pleaſe a ranging carnal mind, then it is but ſinful ſenſuality or vanity. Many perſons have no ſuch delight to read the uſeful Hiſtory of Church-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as they have to read the curiouſly penned, though leſs uſeful Hiſtory of other matters. Though I know that the Hiſtory of the whole world is very ſerviceable to the knowledge of Divine things: yet they that uſe it to holy ends, will make choice accordingly, and be no more in it than may ſuit with thoſe ends. It is the moſt humane, with the moſt light, ridiculous paſſages that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34706:152"/>
are moſt pleaſing to vain unſanctified wits; but the godly delight in it ſo far as it ſhews them ſomething of God, and leadeth them to him. In the very reading of Scripture, a carnal reader may be much pleaſed with the Hiſtory, that hath no ſavour in the Doctrine, but is weary to read it: and yet I muſt add this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the way; If we find a carnal kind of delight in Scripture-hiſtory or any other that is profitable, we muſt not therefore caſt off the Hiſtory, but ſeek after the cure of our diſeaſe, that we may ſpiritually take pleaſure in all for God, and he may be the beginning, &amp; end, &amp; the life, &amp; the All of our ſtudies and delights: And though our carnal delight in News and Hiſtory be a ſin in us; yet God doth ſometime make it an occaſion of Good by leading us to that holy truth, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be the means of our ſanctification, though at firſt we received it but as a Novelty.</p>
               <p>And ſo the carnal pleaſure that many have in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing News, and ſitting with folks that will talk of other mens matters, or things that concern them not, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſinful pleaſing of the fancy, and loſs of time, and neglect of greater matters which call for all our time and care. It was the voice of the <hi>Athenians, Act.</hi> 17. 21. [<hi>for all the</hi> Athenians <hi>and ſtrangers that were there, ſpent their time in nothing elſe but either to tell or to hear ſome new thing</hi>] yea novelty of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion, and Teachers, is a ſnare and bait to carnal fancies, which many are taken by, that are forſaken of God, having firſt forſaken him, and proved falſe to the truth received.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Unneceſſary Knowledge, and Deligh therein</head>
               <p>15. ANother part of Carnal Pleaſure which ſelf muſt be denied in, is, <hi>A deſire after unneceſſary Knowledge, and Delight therein.</hi> This is the common ſin of man, but not of all alike. Even they that can live without the Knowledge of the ſaving Principles of Religion, do yet itch to know unprofitable things: and many a fooliſh queſtion they will be asking about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unrevealed, or that concern them not, when they overlook that which their ſalvation lieth on: but the learneder ſort, and eſpecially more prying wits, and thoſe that are bred up among diſputes, are the proneſt to this ſin: and though it be an odious vice, yet it ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooleth many, that they reckon it confidently among their vertues:</p>
               <p>God cannot be known too much, nor can any man be too much in love with the true knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt: without this knowledge the mind is not good, nor can the heart be ſanctified, or the man be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Nor can any man know too much of the will and word of God; nor yet of his works in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth himſelf to the world. But the Carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is to be denied, is of another nature than the ſanctified knowledge of believers. I ſhall ſhew you the difference in certain particular reſpects.</p>
               <p>1. This deſire to know, which is in the unſanctified, is, partly from meer nature, and partly from a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered fantaſie, which is like a crorupt enraged appetite, that chooſeth that which is unwholſom, and yet is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greedy after it. But the deſire after knowledge in the ſanctified, is kindled by the love of God, and the love
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34706:153"/>
of thoſe holy and heavenly things which they are inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after. It is not the <hi>Love of God</hi> that ſets ungodly men upon their ſtudies, but a common and carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to <hi>know;</hi> and this appears in the end, which is next.</p>
               <p>2. This carnal knowledge is but to feed and furniſh and pleaſe a carnal fancy; becauſe it is ſome adding to our underſtandings, and becauſe it is naturally plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to know, and becauſe it brings in ſome novelty and variety, and becauſe it makes us ſeem wiſer than other men, and furniſheth us with matter of diſcourſe and oſtentation, and rids the mind of ſome troubleſom doubts; therefore even the worſt have a mind to know. But this is the knowledge that muſt be denied: that which muſt be valued and ſought after, is, To know God, that we may love, and reverence, and truſt, and admire, and honour him, and enjoy him: To know Chriſt, that we may have more Communion with him: To know the word and works of God, that in them we may know his nature and his will: and knowing his will, may ſerve him and pleaſe him: Theſe muſt be the ends of Chriſtian knowledge. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world that God hath revealed, but in its place we may be willing to know, ſo that we ſtick not in the creature, or ſenſe of the words, or common ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, but uſe every thing as a book or looking-glaſs: we love not a <hi>book</hi> ſo much for the letters as for the matter which they contain: &amp; we love not a <hi>Glaſs</hi> for it ſelf ſo much as for its uſe to ſhew us the face which we would ſee in it: ſo if we go to the creatures but as a book in which we may read the mind of God, and ſee his nature, and as a glaſs in which his glory doth ſhine forth, our ſtudy and knowledge will be ſanctified and divine. And thus as <hi>Paul</hi> would <hi>know nothing but Chriſt Crucified,</hi> ſo every Chriſtian ſhould be able to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34706:154"/>
ſay, that he would know nothing but God in Chriſt: for though we know a thouſand matters, and that of the loweſt nature in themſelves, yet as long as we ſtudy them not for themſelves but for God, it is not them that we know ſo much, as God in them; and ſo all is but the knowing of God: even as in our duty, though the works may be many and mean that we are employed in, yet all is but the ſerving of God, as long as we do them all for him: this is the main difference between an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified ſcholar and a ſervant of God in all their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: One of them is but recreating his curious fancy or inquiſitive mind, and ſeeking matter of honour and applauſe, or ſome way or other ſtudying for <hi>himſelf:</hi> but the other is ſearching after the nature and will of his Creator, and learning how to do his work in that manner as may pleaſe and honour him moſt. So that when they are reading the ſame books, and ſtudying the ſame ſubjects, they are upon quite different works, as having contrary ends in all their ſtudies: the one is content with bare ſpeculation and aery knowledge which puffeth up; and the other ſtudieth and knoweth practically to feed the holy fire of love in his heart, and to guide, and quicken; and ſtrengthen him for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover there is a difference commonly in the <hi>ſubject</hi> which they moſt deſire to know: for though there is no truth but a wicked man may know, which a true Chriſtian knoweth, and alſo but few truths but what he may for ſelfiſh ends be deſirous to know; yet ordinarily a carnal heart is much more forward to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy common Sciences than Divinity; and in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to ſtudy leaſt the practical part, and to be moſt in points that exerciſe the brain, and lie further from the heart: but the ſanctified man delighteth moſt in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the myſterie of Redemption, the riches of grace,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34706:154"/>
the glory which he hopeth for, the nature and will of God, the way of duty, the temptations that are before him, and his danger by them, and the way to eſcape, with ſuch other uſeful truths which he muſt live upon. One feeds but upon the air and chaff of words and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or common truths; and the other is taken up with the moſt ſpiritual, heavenly and neceſſary matters: yea it is not ſo much the truth as the matter or thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by it which the Chriſtian looks after: it is not only to underſtand the meaning of the Scripture; but to find, and love, and enjoy that God, that Chriſt, that Spirit, that Life which is revealed in thoſe words of Scripture; but the hypocrite ſticks moſt in a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſuperficial kind of knowledge.</p>
               <p>5. Carnal knowledge would break Gods bounds, and would needs know that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34706:155"/>
which elſe they might know, and cannot ſee the ſtrength of a reaſon, which the wiſe can ſee; yet will they ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quarrel with the light than with their eyes, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the reaſons and words of God rather than their purblind minds. But ſpiritual knowledge is modeſt, and humble, and obedient; &amp; preſumeth not to climb any higher than the ladder, leſt he loſe more by ſuch a ſtep too high, than he got by all his labor hitherto; &amp; find himſelf all in pieces at the bottom while he would needs climb above the top. He finds work enough in what God hath commanded him to ſtudy in his word; and therefore hath no leiſure to look after things that God hath hid from him: It is for the uſe of knowledge that he would know; and therefore he hath no great mind of that which is uſeleſs; and he knows that God is the beſt Judge of that; and therefore he takes that to be beſt for him which is preſcribed him.</p>
               <p>6. Carnal Students are apt to learn in the wayes which their intereſts and fancies lead them to: but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Students learn of God in his preſcribed way; that is, 1. In his Church, which is his School. 2. And in and by his holy Scripture, which is the book he ſets us to learn. And 3. By his Miniſters whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to teach us. 4. And in obedience to his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that muſt make all effectual. And 5. In fervent prayer to God for that ſpirit and a bleſſing. This is Gods way in which he will bring men to ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>7. Alſo Carnal Students obſerve not (commonly) Gods order in their learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they begin at that which ſuteth beſt with their carnal intereſt or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being leaſt againſt it; and they catch here and there a little, and make what their liſt of it, and force it to their carnal ſenſe, and to ſpeak for that which their minds are moſt affected to. But the ſanctified ſtudent,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34706:155"/>
begins at the bottom, and firſt ſeeks to know the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Religion, &amp; Points that life lieth moſt upon: and ſo he proceeds in order, and takes the leſſon which God and his Teachers ſet him, and takes up truths as they lie in order of neceſſity and uſe.</p>
               <p>8. And in the manner alſo the difference is great. The Carnal ſtudent ſearcheth preſumptuouſly, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedly, and unreverently, and ſpeaks of holy things accordingly, and cenſureth them, when he ſhould cenſure himſelf and actions by them, and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the words of God to his own carnal intereſt and will. But the ſpiritual ſtudent ſearcheth meekly with fear and reverence, with ſelf-ſuſpicion and conſciouſneſs of his exceeding darkneſs, and with a willingneſs and reſolution to ſubmit to the light, for conviction and for the guidance of his converſation.</p>
               <p>And now you ſee what carnal ſtudies are, remember that to avoid them is part of your <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> Reſtrain your ranging phantaſies &amp; underſtanding, as you would do a ranging appetite. If you have a mind that would fain reach higher than God hath given you light in Scripture, or a mind that muſt needs be ſatisfied of the reaſons of all Gods ways, and murmureth if any of its doubts be unreſolved, remember that this is <hi>ſelf</hi> that muſt be denied; and if any be wiſe in his own eyes, he muſt become a fool, that he may be wiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. and as little children muſt you come to the School of Chriſt, if you will indeed be his Diſciples And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this Intellectual voluptuouſneſs, licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and preſumption of Carnal minds, is a higher, and in ſome reſpects greater, and more dangerous vice, than brutiſh ſenſuality. And you may cheat and undo your ſouls in a civil courſe of carnal ſelfiſh ſtudies, as well as in a courſe of more groſs and ſenſual v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>16. ANother ſelfiſh Intereſt to be denied, is, <hi>The factious deſire of the ſucceſs of any odd opinions which we have eſpouſed, and of the increaſe and proſperity of any dividing party in the Church which we have addicted our ſelves unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It exceedingly delighteth a Carnal mind that his Judgement ſhould be admired, and he ſhould be taken as the light of the Country round about him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he hath hatcht any opinions of his own, or eſpouſed any whereby his ſingularity may be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by which his ſelfiſh intereſt may be promoted, he is as careful to promote theſe opinions, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that holdeth with him, as a Covetous man is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his gain. There is indeed as much of <hi>ſelf</hi> in many mens Hereſies and Church-diviſions, as any Senſualiſt hath in his way. And hence it is that a zeal for <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> opinions is eaſily got and eaſily maintained; when zeal for the ſaving truths of God is hardly kindled, and hardly kept alive. Yea multitudes in the world do make the very truth to be the matter of their carnal intereſt in it; while they ſome way get a ſeeming pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar intereſt, and promote it but as an opinion of their own, or of their party, and uſe it for ſelfiſh car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ends. And hence it is that many that are called Orthodox, can eaſily get and keep a burning zeal for their Orthodox opinions, when Practical Chriſtians do find it a very hard matter to be zealous for the ſame truths in a Practical way. Many ungodly men will be hot in Diſputing for the truth, and crying down all that are againſt it, and perhaps ſo far exceed their bounds,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34706:156"/>
that the godly dare not follow them! And the reaſon is clear. Whether it be Truth or Error that a man holds, if he hold it but as a conceit of his <hi>Own,</hi> or as the opinion of his party, or to be noted in the world, as one that hath found out more truth than others, or any way make it but the matter of his <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> intereſt, nature and corruption will furniſh him with a zeal for it: It's eaſie to go where ſin and Satan drives; and to be zelous where zeal hath ſo ſmall reſiſtance: and to ſwim down the ſtream of corrupted nature. But it is not ſo eaſie to be zealous in the practical ſaving enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the truth, and exerciſing that faith and love to God and holy obedience which truth is ſent to work in us. A ſchiſmatical or Opinionative uſe of truth it ſelf, is but an uſing it for <hi>ſelf</hi> againſt the God of truth: and it is no more wonder to ſee men zealous in this, than to ſee men forward and hot in any evil: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to quench or reſtrain this ſelfiſh carnal kind of zeal. But when men ſhould uſe the truth for God, and their ſalvation againſt Satan, and ſin, and <hi>ſelf,</hi> then it's hard to make them zealous: They are like green wood or wet fuel on the fire, that will not burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much blowing, and ſoon goeth out when it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be kindled, if once you leave it to it ſelf: <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke not non-ſenſe when he ſaid [<hi>For ye are yet Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: for whereas there is among you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not carnal and walk as men? For while one ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and another I am of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, <hi>are ye not Carnal?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3, 4, 5. How ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſoever it may lurk, there is doubtleſs much of <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> in Hereſies and unjuſt Diviſions. I know that moſt of them little perceive it. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in their zeal, which would have called for fire from heaven, did not know what ſpirit they were of. But God would not have ſpoke it, if it were not true, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:34706:157"/>
16. 17. [<hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, mark them which cauſe Diviſions, and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them: For they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt but their own belly, and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi>] Though they little believe that that there is any ſuch wickedneſs in them as this, yet the Spirit of God, that is the ſearcher of hearts is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it: and aſſureth us that both at the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi> and the <hi>End,</hi> Church-dividing courſes have a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſelfiſh nature: It is ſome ſecret intereſt of <hi>ſelf,</hi> (though ſcarce diſcerned) that kindleth the zeal, and carrieth on the work: It is not God that is ſerved by the diviſions of his Church. Many Sects now among us, do put a face of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> upon their cauſe: But <hi>ſelf</hi> is the more dangerouſly powerful with them, by how much the leſs ſuſpected or obſerved. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts under the pretence of the Churches Union, are the great dividers of the Chriſtian world, unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the far greateſt part of the Church, and ſeparating from all that be not Subjects of the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> And do you think it is <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> that is the Principle and Life, and End of this their Schiſm? were it not for the upholding of this uſurped power and worldly immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and greatneſs of the Clergy, it is morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſo many men of reaſon and learning could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in ſuch a ſchiſm, and in ſo many groſs conceits as go along with it. It is not the Pope that they are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally united in: For the far greateſt part of them, it it too evident that it is <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> and <hi>fleſhly</hi> intereſt that is their Center, to which the Pope is but a means. Hence it is that many of their Jeſuits and Fryars are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the world, with ſuch a fire of zeal, to promote their cauſe, that they will compaſs ſea and land for it, and day and night are buſie at the work, to plot, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34706:157"/>
contrive, and inſinuate, and deceive, and think no coſt or pains too great. For a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ſinful zeal and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence hath ſo many friends, and ſo little hindrance, that it's eaſily maintained: but ſo is not the healing peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, practical, and holy zeal of true believers.</p>
               <p>Well! Conſider what I ſay to you from the Word of the Lord: There is a <hi>ſelfiſh dividing Zeal in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which muſt be denied as well as whoredom or drunkenneſs. If you ask me how it's known: Briefly now I ſhallonly tell you this much of it: 1. That it is uſually for either an Error or a particular Truth, againſt the intereſt and advantage of the body of unqueſtionable Chriſtian verities. They can let Religion ſuffer by it, ſo their opinion do but thrive. 2. It is uſually for an Opinion by reaſon of ſome ſpecial endearment or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their own in it. 3. They cry up that opinion with a zeal and diligence much exceeding that which they beſtow upon other opinions of equal weight; and lay a greater ſtreſs upon it, than any ſhew of reaſon will allow them. 4. They uſually are zealous for a party and diviſion, againſt the Unity of the Catholick Church. 5. Their Zeal is moſt commonly turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the faithful Paſtors of the Church: For it's hard to keep in with ſchiſm, and with faithful Paſtors too: And if the Miniſters will not own their ſin and error, they will diſown the Miniſters. The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts and other Sects of late, would never have been ſo much againſt Chriſt's Miniſters, if the Miniſters had not been againſt their way. 6. Their courſe doth in the concluſion, bring down Religion, and hinder the thriving of the Goſpel and of Godlineſs. Mark, what is the iſſue of moſt of thoſe ways, that theſe men are ſo hot for? Doth it go better or worſe with the Church and cauſe of Chriſt in general, where they are, than it did before? Is Religion in more ſtrength, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34706:158"/>
and life, and honour? or doth real holineſs more abound? If ſo, be not too haſty to cenſure their Zeal. But uſually all theſe dividing ways, are the diſeaſes of the Church: which cauſe its languiſhing, decay, and diſſolution. 7. Laſtly, This ſelfiſh zeal is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſorious, and uncharitable, and diminiſheth Chriſtian Love, and ſets thoſe a reproaching and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing each other, that ſhould have lived in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion of Saints. Where you find theſe properties of your zeal and deſire, for the promoting of your Opinions or parties in Religion, you have great reaſon to make it preſently your buſineſs to find out that inſinuating <hi>ſelf,</hi> which maketh your Religion Carnal, and to deny and mortifie it.</p>

ANother <hi>ſelfiſh intereſt</hi> to be denied, is <hi>Carnal Liberty.</hi> A thing that ſelfiſhneſs hath ſtrangely brought of late into ſo much credit, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance among us think they are doing ſome ſpecial ſervice to God, their Country, the Church and their own ſouls, when they are but deeply engaged for the Devil, by a <hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> ſpirit, in a Carnal Courſe. For the diſcovery of this dangerous common diſeaſe, I muſt firſt tell you, that there is a threefold Liberty which muſt carefully be differenced. 1. There is an Holy, Bleſſed Liberty which no man muſt deny. 2. There is a wicked Liberty, which no man ſhould deſire. 3. And between theſe two there is a Common, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Civil Liberty, which is good in its place, as other worldly matters are, but muſt be <hi>denied,</hi> when it
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34706:158"/>
ſtands in competition with higher and better things; and, as all other worldly matters, is Holy when it is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily eſteemed and uſed; that is, for God; but ſinful when it is ſinfully eſteemed and uſed, and that is for <hi>Carnal ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. The firſt of theſe is not to be denied, but all other Liberty to be denied for it. This Holy Liberty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in theſe following Particulars. 1. To be freed from the Power of ſin, which is the diſability, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, the death of the ſoul. 2. From the Guilt of ſin, and the wrath of God, and the Curſe of the Law. 3. To be reſtored to God by Chriſt, in Union, Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and Sanctification; and our enthralled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſet free, to know, and love, and ſerve him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Libert y, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. God is the ſouls freedom, who is its Lord, and life, and end, and all. 4. To be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Satan as a Deceiver, and enemy, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of the wrath of God. 5. To be freed from that Law or Covenant of Works, which requireth that which to us is become impoſſible. 6. To be freed from the burdenſome task of uſeleſs Ceremonies, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the Church in the times of infancy and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 7. To be freed from the accuſations of a guilty conſcience, &amp; thoſe <hi>ſelf-tormentings</hi> which in the wicked are the fore-taſtes of hell. 8. To be freed from ſuch temporal judgments here as might hinder our ſalvation, or our ſervice of God. 9. To be free from the condemning ſentence at the laſt day, and the everlaſting Torments which the wicked muſt endure. 10. And to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the bleſſed ſight of God, and the perfect fruition and pleaſing of him, in Perfect Love, and Joy, and Praiſe, to all eternity. This is the Liberty which you muſt not deny, which I therefore name,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34706:159"/>
that by the way you may ſee, that it is not for nothing that the other ſorts of Liberty are to be denied.</p>
               <p>II. The ſecond ſort of Liberty is, that which is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; directly evil, which all men ſhould deny: And this is a <hi>freedom from Righteouſneſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 20. To be free from a voluntary ſubjection to God, and free from his ſevere and holy Laws, and free from the thoughts of holineſs, and of the life to come, and free from thoſe ſighs and groans for ſin, and that godly ſorrow which the ſanctified undergo; and to be free from all thoſe ſpiritual motions and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works upon their hearts, which the Spirit doth work on all the Saints: to be free from holy ſpeeches, and holy prayer, and other duties, and from that ſtrict and holy manner of living which God commandeth; to be at liberty to ſin againſt God, and to pleaſe the fleſh, and follow their own imaginations and wills, let God ſay what he will to the contrary: to be free to eat and drink what we love and have a mind of, and to be merry, and wanton, and luſtful, and worldly, and take our courſe without being curbed by ſo preciſe a Law, as God hath given us: to be free from an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly converſation, and thoſe preparations for death, and that Communion with God which the Saints par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of: This is the wicked Liberty of the world, which the worſt of carnal men deſire: And the next beyond this, is a Liberty to lie in the fire of hell, and a freedom from ſalvation, and from the everlaſting Joy and Praiſes of the Saints. If freedom from Grace and Holineſs deſerve the name of Freedom, then you may next call <hi>Damnation</hi> a Freedom.</p>
               <p>And it is part alſo of this ſinful miſerable Liberty to be free from the Government, and Officers, and good Laws which rule the Church and Commonwealth.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34706:159"/>
And ſuch wretches there are in the world, that ſeriouſly judge it a deſirable Liberty to be free from theſe. They think that their Country is Free, when every man may do what he liſt, and they have no King or other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, or none that will look after them, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their miſcarriages: And they think the Church is free, when they have no Paſtors, or when Paſtors have leaſt power over them, and they may do what they liſt. And indeed if they were rid of Magiſtrates and Miniſters, they were free! As a School is free that hath ſhut out the Maſter, or have rejected him, and teach and rule one another! And as a Ship is free when the Maſter and Pilot are thrown over-board; and as an Army is free when they have caſt off or loſt their commanders: or to ſpeak more fitly, as an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital is free when they are delivered from their Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and as the madmen in <hi>Bedlam</hi> are free when they have killed, or eſcaped from their Keepers. As Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels keep their Freedom, by refuſing Chriſt in himſelf: ſo carnal Dividers and Hereticks keep their Freedom, by refuſing his Officers, and Chriſt in thoſe Officers: <hi>For he that heareth them heareth him; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth him; and he that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not man but God,</hi> Luke 10. 16. 1 Theſ. 4. 8.</p>
               <p>And another part of this ungodly Liberty is, to be free from the exerciſe at leaſt of this power of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Miniſters ſo far as not to be reſtrained from ſin, though they be not free from the ſtate of ſubjects. To ſwear, and be drunk, and live as moſt Ale-ſellers on the damning ſins of others, and make a trade of ſelling men their damnation, and to have no Magiſtrate puniſh them, no Officer trouble them, and no neighbour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them; this is their Liberty. To game, and roar, and revel, and have no body ſay to them, Why do you
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34706:160"/>
ſo, is part of their Liberty. To have leave without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to make all others as bad as themſelves, and if they are Infidels or Hereticks, to perſwade other men to it: If they hold any opinion againſt the God that made them, againſt Chriſt, againſt the Spirit of God, againſt the Word and Laws of God, againſt his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, his Church, his Ordinances, againſt any neceſſary point of Faith, or if they have any falſe conceit that leads ſtraight to Hell, that they may have full power, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and authority, to bring as many as they can to be of the ſame mind, that they may not be unprofitable ſervants to the Devil, nor go to Hell alone, this is a great part of their impious <hi>Liberty:</hi> And becauſe the name of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is become honourable, they call this by the name of Liberty of <hi>Conſcience:</hi> when indeed it is Liberty of Practice that they mean, and not Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience: For their Conſcience cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by force, nor touched by the Sword. It's <hi>they</hi> that deprive men of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> whilſt by falſe teaching they put out the eye of <hi>conſcience,</hi> &amp; enſlave it to ſinful falſe conceits. And <hi>Conſcience</hi> is <hi>ſcience:</hi> and Error is not ſcience but ignorance: And therefore as <hi>Error</hi> is not <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but the <hi>deſtruction of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> ſo <hi>Liberty to error,</hi> is no <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> but a <hi>Liberty to deſtroy Conſcience:</hi> Much leſs is it Liberty of Conſcience to ſin againſt God, and draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from Conſcience into error, and poyſon mens ſouls, and hinder the Goſpel, and promote the work and Kingdom of the Devil.</p>
               <p>And many of our miſerable ſottiſh people take it for a part of their deſired Liberty to be free from Miniſters Spiritual Overſight and Government, &amp; not to be Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed or called to an account, or examined about the ſtate of their ſouls, nor queſtioned about their lives, but that they may do what they will, and have Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34706:160"/>
and all Ordinances on what terms and in what manner they will, and to have Miniſters bow their Judgments to theirs, and lay their Conſciences at the feet of every carnal ignorant wretch, and be but their ſervants to do what they would have them: this is the Liberty that Satans ſervants do deſire.</p>
               <p>And withall, that they may be free from neceſſary payments for the ſafety of the Commonwealth, and from the neceſſary retribution to God, for the Church and poor, yea from giving but the Miniſters their own; all this they take for part of their liberty. But they are all ſuch liberties as Chriſt never purchaſed, and the Goſpel never beſtowed, and never made the Owners happy: It is a liberty to ſtarve their own ſouls, and go quietly to everlaſting torment, and not be moleſted by Preachers and Puritans, but to ſin againſt God, and damn themſelves, and be let alone, and have no body tell them of it, or ask them, Why will you do ſo? In a word, it is that liberty that Chriſt died to ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from, and which the Goſpel would take down, and the ſpirit, miniſtry, and Ordinances would overthrow, and which no wiſe or good man hath reaſon to deſire: &amp; it is that liberty which God will ſave all thoſe from, whom he will ſave from the flames of hell.</p>
               <p>III. The third ſort of Liberty is that which is in it ſelf Indifferent, or to be reckoned among the common tranſitory benefits of this life, which with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is a mercy; and well uſed may do good, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is hurtful or little worth. This Liberty is not the Natural Liberty of the will, which in regard of its own elicite Acts is nothing but the power of <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination;</hi> and in regard of internal imperate acts, is nothing but a power or freedom to do what we will. For theſe are ſo our own, if not our ſelves, that no man can take them from us; at leaſt the firſt. Nor is it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34706:161"/>
the Ethical Liberty of the ſoul from ſin by gracious Habits: for this is ever good, as was ſaid before. Nor is it a Political Liberty from thoſe tyrannous Laws or practices of men that would root out the Goſpel and pull down the Kingdom of Chriſt, and ſet up iniquity. This Liberty muſt be deſired, and not denied, even when we ſubmit our ſelves to perſecution: but it is 1. The Civil Liberty of being from under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, and of having a hand in Government our ſelves. 2. The Liberty of being from under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Strangers, Conquerors, or enemies. 3. The Liberty of <hi>chooſing our own Governors,</hi> and having them not by other mens election ſet over us. 4. A Liberty from burdenſom payments &amp; taxes which are of no neceſſity to our good. 5. A liberty from arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government, and from being liable to the meer will and paſſions of men. 6. A protection from the abuſes and injuries of others. 7. And a liberty for o
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34706:161"/>
fooliſh conceits that makes impriſonment ſo grievous to the moſt. It is the ſame earth that they tread on, and the ſame air that they breath in as before. The great trouble is that they have not their wills: for when their own wills do as much confine them, it is then no trouble. I can confine my ſelf to one room, to one chair, the far greateſt part of the year for my ſtudies: and why ſhould I not bear as well to be ſo confined by another, if my own will could but comply with it? Never grudge at reſtraint or impriſonment then, but find out ſome imployment in it, whereby you may be ſerviceable to God, or at leaſt ſerve him by your ſufferings, and then rejoyce in it, and bring your minds to your condition, and ſo you may ſet your ſelves at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in ſpite of the greateſt Tyrant in the world. Impriſonment is but a penal reſtraint: and if, it be not Involuntary, it's ſcarcely penal: it is therefore in your power whether you will be Priſoners or not, becauſe it is in your power whether it ſhall be <hi>involuntary</hi> or not. Be but willing of your confinement, and you are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and though you are not out of the place, you are out of the priſon. The ſame room that is a priſon to the reſt, is none to the keper that guards them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe apprehending it to be for his commodity, he is willing of it, and their priſon is his home. And if you do but apprehend how you are called from temptations, and have an opportunity of honouring God, or at leaſt of being more humbled and mortified, and ſo bring your mind to conſent to your habitation, it's become your home and place of freedom: however he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the liberty of the Saints, that cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the liberty of his habitation or bodily abode for the attaining of it.</p>
               <p>And for thethings that men make ſuch a ſtir about in the world, under the name of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>il liberties,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34706:162"/>
ſome of them are no liberties, but fancies or miſeries, &amp; the reſt of them are no further to be valued than they are ſubſervient to the Kingdom of Chriſt and the good of ſouls. Conceited people call it their liberty to be governed rather by four hundred than by one, or by Popularity than by other forms of Government, and a great ſtir they make about this, as if their felicity did conſiſt in it: When as the true liberty of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth conſiſteth in the fulleſt conformity of their Laws and their execution to the will of God: in being free from all Laws or Paſſions of men that encourage iniquity, and are againſt the Goſpel or the common good, and peace and welfare of the body: In a word, to have Government beſt fitted to the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is ſuch a temporal ſafety and proſperity as moſt conduceth to the ſervice and honour of God: But the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Government is none of this liberty in it ſelf conſidered. A people may be at much more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under a pious Monarch than an impious or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Democracy. The free choice of the <hi>moſt</hi> when they are bad (as where is it better?) may enſlave the beſt: and the <hi>awe</hi> and intereſt of the Rich is commonly ſuch upon the people, that a free choice is ſomewhat ſtrange. And that ſort of Government may be fitteſt for One people, that is unfit for another: And their happineſs lieth not in the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Government, let them ſtretch their wits to invent new forms as long as they will; but in the Predominancy of God and his Intereſt in the hearts of the Governors, and in their Laws, their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Execution. This is it, and nothing but this, in Government, that will give the Commonwealth that deſirable liberty, in which their welfare doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore thoſe perſons are Enemies to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Country, that under that Name would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſuch kind of Popular intereſt as is plainly againſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34706:162"/>
the intereſt of Chriſt: and muſt have Magiſtrates and Miniſters reſtrained from doing the Work of the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Soveraign, the one from puniſhing ſin (if it be againſt the firſt Table, or come but under the name of conſcience) and the other from exerciſing Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcipline, and all under pretence of the Peoples Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. All theſe are carnal Liberties to be Denied.</p>

               <p>18. ANother part of <hi>Carnal ſelf-intereſt</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, is, <hi>Our Native Country, or place of habitation, with all the Comforts and Accommodations they afford us.</hi> It is lawful to have ſome ſpecial Love to our own Country; but not ſuch as ſhall prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the love of Chriſt, or ſeem ſufficient to entangle us in ſin. We muſt ſhew our Love to it principally by deſiring and endeavouring, that Gods name may be hallowed, and his Kingdom maintained, and his will fulfilled among and by our Countrymen: But if they ſhould turn enemies to the Goſpel or to Godlineſs, we muſt love the <hi>ſervants</hi> of God <hi>abroad</hi> much better than his <hi>enemies</hi> at <hi>home;</hi> and wiſh the ſucceſs of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants though of other Countries, againſt his enemies, though they were of our own. And if we cannot ſerve God or enjoy the freedom of a good conſcience at home, another Nation, though it were in the utmoſt parts of the Earth, where we may better ſerve God, muſt ſeem a better place to us. And if we be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or neceſſitated to forſake our Country, we muſt not ſtick at it, for the cauſe of Chriſt. It is none of the greateſt tryals to be put to remove from one Country
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:34706:163"/>
to another, as long as we have neceſſaries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we come. We have the ſame God to be with us, and take care of us, beyond ſea, as at home: the ſame earth, and air, and ſun to ſhine upon us: The ſame Spirit, and grace, and promiſes do accompany us: The ſame Saints of God, and Ordinances of Worſhip may be had in other Countries as our own. It's a kind of childiſhneſs to make ſuch a matter of being driven out of one Kingdom into another, when we have the ſame or greater mercies in the other. All is but our Fathers houſe; and we do but remove from room to room. <hi>The Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> As I ſaid before of Impriſonment, ſo I ſay of Baniſhment; It is in our own Wills by conſenting to it, to make it no ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. If you will make an affliction and a great matter of it, you may. A Merchant or Factor can live for his commodity, far from home, even among Turks and Infidels, and take it for no baniſhment: Much more ſhould you do ſo, for the ſake of Chriſt. Every place is our own Country where our Maſters work li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. We are but pilgrims; and as long as we are not out of our way, we need not complain much for being out of our Country. Indeed we are here but <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and this is <hi>not our Country,</hi> and therefore let us not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlove it upon a miſtake. The Apoſtles of Chriſt did purpoſely leave their Countreys, and travel about the Countreys of the World, to bring them the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt. And is it not better be walking Lights to illuminate the world, than Candles ſhut up within the walls of our own habitation? Heb. 11. 8, 9, 19. [<hi>By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was called to go into a place which he ſhould after receive for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went. By faith he ſojourned in the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as in a ſtrange Country, dwelling in Tahernacles</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:34706:163"/>
—<hi>for he looked for a City which had foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> ver. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>They confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth; For they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a Country: And truly if they had been mindful of that Country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned: But now they deſire a better Country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi>] It was the ſoreſt kind of baniſhment that the Saints endured, that's mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37, 38. and yet they patiently underwent it. [<hi>They wandred about in ſheepskins and goatskins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: Of whom the world was not warthy: they wondred in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</hi>] We judge our ſelves unworthy of Chriſt and the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and our Heavenly Country, if we cannot deny an earthly ſinful Country for them.</p>

BUt a far greater <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>ſelf</hi> to be denied, doth conſiſt <hi>in our bodily health and eaſe and from thoſe pains and torments, which perſecutors uſe to inflict upon the godly.</hi> An averſeneſs to ſuffering, is natural to man, and in it ſelf no ſin, but an <hi>exceſſive</hi> averſeneſs, doth ſignifie too much tenderneſs of the fleſh, and too little power of Reaſon, which ſhould quiet the mind, when it cannot abate the pain of the body; and muſt uſe to ſubmit to a leſſer evil, to avoid a greater: or to obtain a greater good than it depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

us of: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> could ſing with their bodies ſore, and their feet in the ſtocks. To be <hi>joyful in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation</hi> ſhould be no ſtrange matter to a Saint: much more with a patient ſubmiſſion to undergo it. We may not thruſt our ſelves into the fire, nor chooſe ſuffering without a call; but we muſt ſuffer rather than ſin, and chooſe the wounds and hurts of the body before the wounds and loſſes of the ſoul. But becauſe fleſh and blood will draw back, and make too great a matter of ſufferings, I ſhall briefly give you ten Conſiderations that may perſwade you herein to deny your ſelves; and in two caſes I deſire you to make uſe of them: Firſt, <hi>in caſe you have no way to eſcape ſuffering, but by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> then deny your ſelves and <hi>chooſe</hi> to ſuffer. Secondly, <hi>in caſe of Gods afflictions which unavoidably lie upon you:</hi> then deny your ſelves by a quiet and patient ſubmiſſion: And for both conſider.</p>
               <p>1. That is the beſt condition for us, in which we may be moſt ſerviceable to God. And if we ſuffer for Righteouſneſs, we may ſerve God as well in ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering as in a proſperous ſtate: Or if God himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us, we may ſerve him in our affliction: Our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience then is the ſervice that we are called to. The ſufferings of the Saints have done very much to the promoting of the Goſpel and building of the Church: Men will ſee that there is ſomewhat <hi>worth</hi> the ſuffering for, in the Chriſtian Religion, and ſee that Heaven is taken by believers for a <hi>certain</hi> thing, when they can let go earth for it: They will be moved to enquire, what it is that moves you to ſuch conſtancy and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. And why ſhould we not be willing of that condition, in which we do our Maſter the beſt ſervice, what ever the doing of it ſhall coſt us? The commodity of our <hi>end</hi> is the chiefeſt commodity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:34706:164"/>2. That is the beſt condition for us in which we may <hi>have moſt</hi> of God. But certainly we may have as much and uſually more of God in <hi>ſuffering,</hi> eſpecially for his cauſe, than we can have in proſperity; eſpecially when we ſin to eſcape theſe ſufferings. Is it <hi>bodily eaſe,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> that you ſet moſt by? It will be ſeen by your choice. If you prefer your eaſe before him, you muſt expect to have no better than you chooſe. If you prefer him before your eaſe and proſperity, you muſt be gladder of God with adverſity and pain, than of proſperity and eaſe without him. A beaſt hath health and eaſe as well as you, and yet you will not think him as happy. If you are tormented or loſe your health for Chriſt, you loſe nothing but what a Turk or Infidel hath, yea but what a beaſt hath, as well as you! But you may have that of God by the advantage of your ſuffering, that none but Saints have. And God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence can make a ſuffering ſtate as ſweet as a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. And he hath given you ground in his promiſes to expect it, Iſa. 43. 1, 2, 3. [<hi>When thou paſſeſt through the fire, I will be with thee</hi>—] 1 Cor. 10. 13. [<hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to man: but God is faithful who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that your able; but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it.</hi>] 1 Pet. 4. 14. [<hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye: for the ſpirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you: On their part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glorified</hi>] ver. 16. [<hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf.</hi>] What is the Scripture fuller of, than comforting promiſes to the ſufferers for Chriſt? To fly from ſuch ſufferings then, is but to fly from the preſence of God, and our own conſolations.</p>

                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:34706:165"/>3. At leaſt theſe <hi>ſufferings further our ſanctification,</hi> and <hi>make us better.</hi> And is not that our beſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>makes us beſt?</hi> Common experience as well as Scripture may ſatisfie us that a ſuffering ſtate doth very much further humiliation and mortification, and bring men to a deeper ſenſe of ſin, &amp; help all the truths of God to work, and make them more ſenſible and ſerious than in proſperity. Then we do not only hear but feel, that ſin is evil, and that the world is vain, and that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God are true. Why Chriſtian, if thou didſt but know that thou ſhouldſt have more of the ſpirit and its graces, and leſs of ſin, in a ſuffering eſtate, than in eaſe and plenty, wouldſt thou not even chooſe it and be glad of it? Is not ſin worſe than ſuffering to thee, and holineſs better than eaſe and peace? Alas, what ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, careleſs perſons ſhould we be, if it were not for the help of ſuffering! Grace uſeth to work by means: and this is the common means.</p>
               <p>4. Conſider, that <hi>pain and ſuffering we ſhall have, whether for Chriſt or not:</hi> The worſt men undergo almoſt as much by ordinary ſickneſſes and loſſes and croſſes, as the Martyrs do that ſuffer for Chriſt; ſin <hi>will</hi> bring ſuffering: and it's better have that which is ſanctified by the intereſt of Chriſt, than that which is not.</p>
               <p>5. And a Chriſtian that hath <hi>ſo much ado to curb and rule the fleſh in proſperity,</hi> me thinks ſhould the more patiently bear adverſity, becauſe God ſets in by it, and helps him to ſubdue the fleſh, and tame the body and bring it in ſubjection: And as it is but this burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fleſh that ſuffereth, which hath been the cauſe of ſo much ſuffering to our minds; ſo our warfare againſt this fleſh, which we mannage through the courſe of our lives, goes on more proſperouſly in the time of its ſufferings, than in proſperity. A weakned enemy is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34706:165"/>
eaſilier conquered. Do not therefore too much take part with the ſuffering fleſh, but ſelf-denyingly juſtifie the proceedings of the Lord.</p>
               <p>6. And conſider <hi>that</hi> the <hi>pains and ſuffering will be but ſhort.</hi> It is but a little while, and you ſhall feel no more than if you had felt nothing. And that which <hi>ſhortly will not be,</hi> is next to that which <hi>is not.</hi> As it makes all the pleaſures and glory of the world, to be a dream and next to nothing, becauſe it's but a while, and they are gone, and never return again: So it makes our ſufferings next to nothing that they are paſſing away, and almoſt over. And then all tears will be wiped from your eyes; and pain will be forgotten, or remembred only to encreaſe your joy. When you are paſt the brunt and ſafe with Chriſt, you will never repent of your ſufferings on earth, nor will it trouble you then to think of the ſhame or ſickneſs or pain and torment that here you were put to undergo. Yet a little while and all will be over.</p>
               <p>7. In the mean time, conſider alſo, that <hi>they are all Deſerved ſufferings.</hi> You deſerve them from <hi>God,</hi> though not from <hi>man:</hi> Nay they are a thouſand fold leſs than your deſervings: If free grace have pardoned you the main, and reſcued you from the torments of Hell, me thinks the remembrance of this wonderful mercy, ſhould make you patiently bear the Fatherly chaſtiſements that tend to the perfecting your delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>8. And ſo much the rather becauſe <hi>They are ſufferings more gainful to you, than the greateſt proſperity is to the world.</hi> When you have ſuffered for Chriſt as much as your natures are able to bear, you need not fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſers by him: As he is engaged by promiſe to make you amends, and to give you the reward of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of glory, ſo he is eaſily able to accompliſh it: <hi>All</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:34706:166"/>
the Saints of God are in the way to glory: but his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Saints are in the <hi>neareſt</hi> way. <hi>All</hi> his ſervants are <hi>unſpeakably</hi> gainers by him: but his <hi>ſufferers</hi> are in the <hi>moſt thriving</hi> way: <hi>They</hi> ſhall have an <hi>eminency</hi> of Reward, or a Reward above the common Reward, Rev. 7. 14. [<hi>Theſe are they that come out of great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and have waſhed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and he that ſuteth on the Throne ſhall dwell among them.</hi>] The Churches therefore glory in their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and for the patience and faith of Chriſtians in all the perſecutions and tribulations which they endure; <hi>A manifeſt token of the righteous judgment of God, that they may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which they ſuffer: ſeeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble them; and to them that are troubled, Reſt with the Saints,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 4, 5, 6. Mat. 19. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid <hi>Behold we have for ſaken all and followed thee; what ſhall we have therefore? And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his glory, ye ſhall alſo ſit on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>&amp; every one that hath for ſaken houſes, or brethren, or Siſters, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for my names ſake ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life.</hi>] And is it not better ſuffer under theſe temrs of unconceivable advantage, than to ſuffer in a natural way for nothing?</p>
               <p>9. And conſider, that if ſuffering ſeem ſo great a matter to you that you are reſoved though by the way of ſin to avoid it, you will eſcape it at ſo dear a rate that you will wiſh a thouſand times you had endured i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. There is no ſcaping of Chriſtian ſuffering when you are
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34706:166"/>
called to it, but by running into eternal ſuffering. There is no ſcaping the Priſon &amp; torment &amp; fire of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, when you are called to it, but by running into the fire of Hell. God can deliver you indeed on eaſier terms, by forbearing to call you to it, or reſcuing by his power: But you cannot reſcue your ſelves by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſuffer and yielding to ſin, without paying dearer for your freedom than it is worth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny your <hi>ſelves</hi> and bear what God ſhall call you to, leſt Chriſt deny you and make you ſuffer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fold more to all eternity.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, conſider alſo, that this part of <hi>ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> is it that Chriſt hath fully and purpoſely taught us, by his own example. Are you better than the Lord of life? And did they not uſe him worſe than you are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Do they ſlander you? and did they not ſo by him, calling him a gluttonous perſon &amp; a wine-bibber, and a friend of Publicans and ſinners, a Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a Deceiver, yea one that had a Devil, and caſt out Devils by <hi>Belzebub?</hi> Do they put a Fools Coat on you, and a Reed in your hand, and make a laughing ſtock of you? Remember what they did by Chriſt. They mixed ſcorn and cruelty toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they crowned him with a Crown of Thorns, and ſtruck him when they had covered his eyes, and bid him read who ſmote him. And do they worſe than this by you? They ſpit in his face, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Murderer, that he might be ſure to die. And do they worſe than this by you? [<hi>Run therefore with patience the race that is ſet before you, looking to Jeſus the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God: For conſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, leſt ye be wearied and faint in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34706:167"/>
your mind,</hi>] Heb. 12. 1, 2, 3. [<hi>If when ye do well and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God; for even hereunto were ye called; becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that ye ſhould follow his ſteps, who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who when he was reviled, reviled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; when he ſuffered threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe conſiderations you may ſee that in the greateſt afflictions or torments of the fleſh, we have reaſon enough for the practice of <hi>ſelf-denial!</hi> And therefore as Chriſt uſed <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16. when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to have favoured <hi>himſelf,</hi> and to have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuffering when it was neceſſary for us, bidding him [<hi>Get behind me Sathan, thou art an offence unto me; for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men</hi>] <hi>ver.</hi> 23. ſo do you deal by carnal <hi>ſelf;</hi> when it would perſwade you to favour your ſelves and put by ſuffering by yielding to ſin: take this <hi>ſelf,</hi> to be but a <hi>Satan</hi> to you, that ſavoureth not heavenly things but earthly, and command it to be ſilent and to get behind you; and do not ſo much as make your fleſh of your Counſel, nor hearken to any of its advice, in caſe of ſuffering for Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> Natural Life to be denied.</head>
               <p>20. BUt the greateſt point of ſelf-denial is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: Nothing is ſo near to <hi>Self</hi> as <hi>Life.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that nature doth ſo highly value, and dearly love, and tenderly look to, and unwillingly let go. And yet <hi>this</hi> alſo muſt be <hi>denied for Chriſt.</hi> All other parts of ſelfiſh intereſt are as it were ſummed up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in this. And many a one can yield in other points, that when he comes to this, is utterly ſtalled and will go away ſorrowful, rather than follow Chriſt to the Death. Nothing in this world is ſo dear to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man as his life. And therefore death is a thing that he knows not how to chooſe, nor to ſubmit to, if he could avoid it.</p>
               <p>In three caſes only I remember that Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have choſen death. Firſt in caſe of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream torment or other miſery, which they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope to prevent or end. But this was but a choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a ſpeedier or eaſier Death before a more grievous death, though remote; or before a death that had ſo great a miſery for its fore-runner: or at leaſt before ſuch a life as is a continual death. And ſo the conquered Heathens would frequently kill themſelves, to prevent a more diſhonourable cruel death from the hand of the Conqueror; And ſo many a one in uncurable miſery wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eth rather to die than endure it; partly becauſe that the ſuffering is ſo great as to overcome all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of life. (For I yield that ſome degrees of miſery with life are more terrible to nature than death;) and partly becauſe that they know they muſt die at laſt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Secondly, in a deſire of <hi>fame,</hi> that they may leave behind them an honourable name when they are
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34706:168"/>
dead. But this is not to deſire death but life. Fain they would live for ever: and becauſe they know that it cannot be obtained (on earth,) they had rather die ſome honourable death a little ſooner, that their names may live, when they are dead, than to die ignominiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly ſhortly after. Thirdly, And ſome have choſen to die for the publick good of their Country. But as it's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncertain whether the deſire of a <hi>living Name</hi> were not their greater motive, ſo it was but a chooſing a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death for their Country, before a latter unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable death without any ſuch advantage. In all theſe caſes a natural man may venture on death, that knows he cannot ſcape it long, but muſt ſhortly die, whether he will or no. But if they could avoid it, there's very few would ſubmit to death, but believers: and none but in one of theſe caſes. 1. To end or avoid ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream intolerable, uncurable miſery. 2. To deliver their Country or friends. 3. And whether any would do it upon their ungrounded hopes of better things in the life to come, I leave to conſideration. But if it be taken for granted that a natural man may love, 1. The comforts of life above it ſelf; 2. And the good of his Country, or the world, or his children above his life; 3. Or ſome carnal felicity falſly conceited to be had in another life; yet it is certain that none but a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified believer can <hi>Love God</hi> better than <hi>his Life,</hi> or can prefer thoſe ſpiritual heavenly joys which conſiſt <hi>in the holy Love and Fruition of God,</hi> before his life: And therefore he that <hi>for theſe can deny his Life, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Chriſtian: and none but be.</hi> Though it be an ungrateful word to the ears of ſome, I muſt ſay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>and none but he.</hi> For this is the very point in which Chriſt for inſtance, doth put our ſelf-denial to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. <hi>He that will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it</hi>] Whether you Love an immortal holy life with God, or this
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34706:168"/>
earthly fleſhly life better, is the great queſtion on which it will be reſolved whether you are Chriſtians or Infidels at the heart, and whether you are heirs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or hell. <hi>Some Love</hi> to God may be in the unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; but not a love to him above their lives: and in ſome caſes they may <hi>ſubmit to death;</hi> but not for the <hi>Love of God.</hi> But both theſe ſet together, that is, a <hi>ſubmitting to Death for the Love of God,</hi> or a <hi>Loving of God above this life,</hi> is the moſt infallible proof of your ſincerity.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, fleſh and blood muſt needs think this is a very hard ſaying; and though they might conſent to acknowledge it a Duty, and a Reaſonable thing to die for Chriſt, and a note of excellency, and a commendable qualification of ſome few extrordinary Saints, yet it goeth very hardly down with them, that it ſhould be the loweſt meaſure of ſaving grace, &amp; that the weakeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt have it that will be ſaved; For ſay they, What can the ſtrongeſt do more than die for Chriſt? But to this I anſwer, 1. There is no rom for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt ſo plain a Word of God. It is the wiſdom of God, and not our Reaſon that diſpoſeth of the Crown of life: and therefore it is his Wiſdom and not our Reaſon muſt determine by what we ſhall attain it. And if God ſay plainly, that <hi>If any man come to Chriſt, and hate not his own life,</hi> (that is, love it not ſo much leſs than Chriſt, that for his ſake he can uſe it as a hated thing is uſed) <hi>he cannot be his Diſciple,</hi>] Luke 14. 26. it is too late for the vote of man, or all the clamour of fooliſh reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal this reſolution. The word of God will ſtand, when they have talk'd againſt it never ſo long: we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our ſelves by daſhing againſt it, but we cannot deſtroy or fruſtrate it. 2. And whereas men ask, <hi>What can the ſtrongeſt do more than die for Chriſt?</hi> I
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34706:169"/>
anſwer, Abundance more: They can die for him with far greater Love, and Zeal, and Readineſs, and Joy, than the weak can do: and ſo bring much more honour to him by their death. Though there be no higher way of outward expreſſing our Love to Chriſt, than by dying for him; yet the inward work of Love may be in very different degrees in perſons that uſe the ſame expreſſion of it. Some may come to the ſtake with a little Love comparatively, and ſome with fervent hot affections: Some have much ado to yield to die; and ſome die ſo chearfully, that they rejoyce in the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of honouring God, and paſſing to him. Yea and in the Expreſſions there is much difference in the manner: Some give up themſelves with ſo much readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as works more on the ſtanders by than their meer patience or the death it ſelf. And ſome are drawn ſo hardly to it, as drowneth much of the honour and fruit of their martyrdom. Of this read Mr. <hi>Pinks</hi> Serm. on <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. But Nature is of God: and Nature teacheth us to Love and ſave our Lives: and is it like that the God of Nature will command and teach us to caſt them away, and ſo contradict his own Law of Nature?</hi> Anſw. 1. As Nature teacheth you to love your lives, ſo God doth not forbid you. But 2. Is it Natural to man to be Reaſonable, as well as to be ſenſitive and animate? To have a reaſonable ſoul, as to have a temporal life? 3. And doth not Reaſon tell us by the light of Nature, that God ſhould be loved better than our Lives? If it did not, yet by the help of ſupernatural light, even Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon clearly tells us this. And it is no contradiction for God to bid you, [Love your lives, but love him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.] And he that bids you ſeek the preſervation of your lives, doth plainly except, that you reſign them to his diſpoſe, and that you ſeek not to ſave them from
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34706:169"/>
him, when he commandeth you to lay them down. So that it is not ſimply againſt Nature, to conſent to die: but when it is for him that is the Lord and end of life, it is agreeable to Nature; that is, though it be againſt our natural inclination as we are Animate, and Senſitive; yet is it agreeable to our true nature as reaſonable: And therefore lay all together, &amp; it is to be ſaid to be agreeable to Nature ſimply in ſuch a caſe; becauſe it is agreeable to the Principal part in nature, which ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant; It is agreeable to nature alſo, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould diſpoſe of the inferiour powers of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But when you have ſaid all that you can, as long as you plead againſt my nature, I cannot conſent to what you ſay; words are but wind: To perſwade me to conſent to die, is as much as to perſwade me not to feel when I am hurt, or to be hungry or thirſty or ſleepy, which are not in my power, becauſe theſe things are Natural. Anſw.</hi> 1. Though hunger and thirſt and other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſenſitive appetites or paſſions, be not in your power, yet a conſent of the will to deny theſe is in your power. As natural as it is to hunger and thirſt, your ſuperiour faculty of Reaſon can prevail with you to ſuffer hunger and thirſt in a Siege or ſickneſs, when the ſuffering of it will ſave your life. You will be ruled by your Phyſician to forbear not only many a diſh but many a meal which your appetite deſireth. And your Reaſon can perſwade you to ſuffer the opening of a vein, and the drawing out of your own blood, yea or the cutting off a member, when it is to ſave your life, for all that <hi>feeling</hi> and ſelf-love is natural to you. And you are not acquainted with the nature of Friendſhip if you would not ſuffer much for a friend; nor with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affections if you would not ſuffer much for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or children, or your Country; ſo that your will is free, though your ſenſe be not free, nor your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34706:170"/>
appetite. Though you cannot chooſe but feel when you are hurt, you might conſent to that feeling for a greater good. 2. And according to the tenour of this Objection, you may as wiſely and honeſtly plead for moſt of the wickedneſs of the world, and ſay <hi>It is natural to me to luſt, and therefore I may play the Adulterer and fulfil it: It is natural to me to deſire meat and drink, and therefore I may eat and drink as long as I deſire it. It is natural to me to ſeek to hurt thoſe that I am much angry with, or hate: and therefore I may beat or kill them.</hi>] If you muſt deny the Paſſions and ſenſitive appetite, and the inferiour faculties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in one thing, why not in another? Theſe lower powers were made to be ruled by reaſon, as beaſts are made to be ruled by men, and more. And therfore ſeeing this Argument from Nature is but from the bruitiſh part of Nature, it is but a brutiſh Argument. And if yet you ſay, that for all theſe words, <hi>Death is ſo great an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to you, that you cannot chooſe it;</hi> I anſwer, that is becauſe your reaſon is not illuminated and elevated by faith, to ſee the Neceſſity of chooſing it; and to ſee thoſe higher and better things, which by this means you may obtain. Had you that heavenly life of faith and love which the ſpirit worketh in the Saints, it would carry you above this preſent life, and take you up with higher matters, and ſhew you that (and ſo ſhew it you) as ſhould procure your own conſent to die.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this is the great point that Chriſt doth purpoſely here try our ſelf-denial by, and a point of ſuch great neceſſity to be look'd after, I ſhall ſtay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer on it, while I give you firſt ſome Reaſons to move you, and 2.

               <p>1. COnſider, that <hi>Our Lives are not our Own;</hi> but God that doth require them is the Abſolute Lord of them. More truly than you are owner of any thing that you have in the world, is he the Owner of your lives and you. And therefore both in Reaſon and Juſtice we ſhould be content that he diſpoſe of his own. If he may notfreely diſpoſe of you &amp; your lives, you may as well deny him the diſpoſe of any thing, and ſo deny him to be God: for he hath the ſame right to you as to any thing elſe, and the ſame power over you. And therefore if you conſent that he ſhall be God (for which he needs not your conſent) you muſt conſent that he be the Owner and Diſpoſer of all, and of you as well as all things elſe: Otherwiſe he is not God.</p>
               <p>2. You can be content that the <hi>lives of others,</hi> yea that all the world be at Gods diſpoſe: In reaſon you cannot wiſh it ſhould be otherwiſe. You are content that the lives of Emperors and Kings that are greater than you, ſhould be at his Diſpoſe? And is there not the ſame Reaſon that he diſpoſe of <hi>your</hi> life as of <hi>theirs?</hi> Are you better than they? or more your own? or hath the world more need of you than them? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it not unreaſonable <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> that makes ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34706:171"/>
a difference with you? If Reaſon might ſerve, the caſe is plain.</p>
               <p>3. You are contented that far <hi>greater</hi> matters than your lives ſhould be at Gods diſpoſe: The Sun in its courſe, the frame of nature, Heaven and Earth and all therein are at his diſpoſe, and would you wiſh it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Days and Nights, and Summer and Winter, and times and ſeaſons are at his diſpoſe; and you dare not murmur that all the year is not Summer or day-light, and that there is any Night or Winter. The Angels of Heaven are at his diſpoſe to do his will, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be uſed on earth for your ſervice, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to be from under his diſpoſe? And ſhould <hi>you</hi> deſire it? or rather deſire that his will may be done on earth as it is in Heaven! If you would not have the Crowns and Kingdoms of the world at his Diſpoſe, and Heaven and Earth are at his Diſpoſe, you would not have him to be God: But if you would have theſe <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> things at his diſpoſe, what are you then, that <hi>your lives</hi> ſhould be excepted?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Whom</hi> would you have to be the Diſpoſer of mens Lives but <hi>God?</hi> Is any other fit for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? No other can <hi>give</hi> life but he! And no other can preſerve and continue it but he! If your life had been in any creatures hand, you had been dead long ago: For no creature is able to uphold it ſelf, much leſs another alſo. Is any Creature <hi>wiſe</hi> enough to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the world and the affairs thereof? Is any Creature <hi>powerful</hi> enough, to diſpoſe of the world and all things in it?

it muſt be God or none that muſt have the Diſpoſal of your lives and you.</p>
               <p>But I know what it is that <hi>ſelf</hi> would have! You would have the Diſpoſal of your <hi>own lives,</hi> or elſe have God to diſpoſe of them as you would have him, which comes all to one. But how unreaſonable is this? Would <hi>you alone</hi> have the Diſpoſal of your <hi>own lives?</hi> or would you have <hi>all men</hi> elſe in the world alſo to have the Diſpoſal of <hi>theirs?</hi> If <hi>all</hi> ſhould have this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, what a miſerable Priviledge would it prove? No man then would die, and then either you muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear marriage, or what would you do with your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when there were no room on earth? And then you could not puniſh a Malefactor with death! And what a world would it be, if all men were Diſpoſers of themſelves, when there would be as many different ends and minds as men? every man would be for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and an enemy to others; and the world would run every man on his own head; and a madder confuſion than can be imagined, would ſeize on all. If you would have every man have the diſpoſe of his own life, you would have as many Gods as Men, and ſo have no God; and you would have as many Kings or Rulers as men, and ſo have no Ruler? and you would have the world to be no world, when God were to them as no God. And if you would not have it thus with all, what reaſon have you to deſire it for your ſelf? What are you more than all the world, that you ſhould be exempted from the common ſtate of mortals, and be at your own diſpoſal more than they, and be inſtead of God unto your ſelves?</p>
               <p>5. You think it neither cruelty or injuſtice, that the lives of <hi>bruits</hi> ſhould be much at <hi>your</hi> diſpoſe! Your poor fellow-creatures muſt die when you require it. Birds and Beaſts and Fiſhes, even multitudes of them
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34706:172"/>
muſt die to feed you, yea often for your delight, to make you a Feaſt, when you have no neceſſity. The moſt harmleſs ſheep you will not ſpare; The moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Ox, the moſt beautiful Bird, muſt give up their lives to ſatisfie your pleaſure. And is not God ten thouſand thouſand times even infinitely more above you, than you are above your fellow-creatures? Is one creature fitter to kill another, and afterwards devour it, and becomes its grave, than God to diſpoſe of the <hi>Lives</hi> of all?</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Where</hi> could you <hi>wiſh</hi> your <hi>Lives</hi> to be <hi>better,</hi> than in the hand of the moſt wiſe &amp; gracious God? If you may reſt content, or have confidence in <hi>any,</hi> it is in him. You neednot <hi>doubt</hi> of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> for he is <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf. And therefore though you ſee not the world to come that you are paſſing to, yet as long as you know that you are in the hands of Love it ſelf, what cauſe have you of diſquiet or diſtruſt? And that you know that he is <hi>wiſe</hi> as well as Good, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> as well as Wiſe, and therefore as he meaneth you no harm, (if you are his children) ſo he will not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, nor fail in the performance: You need not fear leſt your happineſs ſhould miſcarry for want of skill in him that is Omniſcient, or for want of will in him that is your Father, or for want of Power in him that is Omnipotent. You may far better truſt God with your lives, than your ſelves. For you have not wiſdom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know what is beſt for you; nor skill to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it, nor Power to go through with it: Nay, you love not you ſelves ſo well as God doth love you.

You can truſt your lives on the skill of a Phyſician; And cannot you truſt them on the will of God? If you had your <hi>choice</hi> whether your lives ſhould be at your own diſpoſe, or Gods, you ſhould far rather chooſe that God might diſpoſe of them than your ſelves: As it is better for an Infant to be guided and diſpoſed of, by the Parents than by it ſelf. <hi>A Good King</hi> will not kill his own Subjects needleſly: And a natural Father or Mother will not not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly kill their own Children: yea a very brute will tenderly cheriſh their young: And do you think that God who is infinitely good, will cauſeleſly orinjuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly take your lives? or that he doth not mean you good even in your death?</p>

of fleſh, and paſsing under the conduct of Angels, into the preſence of our Lord. God is but hatching us here by his ſpirit, that he may bring us out into the light of glory. And ſhould we grudge at this?</p>
               <p>7. And what if God call you to ſacrifice your lives to him, as he called <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his Son? What if he call you to come to him by a perſecutors hand? or at leaſt to be willing of your natural death? He calls you but to give up a life which you cannot keep; and to do that willingly, which elſe you muſt do whether you will or not: Willing or unwilling, die you muſt! How loth ſoever you are, you are ſure to die. You may turn you every way, and look about you on the right hand and the left, to all the friends and means in the world, and you will never find a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that will here procure immortality, nor ever ſcape the hands of death. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, and after that the Judgement,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. And no man can change the Decrees of Heaven. And ſeeing all your turnings and unwillingneſs cannot avoid it, is it not better to ſubmit to it willingly than unwillingly? God doth impoſe it on you as a neceſſity. Your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs may make a vertue of Neceſſity, and out of Neceſſity extract a reward: but your unwillingneſs may turn your ſuffering into your ſin, and a Neceſſary death unto an unneceſſary miſery now (and hereafter if you be not true believers) as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial labours, 1 Cor. 9. 16, 17. <hi>If I do this thing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, I have a reward: but if againſt my will, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is committed to me: for neceſſity is laid upon me</hi>—] So I may ſay in the preſent caſe: If you give up your lives willingly in the love of God, you have a Reward; but if you do not Neceſſity is upon you, and die you muſt whether you will or no. You may ſcape the Reward by your unwillingneſs, but death you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

eſcape. And me thinks you ſhould ſee that it's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thanks to you, to give up that life which you cannot keep; And yet this is all that God requireth. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you think, that though you cannot keep it ſtill, yet ſomewhat longer you may keep it. But you be not ſure of that. The next hour may God deprive you of it. And O what a dreadful thing it were, if as ſoon as you have denied God your lives, he ſhould ſnatch them from you in his fury, and caſt you into Hell! and if he ſhould diſtrain for his own as ſoon as you have denied it him! and you ſhould die as enemies that would not die as Martyrs, and as his Friends! And in this ſence hath my Text been many a time fulfilled, <hi>He that will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Conſider alſo that it is upon terms of the higheſt advantage imaginable to your ſelves, that God calls you to reſign and lay down your lives. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to <hi>loſe</hi> them, but to <hi>ſave</hi> them, as my Text doth promiſe you [<hi>He that loſeth his life ſhall ſave it.</hi>] No more than you loſe your cloaths which you put off at Night and put on again in the Morning: Or rather, no more than you loſe your louſie rotten rags, when you put them off at Night, and are to have in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Suit of Princely attire in their ſtead. Will any man ſay, theſe rags are loſt? At leaſt they will not ſay that the man is a loſer by the change. That is not loſt that is committed to God, upon the ground of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Nor that which is laid out in his Servive, at his command. Reaſon will tell us, that no man can be a loſer by a courſe of ſubmiſſive Obedience to God. You cannot be at ſo much coſt for him, or offer him ſo dear a ſervice, which he is not able and willing to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you for a thouſand fold. God will not be beholden to any man. You cannot bring him in your debt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what he doth by his bountiful promiſe: But if
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34706:174"/>
you could, he would not continue in your debt. You'l make nothing of your death, if you do not either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it for Chriſt, or bear it ſubmiſſively by the power of heavenly love conſtraining you. Meerly to die whether you will or no, as a fruit of ſin, is common to the moſt ungodly men: But if the love of God can make you voluntarily ſubmit to death (whether natural, or violent from perſecutors) what a glorious advantage may you make of it? You will 1. Put your ſalvation more out of doubt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are that part of the Heavenly Hoſt that ſi and neareſt to the Throne of God, and that praiſe him with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joys, who hath brought them through tribulations, and redeemed them by his blood. If a man ſhould make a motion to you to exchange your cottage for a Palace and a Kingdom, you would not ſtick at it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it were againſt you, becauſe you muſt leave your anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent home: And how much leſs ſhould you be againſt it, when you are but moved to ſtep out of your ruinous cottage into glory, when it would ſhortly fall upon your heads, and you muſt leave it whether you will or no, for nothing.</p>
               <p>9. What reaſon have you to be ſo tender of the fleſh? Is it the greatneſs of its ſuffering that you ſtick at? Why, you put poor Beaſts and Birds to as much, and ſo do the Butchers daily for your uſe: and <hi>they</hi> muſt
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34706:174"/>
ſuffer it. And why ſhould the body be ſo dear to you? for the <hi>matter</hi> of it, what is it but earth? and wherein is it more excellent than the beaſts that periſh? I think God hath purpoſely clothed your ſoul with ſo poor a dreſs, that you ſhould be the leſs unwilling to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed, and might learn to ſet more by your ſouls than by your bodies, and to make more carefully proviſion for them. It ſeems he hath purpoſely lodged you in ſo poor a cottage, that you ſhould not be at too much care for it, nor be too loth to leave it. You have its daily Neceſſities and Infirmities and pains, and ſomewhat of its filth and lothſomeneſs, to tell you of its meanneſs: And why ſhould you be ſo loth that ſo poor a cottage, ſo frail a body ſhould be turned to duſt? Duſt it is, and to duſt it is ſentenced. When the ſoul hath left it but a week, men can ſcarce endure to ſee it or ſmell it? And ſhould the breaking of ſuch an earthen Veſſel be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing a thing to you? And for its uſeſulneſs, though ſo far as it is obedient it was ſerviceable to your ſouls, and God, yet was it ſo refractory, ill diſpoſed, and diſobedient, that it proved no better than your enemy. Many a temptation it hath entertained and cheriſhed; and many a ſin hath it drawn you to commit; Thoſe ſenſes have let in a world of vanity; Thoſe wandring eyes have called in covetouſneſs, and pride, and luſt. Thoſe greedy appetites have been ſo eager on the bait, that they have too oft born down your faith and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and drawn you to exceſs in meats and drinks, for matter or manner, for quality or quantity, or both. Many a groan thoſe ſins have coſt you, and many a ſmarting day they have cauſed you, and a ſad uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life you have had by reaſon of them, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what you might have had. And this fleſh hath been the Mother or the Nurſe of all. You were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by your Baptiſmal Covenant to fight againſt it,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34706:175"/>
when you entred into the Church; and if you are Chriſtians, this combate hath been your daily work, and much of the buſineſs of your lives. And yet are you loth to have the victory, &amp; ſee your enemy under feet? Do you fight againſt it as for the life of your ſouls, &amp; yet are you afraid leſt death ſhould hurt it or break it down? Have you fought your ſelves friends with it, that you are ſo tender of it? when you are the greateſt friends to it, it will be the moſt dangerous enemy to you. And do not think that it is only ſin, and not the body, that is the fleſh, that is called your enemy in Scripture. For though it be not the body as ſuch, or as obedient to the ſoul, yet is it the Body as inclining to creatures, from which the ſinful ſoul cannot reſtrain it; &amp; it is the body as having an inordinate ſenſitive appetite and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo diſtempered, as that it rebels againſt the Spirit, and caſteth off the rule of Reaſon, and would not be curbed of its deſires, but have the rule of all it ſelf. Was it not the very fleſh it ſelf that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he fought againſt, and kept under, and brought into ſubjection, leſt he ſhould be a caſt a-way? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26, 27. Why ſhould ſin be called [<hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Body</hi>] but that it is the Body of Fleſh that is the principal-ſeat of thoſe ſins that are ſo called. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye ſow to the fleſh, of the fleſh ye ſhall reap corruption,</hi> Gal. 6. 8. That which is firſt in Being, is firſt in ſin: But it is the Fleſh or Embryo endued with ſenſe that is firſt in being. Be not therefore too tender of that which corruption hath made your priſon and your enemy: Many a time you have been put to reſiſt it, and watch and ſtrive againſt it; and when you have been at the beſt, it hath been hindring you to be better; and when the ſpirit was willing, the fleſh was weak: And quickly hath it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34706:175"/>
your cooling &amp; declenſion. Many a bleſſed hours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between God &amp; your ſouls, that fleſh hath depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you of. And therfore though ſtill you muſt love it, yet you ſhould the leſs grieve or be troubled at its ſufferings, ſeeing they are but the fruits of its ſin, and a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs ſhold poſſeſs your minds, that God ſhould thus caſtigatorily revenge his own quarrel &amp; yours upon it.</p>
               <p>10. But yet conſider, that were you never ſo tender of the body it ſelf, yet faith and reaſon ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to be content; For God is but preparing even for its felicity; His undoing it but to make it up again. As in the new birth he broke your hearts and falſe hopes, that he might heal your hearts, and give you ſounder hopes inſtead of them: ſo at death he breaketh your fleſh and worldly hopes, not to undo you, and leave it in corruption, but to raiſe it again another manner of body than now it is, and give it a part in the bleſſedneſs which you hoped for. If in good ſadneſs you believe the Reſurrection, what cauſe is there for ſo much fear of death? You can be content that your Roſes die, and your ſweeteſt Flowers fall and periſh, and the green and beauteous complexion of the earth, be turned into a bleak and withered hue, becauſe you expect a kind of Reſurrection in the Spring. You can boldly lie down at night to ſleep, though ſleep be a kind of death to the body, and more to the ſoul; and all becauſe you ſhall riſe again in the morning. And if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nights ſleep (or one at leaſt) were a gentle death, if you were ſure to riſe again the next morning, you would make no great matter of it. Were it as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to men to die every night, and riſe again in the morning, as it is to ſleep every night and riſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, death would not ſeem ſuch a dreadful thing. Thoſe poor men that have the falling-ſickneſs, do once in a day or in a few days, lie as dead men, and have as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34706:176"/>
much pain as many that die: And yet becauſe they uſe to be up and well again in a little time, they can go merrily about their buſineſs, the reſt of the day, and little fear their approaching fall. How much more ſhould the belief of a Reſurrection unto life, confirm us againſt the fears of death? And why ſhould we not as quietly commit our bodies to the duſt, when we have the promiſe of the God of heaven, that the Earth <hi>ſhall deliver up her dead,</hi> and that this body <hi>that is ſown in corruption, ſhall be raiſedin incorruption? It is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory: it is ſown in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is raiſed in power: it is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body</hi>] So great and wonderful the change will be, as now is unconceivable! we have now a droſſie l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Like the Silk-worm which in the Winter is but a ſeed, which in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doth move &amp; attract that matter from which it gets a larger body, by a kind of Reſurrection: But it is another manner of body (I will not ſay of fleſh) which at the Reſurrection we ſhall have. Not fleſh and blood, nor a natural body, but of a nature ſo ſpiritual, ſublime and pure, that it ſhall be indeed a ſpiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And think not that this is a contradiction, and that ſpirituality and corporeity are inconſiſtent. For [<hi>There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual body</hi>] The root of the fleſhly Natural body was the <hi>firſt man</hi> Adam, who was <hi>made a living ſoul,</hi> to be the Root of living ſouls.

Will you allow no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter works for God than ſuch as you can ſee a reaſon of, and can aſſign a natural cauſe of? what did Nature in the creation of nature! It was not certainly any cauſe of it ſelf! If Chriſt roſe without a natural cauſe, even ſo ſhall we. 2. But why may I not ſay that the dead body of man hath a living Root, as truly as the plants in winter. The <hi>ſoul</hi> is the Root of the body, and the ſoul is ſtill alive: And Chriſt is the <hi>Root</hi> of the ſoul, and he is ſtill alive. For though we are dead, yet our <hi>Life is hid with Chriſt in God: and when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear</hi> (at the Spring of Reſurrection) then <hi>we ſhall alſo appear with him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3. 3, 4. And though there be no Phyſical contact between this living ſoul and the body, yet there is a Relative Union, and a deep rooted <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> to its body, and <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to it: ſo that it is mindful of it: and waiteth with longing for that hour when the command of God ſhall ſend it to revive that body. It is not incredible that a ſilly ſnail ſhould by its natural life and power make for it ſelf a beautiful habitation. Or that the life of a Roſe-tree that was buried in the root, ſhould fabricate a ſweet and beauteous Roſe by which it may make an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of its inviſible ſelf to the world. In how ſmall a room doth the life of a ſilk-worm lie (of which I ſpoke before) in the winter! That little grain or ſeed is ſuch as yields no ſign of life to the beholder: yet doth it form it ſelf a larger body, and that body ſpin its ſilken web out of its own ſubſtance, and in that, houſe it ſelf in a husk, and take to it ſelf another ſhape, and thence become a winged Fly, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate more.

But you ſay, the body being dead hath no natural root, nor way of receſs to life again, becauſe the privation is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. To which I anſwer, Firſt the Relative union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſoul and it, and the ſouls diſpoſition to the Return into its body, is as potent a cauſe of its reviving, as the natural union of the Root and branches: if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al you conſider that Chriſt is the Root of the ſoul. Rational agents if perfect, will work as certainly as Natural. For natural cauſes do nothing but by a Power communicated to them from an Intellectual cauſe, even God himſelf. Why ſhould Nature do any of theſe things but becauſe God that makes and ruleth all, will have it to be ſo? Now Jeſus Chriſt is the Political Head of the Church. The body in the grave hath its own Relation to him: Chriſt is ſtill living, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and engaged by promiſe, and enclined by Love, to revive that body. And as Chriſt is the life of the ſoul, ſo the ſoul is the life of the body; and this ſoul, as I ſaid, is waiting to be ſent again into it. And when the hour comes, what can hinder? The Love of the ſoul to its body, and its deſire to be reunited, is a kind of natural cauſe of the Reſurrection: A candle not lighted, is as far from light, and as much without it, as a dead body is without life. And yet one touch of a lighted candle will light that which never was lighted before. And ſo may one touch of the living ſoul that's now with Chriſt, put life into the body that lieth in the duſt. And as the lighted candle makes the other like it, and communicateth of its own nature to it; ſo doth
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34706:178"/>
the glorified ſoul communicate a new kind of excellency to the body, which it never had before: even to be a ſpiritual, glorious, incorruptible, and immortal body. In the firſt creating of man, the new formed body as to the matter of it, was no better than the body of a Beaſt or any common piece of earth. But the ſoul made the difference: when a Rational Soul was breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that Body, it advanced the very body to a dignity beyond the bodies of brutes, even ſuch as the natural body of man had before ſin. When Chriſt was about to repair faln man, it was the ſpirit of Chriſt informing: the ſoul that cauſed the renewed ſoul to communicate again a dignity to the bodies of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified men above other bodies. And ſo when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was dead becauſe of ſin, (having the root of ſin and death within it, and being mortal therefore) yet the ſpirit was life becauſe of Righteouſneſs (being the Root of holy and Righteous diſpoſitions, and the new life in man himſelf) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. For Chriſt the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal root of life, and the ſpirit and holineſs, are firſt in order of nature in the ſoul, and but by communication and ſecondarily in the Body: But contrarily, ſin made its entrance firſt by the Body, and hath its Root and Seat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt in order of nature in the body; &amp; it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the ſoul: Thus ſin comes in at the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, even at the wrong end, and by the baſer part: But Grace comes in the right way by the Nobler part; ſin hath its Root in the viler part: but Chriſt hath his ſeat firſt in the better part. And yet I muſt add 1. That ſin is not ripe till it reach the will, though it enter by the fleſh and ſenſes: it is not formed, nor to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin, till it reach the will, and as there it is ſcituated: but yet the thing it ſelf is firſt in and by the fleſh. 2. And the will is truly the ſeat of Original ſin it ſelf, as well as the ſenſitive part: but not the firſt Root of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34706:178"/>
the corruption. Though ſin be <hi>Worſt</hi> in the Rational part, becauſe the corruption of the beſt is the worſt, yet it is not <hi>firſt</hi> there. But Holineſs is <hi>firſt</hi> alſo in the ſoul, and ſo communicated to the body. And ſo alſo Glory it ſelf will be. And therefore take notice of the wiſe and gracious providence of God, that taketh the ſoul to heaven before-hand that it may be firſt Glorified, and ſo may be fit to communicate glory to the body: And ſo as the <hi>Natural Soul dignified</hi> the <hi>Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and the <hi>Sanctified Soul</hi> did <hi>Sanctifie</hi> the body, ſo <hi>the Glorified Soul</hi> by <hi>reunion</hi> with the <hi>body,</hi> ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate its <hi>Nature</hi> to the <hi>body</hi> at the Reſurrection, and ſo it will be made <hi>ſpiritual, immortal,</hi> and <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi> by the ſoul; and ſoul and body, are made ſuch by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So that by this time you may ſee that there is more <hi>Reaſon</hi> for the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> for all the body is turned to earth, than there is Reaſon that a Candle that's gone out ſhould be lighted again by another; or than there is <hi>Reaſon</hi> that I ſhould put on my cloaths in the morning which I put off at night. It's true, thoſe cloaths have no power to put on themſelves; nor is there any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſitating cauſe of it: but yet there is a <hi>Free cauſe</hi> in me, that will <hi>infallibly</hi> (if I live and be able) produce it: For nature diſpoſeth me to abhor naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deſire my cloaths, and therefore in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I will put them on. And ſo nature teacheth the ſeparated ſoul to deſire a reunion with its body; and therefore when the Reſurrection morning comes, it will gladly take the word from Chriſt, and give that vital touch to the body that ſhall revive it, and ſo put on its ancient garment; but wonderfully changed from <hi>fleſhly</hi> to <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> from <hi>diſhonourable</hi> into <hi>glorious.</hi>

                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:34706:179"/>And now I hope you ſee, that you may put off theſe cloths with patience and ſubmiſſion, and that it is no wrong to the fleſh it ſelf to be put off, but tendeth to its higheſt advancement at the laſt: Though the firſt cauſe of ſin, and the neſt of ſin ſhall be ſo broken firſt, that it ſhall firſt be ſeen what <hi>ſin hath</hi> done, before it be ſeen what <hi>Grace will</hi> do; and the fruit of our <hi>own</hi> wayes muſt firſt be taſted, before we ſhall fully feed and live upon the bleſſed fruit of the grace of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>11. Moreover, as there is a Reſurrection for the body it ſelf, and that to a more perfect eſtate than it can here attain, ſo the <hi>whole nature</hi> ſhall be perfected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our preſent comprehenſion. <hi>This</hi> life was not intended to be the place of our perfection, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it. As the fruit is far from ripeneſs in the firſt appearance, or the flower while it is but in the husk or bud; or the Oak when it is but an acorn; or any plant when it is but in the ſeed; no more is the very nature of man on earth: As the Infant is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Womb, nor the Chicken in the ſhell, no more are our natures perfect in this world. Methinks for the ſake of the body it ſelf, much more of the ſoul, if we are believers, we ſhould ſubmit contentedly to death. While you are here you know that creatures will fail you, enemies will hate you, friends will grieve you, neighbours will wrong you, Satan will tempt you and moleſt you; the world is changeable and will deceive you; all your comforts are mixed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts; the body carrieth about with it calamities enough of its own to weary it: What daily pains muſt it be at for the ſuſtentation of its ſelf in its preſent ſtate; and yet what grief and ſorrow muſt it undergo? Every member hath either its diſeaſe, or a diſpoſition thereto: What abundance of paſſages can pain and ſickneſs find
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34706:179"/>
to enter at; and how many rooms that are ready to receive them! As every member hath its uſe, ſo every one is capable of ſorrow; and the ſorrow of one is at leaſt as much communicated to the whole, as the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is: The pain of the ſimpleſt member, even of a tooth can make the whole body a weary of it ſelf. What is the daily condition of our fleſh, but weakneſs and ſuffering with care and labour to prevent much worſe, which yet we know cannot long be avoided: The ſorrow of many a mans life hath made him wiſh he had never been born: and why then ſhould he not wiſh as much to die, which doth ten thouſand fold more for him if he be a Chriſtian, than to be unborn would have done. Not a Relation ſo comfortable but hath its diſcomforts: Not a friend ſo ſuitable, but hath ſome diſcordancy: nor any ſo amiable and ſweet, but hath ſomewhat loathſome, troubleſome, and bitter. Not a place ſo pleaſant and commodious, but hath its unfitneſs &amp; diſcommodities: Not a Society ſo good and regular, but hath its corruptions and irregularities. And ſhould we be ſo loth to leave (whether naturally or violently) ſuch a life as this? When the fruit is ripe, ſhould it not be gathered? When the corn is ripe, would you have it grow there and not be cut? When the ſpirit hath hatched us for heaven, ſhould we be ſo loth to leave the ſhell or neſt? When we are begotten again to the hopes of immortality, ſhould we be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſtay in the womb? O Sirs, it is another kind of life that we ſhall have with God? They are purer comforts, that ſtay for us above! But if you will not have the Grapes to be gathered and preſt, how can you expect to have the Wine? Me thinks our fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34706:180"/>
to lie down in hope of the day when theſe ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>Little would an unbeliever think what a Body God will make of this, that now is corruptible fleſh and blood! It ſhall then be loathſome and troubleſome no more. It ſhall be hungry, or thirſty, or weary, or cold, or pained no more. As the ſtars of heaven do differ from a clod of earth, or from a carrion in a ditch, ſo will our glorified immortal bodies differ from this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal corruptible fleſh. If a skilful workman can turn a little earth and aſhes into ſuch curious tranſparent glaſſes, as we daily ſee: and if a little ſeed that bears no ſhew of ſuch a thing, can produce the more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flowers of the earth; and if a little acorn can bring forth the greateſt Oak; why ſhould we once doubt whether the ſeed of everlaſting life and glory which is now in the bleſſed ſouls with Chriſt, can by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a perfection to the fleſh that is diſſolved into its elements? There's no true beauty but that which is there received from the face of God: And if a glympſe made <hi>Moſes</hi> face to ſhine; what glory will Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry communicate to us, when we have the fulleſt endleſs intuition of it? <hi>There</hi> only is the ſtrength, and <hi>there's</hi> the riches, and <hi>there's</hi> the honour, and <hi>there's</hi> the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and here are but the ſhadows, and dreams, and names, and images of theſe precious things.</p>
               <p>And the perfection of the ſoul that's now imperfect, will be ſuch as cannot now be known. The very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and manner of Intellection, Memory, Volition, and Affections, will be unconceivably altered and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated, even as the ſoul it ſelf will be, and much more, becauſe of the change on the corruptible body, which in theſe acts it now makes uſe of. But of theſe things I have ſpoke ſo much in the <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> that I ſhall
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34706:180"/>
ſay no more of them now, but this; that in a Believer that expects this bleſſed change, and knows that he ſhall never till then be perfect, there is much unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in the inordinate unwillingneſs and fears of death.</p>
               <p>12. You know that fears and unwillingneſs can do no good, but much increaſe your ſuffering, and make your death a double death. If it be bitter naturally, make it not more bitter wilfully. I ſpeak this of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death for Chriſt as well as of a natural death; For as the one cannot be avoided if we would, ſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot be avoided when Chriſt calleth us to it, without the loſs of our Salvation: and therefore it may be called Neceſſary as well as the other. Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuffering and death is enough without th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> addition of unneceſſary fears.</p>
               <p>13. Nay were it but to put an end to the inordinate fears of death, even death it ſelf ſhould be the leſs fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us. Theſe very fears are troubleſome to many an upright ſoul: and ſhould we not deſire to be paſt them! As a woman with Child is in fear of the pain &amp; danger of her travel; but joyful when it's over; ſo is the true believer himſelf too oft afraid of the departing hour: but death puts an end to all thoſe fears. Is it the pain that you fear? Why how ſoon will it be over? Is it the ſtrangeneſs of your ſouls to God, and the place that you are paſſing to? This alſo will be quickly over; and one moment will give you ſuch full acquaintance with the bleſſed God, and the Celeſtial inhabitants, and the world in which you are to live, that you will find your ſelf no ſtranger there; but be more joyfully fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and content than ever you were in the boſom of your deareſt friend. The Infant in the Womb is a ſtranger to this lighter open world and all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it; and yet it is nor beſt ſtay there. You can fail for commodity to a Country that you never ſaw:
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34706:181"/>
and why cannot you paſs with peace and joy to a God, a Chriſt, a Heaven that you never ſaw? But yet you are not wholly a ſtranger there; Is it not that God that you have loved, and that hath firſt loved you? Have you not been brought into the world by him, and lived by him, and been preſerved and provided for by him? and do you not know him? Is it not your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he that hath given you his Son and his Spirit? have you not found an inclination towards him, deſires after him, and ſome taſte of his love, and communion with him, and yet are you wholly unacquainted with him? Know ye not him whom you have loved above all? in whom you have truſted? and whom you have daily ſerved in the world? Who have you lived to but him? for whom elſe have you laid out your time and labour? and yet do you not know him? And know you not that Chriſt that hath purpoſely come down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fleſh that you might know him? and that hath ſhewed himſelf to you in a holy life, and bitter death, and in abundant precious Goſpel mercies, and in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental repreſentations, that ſo he might entertain a familiarity with you, and infinite diſtance might not leave you too ſtrange to God? Know you not that Spirit that hath made ſo many a motion to your ſoul? that hath ſanctified you, and formed the image of God upon you, and hath dwelt in you ſo long? and made your hearts his very work-houſe, where he hath been daily doing ſomewhat for God? It is not poſſible that you ſhould be utterly ſtrange to him that you <hi>Live to,</hi> and <hi>Live from,</hi> and <hi>Live in;</hi> and not know him, by whom you know your ſelves and all things, nor ſee that Light by which you ſee whatever you ſee.</p>

And then, the Heaven that you are to go to, is it that you are an Heir of, where you have laid up your treaſure, and where your hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation hath ſo long been; and yet do you not know it? You have had many a thought of it, and beſtowed many a days labour for it, and yet do you not know it? <hi>O but you never ſaw it for all this?

And if you know this, you are not altogether ſtrangers to heaven. And for the Saints and heavenly Inhabitants, you are not wholly ſtrangers to them. Some of them you have known in the fleſh, and others of them you have known in the ſpirit: You <hi>are fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God,</hi> and therefore cannot be <hi>utterly</hi> unacquainted with them.</p>
               <p>But me thinks the ſtranger you are to God and to Heaven, and to the Saints, the more you ſhould deſire to be there where there is no ſtrangeneſs; This is not the time or place of moſt intimate acquaintance. If you would be acquainted, you ſhould draw nearer and

not draw back. It's death that muſt open you the door into that preſence where ſtrangeneſs will be no more.</p>
               <p>And if it be the doubts of your intereſt in Chriſt and life that makes you ſhrink and loth to die: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that to refuſe to die for Chriſt, is the way above all to increaſe thoſe doubts; but to give up your lives for him, or chearfully to ſurrender your ſouls to him at his call, is the readieſt ſureſt way in the world to prove you at preſent in a ſtate of grace; beſides that you will be haſtened into a ſtate of glory, where you ſhall be quickly and fully paſt all doubts of your ſtate of former grace. In a word, as all the fears and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of this life will then be at an end, ſo with the reſt will our fears of death: And therefore death ſhould be the more welcome, becauſe it is the end, as of all other troubles, ſo of theſe diſturbing fears.</p>
               <p>14. Conſider alſo what a multitude have trod this bloody way before you. Almoſt all that ever were born have died, and are now in the world that you are paſſing to. You are not the firſt that entred at this narrow gate. The deareſt Saints of God have died. If <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Joſhua, David, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> could not eſcape the ſtroak of death, what are you that you ſhould murmur to follow ſuch and ſo many that have gone before you?

Is it not better be where is nothing but the perfect love of the Infinite God, in perfect Saints and bleſſed Angels, than to live among perverſe ungodly men that make you almoſt weary of your lives? If it be a delight to us to read the writings of the illuminated Saints of God, and we think them ſuch Jewels and Ornaments in our Libraries; what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would it be to converſe with them that wrote theſe Books, and that in their celeſtial perfection, where they have attained a thouſand times more light than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had; and where all the doubts are reſolved which their books could not reſolve.

They converſe with us, though we ſee them not, and are about us night and day; They are among us in our holy aſſemblies, obſerving our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour before the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. and they are witneſſes of our good and evil, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 6. From them, as the Servants of God, was the Law received, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 53. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. They read our books, and ſtudy with us the Myſteries of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. And as near as they are to God, they are glad to make the Church their book in which to read his manifold wiſdom, and know it by beholding it in us as in a glaſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 10.

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. They aſcend and deſcend as ordinary paſſengers between heaven and earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12.

They convoy our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſouls to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. They ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Chriſt at his ſecond coming, as they prcolaimed his firſt, and attended him on earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 31. <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 38. They ſhall be his Heralds to call up the dead to judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39, 49. &amp; 24. 31. And at laſt we ſhall be their companions and equal to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 36. So that you ſee we have the ſame Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inviſible, which we ſhall have in heaven: Yea and ſometime when God is pleaſed, they manifeſt their preſence by viſible or audible apparitions. And ſhall we fear to remove into the preſence of theſe bleſſed ſpirits that now attend us, and are ſtill about us, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſo much of our good?</p>
               <p>Yea the Lord Jeſus Chriſt came down to be familiar with us, and to bring us into a ſtate of friendſhip, and holy boldneſs with God himſelf: And yet ſhall we draw back?</p>
               <p>17. I would put this queſtion to you for your ſerious anſwer, Can you be contented, yea do you deſire, to have no more of God than here you have? Is this much of the knowledge of him, and his will and works ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for you? Would you be no nearer him, and enjoy no more of him? What ever your fleſh ſay, ſure the love of God in your hearts will not ſuffer you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately to ſay ſo. Conſult with your new nature, with the holy principle that is in you; Me thinks you ſhould not be content to remain for ever at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God as you are? If you can, I blame you not to be afraid of death. If not; Why then are you loth to go to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:34706:184"/>18. And I would ask you alſo, Whether you are content with the meaſure of ſanctification which you have, or which is to be attained in this life? Are you content to live for ever with no more knowledge or love of God? No more faith or love to Chriſt? No more ſenſe of the worth of Grace? No more righteouſneſs or peace or joy in the Holy Ghoſt? No more meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility, or heavenly mindedneſs? Are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented rather to live for ever under all the pride and ignorance and paſſion, and ſelfiſhneſs and luſt and worldlineſs, and all other ſins that here beſet you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to remove to the place of perfection, and yield that death ſhall break the veſſel and neſt of your corruptions? If you care ſo little for the grace of God, and ſee ſo little beauty in his image, and ſee ſo little odiouſneſs in ſin, that you had rather keep it for ever, than go to God by the paſſage of death, I blame you not to be afraid to die: But if otherwiſe; Why do you deſire perfection and deliverance, and yet be ſo loth to come and receive it? When you know that it is not to be had on earth.</p>
               <p>19. Moreover, are you contented to remain for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as unſerviceable to God as here you are? Alas! how little do you for him: how much do you to diſpleaſe him? lay together all the ſervice of your lives, and how ſmall and poor a matter is it? And would you ſtill live at theſe rates? Will this content you? Me thinks it ſhould not if you have grace in your hearts. Why then do you not deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt? There you ſhall be perfectly fitted for his ſervice, and therefore perfectly perform it. What other ſervice God will have for us, we cannot yet tell; but Love and Praiſe we are ſure will be the chief, and the reſt will be good and holy and honourable, what ever it be. If you are Chriſtians, me thinks the ſenſe of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34706:184"/>
and of your unpleaſing frame of heart and life, ſhould be your daily grief! and therefore you ſhould deſire the ſtate where you may be more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not be ſo unwilling of it.</p>
               <p>20. Laſtly, I would ask you, Are you contented to attain no other end of all your life and labours and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings than here you do attain? What is it that you pray for, and ſeek and ſtrive for? is it for no more than is to be had on earth? If you have no higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, intentions or deſires, I cannot much blame you to be loth to die. But if you have, me thinks no man ſhould be unwilling to attain his end. What have you done and ſuffered ſo much for heaven, and now would you not go to it? Had you rather all your labour were loſt? Do you deſire to be happy, or do you not? If you do, (as certainly you do) would you not go where happineſs it to be had, when you are ſure that it is not not to be had on earth? What ſay you! is there not plain reaſon in all this that I propound to you? It is a ſad caſe, when men ſeek not God and Heaven as their felicity, but only as a leſſer evil than hell, which they would <hi>endure,</hi> rather than <hi>enjoy,</hi> when they can keep no longer this earthly life which they account their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; where this is the caſe, it's a ſad caſe. And were not this a common caſe, there would not be ſo much unwillingneſs to depart.</p>
               <p>And now Chriſtian Reader, I beſeech thee weigh theſe foregoing Conſiderations, and judge whether it be not a contradiction to thy profeſſion, and unſeemly for a believer to be unwilling to die when God ſhall call him: Much more to caſt away evelaſting life, for the ſaving of his temporal life but a little longer! O learn the needful leſſon of ſelf-denial, eſpecially in this point of denying your lives! He that can do this, can do all; and may be ſure that he is mortified indeed:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34706:185"/>
And he that can do all the reſt, and ſticks but at this, and could part with any thing for Chriſt ſave his life, doth indeed do nothing, nor is it eſteemed <hi>ſelf-denying.</hi> It is a leſſon therefore that is exceeding neceſſary to be learn'd, and worthy all your time and diligence, even to deny your <hi>Lives</hi> for the love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay, <hi>We live in days of peace and liberty, and therefore are not like to be called to Martyrdom: What need then have we to learn this leſſon?</hi> I anſwer, 1. You are uncertain what chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you may ſee: but if you never ſuffer, yet you muſt be ſure that you have a <hi>heart</hi> that <hi>would</hi> ſuffer if God did call you to it: For though you may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering, where you are not called to it, yet you cannot be ſaved without a heart that would ſuffer if you were put upon it. 2. And if you cannot deny your <hi>lives</hi> for Chriſt, you will not <hi>ſincerely</hi> deny your pleaſures, or profits or honours for him. If you would not ſuffer death for him if he called you to it, you will not <hi>ſincerely</hi> ſuffer loſſes and wrongs and reproaches for him, which almoſt every Chriſtian muſt expect. So that to try your own ſincerity, you ſhould look after it. 3. And it is certain that death will ſhortly come; and then if you have not learnt this leſſon, to deny your ſelves even in caſe of life, you will die unwillingly and uncomfortably.</p>
               <p>At leaſt me thinks, I might reaſon thus with any man of you, good or bad. Either death is indeed ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, or not. If it be not, why do you ſo fear it when it comes! If it be, why do you not as well fear it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes, even in your youth and health? For you are ſure then that you muſt die, as if it were upon you. A wonderful thing it is, that mans heart ſhould be ſo unreaſonably inſenſible; and that there ſhould be ſo great a difference in the affections of moſt in regard
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34706:185"/>
of death. It's no matter of doubt or controverſie whether they ſhall die. He is a block and not a man, that knoweth it not as certainly now, as he ſhall do in his ſickneſs. And yet, in health theſe wretches will not be awakened ſo much to fear it, as may reſtrain them from ſin, and help them to prepare for it. It's troubleſome preciſe talk with them, to talk of making ready to die: Either they ſlight it, or love not to hear or think of it. And yet the ſame men when death is coming, and they ſee they muſt away, are even amazed with fear and horror: And I cannot blame them unleſs they were in a better caſe. But this I muſt blame them for, as moſt unreaſonable, that they can make ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable complaint when death and Hell are near hand, and yet make ſo light of it all their life time.</p>

               <p>BUt becauſe this is the hardeſt part of ſelf-denial, and yet moſt neceſſary, and the particular ſubject of my Text, I ſhall ſtay upon it yet ſo much longer as to reſolve a queſtion of ſome doubting Chriſtians, and to give you ſome Directions for the furtherance of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial herein.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If it be a neceſſary part of ſelf-denial to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our own lives; I am much afraid that I am no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt, as having no true ſelf-denial? For I find that for all theſe Reaſons I cannot be willing to die, but when you have ſaid all that can be ſaid, death is the moſt terrible thing in the world to me. Anſw.</hi> I pray you lay together theſe following particulars for
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34706:186"/>
anſwer to this great and common doubt. 1. Death as death, is naturally dreadful to all, and the beſt men as men are naturally averſe to it and abhor it. No man can deſire death as death, nor ought to do it. If it had not been an evil to nature, it had not been fit to be the matter of Gods puniſhment, and to be Threatned to the world. Threatnings would not do their work if that which is threatned were not naturally evil, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dreadful to the ſubject. To threaten men with a benefit is a contradiction, as much as to promiſe him a miſchief, and more. 2. It is not therefore a ſimple. Diſplacency or Averſeneſs to die, that God requireth you to lay by. Self-denial conſiſteth not in reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to Death as death; For then he might as well perſwade us to become Angels, as to deny our ſelves, and Preachers had as hard a work to do as to perſwade men to ceaſe to be men. Death will be an enemy as long as it is death. Even the ſeparated ſoul hath ſo natural an inclination to union with its Body, that the ſeparation is part of the penalty to it: And though heaven be their joy, and Chriſt their life and fulneſs, yet the ſeparation from the body which they have even with Chriſt is a penalty; and they have not that perfect meaſure of Joy and Glory as they ſhall have when they are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the body again. So that ſeparation as ſuch is penal to the ſoul in bleſſedneſs. And even the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt that was more bleſſed than ours, was, as ſeparated, in a ſtate of penalty, when his body was in the grave (Of which ſee my Appendix to the Reformed Paſtor, about the Deſcent into Hell.) 3. That which you have to look after therefore in your ſouls, is not a love to death, or willingneſs to death as death, which no man hath or ſhould have; but it is, 1. A <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to it as a <hi>leſs evil</hi> than ſin and Hell and the Diſpleaſure of God: and a chooſing <hi>rather</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:34706:186"/>
to die than wilfully to ſin and forſake the Lord. 2. And a Love to that glory in the fruition of God, which death is the paſſage to. Seeing we cannot obtain the end of our faith and patience by any eaſier paſſage than death, you muſt rather be content to go this ſtrait and grievous way, than miſs of the ſtate of eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Let death be never ſo odious and dreadful to you, if you had but rather die than forſake Chriſt by ſin, or miſs of everlaſting life with God, you have that true ſelf-denial, even of life it ſelf, which is required in my Text. 4. And yet even a gracious ſoul may be ſo much unprepared as to deſire to ſtay yet longer on earth, though he be abſent from the Lord while he is preſent in the body; that ſo a better preparation may be made: And alſo the love of God may make a man deſire to ſtay yet longer for the ſervice of the Church, or <hi>to be</hi> with <hi>Paul in a ſtrait between two,</hi> Phil. 1. 21, 22, 23. 5. Have you not ſuch pleaſant apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and the coming of Chriſt in glory, and the bleſſed ſtate of the Saints in heaven, as that you could moſt gladly enter into that bleſſed ſtate by any other way than death: And had you not rather die, than miſs of that felicity? At leaſt, when you know that die you muſt, had you not rather die ſooner, even a violent death by perſecution, than miſs of your eternal life, by ſaving your lives a little longer? 6. And for your unwillingneſs to die, as death is the <hi>laſt</hi> enemy to be conquered by Chriſt, at the Reſurrection, ſo the <hi>fears</hi> of death and the <hi>power</hi> of it, is the laſt evil that we ſhall be troubled with; and you muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be fully freed from theſe fears, in this life: for death will be death, and man will be man. But yet let me tell you that before you die, God may very much abate your fears; and very ordinarily doth ſo with his ſervants; 1. By giving them that grace that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34706:187"/>
is ſuited to a dying ſtate; and 2. By the help of ſickneſs and pain it ſelf: And that is one great reaſon why ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall uſually go before death, that pain and miſery may make the fleſh even a weary of it ſelf, and make the ſoul a weary of its companion, and both a weary of this miſerable life.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall briefly name ſome few Directions which if you will practiſe, you will more eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to death.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="40" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XL.</hi> Directions to be willing to die.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. BY all means endeavour the ſtrengthening of your Belief of the Reality of eternal life, and the truth of the promiſe of Chriſt concerning it. For if you Believe it not, you cannot die for it; nor chearfully ſubmit to a natural death, through the hopes of it. This is the ſum or principal work of the Chriſtian faith, <hi>to Believe the everlaſting life as procured for us by the love of the Father, the Obedience, Death, Reſurrection and Interceſſion of the Son, and the Sanctification of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is the unſoundneſs or the weakneſs of this Belief, that is the principal cauſe of our unwillingneſs to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. By all means endeavour to get and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Aſſurance of your Title to this Promiſe and Felicity. Get ſound evidence, and keep it clear: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge all blots without delay. Take heed of ſuch ſin as woundeth Conſcience, and waſteth comfort, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſpirit of Adoption by which you are ſealed to the day of Redemption, and by which you have your
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34706:187"/>
peace and comforts. If by ſuch ſin your ſouls are clouded and eſtranged from God, be diligent in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for healing and reconciliation; and reſt not till your peace be made with God. For while you think of him as diſpleaſed, you will be afraid of coming to him, and this will double the fears of Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Deny your ſelves firſt in the carnal and worldly comforts of this life, or elſe you are unlikely to deny your ſelves in the matter of Life it ſelf. Diſuſe your ſelves from unneceſſary pleaſures of the fleſh: And learn to endure diſhonour, contempt and reproach from the world, and ſickneſs and poverty when it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on you by the hand of God. Till you can deny your eaſe, and profit, and appetite, and honour, and all the delight of this preſent world, you are never likely to deny your lives ſincerely. To deny your lives doth contain the denying of all theſe and more; and therefore you muſt learn the leſſer, if you would do the greater. Theſe are the <hi>parts</hi> of life as it were; and it's eaſier thus to overcome it in its <hi>parts</hi> than in the whole; when particular Souldiers are deſtroyed, the Army is the weaker.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>uſe</hi> of ſuffering the <hi>Afflictions</hi> of this life, will make you hardy, and make death ſeem a ſmaller matter. For when you thus <hi>Die Daily,</hi> you will the more eaſily <hi>die once.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, Death is <hi>half diſarmed</hi> when the Pleaſures &amp; Intereſts of the fleſh are firſt denied. For the leaving of fleſhly contents and pleaſures, is much of the reaſon of mens unwillingneſs to die. And therefore when theſe are denied before-hand, the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of your unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are taken away. If you pull down the Neſt, the Birds will be gone. Men that are loth to leave their Country, would willingly be gone, if their houſes were fired, or they were turned out of doors, and their
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:34706:188"/>
friends and goods were all ſent away. This is it that makes men ſo unwilling to die, becauſe they practiſe not Mortification in their health, but contrarily ſtudy to live as Pleaſingly as may be to the fleſh, and think it part of their Chriſtian Liberty, thus making Chriſt a carnal Saviour as the Jews conceive of their expected Meſſiah; and taking up with a carnal falſe ſalvation, not purchaſed by Chriſt, but given by Satan in the name of Chriſt, and aſſumed by themſelves. They make it their buſineſs to have buildings, and lands, and meats, and drinks, and honours, and all things as pleaſing as may be to the fleſh, and then they <hi>complain</hi> that <hi>they are unwilling to die:</hi> and I eaſily believe him: it is no wonder! They make it the work of their lives to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their neſts, and make Proviſion for the fleſh; and then complain, that they are loth to leave thoſe neſts that they have been feathering ſo long, and loth to ſcatter all the heap and treaſure which they have been gathering. And did you think that gathering it was the way to make you willing to leave it? Men load themſelves with the lumber and baggage of the world, and then complain that they cannot travel on their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but had rather ſit down. They fall a building them habitations in their way, when they ſhould have none but Inns or Tents; and when they have beſtowed all their time, and coſt, and charges on them, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their hearts for being loth to leave them. Such mad doings as theſe are not the way to be willing to die: To provide for <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> in your Life-time, is not the way to <hi>Deny</hi> your Lives. Sirs, the way is this, if you will learn it, and ſtick not at the coſt and trouble: <hi>Self</hi> muſt be here ſtript naked of all its carnal comforts, ſo that it ſhall have nothing left o fly to or truſt upon, nor nothing leſt t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

caſt out all their goods, and leave them nothing but the bare walls, and not ſo much as a bed to lie on, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the houſe over their heads, and then they will be gone. So if you caſt out all your ſenſual commodities and delights, that when the fleſh looks about, it ſhall ſee nothing but the bare walls, and cannot find a reſting place, then death will be leſs grievous and leſs unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Or rather indeed even the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be mortified; and in the ſenſe in which it muſt be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt have no being or life, (that is, as it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from its ſubordination to God) And then there will be nothing to riſe up againſt your ſubmiſſion to Death. Though nature as nature will keep you from <hi>Loving</hi> death as death, yet were but ſelf-denial perfect, there would be nothing to keep you from <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to it, and deſiring to paſs through it to immortality. O that you would but try ſuch a ſelf-denying life, and you would certainly die an eaſie, comfortable Death.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Suffer not unworthy thoughts of God to abide in your ſoul. Think not of his Infinite Love and Goodneſs with doubtfulneſs or diminution. You will never be willing to come to God, while you think of him as cruel, or as a deſpiſer of his creatures, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do Good. But when once you think of him as the ſureſt greateſt Good, and your faſteſt friend, and the moſt lovely object that can be conceived of, and theſe thoughts are deep and wrought into the very nature of your ſoul, then you will be ready more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to die. No man can love the preſence of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or an enemy, or of him that is ſo far above him, that there is no communion with him to be had. If you entertain ſuch blaſphemous thoughts of God, you are unlikely ever to deſire his preſence. See you think as honourably and magnificently of the Goodneſs and Love of God, as you do of his Knowledge or his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34706:189"/>
Power; and as you would abhor any extenuating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the one, ſo do of the other; And then the Lovelineſs and glory of his face, will draw out your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and make you long to be with God.</p>

It is love that is the Divine and heavenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in us: and therefore muſt needs incline us hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-wards. The nature of love is to long after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him that we love. The more Love, the more of God in the ſoul, and the more deſire after God. This is the grace that muſt live for ever, and therefore bendeth towards the place of its perfection. It's want of Love to God, that maketh moſt of us ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be from him.

you ſhall know them all, in God himſelf who is more than all. Study and admire him in the courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences: ſtudy and admire him in the perſon of Chriſt; in the frame of his holy life; in the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the holy frame of his Laws and Covenants; ſtudy and admire him in his Saints and the frame of his holy Image on their ſouls.

For if you uſe your ſelves to this heavenly life, it will much incline you to deſire to be there. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe fear, and godly ſorrow, and care in their places: but eſpecially after Faith and Love, be ſure to live in holy Joy and Praiſe. Be much in the conſideration of all that Riches of grace in Chriſt, communicated and to be communicated to you. And be much in Thanks to God for his mercies; and chearing and comforting your ſoul, in the Lord your God: And thus the Joy of Grace will much diſpoſe you to the Joys of glory; &amp; the Peace which the Kingdom of God conſiſteth in, will incline you to the peace of the everlaſting Kingdom: and the chearful Praiſing of God on Earth, in Pſalms or other ways of Praiſe, will prepare and diſpoſe you to the heavenly Praiſes. And therefore, Chriſtians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wrong their ſouls, and hinder themſelves from a willingneſs to be with God in ſpending all their days in drooping, or doubting, or worldly dulneſs, and laying by ſo much the Joy of the Saints, and the Praiſes of God.</p>

and what you muſt <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſs,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> for ever. Daily think of the Certainty, Perfection, and Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruity of your Bleſſedneſs.

Laſtly, if you would be willing to ſubmit to death, reſign up your own underſtandings and wills to the wiſdom and the will of God; and Know not good and evil for your carnal ſelves: but wholly truſt your lives and ſouls to the Wiſdom and Love of your deareſt Lord. Muſt you be carking and caring for your ſelves when you have an Infinite God enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to care for you? <hi>O</hi> ſaith <hi>ſelf, I am not able to bear the terrors and pangs of death. O</hi> ſaith Faith, <hi>My Lord is eaſily able to ſupport me, and it is his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken work to do it: My work is but to Pleaſe him; and it's his work to take care of me in life and death; and therefore though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet will I fear no evil. O</hi> ſaith <hi>Self, I am utterly a ſtranger to another world! I know not what I ſhall ſee, nor what I ſhall be, nor whither I ſhall go the next minute after death: None come from the dead to ſatisfie us of theſe things! O</hi> but ſaith Faith, My bleſſed Father and Redeemer is not a ſtranger to the place that I muſt go to! He knows it, though I do not! He knows what I ſhall
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34706:190"/>
be and do, and whither I ſhall go; and all is in his power: And ſeeing it belongs not to me but to him to diſpoſe of me, and give me the promiſed reward, it is meet that I reſt in <hi>his</hi> underſtanding; And it is better for me, that his Infinite Wiſdom diſpoſe of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting ſoul, than my ſhallow inſufficient knowledge. I may much more acquieſce in his knowledge than my own. <hi>O</hi> but ſaith <hi>ſelf, I fear it may prove a change of darkneſs and confuſion to my ſoul! what will become of me, I cannot tell.</hi> O but ſaith Faith, I am ſure I am in the hands of Love! and ſuch Love as is Omnipotent and engaged for my good! and how can it then go ill with me! If I had my own will, I ſhould not fear: And how much leſs ſhould I fear when I am at the will of God, even of moſt Wiſe, Almighty Love.</p>
               <p>There is no true Centre for the ſoul to Reſt in but the Will of God. It is our buſineſs to Obey and Pleaſe his Will, as dutiful Children; and to commit our ſelves contentedly to his Will for the abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of us. It is not poſſible that the Will of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father ſhould be againſt his Children, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſincere endeavour hath been to Obey and Pleaſe his Will. And therefore learn this as your great and neceſſary Leſſon, with Joyful Confidence to Commit your ſelves, and your departing ſouls to your Fathers Will, as knowing that your Death is but the execution of that Will, which is engaged to cauſe all things to work together for your good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. And ſay with <hi>Paul, I ſuffer, but am not aſhamed</hi> [<hi>for I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12. &amp; 1 Tim. 4. 10. [<hi>Therefore we labour and ſuffer—becauſe we truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe</hi>] ſay therefore as <hi>Job,</hi> [<hi>Though he kill

me, yet will I truſt in him</hi>] Or rather as Chriſt, [<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into thy hands I commend my Spirit</hi>] Luke 23. 46. If the hands and Will of the Father was the Rock and comfort of Chriſt in his ſuffering and death, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it muſt be to us. See therefore that in your health you Kill your own wills, that when Death comes, <hi>ſelf</hi> may have no will to ſtrive againſt the Will of God; but as your Heaven it ſelf will be your <hi>Reſt in the Will of God;</hi> ſo Reſt in it in death, that you may have a taſte of Heaven in Death, and ſure that will ſweeten it, if any thing will.</p>

               <p>III. THe third part of the Objective Intereſt of Self, is that which goes commonly under the name of <hi>Honour;</hi> and is called by the Apoſtle, [Pride of Life] and put by him in the third place. And of this, I intend, if God will give me time and ſtrength, to write alſo a Treatiſe by it ſelf, and therefore ſhould ſay nothing of it here; but only leſt I ſhould not have time to do that which I deſire, I ſhall briefly name you ten of the particulars under this head of <hi>Honour,</hi> which you muſt deny: that is, Ten ways wherein men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Pride.</p>
               <p>1. One work of Pride <hi>is to climb higher into places of ſuperiority and honour and command.</hi> Poor men that are out of hope, and in no capacity for riſing, feel not much of this, though the Diſpoſition to it be in them as well as others, becauſe it is not drawn forth by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But where opportunity ſerveth, there is nothing wherein <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> doth more conſtantly and obſtinately ſhew it ſelf than in this. It is the Nature of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> to aſpire after the higheſt exaltation in the world that can be attained. We may eaſily obſerve in Kingdoms and Corporations, and all Societies of men, what Chriſt obſerved at their feaſts, that [they chooſe out the chief rooms, and ſit with the higheſt] <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 7, 8. What eager deſires have they to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> other men? If any office or ſeat of Honour be void, there is few that apprehend any poſſibility of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, that want a will to it; Yea few that will not ſeek and ſtrive for it, and envy thoſe that carry it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and hate, or bear a grudge to thoſe that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:34706:192"/>
were againſt their riſing: yea few but venture on the moſt unlawful means to accompliſh their deſires, &amp; yet will ſcarce believe that they are unlawful, becauſe they think them neceſſary to their ends. There is few, if they had the choice of a man to any vacant place of honour, that would chuſe any other but themſelves; unleſs their unfitneſs were likely more to dishonour them, or ſome way to make their honors too burdenſom to them. No man in their eyes is ſo fit as themſelves, or ſo worthy as themſelves: Or if it be their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Kinſmen that ſtand for it, or any that <hi>ſelf</hi> hath ſpecial intereſt in, they ſeem the worthieſt for the place, becauſe they are related to <hi>them.</hi> Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be any eminent Dignity or command, that ſeems to them a prey that's worth the hunting after. O the blinding, bewitching, befooling power of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Selfiſhneſs!</hi> How commonly doth it rule! How few are thoſe holy, happy men, that have eſcaped and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome it! How few Societies be there in the world, whether Corporations, Colledges, or the like, but Pride and Selfiſhneſs makes their Governors? How few Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Earth, where <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> maketh not their Kings or Soveraigns? And is it any wonder if they be all ill-governed then, where the Devil doth ſo much to chooſe the Governors? I know that God over-ruleth all, and reſtraineth the luſts of men, and croſſeth their deſigns; but yet their luſts and the Devil may Rule to their deſtruction for all that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But is it not lawful to ſeek for dignity and ſuperiority?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: not for <hi>ſelf;</hi> but for God it is. You have warnings enough, and plain enough from Chriſt, if warnings would ſerve turn: He hath bid you [<hi>ſit not down in the higheſt room:</hi>] he hath ſharply rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them that ſtrive for precedency, and who ſhall be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34706:192"/>
the greateſt: He hath told you, he that will be the greateſt, muſt be the ſervant of all: and hath told you of ſtooping to the feet of the meaneſt, and condeſcending to men of low degree; and hath ſet little children before you to be your Teachers, and aſſured you that there is no entrance into his Kingdom in any other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. He hath told you that God reſiſteth and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Proud, and that he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted, and he that exalteth himſelf ſhall be brought low.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But how ſhall I know whether I ſeek prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for God or my ſelf? I hope it's God that I ſeek it for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How ſhall a man know his own mind? you have dark hearts indeed if you cannot know your own Intentions, if you are but obſervant, and diligent, and willing to know them. 2. He that ſeeketh not Dignities for himſelf, but for God, will never ſeek to put by another that is as able and likely to do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the place as he: Nor will he ſeek it at all, if he ſee that God may be ſerved as well without his ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: but will ſtay till God call him to it, and then he may expect his help and bleſſing. Few do intend God in it, that are Exalters of themſelves. Indeed if you ſee that an enemy of the Goſpel, or ſome unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ungodly man is like to come into the place if you ſeek it not, by which the Church or the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is like to be much injured, then you may ſeek it by lawful means; ſo that you can truly ſay, I would not do it for my ſelf; but it is to ſerve God for his peoples good. 3. Nay he that ſeeketh not the Dignity for himſelf, will ſeek firſt and more to get in another, if he know another that is fitter than himſelf, and likely to do God more ſervice: and this he will do heartily, and not diſſemblingly. If you had not rather a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34706:193"/>
and more uſeful man were preferred before you, and ſeek not more for ſuch than for your ſelves, you are plain ſelf-ſeekers, whatever you may pretend. If a man ſhould come to almoſt any of the Rulers of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Churches, Colledges or Corporations that have ſcrued themſelves into the place of Government, and ask them, Did you know no man fitter for this place than your ſelf, and have you ſought firſt to get in a fitter man? what can they for ſhame ſay to it? If they ſay, <hi>No;</hi> they proclaim themſelves notorious ſelf-ſeekers! For it's very ſeldom, that an humble man is allowed to judge himſelf the fitteſt. 4. And he that ſeeketh Dignities for God and not for <hi>himſelf,</hi> will uſe them for God, and not for <hi>himſelf.</hi> For the Intention will command the <hi>uſe.</hi> He will deny himſelf in his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority as well as if he were in the loweſt place; and will contrive how he may moſt ſerve and honour God: and this will be eaſily ſeen in his endeavours, whether it be God or ſelf that he ſerves and liveth to.</p>
               <p>And now I adviſe all that love their ſouls, to take heed of this aſpiring act of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> If you will needs ſeek your ſelves, and be your own Exalters, you muſt truſt to your ſelves, and be your own defenders: And then you will find that the loweſt condition in the hand of God, is more ſafe and comfortable than the higheſt in your own hand. If God ſhould lift you up to the top of the higheſt mountains, you may expect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a calm, or his protection in the ſtorm, and to be as ſafe as thoſe below: but if you lift up your ſelves, and Satan carry you to the pinacle of the Temple, take heed leſt you thence caſt down your ſelves by his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that did lift you up. Dignities and Honours, are not indeed the things that they ſeem to be to carnal eyes that ſee not the inſide, but judge by the outward glittering ſhew. There is moſt holy Duty and work
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34706:193"/>
to be done, where is the greateſt dignity. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the life of greateſt work &amp; labour is not the life of greateſt eaſe, or carnal pleaſure: eſpecially when it is the work of God that you muſt do: a work which all the world is againſt, and which Satan and all his power will reſiſt: and which muſt meet with enmity and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of enmity, when ever you ſet about it: Though you are Commanders, yet you are Souldiers; and you that are Leaders have the hotteſt ſtanding, and muſt expect the ſharpeſt conflicts. Do you think of your Dignities and Offices as places of meer ſuperiority and honour and accommodation to your carnal ſelves? then are you Carnal men, and enter upon you know not what, and make your ſelves Traitors and Enemies to God, whom he is engaged to bring down and be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on at laſt: you debaſe the ſacred coin which bears the ſtamp and name of God. Magiſtracy is holy, and the Image of God, and you baſely turn it into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the fleſh; and blot out Gods name from it, and ſtamp upon it the name of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and traiterouſly make it your own, which was eminently his. Believe it, whoever you are, if you ſeek for places of Rule and Dignity with carnal ſelfiſh expectations, you muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe them accordingly when you have them, which is the readieſt way to damnation in the world, or elſe you muſt find your expectations croſt, and mifs of all your carnal Ends; and find that the greateſt toil and burden, which you expected ſhould have been your chief content. God hath annexed the Honour and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward greatneſs, partly to encourage you to ſo hard a work, leſt the burden ſhould be too heavy, and partly to enable you to perform it, and give you ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages againſt oppoſition. But though the cloathing of Authority and Rule be ſplendid, the ſubſtance thus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered is extraordinary Labour, and duty, and ſuffering.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34706:194"/>
It is Honourable, but it's an honourable burden, and an honourable painful difficult work. So that if men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what Office and Authority is in Church or Common-wealth, and look'd after the ſubſtance as well as the ornaments; the work as well as the Honour and Greatneſs; it would be an eminent piece of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial</hi> for a man to ſubmit to the call of God, to be a Prince, a Judge, a Juſtice, or but a Conſtable: and men would as hardly be drawn to take the Office, as they are now to do the work of the Office in faithfulneſs and with courage and zeal for God; and that is almoſt as hard as an offendor is drawn to the ſtocks: Offices and high places, are not intended to accommodate the fleſh; nor are they things to be ambitiouſly deſired and ſought for, by ſuch as underſtand the Ends and uſe of them: but they are ſuch laborious, hazardous ways of ſerving God, which a wiſe man knows muſt coſt him more, than the honour will repay, and which a Good man will not run away from, when God calleth him thereto; but will ſo far Deny himſelf as to ſubmit to them; but not thruſt himſelf into them, as the Proud and ſelfiſh do. It is a work of Patience to a Godly man to be thus exalted; but it is a work of Pride and ſelf-ſeeking in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Deny your ſelves ſo far as to ſubmit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment &amp; dignity, &amp; bear it patiently if it be caſt upon you, as being an excellent opportunity of ſerving God: But wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> not for it, becauſe of the Honour and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the fleſh: much leſs contend for it, or ſet your hearts on it. He that ſeeketh an Office or Honour for himſelf, muſt have another heart before he will uſe it for God. It's better with <hi>Saul</hi> to hide our ſelves from honour, than with <hi>Abſalom</hi> to contrive and ſeek it: but beſt of all with <hi>David</hi> to ſtay till God call us, and then obey.</p>

               <p>2. ANother part of <hi>ſelfiſh Intereſt</hi> to be <hi>Denied,</hi> is <hi>the Love, and good Will, and Word of others.</hi> This is a thing that may and muſt be deſired to good ends; but not for <hi>carnal ſelf.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> look'd at Gods honour and the good of ſouls, he [<hi>became all things to all men that he might by all means ſave ſome; and this he</hi> did, not for <hi>ſelf</hi> but <hi>for the Goſpels ſake,</hi> and yet for himſelf in ſubordination to God, that he <hi>might be partaker of it with them</hi>] He would <hi>give no offence to Jew or Gentile, or the Church of God: but pleaſed all men in all things</hi> (that tended to their good) <hi>not ſeeking his own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved</hi>] 1 Cor. 10. 32, 33. And he hath left it as the duty of the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians, [<hi>not to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but every one to pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification.</hi>] But when <hi>Paul</hi> look'd at <hi>himſelf,</hi> and his eſteem among men, then he ſaith [<hi>With me it is a very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be judged of you or of mans judgment</hi>] 1 Cor. 4. 3. And Gal. 1. 10. [<hi>Do I ſeek to pleaſe men? For if I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt.</hi>] Good natures are loth to provoke others to diſpleaſure: and Grace moveth us to Pleaſe men for the ſaving of their ſouls. But it's <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-ſeeking</hi> to deſire to ſet up our ſelves in mens eſteem, and to endear our ſelves for our ſelves into their affections. It is Gods higheſt honour to be highlieſt eſteemed, and dearlieſt beloved, as being the moſt perfect and tranſcendent Good. And Proud men in this world aſpire to his Prerogative; and much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to be <hi>beloved</hi> of all: and fain they would <hi>ſit</hi> near
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:34706:195"/>
mens hearts, and be the darlings of the world. This is a fine, but dangerous ſin: and I doubt many that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, never well conſidered that it is a ſin, and ſo great a ſin as indeed it is. Deny your ſelves in this. It is God that muſt be Loved of all, and not you: You muſt be content to <hi>be hated of all men for his name ſake,</hi> that he may be beloved. Mens hearts were not made to be <hi>your</hi> throne, but Gods. Your work is to Love, and not ambitiouſly to ſeek for love. So far as your intereſt in mens affections doth conduce to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſervice, and their good, deſire it, and ſpare not: But ſee that theſe be really your ends. But for your ſelves take heed of deſiring or ſeeking for mens Love. They are apt enough to have inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the creature without your temptations. To Love God in you, and Love you for God, is their duty which you may provoke them to in ſeaſon: But ſeek not for any nearer intereſt in them, nor for ſuch a love as terminateth in your ſelves. Nature is exceeding ambitious of being beloved: but ſteal not Gods due. You are to be ſutors and ſollicitors for him, to win the hearts of as many as you can: and not to ſpeak for your ſelves in his ſtead. Thankfully accept of mens <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> Love to you, if you have it: but if they deny it for you, or for the ſake of Chriſt, and turn it into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, do you deny your ſelves herein, and remember that it's no more than you were forewarned of; and no more than your Lord and his worthieſt ſervants have endured: What a Pattern is <hi>Paul</hi> that tells his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, he <hi>ſeeks not theirs but them, as parents lay up for the children, and not children for the parents, and would gladly ſpend, and be ſpent for them, though the more he love, the leſs he were beloved</hi>] 2 Cor. 12. 14, 15. See that <hi>you</hi> Love <hi>God and them,</hi> and that is <hi>your duty:</hi> do that and you need not take care for the <hi>Love</hi> of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34706:195"/>
men to <hi>you.</hi> Their Love is none of your felicity, and therefore their hatred depriveth you not of your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for that lieth only in the Love of God. Here therefore ſelf muſt be denied.</p>

               <p>3 ANother part of the Honour which <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denied in, is, <hi>The Reputation of your Riches.</hi> For <hi>wealth</hi> is one thing that men are proud of. Some deſire to be eſteemed richer than they are; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go in the beſt apparel they can get, that they may not be thought to be perſons of the loweſt pooreſt ſort. And ſome that are Rich, do glory in their Riches, and think they are much more to be honoured than the poor. But alas, if they had well read and conſidered what Chriſt hath ſaid of the danger of the rich, particularly in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. &amp; 16. &amp; 18. &amp; 8. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 23. and what <hi>James</hi> ſaith to them, <hi>James</hi> 5. 1, 2. &amp;c. they would ſee that Riches is not a thing to be Proud of. <hi>Not many great and noble are called. God hath choſen the poor of this world, Rich in faith, to be heirs of the Kingdom.</hi> The talents for which we muſt give ſuch an account at the bar of Chriſt, ſhould be rather the matter of our fear and trembling than of our Pride. That which makes our paſſage to heaven to be as the Camels through a needle's eye, I think ſhould not much lift us up. All the Riches of the world do make you never the better thought of with God, or any wiſe man: Nor will they cauſe you to live a moneth the longer, or quiet your Conſciences, or ſave
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34706:196"/>
you from death, or the wrath of God. The only worth of Riches, is, that you are better furniſhed than others to do God ſome good ſervice, by relieving the poor, and helping the Church, and furthering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch good works: And for the ſake of theſe good ends, you muſt patiently bear a ſtate of Riches, yea, and thankfully receive them, if they are given you by God; though the care and labour in a faithful diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of them, and the danger of abuſing them, and the reckoning to be made for them, are ſo great, as may deter a wiſe man from a greedy ſeeking them, or glorying in them.</p>

               <p>4. ANother part of the Honour that ſelf muſt be denied in, is, <hi>The Reputation of your perſonal comelineſs or beauty:</hi> For ſuch fools and children ſin hath made folks, that many much ſet by the <hi>Reputation</hi> of <hi>theſe.</hi> And hence is moſt commonly the abuſe of Apparel. Every proud perſon is deſirous of that which will make them ſeem the handſomeſt or beautifulleſt perſons unto others; and make it their care to ſet forth themſelves to the eyes of beholders. What they indeed are, we can ſee as well in the meaneſt attire: but what they would be thought to be, we may beſt ſee in this. But of this I ſpoke before; yea ſome think that they are not Proud of their comelineſs, yet cannot endure to be eſteemed ill-favoured or uncomely, and ſo ſhew that Pride which they would deny. I confeſs theſe are commonly but the temptations of women, and procacious youth. But one would think it ſhould be eaſie
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34706:196"/>
for a few ſober thoughts to cut their combs, and let them ſee how little cauſe they have to be proud of beauty or comelineſs of the fleſh. Alas what is that body that you are proud of! Filth and corruption co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a cleaner skin than ſome of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Ah, but the skin is thin, and if that be all you have to glory in, it is as frail, as contemptible. There's many a pretty flower in the common field that's trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down by the feet of beaſts, that have a gloſs and hue incomparably beyond your beauty. I asked you before, what beauty you will have to glory of, when you have dwelt but a few moneths in the grave; or if the ſmall Pox, or Leproſie, ſhould clothe you with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coloured skin: or if a Cancer ſhould but ſeize upon your face, and turn it into ſuch an ugly ſhape, as makes men tremble to behold it: or when wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led age hath made you as another perſon: or when death hath deprived you of that ſoul, which was your beauty, and laid you out as a prey and ſacrifice to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Ah that ever ſuch a skin full of dirt, ſuch a bag of filth, ſhould yet be proud, that's carried about by a living ſoul, and by it kept a little while from falling down as a ſenſleſs clod, and turning into a ſtinking corpſe! They are ſhort-ſighted, and ſhort-witted as well as graceleſs, that cannot look ſo far before them or within them, as to ſee that which may take them down from being proud of any comelineſs of the fleſh. One would think this ſhould be ſo eaſie a part of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial</hi> as any graceleſs one might reach, by a little uſe of the Reaſon that is left them.</p>

O miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Teachers, and miſerable ſouls that do obey them!

                  <hi>CHAP. XLVII.</hi> Reputation of Gifts and ſpiritual Abilities, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>7. ANother piece of vain-glory to be denied, is, <hi>The Reputation of our Gifts and ſpiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities:</hi> I mean ſuch as Praying, and Preaching, and Diſputing, and good Conference, to have readineſs for words, and livelineſs of expreſſion, and exactneſs of method: to be eſteemed in all theſe a very able man by others, is an high part of <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> to be denied. The duties themſelves muſt be denied by none, for they are the ſervice of God, commanded us by his word: But it is the Honour that <hi>ſelf</hi> preſumeth to hunt after in theſe holy things. And it is a double ſin <hi>here</hi> to ſeek our <hi>ſelves,</hi> when we are ſpecially commanded to ſeek God! and where the work is inſtituted for that end! and when we pretend to ſeek God, and to deny our ſelves! The greater are our abilities to do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the more reſolutely and thankfully we ſhould improve them in his ſervice. But we muſt remember that they are given us to ſave others by our improvement, and not to deſtroy our ſelves by our Pride. Get as great abilities as you can, and when you have them, thank God for them, and uſe them for him to the uttermoſt of your Power: but take heed leſt Pride ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice them to your <hi>ſelves</hi> and pervert them from your Maſters ſervice.</p>
               <p>The perſons that have moſt need of this advice are eſpecially theſe following. 1. Young unexperienced Profeſſors, that are but lately turned to a Profeſſion of a Godly life; that have ſo much illumination as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them much that before they knew not, and raiſeth them above the vulgar meaſure, but yet hath made
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34706:199"/>
them but ſmatterers and <hi>half-knowing</hi> men; Theſe are they that the Apoſtle requireth ſhould not be made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Paſtors of the Church, becauſe of their prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefs to this very ſin, that now we are ſpeaking of, 1 Tim. 3. 6. [<hi>Not a Novice, leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil</hi>] the ſpirit of God here intimateth to us, that <hi>Novices</hi> are the likeſt to be lifted up with Pride, and that this Pride is the way to the Condemnation of the Devil.</p>
               <p>2. And men of great abilities, natural or acquired, that have withall unſanctified hearts, are ordinarily tranſported with this odious vice. A ſtrong wit and a voluble tongue, and learning to furniſh it with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are notable ſervants to Pride of heart, where that ſpiritual illumination and holineſs is wanting, that ſhould abaſe the Proud, and turn mens Parts a better way. To all that are apt to be tainted with this odious vice, I would recommend theſe following conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider what a dangerous ſign it is of a graceleſs hypocritical heart, where Pride of Gifts doth much prevail. It is as inſeparable from a child of God, to be humble and little in his own eſteem, as from a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Child to be really leſſer than men at age. No more ſincerity, than humility in any.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider, what cauſe of deep humiliation you carry about you in every duty! Beſides all the wants and loathſom corruptions of your ſouls, which follow you wherever you go, the very ſins of your duties, one would think, ſhould humble you. Oh to have ſuch low conceptions, ſuch dull apprehenſions, ſuch heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, unreverent poor expreſſions of ſuch a God, ſuch a Chriſt, ſuch a glory, and ſuch holy truth, ſhould make us aſhamed to open our Lips before the Lord, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:34706:199"/>
wonder that he doth not tread us into hell, inſtead of regarding us or our ſervices, and that fire doth not come forth from his jealouſie and conſume us! It ſhould make us ſo far from glorying in our performances, that it ſhould drive us to Chriſt in every duty, to take him with us to ſhelter us from the flames of holy jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; ſo that we ſhould not dare to go any further than he goes before us, and ſtands between us and the wrath of God, nor to ſpeak a word but in his name, nor to expect any welcome but on his account. Shall a wretch be Proud of that performance whoſe failings deſerve everlaſting torments! Muſt you be beholden to Chriſt to ſave you from the Hell that the ſins of your performances deſerve, and yet dare you be proud of them? Let a Papiſt run that deſperate path, that rails at us for ſaying that our beſt duties are mix'd with ſin, and that this ſin deſerves the wrath of God; Let them refuſe a Phyſician that think not themſelves ſick; and let them tell Chriſt they will not be beholden to him for a pardon for the ſins of their prayers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties: but for ſhame let not <hi>us</hi> be guilty of this, who profeſs to be better acquainted with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>
               <p>3. Conſider alſo that you have to do with ſo Holy and Glorious a God, that to be Proud before Him, and that in and of our very ſervice of him, is a ſin whoſe greatneſs ſurpaſſeth our apprehenſions. Had you to do with a man like your ſelves, you might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lift up your ſelves againſt him. There is nothing comparatively in the preſence of the greateſt Prince, to humble and abaſe you: But to be Proud before the God of heaven, and that in and of our lamentably weak addreſſes to him, O what an horridly impious, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thing is this? O man, if thy eyes were opened to ſee a little, a very little of the glory of that bleſſed
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:34706:200"/>
God thou ſpeakeſt to, how flat wouldſt thou fall down? how wouldſt thou fear and tremble? and cry out as the Prophet, Iſa. 6. 5. [<hi>Wo is me, for I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hoſts</hi>] Or as <hi>Job</hi> 40. 4. [<hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</hi> And Chap. 42. 5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye ſeeth thee: wherefore I abhor my ſelf and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in duſt and aſhes</hi>] One glimpſe of Gods Majeſty would take down thy ſelf-exalting thoughts, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee with a witneſs.</p>
               <p>4. Conſider the examples of the holieſt of Gods ſervants. The example of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> I have now mentioned. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf did think himſelf unmeet to ſpeak in Gods meſſage, Exod. 4. 10. <hi>He ſaid unto the Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor ſince thou haſt ſpoken to thy ſervant: but I am of ſlow ſpeech and of a ſlow tongue.</hi>] And ver. 13. <hi>He ſaid O, my Lord, ſend I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend</hi>] When God ſent <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 6. he ſaid, <hi>Ah Lord God, behold I cannot ſpeak: for I am a child</hi>] And <hi>Paul</hi> cries out [<hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things!</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16.] So that it hath been the courſe of the moſt Seraphical Prophets, and holy Apoſtles to have low thoughts of their own abilities for duty: And yet have you enough to be Proud of?</p>
               <p>5. And conſider that the Nature of the holy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment that you are upon, one would think, ſhould be enough to humble you. It is a confeſſing of ſin, unworthineſs and guilt, and will you be Proud of this? It is a confeſſing that you deſerve everlaſting torment; And will you be Proud of ſuch a confeſſion as this? The Lord be merciful to us, and ſave us from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34706:200"/>
this unreaſonable vice; who would think that it ſhould be thus with a man in his wits? To confeſs that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth Hell-fire; And to be Proud of that Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! your Petitions are all humbling, if they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word; you are beggars for your lives, for pardon of many and hainous ſins, and ſhould come as with the rope about your necks: you beg for deliverance from eternal miſery: and ſhould you be proud of ſuch requeſts! ſhould beggars be Proud, yea ſuch needy miſerable beggars, and be proud of their very begging? Nay, your very thankſgiving it ſelf is humbling. For what do you give thanks for, but for ſalvation from theſe odious ſins, and the damnation which you have deſerved? And ſhall a thief be proud that he is pardoned and taken from the gallows? Pride is contrary to the very Nature and meaning of all thoſe holy duties that you are Proud of.</p>
               <p>6. Yea the Gifts themſelves that you are Proud of, ſhould humble you. For 1. They are from God, and not your ſelves. 1 Cor. 4. 7. [<hi>For who maketh thee to differ? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> 2. You received them not for your ſelves, but for God: and therefore have no reaſon your ſelves to be lifted up by them. 3. All Gifts are for labour and duty, and muſt be once accounted for: and therefore ſhould keep you in humility and fear. To be Proud of Gods Gifts, is to be Proud of that which is given you to deſtroy Pride in your ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: For this is the End of them.</p>
               <p>7. And it is a ſign that you want exceeding much of that which you are Proud of. You are Proud of <hi>Knowledge:</hi> when as if it were not for <hi>want</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that which ſhould humble you, you would not be ſo Proud. You are Proud of your <hi>worth:</hi> and it is
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:34706:201"/>
for want of real worth that you are Proud. More light and grace, and parts would ſhew you that which would make you bluſh at the things that you were Proud of.</p>
               <p>8. And conſider that you take the Courſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to bereave you of his Gifts. He gave them to you for another uſe. If you will turn them againſt his face by Pride, when he gave them to keep you humble: when you will exalt your carnal <hi>ſelves</hi> by it, which he gave you to exalt his Majeſty, what can you expect but he ſhould take them from you? And it's an eaſie matter with him to do it, yea to take away your very underſtandings, and leave you to the heavy plague of Madneſs, ſeeing you were Proud of your underſtandings, when alas, poor worms, you had ſo little cauſe.</p>
               <p>9. If once you grow Proud of your parts and gifts, you are in the high way to be given over to ſome fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fall; at beſt to particular ſcandals, if not to ſome damnable hereſie or Apoſtaſie. God <hi>may</hi> prevent it by your Humiliation: but you are in the common road that leads to it. It's much to be feared that God will ſo far leave you to your ſelves, as to let you fall into the dirt of ſome notorious ſin, that your ſhame may fly abroad the world, inſtead of the vain-glorious fame which you deſired: and that you may have ſomewhat to humble you that ſhall be written in your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and cannot be denied or hid. Or if you be hypocrites, and for damnation, it is moſt likely that you are in the ready way to ſome deſperate Hereſie, or flat Apoſtaſie. For we ſee that theſe are too frequently the conſequents of ſpiritual Pride.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, Conſider that the Gifts that you are Proud of, are in danger of being unſucceſsful to the Church; God may I confeſs do good to others by
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:34706:201"/>
them, though they do but choak your ſelves; but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily he denieth ſucceſs to the Proud, and bleſſeth weaker endeavours of the humble. Yea often ſuch men and all their parts become a plague and trouble to the Church. For they uſe them to forment the Hereſies and Diviſions which they are given over to: and do more hurt than the ignorant or the common ſortt of the Prophane. Learn therefore to deny your ſelves in the Reputation of your performances. If you feel any tickling delight when you are applauded, caſt water on it ſuddenly as on a fire kindled in your ſouls from Hell. If you perceive the leaſt ſtirring of diſcontent or envy, when the Preaching or prayers of another are preferred, and yours leſs ſet by, take heed, and quench it; for you are entertaining a dangerous temptation. But if you ſhould be ſo far lifted up, as to ſet up your Judgments above their worth, and riſe againſt your Teachers and the Church of Chriſt, and deſire to ſtep beyond your callings, that your parts may be taken notice of, and you may be ſomebody in the Church, and verifie the Propheſie of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20. 30. [<hi>Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them</hi>] I ſay, when once you come to this, it's time to fear leſt you be utterly forſaken, and become the ſhame and ſcorn of men, as you became the ſcourge and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the Church, and leſt your ſelf-exalting lay you as low as hell.</p>

               <p>8. ANother piece of vain-glory to be denied, is, <hi>The Reputation of being Orthodox, or of the right religion.</hi> The thing it ſelf is in the Eſſentials of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation: But the <hi>Reputation</hi> of it, is a thing that we muſt much deny our ſelves in. For it commonly falls out in moſt of the world, that the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>Reputation</hi> of it, are inconſiſtent: and no man can be Orthodox and of the right Religion, but he muſt be taken to be heterodox and of the wrong Religion: For the wrong is in moſt places taken for the right. But through the great Mercy of God, it is not commonly ſo in <hi>England,</hi> nor in the Reformed Churches abroad, in any great and neceſſary points. Among us Truth hath the advantage of Reputation! and ſo may it continue while the Sun endureth! But yet there is uſe for this part of ſelf-denial even with us. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe among many Sects and Parties of various Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and all of them are Confident that they are in the right, and that we are Erroneous and againſt the Truth: ſo ſay the Papiſts; and ſo ſay the Libertines, and many others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And there is no way to gain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being ſound and Orthodox with any of theſe men but by turning to them, and forſaking the truth, and ceaſing to be Orthodox indeed. In <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, you muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hereticks, or yield to hereſie, you muſt either ceaſe to be true Catholicks, or be content to be eſteemed no Catholicks: You have your choice whether you will re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>deed, becauſe they alſo have their errors, and are not Orthodox in all things, you muſt look for the ſame meaſure in thoſe particulars wherein they are miſtaken. For thinking themſelves in the right, they will too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten take it for their duty to let fly at others, as erroneous or dangerous perſons that are not of their mind: And in this miſtake, they think they do God ſervice to defame diſſenters, and raiſe jealouſies and ſuſpicions of them, and bid men take heed of them, as of men that hold ſome dangerous opinions; when it is themſelves that are deceived, and ſhould turn thoſe jealouſies and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions homewards. In ſuch Caſes as theſe it is a hard ſtrait that a ſervant of Chriſt is put to; when he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther err or be ſuppoſed to err. But the principal temptation lieth in thoſe Countries, where Error hath got the major vote, and is patronized both by Book and Sword, and cuſtom hath fixed the name of Truth upon the fouleſt Hereſies, and the name of Hereſie upon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Truths: Here a poor Chriſtian is ſorely tempted and put to a lamentable ſtrait. O ſaith he, <hi>if I were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted but to be baſe, or beggarly, or contemptible, I could bear it; but Hereſie and Schiſm are ſuch odious things that no man ſhould be patient under the imputation of them. Anſw.</hi> Are they ſuch odious things? Take heed of them then leſt out of your own-mouths you be judged. If you think the matter ſo ſmall that you will rather <hi>be</hi> an Heretick or Sciſmatick than be <hi>called</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>one,</hi> it ſeems you take it for no odious thing. Is the <hi>name</hi> or the <hi>thing</hi> more odious to you? Had you rather be erroneous, or be <hi>thought</hi> to be ſo? If the <hi>Thing</hi> be moſt odious to you, the <hi>Name</hi> will be the more tolerable. But if the <hi>Name</hi> be moſt odious to you, it is <hi>Diſhonour</hi> and not Error or Schiſm that you
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:34706:203"/>
are againſt. Had you rather part with <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or with the name &amp; Reputation of them? If you ſet ſo much by <hi>ſelf</hi> and ſo little by <hi>Truth,</hi> as to <hi>let go</hi> Truth for fear of being thought <hi>to let it go;</hi> for ſhame do not take on you to be <hi>Lovers of Truth</hi> but of <hi>your ſelves;</hi> nor haters of <hi>Error,</hi> but of <hi>Diſhonour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And conſider further that you may loſe the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being Orthodox, and Catholick, and of the right Religion, without loſing any of the favour of God; nay it may be a ſuffering for his ſake that may advance you in his favour, and aſſure you of the Reward of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11, 12. [<hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets that were before you</hi>] So that you ſee the thing that you ſo abhor, is matter of exceeding joy: Even to be falſly counted an Heretick or Erroneous for the ſake of Chriſt and Truth: we are <hi>bleſſed</hi> when we are falſly reviled as Erroneous, and have all theſe evil ſayings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. But to be <hi>ſuch indeed,</hi> is to be accurſed: Though the <hi>name</hi> of Hereſie will ſtand with the ſpecial Love of God, yet <hi>Hereſie</hi> it ſelf he utterly abhors. And whether do you think it is better to part with truth and the Favour of God with it; or with the name and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Truth, while we keep both Truth and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God? Deny <hi>your ſelves</hi> then even as to the Reputation of Faith and Orthodoxneſs; For you will certainly deny the Faith, if you cannot deny the name of it, to preſerve it.</p>

               <p>9. ANother piece of Honour that <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in, is, <hi>The Reputation of Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> Concerning both the former and this I muſt ſay, by way of caution, that the Reputation both of Faith and Godlineſs is a great Mercy, and not to be deſpiſed, nor prodigally caſt away by our own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or miſcarriages; nor unthankfully to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: But yet 1. It is not to be deſired for it ſelf, but for God, that it may help and advantage us to ſerve him, or as it is a Mercy that brings the report of his love. 2. And the greater the Mercy is, the greater is our temptation, when it would deprive us of a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mercy than it ſelf: I have oft thought it was a very high paſſage for an Heathen to ſay as <hi>Seneca</hi> did, that [No man doth ſhew a higher eſteem of goodneſs, than he that can let go the Name or Reputation of being a good man, rather than let go his goodneſs it ſelf.] The world is ſo much unacquainted with goodneſs, that they know it not when they ſee it; but call it by thoſe odious names that leaſt agree with it. Their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments follow their <hi>Natures,</hi> diſpoſitions and <hi>intereſts:</hi> And therefore they cannot take that to be <hi>good</hi> which is contrary to theſe. A feather-bed is no better to a ſwine than a mire-lake: A banquet is not ſo good to a Cow as a green paſture. As the perſon is himſelf, ſo do all things ſeem good or evil to him. The <hi>Toad</hi> or <hi>Snake</hi> hath no ſuch odious apprehenſions of it ſelf as <hi>men</hi> have. And hence it is that to ungodly men the beſt men and beſt actions ſeem to be the worſt. And hence alſo it is, that in all Ages Godlineſs ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

matter of reproach: and the beſt have been laden with the he avieſt calumnies. <hi>David</hi> had enemies that laid to his charge the things that he never thought of. And it ſeems by the ſtrain of <hi>Shimei</hi> in his railing, that they took him to be but a Traitor, becauſe King <hi>Saul</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and to be <hi>a bloody man,</hi> becauſe he had been engaged in the wars, 2 Sam. 16. 7, 8. [<hi>Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of</hi> Belial: <hi>the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the houſe of</hi> Saul <hi>in whoſe ſtead thou haſt raigned</hi>] See what a wicked perſon <hi>David</hi> was eſteemed by ſuch fellows as this! And yet he ſo far denied himſelf here, as that he would not hear of revenge upon the railer, but makes it as a tryal ſent from God. And two ſpecial reaſons moved him to bear it. One was the remembrance of that ſin againſt God and his Servant <hi>Uriah,</hi> which he knew God was now chaſtiſing him for: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being under the rod of the Lord, he durſt not think of revenge upon the inſtrument; and being ſenſible that he had brought all this upon himſelf, he durſt not let fly too much at others. The other was that God had raiſed up (by permiſſive providence) the Son of his bowels againſt him: and therefore he thought it an unſeemly thing to be much offended with a ſtranger for leſs. And ſuch Reaſons as theſe have we alſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to Patience and Self-denial in the like Caſe. The Lord Jeſus himſelf who had no ſin at all, eſcaped not theſe cenſures of malicious men. He was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a friend or Companion of Publicans and Sinners, yea a gluttonous perſon, and a wine bibber; yea a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; yea a conjurer that did his works by the help of the Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>Luk</hi> 7. 34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 63. <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 27. What uſage the holy Apoſtles themſelves had, and how they behaved themſelves under all, you may
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34706:204"/>
conjecture by that one paſſage, (to mention no more) 1 Cor. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. [<hi>For I think God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to death: For we are made a ſpectacle to the world, and to Angels, and to men: we are fools for Chriſts ſake, but ye are wiſe in Chriſt; we are weak, but ye are ſtrong; ye are honourable, but we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; Even to this preſent hour we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dwelling place; and labour working with our own hands; being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted we ſuffer it: being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and the off-ſcouring of all things to this day</hi>] The like uſage had the Chriſtians after the Apoſtles days. They were ſlandered by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans as if they ſacrificed, and eat their own children, and putting out the lights had commonly been unclean together after their holy exerciſes: And when they caſt them to the Lions to be devoured, and many wayes tormented them, it was as <hi>ungodly men,</hi> for preaching againſt the Heathen Gods, and refuſing to offer ſacrifice to them. And therefore the rabble was wont thus to cry for Judgement againſt them, [<hi>Tollite impios</hi>] [<hi>Tollite impios</hi>] <hi>Away with the ungodly Chriſtians!</hi> The wicked multitude that were drowned in filthineſs and ungodlineſs, did think themſelves Religious men, and the Chriſtians to be ungodly. So that they were fain to live and die under a Reputation as contrary to the truth, as darkneſs is contrary to light.</p>
               <p>And this uſage hath ſtill been the attendant of true Godlineſs. When the Papiſts burn Gods ſervants at the ſtake, it is for ſuppoſed Hereſie and impiety: they put a painted cap and coat upon them, made of paper, on which the Images of Devils are pictur d to make the people believe that they are ungodly perſons, the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34706:205"/>
ſervants of the Devil, and poſſeſſed by him already, and unworthy to live any longer among men. When they butchered the poor <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> by thouſands, it was under the name of ungodly hereticks. The ignorant ungodly rabble among us now, that hate and revile thoſe that ſeek after God more diligently than themſelves, have yet more deviliſh wit than to oppoſe them directly under the name of honeſt godly men; but they firſt make the world believe that they are Hypocrites, and Proud, and Self-conceited, and Covetous, and ſecretly are as bad as others, and theſe are the things, if you will believe them, that they hate and ſpeak againſt them for. But then how comes it to paſs that it is their <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Preciſeneſs</hi> that is ſo much in the ſcorners mouths? Doth that ſignifie <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie or Pride?</hi> Why do they not <hi>commend</hi> the <hi>good</hi> while they ſpeak againſt the evil? and joyn with them in the holy Worſhip and ways of God, while they oppoſe their ſuppoſed viciouſneſs? Doth the name (<hi>Puritan</hi>] ſignifie a covetous man, or a vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? or rather one that will not be content to venture his ſoul in the common, impure, ungodly courſes of the world! And how comes it to paſs that a man may quietly enough follow ſuch vices, if he will but forbear the profeſſion of Godlineſs? But (to leave theſe wretches in the dirt where we find them) by this you may ſee the common meaſure that is to be expected from the world: If you will be <hi>truly godly,</hi> you muſt be taken for <hi>ungodly,</hi> or for <hi>hypocrites,</hi> that ſeem to be godly when you are not.</p>
               <p>But it's eaſie to bear this charge when it falls upon a whole ſociety, and takes us but in the crowd among the reſt, and when we have ſo much honourable company to ſuffer with us: But it goes nearer us when we are ſingled out by name, and noted and talk'd of all about as
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:34706:205"/>
Hypocrites, or Proud, or worſe than others. But that alſo muſt be born by thoſe that will be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt trial of all is, when the Servants of God that ſhould help us in our ſuffering, have got a hard report of us, and by miſinformation we have loſt our credit even with them. Under all theſe falſe and injurious reports, direct and ſtabliſh your own minds by the help of theſe Conſiderations following.</p>
               <p>1. It may be there is ſome ſpecial cauſe that you ſhould try and judge your ſelves: and ſo God doth ſuffer other men to judge you, to awaken you to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging. However make this uſe of it, and you are ſure to be no loſers by the reproach. Enter into your hearts, and ſearch them throughly as before the Lord, and ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in them which hitherto you have not diſcovered: Try whether there be Hypocriſie and Pride or not; Eſpecially when it is the ſervants of God that think hardly of you, and above all, if it be wiſe, impartial men that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with you, it's then your duty to be very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of your hearts and ways, and to fear leſt you are guilty, and to ſearch the more diligently, and not be quiet till you either find out your ſin, or be ſure that you are clear. And if you be clear in that point, yet ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and ſearch leſt there be ſome other ſecret or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſin, which God would detect to you, or excite you againſt by the injurious cenſures of thoſe that have reproached you.</p>
               <p>2. When you have ſearch'd and cleared your own Conſciences, then conſider further, that though you are not ſuch as you are cenſured to be, yet <hi>ſinners</hi> you are, and you know your ſins in other kinds are ſo many and ſo great that you ſhould bear the more patiently to be hardly thought of, when you know your ſelves to be
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34706:206"/>
ſo bad. If indeed you are godly, you have ſeen a ſink of uncleanneſs in your ſelves, and have condemned your ſelves oft, and loathed your ſelves for your abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and bewailed them before the Lord. And is it ſuitable for ſuch a ſpirit to be eager after the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of ſincerity, and to be much troubled that you are taken by others to be naught?</p>
               <p>3. And conſider alſo that your Caſe may be as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> was, and God may poſſibly make this reproach a chaſtiſement for ſome former ſin, and a means to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you for it more throughly, and to reclaim you from it. Perhaps he bids (by permiſſive providence) ſome <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> curſe you. It may be the voice of a ſlanderer muſt do that which the voice of a Preacher could not do. And then it is your work to look behind you and within you, more than without you, and to hearken more to the voice of God and Conſcience, than of the ſlanderer: and to take it as the rod of God, and a call to a more ſerious Repentance.</p>
               <p>4. And conſider that when you are under the falſe Cenſures of the world, you may have the inward peace of a good conſcience, which is better than all the applauſe of men: And this being a continual feaſt, they cannot do much againſt your quietneſs, as long as they cannot deprive you of this.</p>
               <p>5. Yea moreover, you have the Approbation of God himſelf, and that ſhould ſatisfie againſt the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all the world. Even a Proud man if he have any wit, can bear the Contempt of the ignorant vulgar, if he have but the applauſe of great and wiſe, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men: As that Orator that valued the judgement of <hi>Socrates</hi> above all the reſt of his auditory. But all the wiſeſt men in the world are fools in compariſon of God. Having <hi>his</hi> Approbation, you have the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the Beſt, and the Wiſeſt on your ſide; and a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34706:206"/>
for you that will weigh down the judgement of ten thouſand worlds.</p>
               <p>7. And if you value not Gods approbation above mans, it's a ſign that you are hypocrites indeed, and ſo the censure is not unjust: But if you do, then you will acquieſce in it, though man condemn you; and ſay as the Apoſtle, Rom. 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect; It is God that Justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi> And as 1 Cor. 4. 3, 4. [<hi>With me it is a very small thing, that I should be judged of you, or of mans judgment—but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And remember that the great day of Judgment is near at hand, that will ſet all ſtraight which the ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tongues of men made crooked. Stay but a while, and the Glory of Chriſt, and the ſentence of your judge, will diſpel all the unjuſt reproaches that were on you, and waſh off all the blots that were falſly laid on your good name: <hi>and he will bring forth your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as the light, and your judgment as the noon-day:</hi> for <hi>there is nothing hid that ſhall not be then revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. In the mean time God will take care of your name: He will make the very tongues that ſlander you to honour you; in the blindneſs of their reproaches, croſſing themſelves. As the Papiſts by the poor <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> ſaying they were the <hi>more dangerous hereticks, becauſe they held all the Articles of faith, and lived godly and honeſtly, and were reputed holy, but only that they were againſt the Church of</hi> Rome. As you truſt God with your health, and wealth, ſo muſt you do with your Reputation, even in point of Honeſty, and be ſatisfied that he can clear you when he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>9. And it is not Gods ordinary way to leave the Reputation of his ſervants wholly uncleared even in this world. If <hi>one</hi> condemn them, <hi>another</hi> ſhall Juſtifie
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34706:207"/>
them: and commonly the wiſeſt and beſt men Juſtifie them; and the moſt fooliſh and ungodly are they that condemn them: And cannot you bear the words of fools and children? The proudeſt man can paſs by a contempt or ſlander from a drunken man, an ideot, or a mad man, as being no diſhonour to him: and cannot you bear the cenſures of the diſtracted world? Or if they are better men that ſlander you, it's two to one but it is the more fooliſh or paſſionate ſort of them; and that the judgment of the more wiſe and ſober is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and vindicateth your Reputation. Or if at the preſent they do not, it's ten to one but Providence ſhall work to the clearing of your Reputation, either in your life-time, or when you are dead. Moſt of the Servants of God that were moſt hated and ſlandered, while they lived on earth, are cleared and honoured now they are dead. God is not diſ-regardful of his Servants names.</p>
               <p>10. But however it go, you are ſecured of the main; that which you expected or covenanted for with God, you ſhall be ſure of. If you have the <hi>Thing,</hi> you may eaſily bear the want of the <hi>name.</hi> Hath the Spirit of God renewed and ſanctified you? are you made the living members of Chriſt, and the Sons of God, and the heirs of Heaven? I hope you may well ſpare then the applauſe of men, and eaſily bear it, if you be <hi>reputed</hi> to be deſtitute of what you have. If you <hi>are</hi> in health, it will not much trouble you if it be reported that you are ſick: And if you <hi>are</hi> alive, you can bear it if the report go that you are dead: For as long as you have the <hi>thing</hi> you can ſpare the <hi>name:</hi> And if you <hi>have</hi> Chriſt, and Grace, and Pardon, and Juſtification, and Title to eternal life, cannot you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have men think that you are without them? How baſely do you undervalue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe ineſtimable
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:34706:207"/>
things, when the thoughts of a mans mind, or the words of a mans mouth can blaſt the comforts of them all? As if you ſaid to the world, <hi>It is not Chriſt, and Grace, and Pardon, and Salvation, that will ſerve me, without the applauſe of men!</hi> How baſely think you of God, and how highly of men, if this be your mind! It is more excuſable for a <hi>Haman</hi> to ſay of all his honour and wealth that they ſatisfie him not, or do him no good, as long as he wants but <hi>Mordecai's</hi> obeyſance, than for a Chriſtian to ſay of God, of Chriſt, of Glory, All this will not ſerve my turn as long as men take me for an hypocrite or ungodly. For there is not a ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiency in Honors and wealth, as there is in God and glory. As long as you have the precious treaſure, methinks you may give loſers leave to talk. It was not for the good words of men that you became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Covenanted with God, but for pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and theſe you ſhall have: God will perform his Covenant to you, and give you both his Kingdom, and ſo much of worldly things as overplus, as is truly good for you; and what would you have more? You ſhall have the Inheritance and Crown of bleſſedneſs; and will not that ſerve your turn without a few good words from ſilly man! I hope you would be loth to change Rewards with the Hypocrite! Why then do you ſo much deſire his Reward, and ſo much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value your own! Though <hi>his</hi> be <hi>preſent,</hi> and <hi>yours</hi> be <hi>future,</hi> I hope you think it but a doleful hearing, to have Chriſt ſay [<hi>Verily they have their Reward</hi>] in compariſon of his promiſe to his reproached ſervants [<hi>Verily great is your Reward in Heaven</hi>] Mat. 6. 2. Mat. 5. 12.</p>
               <p>And now I hope in all theſe ten particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations you may ſee reaſon enough for <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> in the very Reputation of your Godlineſs and Honeſty;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:34706:208"/>
and why you ſhould endure joyfully to be eſteemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and diſhoneſt rather than to be ſo.</p>

THe laſt point of Honour which <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denied in, is, <hi>A Renowed and Perpetuated Name.</hi> For to that height doth Pride aſpire, that no leſs will ſatisfie, where there is any apparent hope of this: though in thoſe that ſit ſo low that they ſee no ground to hope for ſuch a thing, the deſires after it are not ſo kindled as they be in others, that think the prey is within their reach. Fain men would be famous and talk'd of through the world: They would have their real and ſuppoſed worth made known as far as may be. And when they die, they would fain have their names ſurvive, that they may be great in the eſtimation of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and magnified by all that mention them. And ſo deeply are men poſſeſſed with this dangerous ſin, that they account this perpetuated fame for their felicity.

that it is God, and his cauſe and honour that we prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intend, and deſire our own honour but as a Means to his, and therefore deſire it no further than it is ſuch a means; then we may juſtly deſire both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion and ſurviving of our reputation if we are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly perſwaded that it's like to conduce to theſe happy ends. As for example: A Prince that owns the cauſe of God, and makes ſuch Laws for the common good as may exceedingly promote it, if they be obſerved by poſterity, muſt have a great regard to his preſent and ſurviving fame, becauſe the honour of his Laws will depend much upon the honour of his name: and if once the people vilifie <hi>him,</hi> they will be likely to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and caſt off his Laws, to the hurt of Church and Common-wealth, and their own undoing. And even as to the ſucceſs of their preſent Government, they ſhould be very careful of their fame: ſo alſo a Miniſter of the Goſpel muſt be very careful of his preſent and future reputation. For at preſent, the ſaving good of his auditors doth much depend upon it. For if they have a baſe eſteem of the Paſtor, they will be unlikely to give diligent intention to his Doctrine, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem it as they do the ſpeaker, and it is not likely to go to their hearts: Nor will they ſeek his advice in the great matters of ſalvation, and the difficult caſes and dangers that they meet with; but to the great hazard of their ſouls will ſlight the neceſſary aſſiſtance of him that is appointed to be their guide to heaven, and will ſet light by all the Ordinances of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſtors Reputation is ten thouſand times more beneficial and neceſſary to the people than to himſelf. For alas it is but their good <hi>thoughts and words</hi> that <hi>he</hi> receiveth; which add little to his happineſs: but it's everlaſting life which <hi>they</hi> may receive by that Word of God and help from him, which is furthered by his
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:34706:209"/>
Reputation. And therefore as Miniſters ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding watchful againſt Pride, that they deſire not Honor for themſelves; ſo when they are ſure that God is their end, they muſt be exceeding careful of their own Reputation, and avoid all occaſions &amp; appearances of evil, and purchaſe it by all juſt means: For though honour be worth little, yet the Cauſe of God and the ſouls of men are worth much; and we muſt not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of our Maſters Talents, and ſuch as are very uſeful to his ſervice: Our Reputation is Gods and the Churches due, and to be cheriſhed for their uſe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe Miniſters muſt be careful of their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that by Reformation or Publick uſeful writings are capable of profiting Poſterity: and they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſurviving of their honours, which for it ſelf might not be deſired: becauſe their works and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Doctrine are like to be much blaſted by their own defamations, and do little good to any that come after: Nay the precious truths and cauſe of God may be moſt dangerouſly wronged and diſadvantaged by it; and get ſuch a blot and diſhonour by <hi>their</hi> diſhonour, that any that ſhall ſeek the promoting of it hereafter may be greatly hindered and diſadvantaged thereby: For it will ſeem enough to caſt off ſuch a Doctrine for ever, that by the diſhonour of the maintainers it was once diſhonourable and rejected as an error. And doubtleſs ſome things have been thus made Hereſies, and ſo will be long rejected as Hereſies in many parts of the Chriſtian world, becauſe they were once call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that name; and that was becauſe the Perſon that did own them had ſome ſuch diſhonour or diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as left his Doctrine open to this reproach. And therefore you may here ſee what a Potent inſtrument Reputation is in the Devils hand, to do his work; and what abundance of advantage he gets by defaming
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:34706:209"/>
Gods ſervants. Principally by this means did he long keep the world from the entertainment of the Goſpel, the ſervants of Chriſt being contemptible in their eyes, and the preaching of the croſs but fooliſhneſs to them. By this means did the Phariſees hinder the Jews from believing in Chriſt: And by this means is Heatheniſm, Infidelity, and Mahometaniſm continued in poſſeſſion of moſt of the world to this day. By this means it is that Popery keeps the common people in thraldom: as the voluminous lies of <hi>Cochlaeus, Bolſecus,</hi> and many others concerning <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Reformers and Writers, do fully teſtifie. And by perſonal reproaches and diſhonours it is that the Doctrine of the Reformed Divines is made ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and the like inſtances might be given in others. If now any weighty Chriſtian Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be aſſerted by any Paſtor of the Church, in a ſounder and clearer manner, than is commonly known or owned, if the perſon that doth it, ſhould but fall under any reproach (which he ſhall be ſure of if the Devil can procure it) it's two to one but for his ſake his Doctine will be ſtigmatized with the name of error, and ſo lie buried for ever, till Divine Omnipotency commands its Reſurrection. And hence it is that there is not one Inſtrument that ever God raiſeth up to vindicate any truth, or ordinance, or do him any ſpecial ſervice, but Satan raiſeth up tongues and pens if not hands and ſwords againſt him, and an Army of reproachers will preſently be on the back of him.</p>
               <p>Now in all ſuch caſes as theſe, it is a great duty for any ſervant of Chriſt to be very regardful of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation even with Poſterity: For his good name may much promote the Truth, as we know the Name of <hi>Auſtin, Calvin,</hi> and many another doth at this day. And if it be our great duty to <hi>extend our ſervice</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:34706:210"/>
of God as far as we can, to all Countries, and to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, to do them good; then is it our duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that a good Reputation ſhould go along with our labours to further the ſucceſs, or remove impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And thus while we are ſincere, and intend all for God, we may and muſt regard our honour; and yet <hi>in</hi> ſo doing we <hi>Deny our ſelves,</hi> becauſe we do it not for <hi>our ſelves</hi> but for God and his Church.</p>
               <p>2. And if honour be <hi>given</hi> in to us this way, even as we partake of it our ſelves, as a Means to Gods honour, we muſt thankfully accept it, eſteem it, and rejoyce in it. And therefore it is made the matter of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſpoken of in Scripture as a bleſſing, Prov. 22. 1. <hi>A good name is rather to be choſen than great riches</hi>] and 10. 7. <hi>The memory of the Juſt is bleſſed: but the name of the wicked ſhall rot</hi>] Eccleſ. 7. 1. <hi>A good name is better than precious oyntment</hi>] with many the like.</p>
               <p>Thus much I have ſaid to prevent a miſ-application of that which followeth; and to help you ſo to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me on this point of Honour, as not to run from extream into extream, and to ſin by ſeeking to avoid ſin.</p>
               <p>But alas, <hi>this kind</hi> of <hi>ſeeking</hi> our Honour for God and his Church, and not for our ſelves, and as our own, I doubt is more rare than the <hi>neglect</hi> of honour. The ſin that I diſſwade you from, is in theſe two points. 1. That you do not <hi>Affect and ſeek</hi> after Extending or ſurviving Reputation for <hi>your ſelves;</hi> and out of a Proud deſire to be ſtill <hi>ſome body</hi> in the eſtimation of the world: 2. That if God <hi>deny</hi> you even that honour which in the lawfulleſt manner you deſire, that you <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to his pleaſure, and take it <hi>patiently;</hi> and in theſe two reſpects you muſt here deny your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Above all others, theſe ſorts of perſons following are in danger of this odious Pride, in deſiring for themſelves
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34706:210"/>
an extended and ſurviving Name. 1. <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> that have the management of the great affairs of the world; Fain would they be Renowned to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And hence are their aſpiring ambitious deſigns. For this are their Wars and Conqueſts, that they may be famous when they are dead as well as while they live: And thus they make their Noble Conqueſts to be but Murders of the vileſt ſort, and worſe than any Cut-throats and Robbers by the high way, while they intend them but for themſelves and their own vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and better might they ſeek honour by whoredom, drunkenneſs, or theft which are far ſmaller ſins: Whereas if their wars had been undertaken for God, and managed according to his Will, they had made them truly honourable and renowned. And from this odious Pride it is, that <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Pillars muſt be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Monuments muſt be built to perpetuate their names, and tell the world what need they have of means to keep alive their memories, and how deſtitute they are of nobler means, when Marbles and Monuments muſt be the great preſervers of their fame. Yea it were well if this <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> did not corrupt the nobleſt of their works, and turn them into deadly ſins: if they did not build their Hoſpitals, Colledges or Churches, and endow them with Revenues to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their own Names, rather than to do good. Though the works themſelves are ſo good and ſo rare, that I would not caſt any diſhonour upon them, ſeeing all that can be ſaid is too little to provoke men to do the like: yet am I bound in duty to tell them, that if ſelf ſhould be the End inſtead of God, and Pride the cauſe inſtead of charity, Hell would be the Reward inſtead of Heaven: ſo great a matter it is to have an honeſt heart and right intentions in the moſt excellent and noble works. In ſo much that a poor man that hath a heart
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:34706:211"/>
to build a Colledge or an Hoſpital, if he had but means, ſhall be Rewarded by God, as if he had done it, if God were the End, and Charity the Principle; when a rich man that <hi>doth the work</hi> it ſelf, ſhall have but a poor and temporary reward, if <hi>ſelf</hi> be the End and <hi>Pride</hi> the Principle.</p>
               <p>2. Another ſort, that are ſpecially in danger of this ſin, are, all <hi>Rich men,</hi> who would be the great in the world, and perpetuate their names and memory in their houſes, lands and poſterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore they would purchaſe Towns and Lordſhips that their Houſes may be famous when they are gone. For it ſeems a kind of life to them if their Greatneſs do but live in their poſterity. Pſal. 49. 11, 12. [<hi>Their inward thought is that their houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations: they call their lands after their own names—This their way is their folly: yet their poſterity approve their ſayings.</hi>] Hence alſo is that oſtentation of Eſcucheons, and Arms, and of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Gentility or Nobility, and much more ſuch proud and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> vanity.</p>
               <p>3. Another ſort that are in danger of this ſin, are <hi>Divines and Learned men in all Profeſſions,</hi> who make their Writings but a means to perpetuate their own Names to Poſterity. Temptations to this ſin may be offered to the beſt, and too much entertainment they may have with our natures, becauſe of the remnants of ſelfiſhneſs and Pride. But yet they do not prevail with the ſanctified ſo far as to aim more at their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than at Gods. The Labours that in themſelves are excellent and a bleſſing to the Church, are loſt to him that was the Author of them, if <hi>ſelf</hi> be the End, and Pride the fountain. And exceeding great need have the godlieſt men to watch their hearts in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; for they are very deceitſul, and <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:34706:211"/>
will too often interpoſe, where nothing but God and publick good is diſcerned. And now becauſe that the ſin is very great and dangerous, I ſhall here annex a few Conſiderations, which by opening the evil of it, may help you to abhor it.</p>
               <p>1. Theſe Proud deſires of a great and ſurviving Name, do ſhew that you lamentably overlook the true eternal honour of the Saints. Muſt you have Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? chooſe that which lieth in the eſteem of God: Muſt you be great and glorious? why you may be ſo, and God would have you be ſo; if you will but know where Greatneſs and Glory is to be had, even in that bleſſedneſs that Chriſt hath purchaſed. Muſt you have your greatneſs and honour perpeuated? why you may have that which will never have an end: And when God hath ſet before you ſuch an endleſs glory, are you looking after a Name among mortal men, to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you on the Earth? Do you think to be ſaved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed or not? If you do, what need have you of the ſmoak of mans applauſe, when you are with God? what unworthythoughts have you of heaven, if you think when you are there, you ſhall have need of mens good thoughts or words on earth? But it's a dangerous ſign that you are indeed unbelievers, and lay not up your treaſure in heaven, when you are ſo careful to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate your names and ſhaddows here with men. The true reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of Heavenly honour would put you out of love with this.</p>
               <p>2. And do you not plainly ſee in your own <hi>deſires</hi> the <hi>vanity</hi> of all theſe Earthly things, when you are put at <hi>laſt</hi> to take up with ſuch a <hi>ſhaddow,</hi> ſuch a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as</hi> is a <hi>ſurviving name?</hi> Is this all that the world can do for you? And do you not ſee here the wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deceitfulneſs of the world, and the fooliſhneſs of unſanctified men, that they will d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s ſtick to the world
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:34706:212"/>
for very <hi>nothing!</hi> when they know that they ſhall have no more from it, they are contriving for a name when they are dead. Wonderful blindneſs! that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the approach and thoughts of death, ſhould no more open your eyes: ſurely if this be all that the world will do for you at the laſt, you ſhould even renounce it and uſe it accordingly at the firſt.</p>
               <p>3. You cannot but know that when you are dead and gone, the <hi>Honour</hi> of the world is <hi>none of yours,</hi> nor can it do you any good, any further than it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to your eternal bleſſedneſs, and your honour is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the honor of God. What good will it do you to be magnified by men, when you neither know nor feel it? what the better is a Tree or Houſe if men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it? And for your ſouls, if they be with God, they will be far above the praiſe of men.</p>
               <p>4. Nay as ſuch a deſign is a dangerous ſign of your Damnation, ſo I beſeech you think, what comfort it will be to your ſoul in Hell to be extolled and well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of on earth? Will you caſt away your ſouls, to leave a Name of renown behind you? And how unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will ſuch Honor be to your condition? ſurely if you be there acquainted with it, you muſt needs be more tormented, both to remember that you were ſeeking the fame of the world, inſtead of the eternal glory, and to conſider what a miſerable wretch it is that men are praiſing and magnifying on earth. Ah then you will think with your ſelves [<hi>Little do the poor inhabitants of the earth know what I am ſuffering while they are extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me. Is the applauſe of mortals ſutable to a poor tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſoul? Alas that at one and the ſame time, men ſhould be extolling me, and Devils tormenting me? How little eaſe do all their acclamations afford this poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoul!</hi>] How honorable are the names of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great, &amp; <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> here on earth! but alas
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:34706:212"/>
what cauſe have we to fear that they are lamenting their miſery, while we are ſpeaking of their glory!</p>
               <p>5. And the ſin is much the greater, becauſe it is not a <hi>miſ-choſen means,</hi> but a <hi>miſtaken end,</hi> that your ſouls have faſtened on: For it ſeems your very <hi>hearts</hi> are ſet upon your Honours, and <hi>deeply</hi> and <hi>deſperately</hi> ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, when you dare contrive the continuation of them when you are dead. Were it not a matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dear to you, undoubtedly you durſt not lay ſuch a deſign for it.</p>
               <p>6. And conſider whether there be not a Love of the deadly ſin of Pride, and a final impenitency implyed in this ambition of a ſurviving name. For you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>a deſign that is ſuppoſed to be executed after death. And as if you deſired an eternity of wickedneſs, becauſe your Pride it ſelf can live no where but with your ſelf, you would have it leave thoſe tokens behind it, by which the world may know that you are Proud; and the effects of it you would have perpetuated on earth? And had not the <hi>world</hi> enough of your Pride while you were alive? and had not <hi>you</hi> enough of it? Is this your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> that you would leave the <hi>Monuments</hi> of your <hi>Pride</hi> unto Poſterity, as if you were afraid there would be no ſurviving witneſs againſt you to condemn you? This is a certain tranſcendency of ſin! The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wicked ones would fain die the death of the Righteous, and wiſh their laſt end were like to his: But theſe men would have their Pride to live for ever; and when they themſelves are in another world, they would have the demonſtrations of their iniquity ſurvive them.</p>
               <p>7. And I beſeech you conſider what a fearful thing it is to <hi>die</hi> in contrived beloved ſin! when men have none but a death-bed Repentance, we have much cauſe to fear, leſt it be but <hi>fear</hi> that is the life of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: But when they have not <hi>this much,</hi> but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34706:213"/>
to leave the Monuments of their vice to all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, from whence then ſhall we fetch our hopes of their forgiveneſs? And O what a power hath Pride in that ſoul, where the thoughts of Death it ſelf will give no ſtop to it, but ſtill they are deſirous that Pride may over-live them! One would think that the ſerious thoughts of a grave, much more of our paſſage into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, ſhould level all ſuch thoughts of a ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving honour, even in an unſanctified ſoul! But I much fear leſt it be infidelity it ſelf that is the root of all; and that men do not ſoundly believe an everlaſting life with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Immortality here on earth.</p>
               <p>8. And conſider what a ſilly immortality you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. The honour can be no greater than the perſons are that honour you, nor no longer. And it is but poor mortals that will magnifie your Names, and what can they add to you? and it will be but a very little while; for it is not long that the world is to continue.</p>
               <p>9. And conſider what a wickedneſs is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly included. Proud men deſire to be thought bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they are, and ſpoken of accordingly; They limit not mens eſtimation to the truth of their deſerts. Otherwiſe if the beſt and greateſt of you all were thought no <hi>better</hi> or greater than you are, alas, how far would men be from admiring you? what would you be thought but worms and ſinners; and ſuch as after all your glory, cannot forbid a crawling worm to feed upon your face or heart? and ſuch as deſerve no leſs than hell; and have many a ſecret ſin that the world was unacquainted with. But it is not a <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>falſe Eſteem</hi> that the Proud deſire: They care not how <hi>great,</hi> or how <hi>good,</hi> or how <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> the world and ſucceeding ages think them: And thus they deſire to <hi>cheat</hi> mens <hi>underſtandings,</hi> and to leave a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:34706:213"/>
                  <hi>falſe</hi> Hiſtory of themſelves on earth, and to have <hi>all men believe</hi> and <hi>report untruths,</hi> to magnifie men, whoſe ſouls, it's much to be doubted, are in hell, or if they be not, muſt needs abhor ſuch doings. And thus every Proud and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> man would be a <hi>falſe Hiſtorian</hi> and <hi>cheater</hi> of the world.</p>
               <p>10. Yea, which is yet the worſt of all, <hi>they would continue ſacrilegiouſly to rob the Lord of his honour even when they are dead.</hi> It is an undue honour, which is ſtoln from God, which they ſo much ſeek for (For were it but ſuch as is a uſeful means to his honour, he would not be offended with them) And when the Saints ſay [<hi>Not unto us Lord, but unto thy name give the glory</hi>] theſe ſinners are not content to rob God of his honour as long as they live, but they would do it even after death. If we had not certainly known the truth of it, we ſhould have thought it an incredible thing, that ever any man ſhould come to that impiety, pride and madneſs, as to deſire to be worſhipped as a God when he was dead. Much more, that the <hi>moſt of the world</hi> ſhould be ſo far diſtracted as to do it. And yet ſo it hath been, and ſo it is in too great a meaſure. And truly the wicked or Proud diſpoſition that is predominant in the hearts of all the unſanctified, doth take up no ſnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where it hath but hopes of ſucceſs to actuate it. Not a man of them but would be honoured as Gods when they are dead: Though I know thoſe of them that feel not this much in themſelves, will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. Conſider what an hainous injury this is to God, and to the ſouls of men, that you ſhould leave your Names as Idols to the world, to entice ſo many thouſand men to ſin, and to be a ſtanding enemy to the honour of God, by encroaching on his right, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eye of mens obſervation and admiration from him to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:34706:214"/>11. Conſider alſo, how that by theſe deſires of earthly honour to your ſelves, and making this the End of your endeavours, you corrupt abundance of excellent works (materially conſidered) and turn them into mortal ſins. If Princes rule &amp; fight for themſelves, I have told you already what they do: but if this were done for God, it would have another <hi>form,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>reward,</hi> as it had another End. What a doleful caſe is it that ſuch excellent works, as alms-deeds, and acts of bounty to Church, or poor, or Commonwealth, in buildings, lands, or any the like works, ſhould be all turned into ſin and death, by ſuch a ſelfiſh vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious intent? And that their ſouls ſhould be ſuffering for thoſe works that others receive much good by! What a ſad caſe is it, that Hiſtorians, Lawyers, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Philoſophers, Linguiſts, and the Profeſſors of all the Sciences, ſhould undo themſelves for ever by thoſe excellent works that edifie the world! Nay what can be more lamentable to think of, than that able and learned Divines themſelves ſhould loſe their own ſouls in the ſtudying, and preaching thoſe precious truths, that are ſaving unto others; and that ſuch excellent writings as remain a ſtanding bleſſing to the Church ſhould be the Authors of mortal ſin! And yet ſo it is, if the renown and immortality of a name on Earth be the End that all this work is done for.</p>
               <p>12. Laſtly, Conſider that if <hi>Honour be good for you,</hi> it is better attained by <hi>minding your duty for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and denying your own Honour,</hi> than by ſeeking it: For Honour is the ſhadow that will follow you if you fly from it, and fly from you if you follow it. What Chriſt here ſaith of Life, is true of Honor: He that ſeeketh and ſaveth it ſhall loſe it, and he that loſeth it for Chriſt ſhall find it. The greateſt Honour is to deny our ſelves, and our own honour, and to do moſt for the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:34706:214"/>
Honour of God; and to be contented to be nothing that God may be all. For you have his promiſe, that them that honour him he will honour, but they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LI.</hi> Q. Whether Self-denial lie in renouncing Propriety?</head>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>WHether doth ſelf-denial require us to renounce Propriety, and to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as our own</hi> (as the Monks among the Papiſts ſwear to do, as part of their ſtate of perfection: &amp; a book called <hi>The way to the Sabbath of Reſt,</hi> dothteach us?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That there ſhould <hi>be no Propriety</hi> in goods, or eſtate among men, is contrary to the will of God, who hath made men his <hi>Stewards,</hi> and truſted ſeveral perſons with ſeveral <hi>talents</hi> and <hi>forbidden ſtealing,</hi> and commanded men to <hi>labour</hi> that <hi>they may have to give to him that needeth; and he that hath this worlds goods and ſeeth his brother have need,</hi> muſt not
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34706:215"/>
ſhut <hi>up the bowels of his compaſſion.</hi> It is a ſtanding duty to <hi>give to the poor;</hi> and we ſhall therefore <hi>have the poor always with us</hi> for this exerciſe of our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And he that <hi>hath nothing,</hi> can <hi>give nothing,</hi> nor uſe it for God. Why did <hi>Paul</hi> require them to <hi>give to the distreſſed Saints, and maintain the Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>gather for ſuch uſes every firſt day of the week,</hi> if he would have men have nothing to give? This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a conceit that needs nothing but Reaſon and the reading and belief of Scripture to confute it.</p>
               <p>2. But as no man is a <hi>Proprietary,</hi> or hath any thing of his <hi>Own</hi> in the ſtrict and Abſolute ſenſe, becauſe all is Gods, and we are but <hi>Stewards;</hi> ſo no man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his humane analogical propriety, when God call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to give it up: No man may retain any thing from Gods Uſe and ſervice which he hath a propriety in. We have ſo much Propriety as that no man muſt rob us; and ſo much as our works of charity are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable, though it be but giving a cup of cold water, which could not be without propriety; for who will reward him that gives that which is none of his own? yea it is made the matter of the laſt judgement [<hi>I was hungry, and ye fed me,; I was naked, and ye cloathed me,</hi> &amp;c.] Which they could not have done if they had not had food and cloathing to beſtow. So that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of <hi>propriety</hi> would deſtroy all exerciſe of charity in ſuch kinds, and deſtroy all Societies and orderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and induſtry in the world.</p>
               <p>But yet when God calls for any thing from us, we muſt preſently obey, and quit all title to it, and reſign it freely and gladly to his will.</p>
               <p>And 3. There muſt be ſo much vigour of charity, and ſenſe of our neighbours wants, as that no man muſt ſhut up the bowels of compaſſion: but as we muſt love our neighbours as our ſelves, ſo muſt we relieve them as
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:34706:215"/>
a ſecond <hi>ſelf;</hi> yea and before our ſelves, if Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or honour ſhould require it. If we muſt <hi>lay down our lives for the brethren,</hi> much more our eſtates. So that <hi>Levelling Community</hi> is abominable; but <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Community</hi> is a Chriſtian duty, and the great Character of ſincere Love to Chriſt in his members. And therefore in the Primitive Church there was no forbidding of <hi>Propriety;</hi> but there was 1. A reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all to God, to ſignifie that they were content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forſake all for him, and did prefer Chriſt and the Kingdom of God before all: and 2. There was ſo great vigor of true Charity, as that all men vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſupplied the wants of the Church and poor, and voluntarily made all things as common, that is, <hi>Common by voluntary Communication for uſe,</hi> though not <hi>common in primary title:</hi> And ſo no man took any thing as his Own, when God, and his Churches, and his Brethrens wants did call for it. O that we had more of that Chriſtian Love that ſhould cauſe a <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Community</hi> which is the true Mean between the <hi>Monkiſh Community,</hi> and the <hi>ſelfiſh tenacious Propriety!</hi> Levelling hath not deſtroyed one ſoul for ten thouſand that an inordinate love of Propriety hath deſtroyed.</p>

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34706:216"/>
ſtate doth ordinarily (not always) call men off from that free attendance on the ſervice of God without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction which is very deſirable: And therefore thoſe that are capable of doing God any notable ſervice, which Marriage is like to hinder them from, ſhould avoid it, if they can without a greater evil. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church did think it for many ages, ſo fit for Miniſters to be ſingle, that they might have the leſs of worldly affairs and cares to call them off from the work of God, and their carnal relations might not hinder them from more publick duties or charitable works. The Papiſts therefore miſtakingly take the <hi>Vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity</hi> to be an entring into a ſtate of Perfection, and ſinfully condemn the Marriage of Prieſts: when the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith [<hi>A Biſhop muſt be blameleſs, the Husband of one Wife—having his children in ſubjection</hi>] 1 Tim. 3. 24. And ſo of Deacons, verſ. 12. And others run into the other extream. But the true Mean is this: 1. Ordinarily Marriage is more <hi>diſtracting</hi> and hindering to us in the ſervice of God than a ſingle life, Eſpecially to Miniſters, and ſuch as ſhould wholly addict themſelves to the publick ſervice of the Church. 2. But yet all men are not alike ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it or from it. Some may be neceſſitated to it by the temper of their bodies to avoid a greater evil, even ſin it ſelf; and ſome may have no ſuch neceſſity: ſome may have their worldly eſtate and affairs in ſuch a plight, that they can far better manage them with freedom for Gods ſervice in a married than a ſingle ſtate: but with others it is not ſo: and eſpecially with very few Miniſters. So that a ſingle or married life is in it ſelf indifferent: but as a means to Gods ſervice, that is a Duty to one that is a ſin to another, but becauſe that a ſingle life is more commonly free and fitteſt for this great end, therefore the Apoſtle preferreth it as
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:34706:216"/>
better, becauſe more ſutable to the ſtate of the moſt, (at leaſt in thoſe times) though to <hi>ſome,</hi> marriage may be a duty. So that every one ſhould impartially enquire, in which ſtate they may do God the greateſt ſervice, and that they ſhould chooſe, not on Popiſh ground, as if it were <hi>Commended</hi> to that particular perſon to whom it is not <hi>Commanded,</hi> and were an <hi>Evangelical counſel of perfection,</hi> and to be <hi>vowed;</hi> but in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ordering of our lives, applying the general rules of Scripture to our ſeveral eſtates.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It requireth us not to have ſuch carnal thoughts of theſe offices, as to look on them only as places of honour, and power, and eaſe; nor yet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them for ſuch carnal ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor yet to thruſt our ſelves upon them without a call, as being the Judges of our own ſufficiency. But ſelf-denial is ſo far from forbidding the offices and imployments themſelves, as that it is a great point of ſelf-denial for a man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:34706:217"/>
them well, to undertake them, if he mean to manage them ſincerely and faithfully. For were it not that the ſweetneſs of Gods intereſt and his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the benefits of the Church, our brethren and our ſouls, did ingratiate theſe offices and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to an honeſt mind, they would be ſo very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom, that fleſh and blood would either make them carnal by abuſe, or never endure them. And therefore hath God given them an addition of honour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, and to put an honour on their work, for the furthering of its ſucceſs. Experience certifieth me that the work of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is far more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the fleſh, than the bodily labour of a poor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer or plowman is: ſo that without great ſelf-denial no man will be a Miniſter, that doth not carnally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the function for another thing than indeed it is. And I think I may ſay the like in its degree, by the <hi>Magiſtracy:</hi> Eſpecially by them in higheſt Power, who have the greateſt work. Certain I am, if they faithfully do their duties, they will find more burden to the fleſh and mind, than poor men that have only a Family to provide for. Though many ignorant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly poor people that ſit at home in peace, and little know the care, and grief, and trouble of their Rulers, do wickedly murmur at their very calling, as if they had nothing but honour, and idleneſs, and exceſs, yet if they had tryed and taſted their care and trouble a few moneths, they would think a private life the eaſier, and confeſs that there is need of <hi>much ſelf-denial</hi> for a man to <hi>accept</hi> of <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> or <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth them, and reſolveth to uſe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe Offices are of neceſſity to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, and eſtabliſhed to that End by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And the fifth Commandment requires us to pay

                  </gap>o imagine that it's any part of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Office of Magiſtracy or Miniſtry, is to make it <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> to deſtroy the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and be a cruel enemy to mankind, and to our Country, and to rebel againſt the Powers that are ordained of God, and thereby to receive damnation to our ſelves, <hi>Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3.

               <p>But yet this I muſt ſay: that if a worthy perſon ſtand in competition with us, <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> requireth us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them before our ſelves, and to refuſe honours and dignities, when the good of the publick doth not call us to deny our ſelves more in the accepting them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You might as wiſely imagine that ſelf-denial lieth in hating or denying any of Gods Works, even the frame of nature: or in denying food and rayment to our bodies, or in denying our own lives ſo as to cut our throats. For the ſame Law of Nature that made me a man, and requireth me to preſerve my life, did make me a ſon, and require me to love and honour my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: And it is in the Decalogue; the <hi>firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with promiſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 2. It is frequently and expreſly commanded in Scripture,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:34706:218"/>
that children love, honour, obey their parents; and terrible curſes are pronounced on the breakers of theſe Commands, <hi>Eph. 6. 1. 4. &amp; 5. 22, 5. Coloſ. 3. 20, 21, 22. &amp; 4. 1. Exod. 21. 17. Levit. 20. 9. Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. 21. 18, 19. &amp; 27. 16. Prov. 30. 17. Mat. 15. 4. &amp;</hi> 19. 19. And if children were not bound to parents, then parents ſhould not be bound to educate children, and then they would be expoſed to miſery and periſh. One would think that there ſhould never ſuch a Sect have riſen up, that ſhould be worſe than the very brutes, who by the inſtinct of nature love their young ones, and their dams. But the Spirit foretold us, that which is come to paſs, that in the laſt and perilous times, there ſhould be men that are <hi>diſobedient</hi> to <hi>parents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out natural affection,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 3.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>contracted Relations,</hi> they are the expreſs inſtitution of God, ſo frequently owned by him in Scripture, and the duties of them ſo frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that I will not trouble you with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of the paſſages. And as for the Adverſaries ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, they are frivolous. The meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words, [<hi>that we know no man after the fleſh</hi>] I have told you before: The words of Chriſt to his Mother, Joh. 2. 4. [<hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee!</hi>] which they alledge, are nothing for their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cauſe; they being no more but Chriſt's due Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his Mothers miſtake, who would preſcribe him the time and manner of doing Miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have him do them in a way of oſtentation, which things did not belong to her, but to the Spirit of God, and the Lord himſelf. And whereas they alledge that Text, Luke 14. 26. <hi>that father, mother, brother, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are to be hated, for Chriſt;</hi> I anſwer, Even as our <hi>own lives</hi> are to be <hi>hated,</hi> which are alſo num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with them: that is, They muſt be all forſaken
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:34706:219"/>
rather than Chriſt ſhould be forſaken, and therefore loved leſs than he, and but for his ſake. If therefore this Text require you not at all to cut your own throats, or ſome way kill your ſelves, then it doth not require you to withdraw your due affections from Natural or Contracted Relations. I muſt crave the Readers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that I trouble him with confuting ſuch unnatural opinions, and deſire him to believe that it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am urged to it by the arguments of ſome delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſouls that are not unlikely to do hurt by them with ſome.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Where our Natural Kindred are as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and as needy as others, there is a double obligation on us, both natural and ſpiritual, to love and relieve them. 2. Where they are <hi>as Holy</hi> as others, but <hi>leſs needy,</hi> there may lie a double obligation on us, to <hi>love them,</hi> and yet not to give to them. 3. If they be <hi>more needy,</hi> or as <hi>needy</hi> as others, though withal they be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> we are not thereby excuſed from natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or charitable relief. 4. We muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>children,</hi> or ſuch <hi>kindred as nature</hi> caſteth upon our care for proviſion, and <hi>ſuch kindred</hi> as are by nature caſt upon <hi>others.</hi> If parents were not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to relieve and provide for their own children, they would be expoſed to miſery, and man ſhould be more
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:34706:219"/>
unnatural than brutes. So that even when by ungodlineſs, they are leſs amiable than others, yet God hath bound men to provide for them more. 5. <hi>Natural love</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> are much different; you may have a ſtronger <hi>Natural Love</hi> to an <hi>ungodly child,</hi> than to a <hi>Godly ſtranger,</hi> but you muſt have a <hi>ſpiritual Love</hi> to that <hi>Godly ſtranger,</hi> more than to your <hi>child;</hi> And that <hi>ſpiritual Love</hi> muſt be (at leaſt as to the Rational and Eſtimative part) much greater than the other <hi>Natural Love:</hi> And yet you may be bound to <hi>Give</hi> more, where you are not bound to <hi>Love</hi> more. For it is not <hi>Love</hi> only that is the cauſe of <hi>giving;</hi> but we are Gods Stewards, and muſt diſpoſe of what we have as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth us: and his ſtanding Law of Nature for the preſervation of mankind, is, that parents take care of their children, as ſuch.</p>
               <p>6. The will and ſervice of God, being it that ſhould diſpoſe of all that we have, we muſt in all ſuch doubts look to theſe two things for our direction: Firſt to the particular Precepts of the Word: and there we find the fore-ſaid duty of parents expreſſed, and withal the duty of relieving all that are needy to our power: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to the General Precept: and there we find, that we muſt honour God with our ſubſtance, and lay out all our talents to his ſervice. And ſo the duty lieth plain before us. If you have a child that is wicked, yet as prents provide him his daily bread; and leave him enough for daily bread when you die. But more he ſhould not have from me: but the reſt (had I ten thouſand pound a year) I would lay out that way that my conſcience told me may be moſt ſerviceable to God. For 1. I am not bound to ſtrengthen an enemy of Chriſt, and enable him to do the greater miſchief. 2. Nor to caſt away the mercies of God. 3. If the Law required the parents to cauſe ſuch a Rebellious ſon to be
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:34706:220"/>
put to death, Deut. 21. 18. then ſurely to provide him daily bread, is now as much as a parent is obliged to. And if it be an expreſs Command, <hi>that he that will not labour ſhall not eat,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 10. ſuch <hi>uſeleſs members</hi> forſeiting their very <hi>ſuſtenance,</hi> then ſurely he that is <hi>ſuch or worſe,</hi> ſpeeds fair if you leave him food and raiment. 4. And the great command of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to Gods Glory,</hi> and <hi>ſerving him with our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> will not be obeyed, if you leave your Riches and Eſtates in the hands of ſuch perſons meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are your Children. No doubt but that is a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> and unconſcionable courſe, and the thing that ſets up the ungodly to diſturb the Church, &amp; Lord it over the world, while parents furniſh them with Riches to do the Devil eminent ſervice with.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But who knows but God may convert them? Anſw.</hi> You cannot guide your actions by things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. You have no promiſe of their converſion; nor much <hi>probability,</hi> when they have fruſtrated all your Counſels and means of their good education; and grace is ſupernatural: and therefore you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon grounds that are known.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>remoter Kindred,</hi> if they may be as ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God with what I give them as others, nature teacheth me to prefer them before others: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Grace teacheth me, both to love a godly ſtranger better than ungodly kindred, and to lay out all that I have as may be moſt ſerviceable to God.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LVII.</hi> Q. How we muſt love our Neighbours as our ſelves.</head>
               <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>HOw is it that Self-denial requireth us to love our neighbour as our ſelves: Is it with the ſame degree of Love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwered this on the by, before: Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1. The chief part of the precept is Negative: thus q. d. [<hi>Set not up thy ſelf againſt the welfare of thy neighbour: Draw not from him, or covet not that which is his to thy ſelf, and confine not thy love and care of thyſelf</hi>] 2. And it comprehendeth this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and that as to the <hi>kind</hi> of Love, we ſhould love both our ſelves and neighbours as <hi>means to God,</hi> and for the intereſt of God; and in that reſpect there is an equality: we muſt <hi>appretiative</hi> or eſtimatively love a better and more ſerviceable man that hath more of Gods Spirit in him, <hi>above</hi> our ſelves: and an equal perſon equally with our ſelves, with this <hi>Rational</hi> Love, which intendeth all for God. 3. But <hi>Natural Love</hi> which is put into a man for ſelf-preſervation will be ſtronger to <hi>ſelf</hi> than to another, and alloweth us <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> to prefer, and firſt preſerve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our ſelves. And in this regard, our <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> muſt be loved but as a <hi>ſecond ſelf,</hi> or next our ſelves. 4. But this <hi>Natural Love</hi> in the exerciſe of it, at leaſt in imperate acts, is to be <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to our <hi>Rational ſpiritual Love,</hi> and to be over-maſtered by it. And therefore it is that as <hi>Reaſon</hi> teacheth an Heathen to prefer his <hi>Country</hi> before his <hi>life,</hi> (though the inſtinct of Nature incline us more to life) ſo <hi>faith</hi> teacheth a Chriſtian much more, to prefer <hi>Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel, Church, Common-wealth,</hi> and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:34706:221"/>
his <hi>neighbours good</hi> when it more conduceth to theſe ends, than his own, before himſelf, his liberty or life.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LVIII.</hi> Q. Is Self-revenge and Penance ſelf-denial?</head>
               <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>WHether ſelf-denial require us after ſin, to uſe vindictive penance or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the fleſh, by faſting, watching, going bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, lying hard, wearing hair-cloth, or to do this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily? as ſome of the Papiſts, Monks, and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The eaſineſs of this caſe may allow a brief deciſion. 1. The Body muſt be ſo far afflicted, as is needful to humble it, and ſubdue it to the ſpirit, and tame its Rebellion, and fit it for the ſervice of God. 2. The exerciſe of a holy revenge on our ſelves may be a lower end, ſubservient to this. 3. It muſt alſo be ſo far humbled as is neceſſary to expreſs Repentance to the Church when Abſolution is expected upon publick Repentance. 4. As alſo to concur with the ſoul in ſecret or open humiliation.</p>
               <p>But 1. He that ſhall think that whippings, or ſackcloth, or going bare-foot or other ſelf-puniſhing, are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good works, and meritorious with God, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Juſtice, or are a ſtate of perfection, doth offer God a hainous ſin, under the name and conceit of a good work. 2. And he that ſhall by ſuch ſelf-afflicting unfit his Body for the ſervice of God, yea that doth not che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it ſo far as is neceſſary to fit it for duty, is guilty of ſelf-murder, and defrauding God of his ſervice, and abuſing his creature, and depriving others of the help
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:34706:221"/>
we owe them: ſo that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> one word, the <hi>Body muſt be ſo uſed as may beſt fit it for Gods ſervice.</hi> And to think that ſelf-afflicting is a good work, meerly as it is penalty or ſuffering to the body, or that we may go further here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is to think 1. That we ſhould uſe our Body worſe than our beaſt; for we will no further afflict <hi>him</hi> than is neceſſary to tame him, or ſerve our ſelves by him, and not to diſable him for ſervice. 2. And it will teach men to kill themſelves: for that is a greater penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the body than whipping or faſting. 3. And it is an offering God a ſacrifice of cruelty and Robbery, which we commit againſt himſelf and man.</p>
               <p>But I muſt needs add, that though ſome Fryars and Melancholy people are apt to go too far in this, and pine their bodies or miſuſe them with conceits of merit and ſatisfaction; yet almoſt all the common people run into the contrary extream, and pamper and pleaſe their fleſh, to the diſpleaſing of God, and the ruine of their ſouls. And I know but few that have need to be reſtrained from afflicting or taking down the fleſh too much.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Stoicks and ſome Behmeniſts think ſo: But ſo doth not God or any well informed man. For 1. God would not have made the Affections in vain: It is not the Paſſions, but the diſorder of them that is ſinful, or the fruit of ſin. 2. We are commanded to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:34706:222"/>
exerciſe all the Affections or Paſſions for God, and on other ſutable objects. We muſt <hi>Love</hi> God with all the heart, and ſoul, and might, which is not without affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or paſſion. We muſt <hi>Love</hi> his ſervants, his Church, his Word, his wayes: We muſt <hi>fear</hi> him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them that can kill us: we muſt <hi>hunger and thirſt</hi> after his Righteouſneſs, and <hi>pant</hi> after him as the Hart doth after the Water-brooks: We muſt be <hi>angry</hi> and ſin not. A <hi>zeal</hi> for God is the life of our Graces: we must <hi>always be zealous in a good matter; fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> We muſt <hi>hate evil,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow for it,</hi> when we are guilty, and <hi>grieve</hi> under the ſenſe of our miſcarriages, and Gods diſpleaſure. And all theſe (expreſly commanded in the Word) are holy <hi>Affections</hi> or <hi>Paſsions</hi> of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>3. Yea it is the Work of the Holy Ghoſt to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie all theſe Paſſions that they may be uſed for God; and they are called by the names of the ſeveral graces of the Spirit. And it is not <hi>Paſsion,</hi> but <hi>diſordered Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> that muſt be denied.</p>

               <p>Queſt. 10. <hi>HOw far muſt we deny our own Reaſon? Anſw.</hi> 1. We muſt not <hi>be unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> nor <hi>live unreaſonably,</hi> nor <hi>believe unreaſonably,</hi> nor <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>chooſe,</hi> or let out any affection unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. We are commanded to be ready to give a <hi>reaſon of our hopes.</hi> It is our <hi>Rational</hi> faculty that proveth us men, and is eſſential to us: And without it we can neither underſtand the things of God or man: For how ſhould we underſtand without an underſtanding?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:34706:222"/>But yet Reaſon muſt thus far be denied. 1. We muſt not think highlier of our Reaſon than it deſerves either in it ſelf, or as compared to others. 2. We muſt not ſatisfie its curioſity in prying into unrevealed things. 3. Nor muſt we ſatisfie or ſuffer its preſumption in judging our Brethren, or cenſuring mens hearts or ways uncharitably. 4. Nor muſt we endure it to riſe up againſt the Word or ways of God, or contradict or quarrel with Divine Revelations, though we cannot ſee the particular Evidence or Reaſon of each Truth, nor reconcile them together in our apprehenſions. Though we may not take any thing to be the Word of God without Reaſon; yet when he have Reaſon to it take to be his Word, we muſt believe and ſubmit to all that is in it, without any more Reſon for our belief. For the formal Reaſon of our belief, is, becauſe God is true that did reveal this Word: And we have the greateſt Reaſon in the world to believe all that he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

               <p>Queſt. 11. <hi>IF Self-denial require us to Content our ſouls in the Will of God, then whether muſt we be content with his afflictions, or permiſsion of ſin, or the Churches ſufferings; and 1. How will this ſtand with our due ſenſe of Gods diſplcaſure and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 2. And with our praying againſt them. 3. And our uſe of means for their removal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>Will of God</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>Hurt</hi> which he willeth us is another: and the <hi>Good En
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:34706:223"/>
for</hi> which he willeth it, is a third. The afflicting <hi>Will</hi> of God is good, and muſt be Loved as good: and the <hi>End and Benefit</hi> of Chaſtiſement is good and muſt be loved: But the <hi>hurt</hi> as hurt muſt not be loved. It is not Gods <hi>Will</hi> that we muſt reſiſt, or ſeek to change; nor yet is it the End or Benefit of the Chaſtiſement; but only the <hi>hurt,</hi> which our folly hath made a ſutable means. And we may not ſeek to remove this <hi>hurt,</hi> till the <hi>effect</hi> be procured, or on terms that may conſiſt with the <hi>End</hi> of it. And this is not againſt the Will of God, that when the good is attained, the Affliction be removed.</p>
               <p>2. And you muſt diſtinguiſh between his <hi>Pleaſed, and Diſpleaſed Will!</hi> his complacency and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and his Diſplacency and Rejecting Will. Every act of Gods Will muſt be approved and loved as Good in God; but it is not every one that we may Reſt and Rejoyce in as Good to us, and as our felicity. We muſt be grieved for Gods Diſpleaſure, and yet Love even that holy will that is diſpleaſed with us; and we muſt be ſenſible of Gods judgments, and yet Love the Will that doth inflict them. But it is only the <hi>Love</hi> of God and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of his <hi>Will to us,</hi> that can be the <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>felicity</hi> of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>3. Some acts of Gods Will are about the <hi>Means,</hi> and have a tendency to a further end; and ſome are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>End</hi> it ſelf. His <hi>Commanding Will</hi> we muſt <hi>Love and obey:</hi> his <hi>forbidding</hi> Will muſt have the ſame affections: his <hi>threatning Will</hi> we muſt <hi>love and fear;</hi> his <hi>Rewarding Will</hi> we muſt <hi>Love and Rejoyce in:</hi> His <hi>full Accepting Will,</hi> that is, <hi>his Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi> in us, we muſt <hi>Reſt and Delight our ſouls in for ever.</hi> And thus we muſt comply with the Will of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are ſuch abundance of abſtruſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Controverſies <hi>de anima &amp; fine</hi> that ſtand here in the way, that I muſt only decide this briefly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly for vulgar capacities. Schoolmen and other Philoſophers are not ſo much as agreed what a <hi>final Cauſe</hi> is. But this much briefly may give ſome degree of ſatisfaction to the Moderate. 1. No fleſhly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, Pleaſures, or Honours muſt be made our End. This we are agreed on. 2. The Ultimate End of all the Saints, is an End that is ſutable to the Nature of Love: and that is, perfectly to love God, and Pleaſe him, and ſerve him, and to be perfectly beloved of him, and behold his glory. So that it is not an <hi>End</hi> of <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,</hi> or <hi>Love of Concupiſcence,</hi> or for our Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only; but it is the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Love of Friendſhip:</hi> Now all <hi>Love of friendſhip</hi> doth take in both the <hi>party Loving,</hi> and the <hi>party beloved</hi> into the <hi>End:</hi> For the End is a <hi>perfect Union</hi> of both, according to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. And it being <hi>Intentio amantis,</hi> the <hi>End of Love,</hi> both <hi>God and our ſelves</hi> muſt be comprehended in it, as the parties to be <hi>united;</hi> and ſo it is both <hi>for him, and for our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:34706:224"/>3. But yet though <hi>both parties</hi> as <hi>united</hi> be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the <hi>End,</hi> it is not <hi>equally,</hi> but with great <hi>inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> For 1. <hi>God</hi> being <hi>Infinite Goodneſs it ſelf,</hi> muſt <hi>appreciative</hi> in eſtimation and affection, be preferred exceedingly before <hi>our ſelves;</hi> ſo that in deſiring this <hi>bleſſed Union,</hi> we muſt <hi>more</hi> deſire it to <hi>Pleaſe and Praiſe him,</hi> and give him his due, for which he Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Redeemed, and Glorified us, than to be <hi>our ſelves happy</hi> in him. 2. And God being not a <hi>meer friend,</hi> but our <hi>Abſolute Lord</hi> of <hi>Infinite Power and Glory,</hi> it muſt be more in our <hi>Intention</hi> to <hi>bring</hi> to him eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than to <hi>receive</hi> from him; (though both muſt be comprized:) For <hi>Receiving</hi> is <hi>for our ſelves,</hi> further than we intend it for <hi>Returns;</hi> but <hi>Returning</hi> is for God; Not to <hi>add to his bleſſedneſſ;</hi> but to <hi>Pleaſe his Will, and give him his own;</hi> For he <hi>made all things for himſelf.</hi> And ſo that in <hi>union with him</hi> we may <hi>give him his own</hi> in <hi>fulleſt love and Praiſe, and ſervice,</hi> and <hi>thus pleaſe him,</hi> muſt be the higeſt part of our <hi>Intention,</hi> about our <hi>own felicity in enjoying him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you may ſee, that <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> teacheth no man to ask, [<hi>Whether he could be content to be damned for Chriſt?</hi>] For this is contrary to our propounded <hi>End,</hi> in the <hi>whole.</hi> For a <hi>damned</hi> man hath no <hi>union</hi> of Love with God, and giveth him not his own in Love or Praiſes.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>What ſay you then by the wiſhes of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Paul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſaying of <hi>Moſes</hi> is very plain, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32. He doth not deſire that his ſoul might be made a ranſom for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but that if God would not pardon them, but deſtroy them and caſt them off, he would blot out <hi>Moſes</hi> name from his Book, that is, from among the number of the living; ſo that his ſaying is no other than ſuch as <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Jonas</hi> was
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:34706:224"/>
[<hi>What good will my life do me, if I live to ſee thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple caſt off, and all thy wonders for them buryed? therefore either let them live in thy ſight or kill me with them</hi>] This is the plain meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Pauls,</hi> the difficulty is ſomewhat greater: 1. Some think that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3.) that he once wiſhed himſelf to be no Chriſtan in the days of his ignorance, and all through his Zeal for the Jewith Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this is improbable. 2. Some think that he meaneth only, I could wiſh to be given up to death for them, as the accurſed under the Law.</p>
               <p>3. Some think he meaneth only, I could wiſh my ſelf yet unconverted to Chriſt, ſo they were converted.</p>
               <p>4. Some think, the meaning is, [<hi>I could wiſh my ſelf caſt out of the Church,</hi> and <hi>given up to Satan for any bodily ſuffering.</hi>]</p>
               <p>5. Some ſay it is only to have his ſalvation defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>6. And ſome that it is damnation for a time.</p>
               <p>But 7. The plain meaning ſeemeth to be this; [<hi>ſo great is my Love to my Countrymen the Jews, that if it were offered to my choice whether they or I without them ſhould enjoy Chriſt; I would yield to be caſt out of his ſight for ever, rather than they ſhould</hi>] where mark; 1. That it is not a <hi>wiſh that it were ſo:</hi> for he knew that this was no means to promote their ſalvation: but it's a diſcovery of his affection that <hi>would</hi> with or chooſe this <hi>if it were</hi> a means to that End. 2. And it is not the <hi>ſin of not Loving Chriſt,</hi> that he would chooſe, but only the <hi>miſery of being deprived of his bleſſed preſence.</hi> 3. And the Reaſons of this his choice are theſe two conjunct; 1. Becauſe the ſouls of ſo many thouſands is in impartial Reaſon more to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led than the ſoul of one; 2. And principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:34706:225"/>
by the converſion and ſalvation of a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God may be more honored and ſerved than by one.</p>
               <p>And note farther, 1. That this is not ſet as a mark for every Chriſtian to try the truth of his Love by: 2. But yet no doubt but it is a duty and degree of Grace that every one ſhould aim at. For 1. We ſee among Heathens that nature it ſelf teacheth them that a man ſhould lay down his life for his Country; becauſe a Country is better than a man. And proportionably, Reaſon tells us that the ſalvation of a Country being a greater good than of any one, it ſhould be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: And Self-love goeth againſt plain Reaſon when it contradicteth this. What mans Reaſon doth not tell him that it were <hi>better he ſhould die,</hi> than the <hi>world ſhould be deſtroyed,</hi> or the Sun turned into darkneſs; yea or that one Church or Country periſh? And ſo of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>2. And it is agreeable to the nature of Love to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that moſt that moſt Pleaſeth him whom we Love: and therefore to deſire rather that God may have multitudes than one, and be ſerved and Praiſed by them. So much about the Matter of ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p>III. I Have finiſhed the two firſt things which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you under the uſe of Exhortation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>trial</hi> of your <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> and the particulars in which it conſiſteth, and muſt be exerciſed; and there I have ſhewed you 1. In what reſpect <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be denied, 2. What that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is that muſt be denied, as to the inward Diſpoſition; and 3. What is that objective <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> that muſt be denied, which conſiſteth in ſo many Particulars that I cannot undertake to enumerate all: but I have mentioned twenty Particulars under the general head of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and ten under the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:34706:225"/>
general Head of <hi>Honour,</hi> and have referred you to another Treatiſe for that which conſiſteth in worldly <hi>profits.</hi> And now I come to the <hi>third</hi> part of my work, which is to ſhew you a little more fully the Greatneſs of the ſin of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and give you thence ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reaſons as may conduce to the cure of it: which are theſe that follow.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>SElfiſhneſs is the grand Idolatry of the world, and ſelf the worlds Idol,</hi> as I have told you before. It uſurpeth the Place of God himſelf in mens Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wills, affections and endeavours. It was the work of the ten Diſcoveries in the Beginning of the Book to demonſtrate this: and therefore I ſhall ſay but little more. But <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> deſtroyeth the worlds great Idol, and giveth God his own again. The <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> lean moſt to their own underſtandings: but the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> truſt the Wiſdom of God. The <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> are careful principally, for themſelves, and their own felicity, even a terrene and carnal kind of felicity: But the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally careful how they may Pleaſe and Honour God, and promote the welfare of his Church, and in this way attain the ſpiritual everlaſting felicity of the Saints. The <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> muſt have their own humors pleaſed, and their own wills accompliſhed, and their own deſires granted: But the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> do ſlay their own carnal wills, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and conceits, and lay them dead at the feet of Chriſt, that his will alone may be exalted. The <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> would have all men love them, admire them, and commend them. But the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> would have all men to Love,

Admire, and Glorifie the Lord, above himſelf and all the world. The ſelfiſh can bear with Gods enemies, but not with their <hi>Own:</hi> and they can ſuffer men to wrong Cod, and ſin againſt him, more patiently than they can ſuffer them to wrong themſelves. But it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with the <hi>ſelf-denying:</hi> A wrong to God and his Church ſeemeth far greater to them than a wrong againſt themſelves. In a word, the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> intend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and live to themſelves, and the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> intend God, and live to him, in the courſe of their lives. And therefore when the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> are troubled about many things, the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> are minding the One thing Neceſſary: And when the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> are ſeeking to know what is good or evil to their fleſh; the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> are ſeeking to Pleaſe the Lord, and deſire to know nothing but him in Chriſt crucified; and they could part with all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the creatures, as uſeful to themſelves, if they could but know more of God in Chriſt. The <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh</hi> would be in his own hands, at his own diſpoſe and government, and the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> would be in the hands of God, and at his diſpoſe and Government.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs, the very ſtate of mans Apoſtacy did lie in turning from Cod to <hi>ſelf,</hi> and to the creature for <hi>ſelf:</hi> ſo that he now ſtudyeth, and uſeth, and loveth the Creature but for <hi>himſelf:</hi> And ſo he would have him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all as far out of the hands of God in his own, as poſſibly he can. I gave you my thoughts in the beginning, that this was the meaning of mans knowing Good and Evil by the Fall: And ſince I wrote that, I meet with the ſame Expoſition in <hi>Damaſcene, do Orthodox. fid. li.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>p.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:34706:226"/>
exerciſe of mans obedience and diſobedience. And therefore it is called the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil: Or becauſe it gave man a power to Know his Own nature; which indeed to the perfect is good, but to the infirm is evil; and to them that are yet prone to concupiſcence, as ſtrong meats to the weak and thoſe that need milk. For the Lord that created us, would not have us careful and troubled about many things, nor to become Contrivers and Providers for our own lives: into which it was that <hi>Adam</hi> fell. For when he had eaten, he knew that he was naked, and made hmſelf an apron of fig-leaves to cover his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But before both <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were naked and not aſhamed. And God would have had us inſenſible of (or not to ſuffer by) ſuch things: For this is but an inſenſibility or impaſſibility. But we had One work only to do without vexation and care, which is the work of Angels, unweariedly and continually to praiſe our Creator, and to delight in the contemplation of him, and to caſt all our care on him, as he taught us by the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, Caſt thy care on the Lord, and he ſhall nouriſh thee; aud the Lord taught his own Diſciples in the Goſpel, Take no care what you ſhall eat, nor wherewith you ſhall be cloathed; and again, Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and theſe things ſhall be added to you; and to <hi>Martha: Martha,</hi> thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful: <hi>Mary</hi> hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen beſt part which ſhall not be taken from her;] that is, to ſit at his feet, and hear his word; and this is the tree of Life.] So far <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> who you ſee dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth at the ſame ſenſe, though it be not clearly and fully expreſt by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:34706:227"/>And as man by his Fall, deſired to know what was good and evil for himſelf, that is, to his own Nature, for his daily proviſion and ſafety, that he might be able to chooſe for himſelf, and not truſt himſelf wholly on the Proviſion of God; ſo accordingly God in judgment hath given him over to himſelf according to his deſire, of which more anon.</p>
               <p>And accordingly our Reſtauration from this lapſed ſtate, conſiſteth in retiring from our ſelves to God; and giving up to him again thoſe minds, thoſe thoughts, thoſe wills, thoſe affections that have been, all this while detained from him, and miſ-imployed by <hi>ſelf;</hi> Down then with this Idol and ſet up God. Did you <hi>make</hi> your <hi>ſelves?</hi> or <hi>redeem</hi> your ſelves? or do you ſuſtain your ſelves, or are you ſufficient for your ſelves?

                  </gap> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet for all that. The words are written to ſignifie the <hi>ſpiritual apprehenſions and affections</hi> which the holy inditers had of the matter ſignified by them: And till you come by the help of thoſe words to have the <hi>ſame impreſs upon your ſouls,</hi> the <hi>ſame apprehenſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> which the <hi>inditers</hi> had, and intended to expreſs by them, you have not the perfect underſtanding of the Scriptures; And therefore while you are <hi>wholly</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>their ſpiritual Apprehenſions and Affections,</hi> you do not ſo much as <hi>ſincerely</hi> or <hi>truly</hi> underſtand them; however you may be able to ſpeak as good Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and true Expoſitors in the explaining of them to others. And alſo ſelfiſhneſs in the Will doth make you diſreliſh the Doctrine which you ſhould believe, becauſe that being Practical, either the Doctrine, or its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or the Practice that it puts you on, is againſt your carnal ſelf and intereſt.</p>
               <p>2. And for Prayer, I might eaſily ſhew you, that <hi>ſelf</hi> contradicteth all the parts of it. You ſhould firſt Pray that the <hi>Name of God may be Hallowed,</hi> making his Glory the End of your deſires: But ſelf muſt be its <hi>Own End,</hi> and ſeek the Honour of its <hi>Own Name,</hi> and leſs regardeth the <hi>Hallowing</hi> of <hi>Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt pray that <hi>the Kingdom of God may come:</hi> But this Kingdom treadeth down <hi>ſelf</hi> as an enemy, and therefore no marvel if <hi>ſelf</hi> be unwilling of it. Would you be depoſed, and ſubjected to a ſpiritual government, and do nothing nor have nothing but at the pleaſure of Chriſt? The Reign of <hi>ſelf</hi> is contrary to his reign.</p>
               <p>You muſt pray that the <hi>Will of God may be done.</hi> But <hi>ſelf</hi> hath a Will that is contrary to Gods Will; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very carnal man would be a Lawgiver to himſelf, and

               <p>You muſt pray <hi>each day for your daily bread,</hi> as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that live not on their own proviſion, but on their Fathers love and bounty, and have their addreſs to him for all they want, deſiring but ſuch ſupplies as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or uſeful to them for his ſervice. But <hi>ſelf</hi> deſireth more than <hi>daily bread,</hi> &amp; deſireth not ſo much to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then you for Gods ſervice, as to delight and gratifie the fleſh; and had rather have its ſtock in its own poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than daily to fetch it as you uſe it from God.</p>
               <p>You muſt pray daily <hi>for the forgiveneſs of your ſins,</hi> as people that are grieved for them, and weary of them, and hate them, and are ſenſible of the want and worth of pardon, and of the abundant Grace of Chriſt that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it, and the preciouſneſs of the Goſpel-promiſes that conveigh it, and of your own Unworthineſs by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this ſin. But <hi>ſelf</hi> is not eaſily ſo far abaſed as to be heavy-laden, and ſick of ſin; nor is it eaſily drawn to value Grace, or feel how much you are unworthy of it, or need it; nor eaſily driven to renounce all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and conceits of a Righteouſneſs of your own, and wholly to go out of your ſelves to Chriſt for life: <hi>Self</hi> cannot ſpare ſin: for it is its darling and play-fellow, its food, its recreation and its life.</p>
               <p>You muſt daily pray to be ſaved <hi>from temptation, and delivered from Evil;</hi> even the Evil of ſin, as <hi>well</hi> as <hi>of</hi> puniſhment. But <hi>ſelf</hi> doth Love the ſin, and therefore cannot long to be delivered from it, and therefore Loveth the temptation that leadeth to it, &amp; indeed is a continual tempter to it ſelf. Would the Covetous worldling be delivered from his worldlineſs? Would the Ambitious
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:34706:228"/>
Proud perſon be delivered from his Pride or Honours? or the ſenſual perſon from his ſenſual delights? No, they do not Love the Preacher or people that are againſt them in theſe ways: nor the holy <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> that is contrary to them; nor the Scripture that condemneth them; nor indeed the Lord himſelf that forbids them, and is the author of all theſe Laws and holy ways which they abhor. So that you ſee how <hi>ſelf</hi> is an enemy to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Petition in the Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>3. And it is a violation of all the ten Commandments. The firſt and ſecond it is moſt directly againſt, and is the very thing forbidden in them: and all the reſt it is againſt conſequentially, and is the virtual breach of them, as diſpoſing and drawing the ſoul thereunto.</p>
               <p>The two Tables have two Great Commands, which are the ſum of the whole Law, and all the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are conſequents or particulars from theſe. The ſum of the firſt Table is [<hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart</hi>] or <hi>above all</hi>] This is the <hi>firſt Commandment</hi>] <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods before me</hi>] which is put firſt as being the <hi>Fundamental Law,</hi> commanding <hi>ſubjection it ſelf</hi> to the <hi>ſoveraign Power</hi> of God, which neceſſarily goes before all <hi>actual obedience</hi> to particular precepts. But <hi>ſelf</hi> is directly againſt this, and ſets up man as a God to himſelf: And all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Love themſelves better than God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot Love him above all.</p>
               <p>And therefore neither ſecond, third or fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand can be ſincerely kept by ſuch: For when <hi>ſelf</hi> is ſet up, and God <hi>denied,</hi> in ſtead of the right worſhipping of God, they are worſhipping themſelves, or ſuiting God worſhip to the conceit and will of <hi>ſelf.</hi> Inſtead of the Reverent uſe of his name, they are ſetting up their own names, and will venture on the groſſeſt abuſe of Gods name, rather than <hi>ſelf</hi> ſhall ſuffer or be croſſed.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:34706:229"/>
And inſtead of hallowing the Lords day, they devote both that and every day to themſelves.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the ſecond Table is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf</hi>] and this is the meaning of the tenth Commandment, which forbiddeth us to <hi>covet</hi> any thing from him to our ſelves: that is, that we ſet not up <hi>ſelf</hi> and its intereſt againſt our neighbour and his good; and be not like a bruiſed or inflamed part of the body, that draweth the blood or humors to it ſelf, or like a Wen or other Tumor, that is ſucking from the body for its own nutrition: ſo that it is but plainly this [<hi>Be not ſelfiſh, or drawing, or deſiring any thing to thy ſelf, which is not thy due, but belongeth to another: but let Love run by even proportions, between thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and thy ſelf, in order to God and the publick good.</hi>] And this Commandment brings up the rear, that it may ſummarily comprehend and gather up all other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that be not inſtanced in, in the foregoing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Now <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> being the very ſin that is here forbidden, I need to ſay no more to tell you that <hi>ſelf</hi> is the breaker of this Law.</p>
               <p>Next to this ſummary concluding Precept, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the ſecond Table (if not one of the firſt) is the fifth Commandment; which requireth the preſervation of Relations and Societies, and the duties of thoſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially of inferiors to ſuperiors, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and the Common good. And this is ſet before the reſt, becauſe the publick good is preferred to the perſonal good of any; and Magiſtrates and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors being Gods Officers, and for the Publick good, are to be prefered before the ſubjects. But what an enemy <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is to this Commandment, I intend anon to ſhew you diſtinctly, and therefore now paſs it by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:34706:229"/>And for the following Commandments, who ever murdered another but out of ſome inordinate reſpect to himſelf, either to remove that other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>And what is it but the ſatisfaction of your Own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy luſts, that cauſeth Adultery and all uncleanneſs? And what is it but the furniſhing and providing for <hi>ſelf</hi> that provoketh any man to Rob another? And what is it but ſome <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> End that cauſeth any man to pervert Juſtice, or ſlander, or bear falſe witneſs againſt his neighbour? ſo that nothing is more plain than that <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs</hi> is all ſin and villany againſt God and man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in one word.</p>
               <p>And therefore you need not ask me, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment it is that doth forbid it: For it is forbidden in every one of the ten Commandments. The firſt condemneth <hi>ſelf</hi> as it is the Idol ſet up, and Loved, truſted, and ſerved before God: the ſecond condemneth it as the Enemy of his worſhip; and the third condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it as the Prophaner of his Name; and the fourth, as the Prophaner of his Hallowed time: The ſecond Table in the tenth Commandment condemneth <hi>ſelf</hi> as it is the Tumor and gulf that is contrary to the Love of our neighbour, and would draw all to it ſelf. The fifth Commandment condemneth it as the Enemy of Authority and Society: the ſixth as the Enemy to our Neighbours life; the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it as the enemy to our neighbours chaſtity, Eſtates, and Cauſe, or Name.</p>
               <p>So that if you ſee any miſchief done in Perſons, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Towns, Countrys, Courts, Armies, or any where in the world, you need not ſend out Hue and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:34706:230"/>
Cry to find out and apprehend the actor: It is <hi>ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> that is the Author of all. If the poor be oppreſſed by the rich, and their lives made almoſt like the life of a labouring Ox or Horſe, till the Cry of the oppreſſed reach to heaven, who is it that doth all this but <hi>ſelf?</hi> The Landlords and rich men muſt Rule and be ſerved by them. I warrant you they would not do thus by themſelves.</p>
               <p>If the poor be diſcontented and murmur at their condition, and ſteal from others, who is it that is the cauſe of this but <hi>ſelf?</hi> If <hi>another</hi> were in poverty, they would not murmur nor ſteal for <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> that blemiſheth Judges, and Juſtices and Officers with the ſtains of partiality, avarice, and injuſtice: It is this that diſturbeth the peace of Nations; that will not let Princes Rule for God, and conſequently overthrows their Thrones: that will not let ſubjects Obey them in the Lord, but lets in wars and miſeries upon them: that ſets the Nations together by the ears, and ſo continueth them: yea it is ſelf that will not let neighbours live together in Peace: that provoketh people to diſobey their Teachers, and Teachers to be man-pleaſers, and neglect the people; that will not let Maſters and Servants, Parents and Children, Husband and Wife, live peaceably and lovingly one with other; It is the common make-bate and troubler of the world.</p>
               <p>Nay it is <hi>ſelf</hi> that cauſeth moſt of the new Opinions and practiſes in Religion: that ſets up Popery, and moſt other Sects; and cauſeth the Paſtors to contend for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority to the troubling of the Church after all the plain prohibitions of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In a word, ſelfiſhneſs is the grand enemy of God and man; the Diſeaſe of Depraved lapſed nature: the very heart of Original ſin, and the old man; the root of all
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:34706:230"/>
the Iniquity in the world: the breach of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Law; the enemy of every Article of Faith, and every Petition in the Lords Prayer; and by that time we have added the reſt of its deformity, you will ſee whether it be not the very Image of the <hi>Devil,</hi> as the Love of God and our neighbour which is its contrary, is the image of God.</p>
               <p>But now on the contrary ſide Self-denial complyeth with all Divine Revelations, and diſpoſeth the ſoul to all holy Requeſts, and to the obſervation of every Command of God.</p>
               <p>It humbly ſtoopeth to the myſteries of Faith, which others proudly quarrel with in the dark. It makes a man ſay, <hi>O what am I that I ſhould ſet my wit againſt the Lord, and make my Reaſon the Touch-ſtone of his truth, and think to Comprehend his judgements that are incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible!</hi> It cauſeth a man to ſit as a little child, at the feet of Chriſt to learn his will, and ſay, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth.</hi> It ſilenceth the carpings of an unſatisfied underſtanding, and limiteth the enquiries of a buſie, prying, preſumptuous wit; and ſubdueth the contradictions of fleſh and blood: It caſteth off that Pride and ſelf-conceitedneſs that hindreth others from believing.</p>
               <p>In Prayer it bringeth an emptied ſoul, that is not ſtopped up againſt the grace and bleſſings of God; It layeth us low in a receiving poſture: It emptieth us of our ſelves, that we may be filled with God: It hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt any one of thoſe Requeſts which Chriſt hath put into our mouths, but ſubſcribeth to them all. It is the higheſt ambition, the greateſt deſire of a ſelf-denying ſoul, that Gods Name may be hallowed and honoured, whatever become of his own Name or honour; and that the Kingdom of God may flouriſh, in which he deſireth to be a ſubject; and that the will of God
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:34706:231"/>
may be done, and the will of himſelf and all the world conformed and ſubjected to it: And ſo of the reſt of the Petitions. Self-denial is <hi>half</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of Prayer.</p>
               <p>And it is a dutiful obſerver of all the Commandments. It giveth up our Love to God as his Own, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently worſhippeth him in Love, and Reverenceth his name, and obſerveth his time, and indeed is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to him. And it giveth our neighbour that part of our Love which belongeth to him; and therefore will not diſhonour ſuperiors, or encroach upon the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of others, or injure them for his own ends.</p>
               <p>And indeed what ſhould draw a ſelf-denying man to ſin, (were he but perfect in ſelf-denial?) when the poiſe is taken off, the wheels all ſtand ſtill: Self-denial doth fruſtrate Temptations, and leave them little to work upon. What ſhould move a ſelf-denying man to be Proud, or covetous, or injurious to others? no man doth evil, but it ſeemeth good, and for ſome good that he imagineth it will do him: And this ſeeming good is to carnal ſelf: And therefore a ſelf-denying man hath taken off the byaſs of ſin, and turned out the deceiver, and when Satan comes he hath little in him to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of. O how eaſily may you take ſin out of the hands of the <hi>ſelf-denying,</hi> and make them caſt it away with lamentation, when other men will hold it as faſt as their lives! O try this ſpeedy way of Mortification. Would you but deſtroy this Original breeding ſin, you would deſtroy all. All the ſins of your lives are the fruits of your <hi>ſelfiſhneſs;</hi> kill them at the heart and root, if you would go the neareſt way to work. What abundance of ſin doth ſelf-denial kill at once? Indeed it is the ſum of mortification. And therefore be ſure that you deny your ſelves.</p>

               <p>3. MOreover, <hi>Selfiſhneſs is contrary to the State of Holineſs and Happineſs: contrary to every grace, and contrary to the life of Glory.</hi> For it is the uſe of all grace to recover the ſoul from <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> to God: that God may be Loved, and <hi>Self-love</hi> may be overcome: that God may be truſted, and pleaſed, and his ſervice may be our care and buſineſs, when before our care was to Pleaſe our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And the very <hi>felicity</hi> of the ſoul conſiſteth in a cloſing and communion with God. The ſoul that will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, muſt be conſcious of <hi>ſelf-inſufficiency,</hi> and muſt go out of it ſelf, and ſeek after life in God; It muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it ſelf, and apply it ſelf to him.

Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſelf is but the neareſt and fulleſt intuition and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God: And he that hath moſt of him here in his ſoul, and in the creatures, providences, and ordinances, is the happieſt man on Earth, and likeſt to the glorified. And there is no approach to God but by departing from carnal ſelf. I know ſelf-ſeeking men do think of finding more peace and comfort in that way: but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way deceived of their hopes: It is ſelf-denial that is the way to peace and comfort. While we reſt on our <hi>ſelves,</hi> or are taken up with anxious caring for our ſelves, we are but toſt up and down as on a tempeſtuous ſea, and are ſeeking Reſt but never find it: but when
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:34706:232"/>
we retire from our ſelves to God, we are preſently at the harbour, and find that Peace which before we ſought in vain. I confeſs, in the too-little experience that I have my ſelf of the way of peace and quiet to the ſoul, I muſt needs ſay, there is none to this: There is none but this. Never can I ſtep out, but <hi>ſelf</hi> meets with ſomewhat that is vexatious and diſpleaſing to it: <hi>This</hi> buſineſs goes croſs, and that buſineſs is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: this perſon is troubleſome, and that perſon is abuſive and injurious: One is falſe and treacherous, or ſlanderous; and another is imprudent, and weak, and burdenſome: what between the baits of proſperity, and the troubles of affliction, the perverſeneſs of adverſaries, and the weakneſs of friends, and the changes that all States and perſons are liable to; the multitudes that would be pleaſed, and the labour and the coſt that it will ſtand us in to pleaſe them, and the multitudes that will be diſpleaſed when we have done our beſt; and the murmurings, reproaches, and falſe accuſations that we ſhall be ſure of from the diſpleaſed; and which is worſt of all, the burdenſome weakneſſes and corruptions of our own ſouls, and the ſins of our lives, and the daily vexation that our dark and ſhattered condition doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to our ſelves; I ſay, between all theſe diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perplexities, enough to rack and tear in pieces the heart of man, I have no way but to ſhut up the eyes of ſenſe, and forget all <hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> and withdraw from the creature, as if there were no <hi>ſelf</hi> or <hi>creature</hi> for it in the world, and to retire into God and ſatisfie my ſoul with his Goodneſs and All-ſufficiency, and faithfulneſs, and immutability. And in him is nothing to diſquiet or diſcontent, unleſs you will call his enmity to our own diſeaſes and unhappineſs a diſcontenting thing. And this is not my own experience alone, but all that know what Chriſtian Peace and Comfort is, do know that
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:34706:232"/>
they loſe it, and are torn in pieces while they are caring and contriving for themſelves; and that Retiring into God, and caſting all their care on him, and ſatisfying themſelves with him alone, though all the creatures ſhould turn againſt them, is the way to their content and quietneſs of mind. The Example of <hi>David</hi> is exceeding obſervable, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. When beſides the diſtreſſed eſtate that he was before in, the City where he left his family and the families of his followers, was taken and burnt down, and their wives and children carried away, &amp; all gone, ſo that <hi>David</hi> and the people that were with him, <hi>lift up their voice and wept, untill they had no more power to weep;</hi> and to make up his calamity, the Souldiers that were with him talkt of ſtoning him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the loſs of their wives and children; in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate condition, ſaith the Text [<hi>but</hi> David <hi>encouraged</hi> (or comforted) <hi>himſelf in the Lord his God</hi>] And it is good for us ſometime to have nothing in this world left us that will afford us comfort, that we may be driven to God for it: Till the houſe be as on fire over our heads, and we are as it were fired out of every room of it, we will hardly be gone, and betake our ſelves to God our only Reſt. Try it Chriſtians when you will, and you ſhall find it true, that <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> contents do but tice you to ſtraggle away from your true comfort; and when you have done all, it is in returning unto God that you muſt find the comfort which you loſt by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it abroad. It is only in the God of Peace, that your ſouls will find peace, and therefore away from <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>creatures,</hi> and retire into God.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXVI.</hi> Self-ſeeking is ſelf-loſing: ſelf-denying our ſafety.</head>
               <p>4. MOreover, conſider that <hi>ſelf-ſeeking is ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, and ſelf-denial is the only way to our ſafety.</hi> We were well when we were in the hands of God, and had no need to care for our ſelves. But we were loſt as ſoon as we left him and turned to our ſelves. If God care for you, <hi>infinite Wiſdom</hi> cares for you; whom no enemy is able to over-wit or circumvent; who can foreſee all your dangers, and is acquainted with all the ways of your enemies, and with all that is neceſſary to your preſervation. But if you be at your <hi>own</hi> care, you are at the care of fools, and ſhort-witted people, that are not acquainted with the depths of Satan, the ſubtilties of men, nor the way of your eſcape, but may eaſily be over-reached to your undoing. If you are in your own hands, you are in the hands of bad men, that though they have ſelf-love, yet are ſo blinded by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety that they will live like <hi>ſelf haters;</hi> And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience fully manifeſteth, in that all ſinners are ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroyers: No enemy could do ſo much againſt us as the beſt of us doth againſt himſelf: Did a man hate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as bad as the Devil hateth him, he could ſhew it by no worſe a way than ſin; nor do himſelf a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than by neglecting God, and the life to come, and undoing his own ſoul, as the ungodly do. Should you ſit down of purpoſe to ſtudy how to do all the hurt to your ſelves that you can, and to play the part of your deadlieſt enemies, I know not what you could do more than is ordinary with ungodly men to do, except to go a little further in the ſame way. Nothing but ſin could alienate you from God, or make you liable to his
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:34706:233"/>
heavy wrath: and this no man elſe could make you guilty of, if you did not voluntarily chooſe to be evil. If you could ask any man that is this day in Hell, or that will ever be there, what brought him thither, and who it was long of that he came to ſuch a miſerable end, he muſt needs tell you it was <hi>himſelf.</hi> If you come to any in earthly miſery, and ask them, who brought this upon them? If they ſpeak truly they muſt ſay, it was themſelves. And this will be a great aggravation of their miſery, and the fewel that will feed the unquenchable fire, to think that all this was their own doing, and that they had not been deprived of the heavenly Glory but for their own refuſal or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. It will fill the ſoul with an everlaſting indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it ſelf to conſider that it hath caſt it ſelf wilfully into ſuch miſery! that, when Satan could not, and men could not, and God would not, if he had not done it himſelf, he ſhould be ſo witleſs and graceleſs as to be the chooſer of ſin, the refuſer of holineſs, and his own undoer. So that the experience of all the world telleth you, how unſafe man is in his own hands: the experience of thoſe in Hell may tell us, whither it is that <hi>ſelf</hi> would lead us, if we follow its conduct. Whither did <hi>ſelf</hi> lead <hi>Adam</hi> when he hearkened to it, but to ſin and death? what work hath it made over all the earth? Do we not ſee a whole world of people, not one excepted, wounded, and ſlain, and brought into ſo low and ſad a ſtate, and all this by <hi>themſelves!</hi> and yet ſhall we go on in <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> ſtill? Of all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies you have in the world, pray God to ſave you from your ſelves; ſcape your ſelves and you ſcape all. You will never miſcarry by any other hands. The Devil and wicked men will do their worſt; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you they can do nothing. Never will you come to Hell if you run not your ſelves thither: Never will
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:34706:234"/>
you be ſhut out of Heaven if you run not from it by your own neglect, and prefer not the proſperity of the world before it. And therefore you ſee that we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more unſafe than in our own hands. Gods Will is good, and would make a good choice for us: but our wills are bad, and will make a bad choice for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. God is unchangeable, and the ſame for ever; but we are giddy and uncertain, and if we are in a good mind to day, are in danger of being in a bad to morrow. God is able to ſecure us againſt all the ſubtilty, and rage, and power of Earth or Hell: but we are ſilly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent worms, and unable to defend our ſelves, or to accompliſh our own deſires. So that our ſafety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in forſaking our ſelves and cleaving to the Lord. The more of your happineſs lieth on your own hands, the greater is your danger: and the more of it is on the hands of God, the greater is your ſafety. Fly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from your ſelves to God, as you would fly out of a torn or ſinking Veſſel into the ſtrongeſt ſhip; or as you would haſte away from a tottering Houſe that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall upon your heads: ſo haſte away from <hi>ſelf</hi> to God. Study his Love, and fall in Love with him; and that will be more gainful to you, than ſtudying and carnally Loving your ſelves. Forget <hi>your ſelves,</hi> and remember him; and he will remember you to your greater advantage than if you had remembred your ſelves. When any intereſt of your Own, riſeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Intereſt or will of God, care not then for your ſelves or for your own; ſet as light by it as if it were nothing worth; and ſay as the three witneſſes of God in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17. when they were ready to be caſt into a flaming furnace [<hi>We are not careful to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee in this matter: If it be ſo, the God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand O King:
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:34706:234"/>
But if not, be it known unto thee O King, that we will not ſerve thy gods or worſhip the golden Image which thou haſt ſet up</hi>] Care you for your Duty, and God will care for your ſafety better than you can do: you are ſafer under Gods care in the midſt of a flaming fire, than under your own care in the greateſt proſperity, or honour in the world. While <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> depended upon God, they were ſafe, though in the midſt of dangers: but when they fell upon carnal ſhifting for themſelves, to ſay their Wives were their Siſters, they brought themſelves but into a ſnare and double danger; when you have cared, and contrived, and ſhifted for your ſelves as long as you can, it's God that muſt do the deed, and defend and deliver you, and provide for you when all is done. Is it wiſe, or ſafe, or profitable for your child to be caſting for proviſion of meat, and drink, and clothes for it ſelf? Cannot you do it better? and is it not your work? and had you not rather your child would truſt you with it, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with his own buſineſs, and be careful to pleaſe you, and then to depend on your care and love? What good will it do a ſimple patient, to know the ingredients of every medicine compounded for him, and given by his Phyſician? or to deſire to be acquainted with his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick himſelf that ſo he may be tampering with his own body, and have the doing of the buſineſs himſelf, till by his unskilfulneſs he hath undone himſelf, when he had a wiſe and faithful Phyſician that he might have truſted to! O that men knew how ready a way it is to their undoing, when they muſt be ſatisfied of all the Reaſons of the ways of God! and when they muſt have their own wills and ways, and muſt ſee a ground of ſafety in the creature! and muſt take that courſe that <hi>ſelf</hi> tells them is the beſt! when they are reſolved to look to their eſtates, and honours, and lives, and dare not
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:34706:235"/>
caſt them on the wiſdom, and care and will of God! O that men knew how ſure and near a way it is to their felicity, to be contented to be Nothing that God may be all; and then they would be More in God than they could have been in themſelves: and to be contented to Die, that they may Live in God; and to loſe their lives that they may find them in him. Let go your Reputation with men, and you will find it made up a thouſand-fold in the approbation of God. Let men condemn you, ſo that God may but Juſtifie you! Let Riches go, and ſee whether you will not find more in God, than you could poſſibly loſe for him. Can any man be a loſer by God? or can he make an ill bargain that makes ſure of Heaven? Do you think there is any want of Riches or Honour there? O Sirs, win God and win all: win Heaven and never fear being loſers. It ſeems a great loſs to fleſh and blood to lay down your eſtates, and honour, and life, for Chriſt and the hopes of a life to come: But it is becauſe the fleſh is blind, and cannot ſee ſo far off as everlaſting is. The loſs is not ſo great as to exchange your braſs, your dirt, for gold and jewels: or to exchange your ſickneſs for health. It is the moſt profitable Uſury to make God your deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by putting all your ſtock into his hand, and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it all on his ſervice upon the confidence of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>But if you will go about to ſhift for your ſelves, you will loſe your ſelves: and if you will ſave your ſelves, you will undo your ſelves; and if you will keep your Riches or Honours, you do but caſt them away: For all is loſt that is ſaved from God: and that is beſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that is loſt for God.</p>

               <p>5. MOreover <hi>it is ſelf that is the moſt powerful reſiſter of all the Ordinances of God; and it is ſelf-denial that boweth the ſoul to that holy complyance with them, which wonderfully furthereth their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were it not for this one prevailing eneny, what work would the Goſpel make in the world! O with what confidence ſhould we come into the Pulpit, and ſpeak the word of God to our hearers, had we any to deal with but this <hi>Carnal ſelf!</hi> God can overcome it by his victorious grace; but it's ſo blind, ſo wilful, ſo near men, and ſo conſtant with them, that it will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us, and all that we can ſay or do, till God ſet in. When I come to convince a ſinner of his guilt, and ſhew him the hainous nature of his ſin, becauſe it is his <hi>Own,</hi> he will be convinced of it: when I tell them of their miſery, they will not be convinced of it, becauſe it is their own. Were I to ſpeak all this to <hi>another,</hi> and tell <hi>another</hi> of his ſin and miſery, I might have theſe mens conſent, ſo it reflected not upon themſelves. Were I to wring the unlawful gains out of the hands of <hi>another,</hi> I might have their conſent: or were I to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>another</hi> from his Pride, or luſt, or paſſion, they would give me free leave, becauſe it is not <hi>ſelf</hi> that is concerned in it, nor <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> that is neceſſary to it in them. But when we come to themſelves, there is no dealing with them, till God by Grace or Judgement deal with them. They cannot endure to know the worſt by themſelves: much leſs to come out of it. If we tell them of their ſin and danger, they ſay, we
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:34706:236"/>
ſpeak againſt them! And therefore they ſay, It is out of malice, or humour, or pride. And as well might all diſeaſed perſons ſay ſo of their Phyſicians, that when they tell them of their diſeaſe and danger, they ſpeak againſt them, and ſpeak out of malice or ill will. It is natural for men to think well of all that they love, and of all that they do: and whom do they love better than themſelves? Pride will not let men think ſo mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hardly of themſelves as the Scripture ſpeaks of them, and Miniſters muſt plainly tell them. The Prophet wept that foreſaw the cruelty of <hi>Hazael;</hi> but he had ſo good a conceit of himſelf that he would not believe he ſhould be ſo cruel, 2 Kings 8. 13. <hi>Is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this?</hi>] The falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zedekiah</hi> could not forbear, but ſtruck <hi>Micaiah,</hi> when he made it known that he was a lying Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 24. And <hi>Ahab</hi> hated him, <hi>becauſe he propheſied not good of him but evil.</hi> It was all the <hi>Proud men</hi> that roſe up againſt <hi>Jeremiah, and</hi> contradicted his prophecie, and rejected his word, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. 2. The word of God is quick and powerful, and a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; and it is the plain word of that God, that feareth not the faces of the Proudeſt ſinners on earth, and will not flatter, nor daub with any of them all, but will tell them to their faces what they are, and what will become of them if they do not turn, and what they muſt truſt to: This is the word that God hath put into our mouths, and commanded us to preach to them: not the flattering words of an inferior, nor the tender language of a man-pleaſer, but the commanding words of the God of heaven, and the peremptory threatnings of everlaſting fire, againſt all unconverted, unſanctified men, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from him that feareth none of them all, but will make them all ſtoop at laſt to him, and fear, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:34706:236"/>
before his Majeſty. And is it any wonder if Proud and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ſinners are diſpleaſed with ſuch a word as this? They ſtand all the while they are hearing a plain and powerful Preacher, as priſoners arraigned at the bar; and ſometime are ready to tremble as <hi>Felix</hi> did, when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> dilating of righteouſneſs, and temperance and the judgement to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. And can <hi>ſelf</hi> endure to be thus uſed and arraigned for its life? eſpecially when they think it is but by a man? For they have not the underſtanding to know that it is Chriſt that owneth all that his Meſſengers ſpeak by his Commiſſion. Hence it is that men hate thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that they feel thus to judge them in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and take them for <hi>their enemies for telling them the truth,</hi> Gal. 4. 16. and think they are but <hi>the troublers of the</hi> Countrey, as <hi>Ahab</hi> called <hi>Elijah</hi> the <hi>troubler of Iſrael,</hi> which he had <hi>troubled</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 17. and meet them as he did the ſame Prophet, 1 Kings 21. 20. <hi>Haſt thou found me O mine Enemy?</hi> They meet not a Miniſter as the Meſſenger of God that calls them to repentance, but as an enemy in the field, to ſtrive againſt him, and raiſe up all the reaſonings and paſſions of their ſouls againſt him, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth their unregenerate ſtate, tells them but what God hath charged him to tell them: when the poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conſider not, that before God hath done with them, as ſure as they breathe, he will make them either by grace or Judgement, condemn themſelves as much as any of his Miniſters condemned them, (from the word of God) at whom they were moſt offended. Ah little do theſe Proud worms that rage at us now for faithful dealing, and for telling them that which they will ſhortly find true, little do they think that they ſhall ſhortly ſay the very ſame againſt themſelves which they hated us for ſaying: Nay with an hundred times more
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:34706:237"/>
bitterneſs and ſelf-revenge will they ſpeak theſe things againſt themſelves, than ever we ſpoke them. Hence it is that faithful plain-dealing Miniſters are commonly hated and perſecuted by the ungodly, eſpecially by the great ones and honourable ſinners. For their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is againſt <hi>ſelf,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſelf</hi> will riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and ſo many <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> unmortified perſons as there be in the Congregation, ſo many enemies uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hath ſuch a Miniſter. And therefore the Lords of <hi>Iſrael</hi> petition the King that <hi>Jeremy</hi> may be put to death, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 4. And <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Prieſt calls <hi>Amos</hi> a conſpirator againſt the King, and tells the King that the Land was not able to bear his words, and commands him to preach no more at the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or his Court, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 10, 11, 12, 13. And what was the matter that deſerved all this, yea and the death of almoſt all the Prophets and Apoſtles of Chriſt? why, it was for ſpeaking againſt <hi>ſelf</hi> and its carnal intereſt: But was it not a truth that was ſpoken? True or falſe, if it be againſt <hi>ſelf,</hi> it cannot be born! As the Biſhop of <hi>Ments</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks of, meeting with a Bible, and reading an hour in it, [<hi>I know not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what book this is, but I am ſure it is againſt us</hi>] Meaning the Popiſh Clergy. So theſe men ſay by our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and by the word of God it ſelf, Be it never ſo true, we are ſure it is againſt us: Or rather [we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, becauſe it is againſt us] But if theſe men had their wits about them, they would ſee that this is <hi>for</hi> them, which they think is againſt them. It is for their healing and ſalvation, had they hearts to entertain it, though it be for the troubling of them at the preſent by humiliation. O how tender are carnal perſons of this <hi>ſelf!</hi> How quickly do they feel, if a Miniſter do but touch them! How impatiently do they ſmart, if he meddle with the galled place, and plainly open their
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:34706:237"/>
moſt diſgraceful ſins, and moſt dangerous courſes, as one that had rather be guilty of diſpleaſing them, than of ſilently permitting them to diſpleaſe God, and undo their ſouls! They fret and fume at the Sermon, and go home with paſſion in their hearts and reproaches in their mouths againſt the Miniſters: And are of the mind of the deſperate <hi>Sodomites,</hi> Gen. 19. 9. that ſaid to <hi>Lot</hi> when he exhorted them, [<hi>Stand back: This one fellow came in to ſojourn, and he will needs be a Judge: now will we deal worſe with thee than with them</hi>] what, ſay they, <hi>can he not preach and let me alone? hath he none to rebuke before the Congregation but me!</hi> And thus will every ungodly perſon reject the Word as they are ſelfiſh, and <hi>ſelf</hi> muſt be let alone in all. But why muſt you be let alone? will you be ever the ſafer or better for that! will God let you alone if we ſhould let you alone? No, he will not be frightened from dealing with you as you are: whatever his word hath ſaid againſt you, he will certainly make good, though you ſhould never more be told of it by Miniſters. You have not ſilenced your Judge, when you have ſilenced his Meſſengers. He will handle you in another manner than Miniſters do. O how eaſie is it to hear a Preacher threatning the everlaſting wrath, in compariſon of hearing the ſentence of the Judge and feeling the execution! If <hi>we</hi> ſhould yield to your deſires, and let you alone, God would neither let you nor us alone; you would but go the quietlier to hell; and your blood will be required alſo at our hands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 6, 7, 8, 9. and then what would become both of us and you?</p>
               <p>O were it not for the Powerful reſiſtance of this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> what work would every Sermon make that we preach to you? O what abundance would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at a Sermon! for what ſhould hinder it? I ſhould make no doubt of perſwading you all to cloſe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:34706:238"/>
with the Lord upon his reaſonable terms, and to become a holy and heavenly people, and preſently to forſake your former ſin, even this hour. Nay ſome ordinances there are that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> hath almoſt ſhut out of the Church: as moſt of the exerciſe of the antient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in open and perſonal admonitions, and publick confeſſions and lamentation of ſin, with rejection of the impenitent, and the Abſolution of the penitent: Beſides moſt of that private addreſs to Paſtors for their advice in caſe of falls, and ſpiritual decays, or weakneſſes, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that meet them in doctrine or duty. <hi>Self</hi> will not ſuffer men to ſtoop to moſt of theſe! What, will they be brought to open confeſſions and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin, and to follow the guidance and perſwaſions of a Prieſt? no, all the Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> ſhall not make ſuch fools of them: ſo wiſe are theſe <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men for a little while! But how long will this hold! and how long will madneſs go for wiſdom! when they are dying, then they will ſend for the Miniſter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs: and when ſome of them come to the Gallows, they will confeſs: And every one of them ſhall confeſs at laſt whether they will or no; and God will indite their confeſſion for them, and open their ſhame to all the world in another manner than Miniſters required them to open it: But then Confeſſion will do nothing for Remiſſion, and the preventing of execution, as now it might have done.</p>
               <p>So alſo the duty of brotherly reproof and admonition of offendors, is almoſt quite caſt out by <hi>ſelfiſhneſs:</hi> and eſpecially, the patient and thankful receiving of it: And thoſe ordinances that are continued, are very much fruſtrated by the oppoſition of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> It is a very hard task that Scripture and good books, and preachers have to do; when we ſpeak every word to enemies of the Doctrine which we preach, and we can do them no

good but by their own conſent: And who will conſent to that which he is an enemy to? Our work is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their Fleſh and Carnal wills to Chriſt: and this fleſh is ſo dear to them that it is themſelves: ſo that they take all that Doctrine to be againſt them which ſhould ſave them: And we have as many Enemies as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted hearers in our Aſſemblies: No wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they carp, and quarrel, and ſtrive, when the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying humbly ſubmit and obey.</p>
               <p>Self-denial openeth the heart to Chriſt, and giveth the Ordinances leave to work: It taketh down all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and contradiction; ſo that though the ſoul may ſtay to ſearch the Scripture, and ſee whether the things that are taught be ſo, yet it ſearcheth with a childlike charitableneſs, and willingneſs to learn, and know, and obey. It hath no mind to quarrel with God; how eaſily will a <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> man ſubmit to thoſe duties which another man abhors? How eaſily will he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to forgive a wrong, to part with his right for a greater good to others, to let go a gainful Trade that is unlawful, or any ſinful way of thriving: How eaſily is he brought to ask forgiveneſs of thoſe that he hath wronged, to make a publick confeſſion of his ſins, if the greatneſs of them, or his duty to God, or the good of others, do require it; to make reſtitution of all that he hath gotten wrongfully; to bear a plain and ſharp reproof; to part with his own for the relief of the poor; to lay out his eſtate to the beſt advantage of the Cauſe and Church of God, and the common good; to let go any unlawful vanity; any exceſs in meat, and drink, or ſport, or ſleep, or any vanity in apparel or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work of Pride: How eaſily can he bear all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, reproaches, and neglects, and undervaluing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude from others! But what ado ſhall we have with
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:34706:239"/>
carnal, unſanctified wretches to perſwade them to all or any of this? From them a Preacher hath ſuch a work to pull their beloved profitable ſins (they ſeem profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them till the reckoning comes) as a man hath to pull the prey from the jaws of a hungry Wolf, or meat from the mouth of a greedy Dog: But when we require the ſelf-denying to do the ſame thing, it is but as to bid a child obey his Father whom he loveth and honoureth. The doing of theſe duties, and forſaking theſe ſins, is to an ungodly man as the parting with a right hand, or a right eye, or the skin from his back, or the fleſh from his bones, as we ſee by the rarity, and the unſucceſsfulneſs of the plaineſt reaſons, and great Authority of God himſelf, and the few works of Piety, charity, or ſelf-denyal that are done by ſuch at any great coſt. But to the <hi>ſelf-denying,</hi> it is but as the caſting away a handful of earth, or caſting off an upper garment, for the doing of their work.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXVIII.</hi> Enemy of all Society, Relations and Common good.</head>
               <p>6. MOreover, <hi>this ſelfiſhneſs is the enemy to all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and Relations, and conſequently to the common good.</hi> And it is not only indirectly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially, but directly that it ſtrikes at the very foundation of all. For the manifeſting of this, conſider in what reſpects this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is at enmity with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>End</hi> of Societies is eſſential to them: and this End is the Common good of the Society: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Republick hath its name from hence, becauſe it
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:34706:239"/>
is conſtituted and to be adminiſtred for the Commonweal, or the good of all. Now <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is contrary to this common good which is the End of all Societies. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> perſon is his Own End; and cares not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>common</hi> good if he do but think it will promote his own: And how is that Family, Church, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth like to proſper, where moſt (alas, <hi>moſt</hi> indeed) have an End of their own, that is ſet up againſt the End and being of the Society? For though the real good of particular perſons is uſually comprehended in the common good, yet that is but in ſubſerviency to the publick good, and is not obſerved uſually by theſe perſons who principally look at themſelves. And it commonly falls out that the publick welfare cannot be obtained but by ſuch <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> of the Members, which theſe men will not ſubmit to; though they incur a greater hurt by their <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> Little do <hi>they</hi> think of the common good: it is their own matters that they regard and mind. So it go well with them, let Church and Commonwealth do what it will: They can bear <hi>any ones</hi> trouble or loſſes ſave their own. They are every man as a Church, as a Commonwealth, as a world to themſelves. If they be well, all is well with them: If they proſper, they think it's a good world, what ever others undergo. If they be poor, or ſick, or under any other ſuffering, it is all one to them as if calamity had covered the earth: and if they ſee that they muſt die, they take it as if it were the diſſolution of the world, (unleſs as they leave either name or poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity behind them in which a ſhadow of them may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive.). And therefore they uſe to ſay [when I am gone, all the world is gone with me.]</p>
               <p>2. Moreover <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is contrary to that <hi>Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> that every Member of a Society ſhould be poſſeſſed with. The publick good will not be attained
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:34706:240"/>
without a Publick ſpirit, to which a Private ſpirit is contrary. Men muſt be <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to the work that they muſt be imployed in. The work of every Member of a Society, is ſuch as <hi>Mordecai</hi> is approved for, <hi>Eſther</hi> 10. 3. [<hi>ſeeking the wealth of his people, and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed</hi>] Every true Member of the Church muſt have ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that in the midſt of his own proſperity and honours is caſt down in faſting, tears, and Prayers, when he heareth of the affliction, reproach, and ruines of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſaith [<hi>Why ſhould not my countenance be ſad, when the City the place of my fathers ſepulchres lieth waſte?</hi>] Neh. 1. 3. &amp; 2. 3, 4. And as the captivated Jews, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. that lay by all their mirth and muſick, and ſit down and weep at the remembrance of <hi>Zion.</hi> A <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſelfiſh</hi> diſpoſition is quite contrary to this; and is buſie about his own matters, and principally looketh to his own ends and intereſts, what ever come of the Church; and falls under the reproof that <hi>Baruch</hi> had from God, Jer. 45. 4, 5. [<hi>Behold that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole Land; and ſeekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf? ſeek them not.</hi>] This <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> diſpoſition makes men ſo fooliſh as to loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſeeking themſelves; looking to their own goods or cabbins when the ſhip is ſinking in which they are; and to their own rooms, when the Houſe is all on fire. But a Publick Spirit ſaith [<hi>If I forget thee O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>above my chief Joy</hi>] Pſal. 137. 5, 6. His love is to the Church as the Spouſe of Chriſt, and as to the body of which he is himſelf a member, and his Prayers and endeavours are for its proſperity and peace, Pſal. 122. 6, 7, 8, 9. [<hi>Pray
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:34706:240"/>
for the Peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they ſhall proſper that love thee: Peace be within thy walls and proſperity within thy Palaces: For my Brethren and companions ſake I will now ſay, Peace be within thee: becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeek thy good</hi>] The body of Chriſt, is all animated by one ſpirit, that it might aim at one end; and it is ſo tempered by God, that there ſhould be no Schiſm in it, but that the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould have the ſame care one for another, that if one member ſuffer all the members ſhould ſuffer with it, or if one member be honoured, all ſhould rejoyce with it</hi>] 1 Cor. 12. 13, 24, 25, 26, 27. There is no ſerving Publick ends with a Private ſelfiſh ſpirit.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover <hi>ſefiſhneſs</hi> is an Enemy to the Laws of Societies, whether it be the Laws of God or man. For it would have them all bended to their private intereſt, and fitted to their ſelfiſh diſpoſition. And therefore for the immutable Laws of God, which they cannot change, they corrupt them by miſinterpretations, expounding them according to the dictates of the fleſh, and putting ſuch a ſence on all as ſelf can bear with. And what they cannot miſinterpret, they murmur at and diſobey. And for the Laws of men, where ſelfiſh perſons are the makers of them, you ſhall perceive by the warping of them, who they were made for. Hence it is that Princes and Parliaments have lookt at the Laws, and Church, and Miniſters of Chriſt, with an eye of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie as if they had been ſome enemies that they ſtood in danger of, and all for fear leſt the perſonal, ſelfiſh, fleſhly intereſt of Noblemen, and Gentlemen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould be incroacht upon by the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt. And hence it is that ſo much endeavours and hopes of a Reformation have been ſo long fruſtrated, and even among wiſe and Pious Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers there hath been ſo much pains to keep Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:34706:241"/>
from doing their duty in Governing the Churches, and laying ſuch reſtrictions on them, that Paſtors might be no Paſtors, that is, no Guides and Overſeers of the Church in the worſhip of God. And when good Laws are made, they have as many enemies as ſelfiſh men. If the Law were not hated, the execution of it would not be hated ſo much.</p>
               <p>4. Alſo ſelfiſhneſs is an enemy to the very being of Magiſtracy, and to all publick Officers and their work. For the very End of the Magiſtracy is the Publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, as I ſaid before of the end of a Commonwealth: and therefore this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is contrary to this end: and ſuch men will not value a Magiſtrate as a publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, but only as one that is able to help them, or to hurt them; which is but to fear him as a potent enemy, and not to love or honour him as a Ruler. They look at Magiſtrates as at Tyrants that are too ſtrong for them; and as a Cur will crouch to a Maſtiff Dog, ſo they will crouch to them to ſave themſelves: and this is their love, and honour, and obedience; (even ſuch as <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath taught them in his <hi>Leviathan.</hi>) But they do not reverence that beam of Divinity which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them in their Authority; nor love their Governors as the Fathers of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for the common good and the honour of God which they are appointed to promote.</p>
               <p>5. And this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is the deadly enemy of all right Adminiſtrations of Juſtice, and the due exerciſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Church or Commonwealth. If a Miniſter be <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> he will be ſhifting off the troubleſome part of his duty, and will over-rule his underſtanding to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is no duty, becauſe diſ-believing is eaſier than obeying. He will be forward in thoſe duties that are neceſſary to his maintenance and applauſe, and are impoſed on him by the Laws of men, but out of the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:34706:241"/>
Pulpit it's little that he will do: As if it were the Pulpit only that were Gods Vineyard where he is ſet to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Fleſh and blood ſhall be conſulted, and men ſhall be pleaſed and all that the intereſt of <hi>ſelf</hi> may be maintained.</p>
               <p>And if the People be <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> they will rebel againſt their faithfulleſt Guides, and kick againſt their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and reproofs, and fly from Diſcipline, which ſeems to their diſtempered minds to be againſt them. Let but one moſt notorious, lamentable inſtance ſuffice. The greater part of our Pariſhioners in moſt places of the Land are lamentably ignorant and careleſs in the matters of their Salvation, and all that we can do is too little to bring them to underſtand the matters of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity: and yet almoſt all of them are ſo much wiſer in their own conceits than the ableſt of their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that if we do not humor them, and be not Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them in our Doctrine and Adminiſtrations, about Sacraments, Prayers, Burial, and the reſt, yea if we obey them not in geſtures and forms, they turn their backs upon Officers, and Ordinances, and the Church it ſelf, and pour out their reproach upon their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as if we were ignorant in compariſon of them (even of them that know not ſo much as children of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight year old ſhould know.) See here the wonderful, bewitched power of a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And in matters of the Commonwealth, what is it more than this! nay what is it beſides this, that maketh Princes become Tyrants, and Rulers keep under the Ordinances and intereſt of Chriſt, or fearfully neglect them, and look after the Church in the laſt place, when they have no buſineſs of their <hi>own</hi> to call them off, and to begin to build Gods Houſe when they have firſt built their own, not imitating <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s labourers that had
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:34706:242"/>
the ſword in one hand, and the Trewel in the other, and builded in their arms! what elſe makes them give God but their leavings who giveth them all! And what elſe could make them ſuch enemies to Truth, as to ſide with thoſe parties what ever they be that ſide moſt with them, and promote their intereſt?</p>
               <p>And alas what work doth ſelfiſhneſs make with infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Magiſtrates? It is this only that opens the hand to a Reward, and the ear to the ſolicitations of their friends; and its this that perverteth the judgement, and this that oppreſſeth the poor and innocent, and this that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yeth the tongues and hands of Juſtices, ſo that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them do little more than poſſeſs the room, and ſtand like an armed ſtatue or a ſign-poſt, which hurteth none; Alehouſes do what their liſt for them, and drunkards and ſwearers are bold at their noſes, and they are no terror to evil doers, nor revengers to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath upon them, nor Miniſters that uſe their power for much good, but bear the Sword almoſt in vain, contrary to the very nature of their Office, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>And it is <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> in the people that cauſeth the trouble of faithful Magiſtrates: Every man would do what his liſt. The worſt offendor abhors him that would puniſh him: And thoſe that will commend Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and cry down vice in the general, yet when they fall under Juſtice themſelves, they take all that they ſuffer to be injury, and will do all that they can againſt Juſtice and the Officers of it, when it is to defend themſelves or theirs from the execution of it: ſo rare a thing is it to meet with a man that is a friend to Laws and Juſtice, when themſelves muſt ſuffer by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:34706:242"/>6. <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> alſo makes men withdraw from all thoſe neceſſary burdens and duties that are for the preſervation of Church or Commonwealth. Such wretches had rather the Goſpel were thruſt out of doors than it ſhould coſt them much: and had rather have the unworthieſt man that would be their Teacher for a little, than allow the beſt that mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that the Goſpel doth command, or give them what the Law hath made their Own. They would venture the ruine of Church and State, and let all fall into the hands of the common enemies, rather than ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their perſons, or lay out their eſtates for the common preſervation. So that if the hand of violence did not ſometimes ſqueeze thoſe Spunges, and force theſe leeches to diſgorge themſelves, they would but impoveriſh the Common-wealth by their Riches, and weaken the body like wens or impoſtumes by drawing to themſelves.</p>
               <p>7. And then the ſelfiſh are ſuch cauſes of Diviſion, that if they did no other harm, they would break both Church and State into pieces, if their humor were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, and not reſtrained or purged out. And in this regard <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is the direct enemy of Societies, and is always at work to diſſolve them into Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant individuals. A Society is a Political Body which muſt have but one Head, and one Intereſt, and one End: But when <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> prevaileth, there are as many Heads, and Ends, and Intereſts as Perſons: If they be in a Church, every one is the Teacher and Ruler: and every one muſt have his opinion countenanced, and his humor ſatisfied; Every one muſt have his way and will: And how is this poſſible, when their minds are ſo various and contrary to one another; and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts ſo inconſiſtent, and there are as many Rulers as perſons: when every man is drawing to himſelf, and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:34706:243"/>
there is no center in which they can unite, what work is there like to be in the Church? What progreſs could be made in the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> when no man was ruled by another, but every man ran confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly after his ſingle imagination? what an Army will it be, and how are they like to ſpeed in fight, where every Souldier is inſtead of a Captain and General to himſelf, and one runs this way, and another that way, and one will have one courſe taken, and another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, and every one fighteth on his own head: ſuch work doth ſelfiſhneſs make in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is this that hath broken it into ſo many parcels, and would crumble it all to duſt if it ſhould prevail.</p>
               <p>And it is this alſo that cauſeth the Diviſions of the Commonwealth; Faction riſing up againſt Faction, and Prince and people living in jealouſies of each other as having contradictory intereſts; which would not be if the Pleaſing of God, and the common good were the principal End and Intereſt of them all, and ſelfiſhneſs did not prevail.</p>
               <p>And this is it that keepeth Chriſtian Princes in moſt ungodly wars, to the ſhedding of Chriſtian blood, and the weakening of the common intereſt, and the ſtrengthening of the common enemy, whom they ſhould all joyn together to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>This alſo keepeth up ſo many parties on Religious pretences to ſeek the undermining and ruine of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they ſhould all joyn together againſt the common prophaneneſs of the world; and all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct endeavours would be too little. Thus ſelfiſhneſs is the grand Enemy that by Diviſions and Subdiviſions is ſtill at work for the Diſſolution and Ruine of Church and State, and the Confuſion of the World, and the diſturbance and deſtruction of order and government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:34706:243"/>8. Yea <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> makes men falſe and treacherous, ſo that they are not to be truſted, and are unmeet mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for any Society. For what ever they promiſe, pretend, or ſeem, they are all for themſelves, and will be no further true and faithful to the Society, or any Member of it, than ſuiteth with their own Ends: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truſt a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> perſon, if it be your own Brother, further than you can accommodate and pleaſe him, and ſo oblige him to you upon his Own account. It is the Complication of Intereſts, that makes Husband and Wife ſo much agree and love each other: becauſe that which one hath the other hath: But if their Intereſts fall out to be any whit divided, it is two to one but <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> will divide their affections. One would think that the bond of nature ſhould be ſo ſtrong to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain a Son to love his Father, that nothing could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it: And yet ſad experience telleth us that even here, it is an unity of Intereſt that doth more with many children than either nature or grace: and that when they have no more dependance upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for their commodity, their affections and reſpects are gone; and if they ſhall gain much by their death, they can bear it without much ſorrow, if not deſire it. So potent is <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> that it makes not men unfaithful only to their friends, and treacherous to their Governors, and falſe to all they have to do with, but alſo unnatural to their neareſt Relations.</p>
               <p>And therefore (next to true Piety which leads up all to an Unity in God, and therefore is the moſt perfect Polity) the chief point of humane Polity, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Commonwealths and all Societies, is, a Complication of Intereſt: when the Conſtitution makes the Governor and the Governed as Husband and Wife, that have nothing dividely as their own, but all in common, and take each other for better or worſe, and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:34706:244"/>
know they muſt ſtand or fall together, and that the good or hurt of one is the good or hurt of both, and that there is no manner of hope that either of them ſhould thrive by the ruine of the other. If Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had the skill and will to make ſuch an union of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts between the Soveraign and the Subject, and to make it viſible that all might underſtand it, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks would be Immortal, till either the wrath of a Neglected God, or the Power of a foreign enemy ſhould diſſolve them: For nothing elſe but <hi>ſelf could</hi> do it; and <hi>ſelf</hi> wil not do it when it ſees its own intereſt lie in the preſervation of the preſent State.</p>

               <p>7. ANother aggravation of the evil of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is, that <hi>it corrupteth and debaſeth every thing that it diſpoſeth of.</hi> And on the contrary it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> (as joyned with the Love of God) that <hi>it rectifieth and ennobleth all your actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the work be never ſo Holy in its own nature, yet if you do it but for <hi>your ſelves,</hi> you make a prophane employment of it; and to you it is not Holy. A <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh</hi> carnal perſon is ſerving himſelf even in Preaching, and hearing, and praying, and Sacraments, and other acts of worſhip and Church-communion: Much more in the common buſineſs of his life. Even when he thinks he is ſerving God, he is but ſerving himſelf of God, and provoking God by this abuſe: when he thinks he is very holy becauſe of his ſervices, he is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unholy, in that he even prophaneth holy things.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:34706:244"/>
And as it is not God indeed that he ſerveth, ſo from God he muſt not expect a Reward. And as far as a mans <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> is below the bleſſed God, ſo far, in a ſort, is the work of <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men debaſed, in compariſon of thoſe works of the Saints that are performed purely for God. They make but a low unprofitable drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that which in the hands of others is the higheſt and nobleſt work on earth. For the action can be no better than the End; and therefore is baſe as it is baſe.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, ſelf-denial makes noble the actions that in themſelves ſeem baſe. If you are gone out of your ſelves, and can truly ſay, that it is God you ſerve and ſeek in your employments, you may be ſure that God will take them for his ſervice, and ſet them on your account among the works that he hath promiſed to Reward (ſuppoſing that the Matter be ſuch as he alloweth of, and that you think not by good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to turn ſin to holineſs, and make him a ſervice of that which he forbiddeth.) O what an honour, what an encouragement, what a comfort is this, to every Chriſtian! The actions of a Prince or Conqueror are baſe, if <hi>ſelf</hi> be their End, and the reſpect to God do not ennoble them. And the work of the pooreſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is honourable that is done for God. It is a great temptation to ſome poor Christians to grudge at their condition, becauſe they are ſo unſerviceable to God. Alas thinks a poor Tradeſman, or Plowman, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, What do I but drudge in the world? I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts not place to do God ſervice with! But ſuch d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> very much miſtake the matter. It is not the parts and place but the hearty performance of your works for God that makes them ſuch as he will take for ſervice. O thinks a poor woman or toiling ſervant; I can do nothing either for the Converſion of Souls, or the

good of Church or Commonwealth, but am made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable: But do you not know that any thing is acceptable ſervice which God commandeth, and is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily intended to his honour and his Pleaſure: It is not the mettle but the ſtamp of the Prince that makes a piece to be currant money. If the Kings ſtamp were put by his appointment on a piece of Braſs or Copper, it would paſs for Coin. Believe it ſirs, if your ſtudy be to Pleaſe the Lord in your Callings, and you can but get above <hi>your ſelves,</hi> and do the baſeſt ſervile works, as commanded you by God, that you may be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him, and offer your <hi>ſelves</hi> and all your labors purely to him, and to his honour, and his will, God will take theſe for honourable ſervices; and you are as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his work even in your ſhops and fields as Princes are in Ruling, or Paſtors in teaching or guiding the flock: you that are poor, and cannot ſet ſo much time apart for reading and other holy duties as ſome other do, ſee that you neglect no holy opportunity that you can take, and then conſider, that if God ſet you to do him ſervice even by waſhing diſhes, or ſweeping channels, or the meaneſt drudgery, he will accept it; and the more, by how much the more humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is found in it. Take him as the only Lord and Maſter of your ſouls and lives, and all that you have, and when you are called to your dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour, look but to your hearts that God be your End, and that you can truly ſay, [I do not this principally to provide for my ſelf, but as an obedient child in my Fathers ſervice, becauſe he bids me do it, and it is pleaſing to him through Chriſt; I do it not principally from <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> but from the Love of God that commandeth me my work; and as a traveller that laboureth in his way for the love of his home, ſo I am here at labour in this world in the

place that God hath ſet me, that I may in his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way attain the everlaſting glory that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed] I ſay, do but ſee to it, that thus you dedicate your labours to God, and you may take comfort in the daily labours of your lives, even the meaneſt and moſt contemptible, as well as Princes and Preachers may in their more honourable works. Nay all your labours are honoured and ſanctified by this: For all is Holy that is heartily devoted to God, upon his invitation. And thus all things are pure to the pure. For it is Gods intereſt in your work that is the holineſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of them. Were ſervants and labouring people more <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denying,</hi> they might have more true comfort in their daily labour, than the beſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified can have from their prayers or other worſhip of God. Not that worſhip may be therefore neglected, but that a Chriſtian muſt do nothing at all but for God; and then he may be ſure of Gods Acceptance.</p>

               <p>8. MOreover, <hi>the ſelfiſh will never ſuffer as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but deny Chriſt in a day of trial; when the ſelf-denying will go through all, and be ſaved.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth ſo througly try whether ſelf or God be beſt beloved, as ſuffering for his cauſe. In this it is that Chriſt uſeth to try mens ſelf-denial: and it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal use of perſecution. When you hear of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before Rulers and Judges, and being hated of all men for Chriſts name ſake, then ſelf riſeth up to plead for its intereſt, and never maketh more ado than when it ſeeth the flames. The fleſh cannot Reaſon, but it can ſtrive againſt Reaſon, and draw it to its ſide. No Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeemeth ſufficient to it, to perſwade it to chooſe a ſuffering ſtate. If you perſwade a Carnal man to let go his eſtate, to be poor and deſpiſed in the world, and to give up life it ſelf if it be called for, and all this for the hope of an inviſible felicity, you loſe your labour (till God ſet in,) and all ſuch reaſoning ſeems to him moſt unreaſonable. And what a dreadful caſe ſuch ſouls are in, my Text and many another paſſage in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may convince you. If you cannot drink of his cup, and be baptized with his baptiſm, you cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with him to glory. Through many tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God. The pleaſing of the fleſh is the high way to miſery by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing God: and the voluntary ſubmiſſion to the ſuffering of the fleſh for the cauſe of Chriſt, is the high way to felicity, 2 Tim. 2. 11, 12. [<hi>It is a faithful ſaying: for if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him; if
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:34706:246"/>
we deny him, he alſo will deny us</hi>] Rom. 8. 17. [<hi>Yea, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution</hi>] 2 Tim. 3. 12. The day of trial is a kind of Judgement day to the ſelfiſh unſanctified man: For it diſcovereth his hypocriſie, and ſheweth him to be but droſs, and ſeparateth him from the ſuffering ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſelf-denial maketh ſuffering light, and will make you wiſh that you had any thing worth the reſigning unto Chriſt, and any thing by the denial whereof you might ſerve him. For him you would ſuffer the loſs of all things, and account them droſs and dung that you may win him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. He will count us <hi>worthy of the Kingdom for which we ſuffer,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 5. As the <hi>Captain of our ſalvation was made perfect by ſuffering,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. ſo alſo muſt his members, by <hi>filling up the meaſure,</hi> and being <hi>made partakers of his ſufferings,</hi> and <hi>knowing the fellowſhip of them,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 5, 6, 7. Phil. 3. 10. And the <hi>God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Chriſt Jeſus, after we have ſuffered a while, will make us perfect, ſtable, ſtrengthen and ſettle us,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>If therefore you would not prove Apoſtates, and deny Chriſt in a day of trial, and be denied by him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father aud the holy Angels, ſee that you now learn this needful Leſſon of <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi>

They will deny God their Maker and Redeemer, their Lord and Judge, their Preſerver and their hope: though he have the only Title to them, and their lives and ſouls be in his hand: They will for the ſake of a filthy luſt, or of a ſhort and miſerable life, deny him that never did them wrong, nay that hath always ſhewed them kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even all the kindneſs that ever they received; and that when they know that their everlaſting ſtate muſt ſtand or fall according to his judgement. They will deny the Lord Jeſus the Redeemer of their ſouls: They will deny and reſiſt the holy ſpirit of God: They will deny his Laws, his Goſpel-promiſes, and all his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: They will deny his Miniſters and all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and daily labours: They will deny their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Chriſtian friends, and deny their own Conſciences and Convictions; and deny themſelves the Peace and Joy which they might find in a holy walking with God: Yea they will deny themſelves everlaſting life, and the favour of God, and caſt themſelves into endleſs miſery; and all this for a thing that is ten thouſand times worſe than nothing, or for a very ſenſual brutiſh Pleaſure. And yet theſe men cannot deny themſelves in

life, or liberty, in gain, or honour, no nor in the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt luſts, for the ſake of Chriſt and their own ſalvation: Even when they may know that they moſt deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they will not deny themſelves. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves eternal glory, becauſe they will not deny themſelves in temporal vanity. Heaven and earth will witneſs againſt ſuch ſottiſh and unrighteous dealing as this, if true Converſion do not prevent it. Hath God, hath Chriſt, hath your own ſalvation deſerved no better at your hands than this? O miſerable ſouls! All things can be eaſily denied ſave ſin and Carnal ſelf, and theſe cannot be denied. God can be denied, Chriſt and Scripture and Heaven it ſelf can be denied, for fleſh and ſin; and fleſh and ſin cannot be denied for God and for eternal Glory. Do you think that this will look like wiſe or righteous dealing when you ſtand in judgement? Ask now any ſtander by that is impartial, whether God or the fleſh ſhould be denied? Whether Heaven or Earth ſhould be denied, ſeeing one of them you muſt deny? And if any impartial man will be now againſt you, what think you will God be, who is not only impartial, but wronged by you, and a hater of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous dealing?</p>

To be given over to care for your ſelves, is to forfeit the fatherly care of God, and to be at the care of a ſilly inſufficient improvident ſinner. To be given over to your own Conceits or Wiſdom, is to be forſaken of the Sun, and left in darkneſs, and ſpend the reſt of your days in a Dungeon, the beginning of the endleſs utter darkneſs. To be given over to your own wills, is to be at the choice and diſpoſal of a fool and of an enemy; and to be in ſuch hands as will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly undo you, and to be caſt out of the hands of God: To be given over to <hi>ſeek</hi> your ſelves, is to loſe your ſelves and God, and your ſalvation. To be given over to live as your <hi>own,</hi> is to forfeit the Protection of God, without which you cannot be kept an hour out of hell.

Woe to that man that ever he was born, that is finally given over to himſelf: For this is a ſign that God hath forſaken them, and they ſtand at the brink of eternal death. O think of this you that are <hi>ſelf-conceited,</hi> and <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willed,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-lovers,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeekers,</hi> and know not how to deny your ſelves: Muſt <hi>ſelf</hi> be ſo regarded and tenderly uſed?

               <p>IV. I Come now to the laſt part of my task, which is to tell you, what courſe you ſhould take to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> For though it be the gift of God, yet there are certain means appointed us for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and God uſeth to give it men in the uſe of his means, and by thoſe means muſt it be confirmed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
               <p>Direction 1. <hi>Set faith a work upon the promiſes of God and upon everlaſting life:</hi> For the <hi>Fleſh</hi> will not be taken off theſe lower things till you have found out better, and ſuch as will be ſure to ſave you harmleſs. The moſt covetous man would let go ſilver if he may have gold inſtead of it Set faith a pleading the caſe with the fleſh: and urge your own hearts with the Certainty, the Nearneſs, the Glory, the Eternity of the Kingdom which by <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> you may attain; and if they will not yield to ſuch a change as this, they are unreaſonable unbelieving hearts.</p>
               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Never be deluded to forget the vanity, the brevity, and the emptineſs and inſufficiency, of all theſe earthly things,</hi> which ſelf ſo adhereth to as to neglect the promiſed life of bleſſedneſs. Acquaint your own hearts what a nothing it is that they make ſo much of, and follow ſo greedily and hold ſo faſt: ſhew them in the Sanctuary the glaſs of the word of God, which will tell them what will be the end of all, and where all their worldly proſperity will leave them? Ask your hearts, [Can I keep theſe things for ever; or not? If not? Is it not better let them go for ſomething, than for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:34706:249"/>
and to part with them as a child at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my heavenly father, than to part with them as a thief doth with his prize, at the Gallows? Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter let them go to eaſe me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſecure my eternal peace, than let them go to wound me and torment me! And while I keep them, what will they do for me, that I ſhould buy them at ſo dear a rate! O how dear muſt I pay for my eaſe, and honour and gluttony and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and ſenſual delights, if I part not with them when God commandeth? How cheap is a holy bleſſed life in compariſon of this which I muſt pay ſo dear for!]</p>
               <p>Direct. 3. To promote your ſelf-denial, <hi>Conſider freque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You think it meet that every workman ſhould have the uſe of his own work. Doth any man make a Houſe for its own ſake, or for his uſe to dwell in? Is it for the <hi>things</hi> ſake that any man makes an Inſtrument, or for his ſervice by it? Do you think that God made you for your ſelves: and not for himſelf and ſervice? give therefore to God the things that are Gods: All ſouls are his, and therefore all ſhould acknowledge him, and ſubmit to his diſpoſe and pleaſure. Shall the pot quarrel with the Potter, or claim title to it ſelf and ſay, I am mine own? It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cleareſt reaſon in the world, that any but the Creator, Redeemer and Perſerver of the world ſhould be Lord, and the Governour and the end of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that men ſhould prefer themſelves before him.</p>
               <p>Direct. 4. Moreover it will further your <hi>ſelf-denial</hi>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:34706:250"/>
to <hi>remember what you will get by ſelfiſhneſs:</hi> God <hi>will</hi> have his Ends and Honour out of you one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether you will or no; He will have your goods from you, and your lives from you; and the faſter you hold them, the more you will ſuffer when he wringeth them out of your hands. The moſt covetous man would part with his money to buy a Lordſhip, if he knew it would elſe be taken from him: A worldly treaſure is obnoxious to ruſt, and mothes, and Thieves: and if you exchange it not for the heavenly treaſure in time, and remove not your riches to the world that you muſt for ever live in, what will you do when you muſt remove your ſelves? And all your ſelf-denial is but ſuch an exchange or removal which all ſhould be glad of that know they muſt be gone themſelves; Nay more, conſider ſtill that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> makes you an Idol to your ſelf, and therefore you do but ſet up your ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

lamentably deceived and enſlaved by it: Princes and great men blinded by it; Judges and Learned men befooled by it; and the Nations of the world almoſt all ſet together by the ears by it: So that it hath turned the world into the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> that no man can underſtand a word of the Language that tendeth to Unity, Peace and building up: Princes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it not: too many Preachers underſtand it not; but the Language of ſcorn and ſtrife and diſſention they underſtand: ſo that the world is caſt all into a hurly burly, and every mans hand is againſt his Brother when he ſcarce knows why. No Church or State can ſtand without diſturbance: No truths without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Under pretence of coming in to Chriſt, they are buſily uncovering his Houſe, when the door is wide open, and there are more to invite them than to hinder them. Me thinks as a man that obſerveth the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of mad men or drunken men, ſhould never have any mind to be mad or drunken; ſo he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth but what <hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> hath done in the world, ſhould have little mind to be <hi>ſelf-conceited, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willed,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> but ſhould love and honour <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial.</hi>

               <p>Direct. 6. If you would promote <hi>ſelf-denial, keep with you the continual feeling of your own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſufficiency:</hi> No man will truſt upon a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſtaff if he know it; nor be ſo fooliſh as to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to walk upon the water, which he knows will not bear him. One would think this ſhould be an eaſie and an effectual remedy. Should it not be eaſie for ſuch wretched ſinners as we to carry about with us a ſenſe of our unworthineſs? For ſuch Lepers to carry about us a ſenſe of our uncleanneſs? Me thinks ſo many and great Diſeaſes ſhould make us feel them. O then
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:34706:251"/>
conſider, as creatures you are utterly inſufficient for your ſelves; and as ſinners much more. God never made you to live upon or to your ſelves; or without him, or without the help of others. There are few beaſts when they are firſt brought forth into the world, but are more able to help themſelves than man; When he is newly born, he can do nothing to help himſelf. And when he comes to Age he is naturally formed to a ſociable life; ſo that if he ſhould retire from the world, and live onely by and of himſelf, he would ſoon find what it is to be ſelfiſh: Much more if he be left to himſelf by God, or forſake God, and truſt to and depend upon himſelf. But if ever innocent man had been ſufficient for himſelf: yet <hi>ſinful</hi> man can have no pretence to ſuch a priviledge, while he beareth about him ſo many convincing evidences of the contrary, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day. Do you not feel ſin as a heavy burden preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you down, and perceive how eaſily it entangleth and beſetteth you? ſure you do, if you be not paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in And do you not know enough of the nature and deſert of ſin, to drive you out of your ſelves, and bring you to him that calleth the weary and heavy laden to come to him for eaſe and reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. Do you not feel a continual burden of infirmities? and doth not experience tell you that you are not ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your ſelves in any pain or ſickneſs that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal you? you cannot ſupport your ſelves a moment: you are ſtill in the hands of that inviſible God whom you abuſe by your <hi>ſelf-ſeeking.</hi> You would drop into Hell if he withdrew the hand of his patience and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as ſure as a ſtone would fall to the earth that were looſe in the Air!

If you would live in ſelf-denial, <hi>be ſure that you keep the maſtery of your ſenſes:</hi> and do not let them be ungoverned, but ſhut them up when reaſon doth require it. It is your Appetite and ſenſes that feed this carnal ſelfiſh vice: but reaſon and faith are both againſt it. Whenever you conſult with <hi>ſenſe,</hi> you may know what brutiſh advice you may expect. Ask not therefore what is delightful, nor what is for your carnal eaſe and peace; but what is neceſſary to pleaſe the Lord, and for your everlaſting peace. And if the tempter tell you, [This is the eaſier and the broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der way] tell him that it is not the honeſter nor the ſafer way: And the queſtion is not which is the faireſt way? but, which is the way to Heaven?

If you cannot keep under your ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and ſubdue the eager deſires of the fleſh, and learn to want as well as to abound, to be empty as well as to be full, you will never attain to ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p>Direct. 8. To promote your ſelf-denial, me thinks it ſhould be effectual <hi>to underſtand the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that you have by the Communion and Society which you enter into when you deny your ſelves.</hi> Though a Prince or Lord would be loth to enter into a Colledge, or Monaſtery where there's no Propriety, and yet withal, no care or want; yet a poor labouring man or a beggar would be glad of ſuch a life. So you that cannot live of your ſelves, me thinks ſhould be glad of ſuch a <hi>Community.</hi>

               <p>1. Conſider that the Lord Jeſus is the Head of the Society, who hath undertaken to make proviſion for the whole, and is engaged for their ſecurity, and to ſave them harmleſs: and all the Riches of his grace and love belong to that Society, and will be yours; which is more than all that you can part with of your own, yea more than all the treaſures of the world. It is therefore the nobleſt and richeſt Society in the world that you ſhall live in communion with, if you will deny your ſelves.</p>
               <p>2. And the Saints that are the Members of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety are the Brethren of Chriſt and the Heirs of Heaven. And all theſe are your Brethren; endeared in ſpecial love to you, engaged to aſſiſt you, by prayers, and counſel, and pains and purſe, and every way that you can: ſo that well might Chriſt ſay that he that forſaketh any thing for him, ſhall receive even an hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come eternal life. For this one ſorry <hi>ſelf</hi> that you forſake, and it's poor accommodations, you have God for your

               <p>I Have now finiſhed what I had to ſay to you on this great and needful ſubject: And I have ſtayed the longer on it, that I might occaſion your own thoughts to be the longer on it: For it is not a few haſty running thoughts that will make any great impreſſion on the ſoul. And now, Chriſtian friends, whoever you are that hear or read theſe words, I earneſtly intreat you in the name of God that you will ſet your hearts to the deep conſideration of the nature and odiouſneſs of this ſin of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs;</hi> and of the nature and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> You will never effectually hate and reſiſt the ſin which you think lightly of, and is not in any great diſcredit with you; nor will you fly from it with fear and care and vigilancy, till you apprehend the dangerouſneſs of it. I have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told you, but proved it to you; that this is one of the moſt odious and dangerous ſins in the world, even the ſum of all iniquity, that containeth a thouſand ſins in the bowels of it: This is it that generateth all other vices, and fills the world with ſwarms of miſchief.

I dare boldly ſay, if this one ſin were but rooted out of the hears of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters themſelves that are the Preachers of ſelf-denial, it would make ſo ſudden and wonderful a change in the Church, as would be the glory of our Profeſſion, the Joy of the godly, and the admiration of all!

Were not our hope only in the Omnipotent God, it muſt be ſo. When we look at men, at Magiſtrates or Miniſters, we ſee no hope: What higher profeſſions can be made by thoſe in ſucceeding Ages, than have now been made? And yet what negligence of Magiſtrates, and what contentiouſneſs of Miniſters, deſtroy all hopes? So that we look at the Reſtauration of the Church, as at the Reſurrection, that muſt be done by Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: God muſt raiſe up another Generation of more ſelf-denying, prudent, zealous Magiſtrates, and of more ſelf-ſtudying, peaceable, Humble, Zealous, Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtous Miniſters, before the Healing work be done.

While the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are deſtroying us by ſecret fraud and open force, we ſtand at a diſtance and unite not againſt them, yea we are calling each other Heretick and Deceivers, and teaching them how to revile us, and putting ſuch words into their mouth againſt us, as may help our people to deſpiſe us, and reject us, and warrant them from our own mouths or pens to rail at us and forſake us: One part of us being Hereticks or Deceivers by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other part, and the other part by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of too many of them.</p>
               <p>Dear Brethren, if <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> ſhall not now be left, when we are in the ſight of the havock it hath made, and ſtand in the field among thoſe that it hath ſlain, and ſee the Church of God ſo horribly abuſed by it: when then ſhall it be forſaken!

And that you will ſuſpect it, and watch againſt it in every work you have to do. Are you upon any imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpiritual or ſecular? Preſently enquire when you ſet upon it, [Is there no <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> diſpoſition lurking here?

O look to it that you be not enſnared before you are aware. Take heed of it, eſpecially you that are great and honourable, and have ſo much <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> to tempt you in the world! How hardly will you eſcape! When all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemies are conquered, you have yet <hi>ſelf</hi> the greateſt enemy to overcome. Take heed of it; you that have any riſing thriving project, little know you on what a precipice you ſtand: Take heed of it you that are in deep and pinching wants, leſt <hi>ſelf</hi> make them ſeem more grievous than they are, and provoke you to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon ſin for your relief. Take heed all you that have raging appetites or paſſions, or luſtful inclinations, and remember your enemy is now diſcovered, and you have him to deal with before your face: and therefore ſee that you be reſolute and vigilant. Take heed all you that have Learning, Parts, or fame and honour, or any thing that <hi>ſelf</hi> hath to glory in and to abuſe, leſt the nobleſt gifts ſhould by this deadly principle be turned into a plague to the Church, and to your ſouls. Suſpect <hi>ſelf</hi> in the choice of your parties and opinions: Suſpect it in your publick labours; yea and in your

private duties, and greateſt diligence in Religious Works; leſt when your eyes are open'd at laſt it ſhould appear, that you preached, or prayed, or profeſſed, or wrote, or lived for <hi>ſelf,</hi> and not for God. I do but tranſcribe the counſel to you, that God is daily giving in to my own ſoul: &amp; as I feel exceeding great uſe of it to my ſelf, ſo I am ſure there is to others: and wo to me and you if we take it not, and be not found among the <hi>ſelf-denying.</hi> Doubtleſs God will put you to the tryal, and find you frequent uſe for this grace. Let me take the boldneſs to tell you from my own (though alas too ſmall) experience, that as it is meer <hi>ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that is the perplexer and diſquieter of the mind, without which nothing that befalls us could diſcompoſe it, ſo it is God only that quiets it, and gives it reſt: And I bleſs the Lord I can truly ſay, that I have found that content in loving and cloſing with the will of God, and endeavouring to know no intereſt but his, to diſquiet or quiet me, which I never could find in any other way. When God is enough for us, and his will is in our eyes, the will of a Father infinitely good, it may ſatisfie the ſoul in the darkeſt condition; when we underſtand not the particular meaning of his providence, nor what he is doing with us, yet ſtill we may be ſure that he is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us good: And therefore a child may not only ſubmit to the will of God, becauſe it cannot be reſiſted, as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies muſt be forced to do; but he may Reſt in that will as the Center of his deſires, and the very felicity and <hi>Heaven</hi> of his ſoul.</p>
               <p>And now Sirs, I muſt let go this ſubject, as to you that have heard it preacht, for we muſt not be always on one thing: but I am exceedingly afraid leſt I have loſt my labour with moſt of you, and shall leave you as <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> as I found you; becauſe ſad experience tells me,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:34706:257"/>
that it is ſo natural and obſtinate an enemy that I have diſcovered, and that you have now to ſet your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. I have done my work; but <hi>ſelf</hi> hath not done, but is ſtill at work in you. I cannot now go home with every one of you, but <hi>ſelf</hi> will go home with you. I cannot be at hand with every one of you, when the next temptation comes, but <hi>ſelf</hi> will be at hand to draw you to entertain it. When you are next tempted to error, to pride, to luſt, to contention with your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by words or real injuries, what will you do then, and how will you ſtand againſt this enemy? If God be not your Intereſt, and the deareſt to your ſouls, and you ſee not with his light, and <hi>will</hi> not by his <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial</hi> be not become as it were your nature; you will never ſtand after all this that I have ſaid, but <hi>ſelf</hi> will be your undoing for ever! If you have not ſomewhat within you, as <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is within you, to be always at hand as it is, and ready, and conſtant, and powerful to overcome it, it will be your ruine after all the warnings that have been given you. And this preſerving Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple muſt be the <hi>Spirit of God, by cauſing you to Deny your ſelves; Believe in Chriſt, and Love God above all.</hi> I ſay again that you may think on it, and live upon it: The ſum of all your Religion or ſaving grace is in theſe three, <hi>Faith, Self-denial,</hi> and <hi>the Love of God. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Carnal-ſelf, Returning home to God by Love, and this by faith in the Redeemer,</hi> is the true Chriſtianity, and the Life that leadeth to everlaſting life.</p>
