         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Wedded</hi> to Noiſe, to Miſery, and Want;</l>
            <l>Sold an Eternal Vaſſal for thy Life,</l>
            <l>Oblieg'd to Cheriſh, and to Heat a Wife:</l>
            <l>Drudge on till <hi>Fifty;</hi> at thy Own Expence</l>
            <l>Breath out thy Life in one Impertinence;</l>
            <l>Repeat thy loath'd Embraces every Night,</l>
            <l>Prompted to Act, by Duty (not Delight:)</l>
            <l>Chriſten thy froward <hi>Bantling</hi> every Year,</l>
            <l>And carefully thy Spurious Iſſue Rear:</l>
            <l>Go once a Week to ſee the Brat at Nurſe,</l>
            <l>And let the Young Impoſter drein thy Purſe:</l>
            <l>Hedge-Sparrow-like, what <hi>Cuckoo's</hi> have begot</l>
            <l>Do thou maintain, Incorrigible Sott.</l>
            <l>O! I could curſe the Pimp that could do leſs,</l>
            <l>He's beneath Pitty, and beyond Redreſs:</l>
            <l>Pox on him! let him go; what can I ſay.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Anethemas</hi> on him are Thrown away;</l>
            <l>The wretch is marry'd, &amp; has known the worſt,</l>
            <l>And now his Bleſſing is, he can't be Curſt.</l>
            <l>Marry'd! O Hell and Furies! name it not,</l>
            <l>Hence, hence you Holy Cheats; a Plot, a Plot.</l>
            <l>Marriage is but a Licens'd way to Sin,</l>
            <l>A Nooze to catch Religious Wood-cocks in:</l>
            <l>Or the Nick-name of ſome Malicious Friend,</l>
            <l>Begot in Hell to Proſecute Man-kind.</l>
            <l>'Tis the Deſtroyer of our Peace and Health,</l>
            <l>Miſpender of our precious Time and Wealth;</l>
            <l>The Enemy to Wit, Valour, Mirth, all</l>

            <l>Abroad the Sport and Wonder of the Crowd,</l>
            <l>At Home the hourly breach of what we vow'd</l>
            <l>In it's Opium to our Luſtful Rage,</l>
            <l>Which ſleeps a while, and wakes again in Age.</l>
            <l>It heaps on all Men much (but uſeleſs) Care,</l>
            <l>Forthwith more Trouble, they leſs Happy are;</l>
            <l>It checks Youth, ſhortens life, &amp; taints the mind,</l>
            <l>Our Sences pales, and ſtrikes our Reaſon blind.</l>
            <l>Ye Gods! that Man by his own Slaviſh Law,</l>

               <l>She bids freely Look, Like, and Enjoy.</l>

            <l>To Flame the Blood unto a Generous Fire;</l>
            <l>We muſt not think the Gallant will Indure</l>

            <l>No, he muſt have a ſprightly youthful Wench,</l>
            <l>In equal floods of Love, his flame to quench;</l>
            <l>One that will hold him in her Claſping Arm,</l>
            <l>And in that Circle all his Spirits Charm:</l>
            <l>That with New Motion, and unpractis'd Art,</l>
            <l>Can raiſe his Soul, &amp; then vein-ſnare his Heart.</l>
            <l>Hence ſprings the Noble, Fortunate, and Great,</l>
            <l>Always Begot in Paſſion, and in Heat:</l>
            <l>But the Dull Off-ſpring of the Marriage-Bed,</l>

            <l>The Mothers Fear's Intail'd upon the Child.</l>
            <l>Thus whether Illegitimate, or Not,</l>
