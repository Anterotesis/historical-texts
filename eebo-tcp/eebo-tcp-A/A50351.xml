         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PIety and Policy, Church and State, Prince and
Priest are so nearly and naturally conjoyned in a
mutual Interest, that like to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his

the Crown and Scepter are under any <hi>coactive (directive</hi>

that Kings by any Church-man or men whatsoever, Pope or

more and solely verified of the Christian Religion: a strange
Wonder then it is, that so many <hi>Achitophels</hi> and <hi>Achans</hi>
in the World should promise to themselves, undertake to
Christian Kings, by sacrificing the Church, undoing the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the Service and Worship of God, destroying
Christ his Ordinances, robbing him of his Patrimony and
Right, to establish King and Kingdom, Peace and Quiet
in the Land. How is it probable or possible, Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Base and Bottom</hi> upon which all Happiness of
King and Kingdom are grounded and founded, the Cement
and Bond that tieth all together; the Rule of Right ruling,
the Mother of entire and hearty Obedience, the life of Laws,
the use of Quiet, and Strength of all Defence, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disordered, King, Kingdom, and State can be well,
and enjoy any kind of Happiness?</p>
            <p>If neither the Dictate of Nature, nor sacred Truth reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in holy Word should confirm this Truth; the sad and
doleful Experience we find, we feel this day in the <hi>Achel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama</hi>
of these Kingdoms, has laid it open to our Eyes in
Letters of Blood, that he that runneth by may read it.
Consider how since the <hi>Sacred Hierarchy,</hi> the Order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by Christ for the Government of his Church, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the Apostles, and continued against any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
Opposition for fifteen Ages and upwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Interruption, hath been opposed, that in some places
it is totally overthrown, in other places disgraced,
weakened, and threatned with Abolition of Root and
Branch, what is the Condition of Sovereignty and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?
You shall find that the Course against it hath been
a preparatory Destructive to Royalty, to the Liberty
and Propriety of the Subject. Many are deceived, and
think it skilleth not what Government be in the Church;
it is enough if the Essentials and Fundamentals of Faith
and Worship be preserved. They are infinitely deceived,
<pb facs="tcp:33502:7"/>
no Society can subsist without Government, and if you destroy
the Government, neither can the sound Faith, nor the true
Worship be long maintained. The Apostle intimateth this,
<hi>Col.</hi> 11. 5. that <hi>he joyed to behold their Order, and the
stedfastness of their Faith in Christ.</hi> First, <hi>their Order;</hi>
then <hi>the stedfastness of their Faith in Christ,</hi> implying,
where right Order is non maintained, stedfastness of Faith in
Christ cannot continue: A Holy Father to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

               </gap>,
Order is the Mother and Security of the Being of
all things that have Being. Do we not see that the
Order and Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
doth this day preserve their Humane Inventions
and unwarrantable Superstions, in such Safety, that, alas,
Truth doth not prevail much upon them are within her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?
and on the other part, our Disorder, and not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Government, maketh us lose too too much, and gain too
too little.</p>
            <p>Look a little upon the Parallel, and consider how since E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy
hath been infested, and way too much given to a
prevalent Faction, what malign Influence this course hath
had upon Sovereignty, and it will make it appear, that the
Mitre cannot suffer, and the Diadem be secured. It was
maintained, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was none of Christ's Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it was onely the positive constitution of man. Hath not
<hi>Royalty</hi> been thus entertained? Do not our Sectaries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
maintain, that Kings are the onely Extract of the
People, having their Being and Constitution by derivation
from them? Do they not hold, that howsoever <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
is a <hi>tolerable government</hi> of the Church, yet it is mutable,
at the pleasure of the Church? And do they not answerably
aver, that the collective or representative Body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
may, upon any real or fancied Exigent, mould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into an Aristocracie or Democracie? Others more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
have reached higher, and give out, that the Sacred
<pb facs="tcp:33502:7"/>
Hierarchy is Antichristian, against Christ and his Scepter,
(not being able because of their Ignorance to difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Christian Hierarchy,</hi> and <hi>Romish Hieromonarchy.)</hi>
Have not the Authors and Abettors of these Paradoxes in
Divinity, invented and vented as blasphemous Principles
against the Lord's Anointed in Policy? Do they not magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially
determine that Kings are not of God's creation, by
<hi>authoritative commission,</hi> but onely by <hi>permission,</hi> extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by importunity, and way given, that they may be a scourge
to a sinful People? Nor is this all; these late distempers
have produced Creatures not of Christ's making, <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
who are adopted to be Ecclesiastical Persons, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Power with men in holy Orders, to decide and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in matters of Faith, Worship, and in the exercise of
the Power of the Keyes; nothing kept from them but liberty
to Preach publickly, to baptize, and to consecrate the blessed
Eucharist. Answerable to this, find we not, that they have
erected a <hi>coordinate, a coequal, a corrival Power</hi> with
Sovereignty, and have made <hi>Regnum in regno,</hi> two Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,
a thing incompatible with Supremacy and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy?
the persecution of Episcopacy has been so hot and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
that I dare say, look upon all Persecutions recorded in
Ecclesiastical Story, none can parallel this, if ye consider it as
it is cloathed with all its circumstances, and attended with
its consequents; Episcopacy, after the most exact and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
Tryal, is onely the Crime, except you will add the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the Publick Worship intended and attempted, to
vindicate God's Service from prophaneness and contempt,
and to restore it to its ancient true beauty, to the shame of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church. Men innocent, men well deserving of the
Church and Kingdom, have been cast out, their Estates seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
their Houses rifled and plundered, their Blood thirsted
after, their poor Wives forced to fly, some into mountains and
wilderness, some by Sea, some one way, some another; their
poor Children forced to starve, or beg at best; O barbarous
<pb facs="tcp:33502:8"/>
and inhumane Cruelty, more beseeming Cannibals than
Christians! When the Lord's Prophets were hurt and
wronged, was the Lord's Anointed not touched? <hi>Tell it
not in</hi> Gath, <hi>publish it not in the streets of</hi> Askalon,
<hi>lest the Daughters of the Philistims rejoyce, lest the
Daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</hi> The best of
Kings, in whom malice it self, how quick-sighted soever,
cannot find any thing blame-worthy, (except it be a Crime
to be too good and transcendently clement) hath been forced
to flie from his Palaces, could not find Safety in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
enlightened and enriched by his royal Presence, to the
Admiration and Envy of the whole World. His royal
Consort necessitated, for personal Security, and in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
way to provide for strengthening her Lord, the best
of Husbands, to flie beyond Seas. That Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those Olive-branches, the Pledges and Hopes of our
continuing Peace, divided one from another, and to this
day remaining so. His Revenues, his Casualties seized
by those have sent out Armies and Arms against him. His
Forts, his strong Holds taken from him, his Royal Navy
employed to destroy him, keep all Encouragement of Allies
from him, and to divorce personally (if they could) those
royal Personages in whom we are most happy, if we had
Eyes to see it whom in Heart and Affection the Devil and
his Malice cannot divide, notwithstanding it hath been
shrewdly endeavoured. More of this kind might be added,
but of purpose I forbear it.</p>
            <p>If we will consider what private men have gained,
since God and Religion have been wronged, we will
find we have made an unhappy Choice, a miserable
Change. No man hath Protection or Direction by Law, no
known Law hath place, we are all oppressed and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
over-ruled by an arbitrary Power, placed in a wrong
hand; all Religions (if I may call Sects so) are tolerated,
except the true Catholick Reformed Religion; and all
<pb facs="tcp:33502:8"/>
Heresies buried long ago in Hell, are revived, in number
like to be more, and in their nature more ugly than all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and St. <hi>Austin;</hi> our Sectaries agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only in the destructive part, to make away Truth and
the true Government, to spoil Churches, rob Christ of
his Patrimony, abrogate the Solemnity of the Worship, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
ancient Christian Monuments: but in the positive not
one agreeing with another; <hi>Ephraim</hi> smiting <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
and <hi>Manasseh, Ephraim,</hi> and both of them against <hi>Judah.</hi>
Hath any now the Liberty of his Person? are not the best
of Subjects, the best of God's Servants kept in Prisons,
like to <hi>Jeremie's</hi> Dungeon? What Property is reserved?
Since Christ's Patrimony hath been despoiled, who can say,
<hi>This I have?</hi> They command what portion, what <hi>quota</hi>
they will, and in the end he will be a Malignant at Pleasure,
that hath any thing to maintain this Rebellion. If S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
were living now, he might well say, <hi>Quod non capit
Christus, hoc rapit fiscus.</hi> What stately Houses have
been spoiled? What rich and princely Furniture hath been
destroyed? What Blood of Nobles and generous Gentry
hath been shed? More in this uncivil Rebellion, in this
short time, than in many years in long continuing Wars in
many Countries beyond Seas: this Loss cannot be valued,
it infinitely surpasses all other Losses besides. And yet give
me leave to say it, if we will look upon the Pressures and
Sufferings of the Subject, the only Effects we feel of this
glorious so much talked of Reformation, they will transcend
highly all Grievances complained of in the successive Reigns
of seven Sovereigns. And the greatest of all Iudgments have
fallen, upon us, that some sort with the Prophet <hi>Hosea, We
have no King, because we feared not the Lord, what then
should a King do to us? They have spoken words, swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
falsely in making a Covenant: thus Judgment
springeth up as Hemlock in the Furrows of the Field.</hi>
Hos. 10. 3. 4. A Redress of these Disorders, a Remedy

            <p>My Lord, I have put Pen to Paper to right our gracious
Sovereign, to undeceive his Subjects, making it appear, that
his Right is independent from man, solely dependent from
God: that Monarchy is the most countenanced, the most
authorised Spece of Government by Almighty God; that
the conveyance of this Right is not by Trust from the People;
and have cleared, what are <hi>Jura Majestatis,</hi> the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
inherent in the Crown, incommunicable to the Subject;
and how Sacred his Person and Charge is, that they cannot
be opposed, are not to be resisted. A task it is above my
strength. In the Imperial Law it is a crime mixt with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege,
to argue the Right and Power of the King; nor was
it allowed to every vulgar and ordinary Pencil to draw the
Picture of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great: and we see what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Seditious and Factious have made of the escapes of
some Pens: Notwithstanding I am necessitated to meddle with
it, with no less constraining and unavoidable necessity, than
that made the young dumb Prince speak. All men are tied
to the maintenance of Sovereign Right, none amongst men
more than Church-men; it is a necessary truth, as aptly, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
and purposely set forth in Gods Word as any else,
Prince and Priest were once joyned in one Person, and are so
tied that <hi>Alterius</hi>
               <q>Altera poscit opem res, &amp; conspirat amicè.</q>
We find onely three Office-bearers anointed by God, King,
Priest, and Prophet; who then more tied to maintain the
Lord's Anointed and his Right than Priests and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?
God hath honoured Kings to be the Nurse-fathers
of his Church; nor when we reflect upon by-gone Story,

               </gap> that ever the Church had either Beauty, Plenty, or
Progress, but under Monarchy; and view this day the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb facs="tcp:33502:9"/>
of the Christian Church under any other Government
than Monarchy, and we will find her condition but sorry
and poor. It is the onely Government which is most connte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
and magnified in Holy Writ. And I dare to say,
that none or all of them who ever writ purposely of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
or in an Historical way laid down Political Maxims,
whether it be <hi>Plato</hi> in his fancied Republick, or <hi>Aristotle</hi>
in his Politicks, or <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Livie,</hi> or <hi>Dionysius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseus,</hi>
or <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> or who besides, either by
Art or Story, is most renowned this way, have given us so
fully, so apertly, the Right of Monarchy, the true prescript
of Government, and perfect Rule of Obedience to the Subject.
The Ancient Fathers and Martyrs, whilst Emperours were
Heathenish and Persecutors, have delivered this Doctrine,
pleaded the Sacred Royal Prerogative of Emperours, and
with other Truths have sealed this with their Blood. Who
can deny then, but it beseemeth a Divine most of all men
to maintain or write of this subject? A wonder then it is
that some Smatterers in Divinity writing in this subject, do
borrow Principles from old Poetical Fables and Toyes, make
premises, and infer Conclusions, not onely destructive of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
but also contradictory to that Truth Scripture hath
revealed. Like to them are our Pettifoggers in the Law,
(I reverence Learned Iureconsults, who deserved well in
this subject) who cry out, what have Church-men to do
to dispute the King's Right? that belongeth to us, who are
versed in the Laws of the Kingdom, and know what Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Law alloweth the King, what not; these Ignaroes,
who are better versed in the Statutes and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than in the Acts of Christ and his Apostles, may even
as well go about not to authorize the Book of God, except
it be warranted by their Law, as to aver that the King
hath nothing immediately from God, nor no Sacred Right
but what He hath by Law. More learned Lawyers than
they can be, as <hi>Bodin, Barclay,</hi> and others, have treated of
<pb facs="tcp:33502:10"/>
this matter, and made as good Vse of Scripture and Holy
Fathers writing, as any other Warrant besides.</p>
            <p>It is more than evident then, that no men are more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
no men may be more fitted to maintain the Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Kings than Divines. But <hi>Officiis quis idoneus
istis?</hi> I confess my weakness, my insufficiency, and am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to have recourse to a Patron worthy of it, and able to
maintain it. I could hit upon no subject more worthy of so

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>CHristian Reader, this is an Extemporary
Piece, which was extorted by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of Friends; who prevailed so far
with me, that I chose rather to expose
my Weakness and it to the Censure of the World,
than uncourteously refuse them. To strengthen Truth,
I was able to bring more Zeal and good Affection than
any other Abilities. Believe, I write nothing but that
I am assured of in Conscience, <hi>in certitudine mentis,</hi> and
which I believe to be really certain, <hi>in certitudine entis.</hi>
God knows, I am far from temporizing, and he is of
weak apprehension, that in this Distemper can expect
any great Reward by appearing in Publick to maintain
this Sacred Truth; Experience teacheth us, that it is
more advantageous to run the contrary course, if a
good Conscience could allow it. If the method in
handling and proposing these five ensuing Questions be
not so orderly, I beg pardon; and that justly, because I
follow the Order proposed by the Observator. If the
Diction be not so terse and pregnant, I am not able to
help it; for by nature I am not enabled to delicate and
witty Expressions, nor have I endeavoured by Industry
to help those natural Defects. My care was ever to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Truth and Reality, more than flowers of Eloquence,
holding that for one (as I am) of small reach, the better
way is rather to be <hi>inter reales,</hi> than <hi>inter nominales.</hi> If
there be any tart Expression, construe it charitably, as
fallen by inadvertence from my Pen, whereas there was
no Gall in my Heart. If any will be at pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it critically, and to answer it rationally and fully,
<pb facs="tcp:33502:12"/>
I humbly intreat him to do it in a Christian and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
way, without Passion, for which I shall heartily
thank him: And if I be not able with as much reason
to answer him, I shall not be ashamed to retract my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and joyn Heart, Hand, and Pen, for him and all
Christian Sacred Truth; of which kind I hold those
which I would maintain, to be. If any thing in it give
thee content, thank God for it, and pray for Grace
and Strength to the weak Author, who hath resolved
to be a Lover, a Professor, and a maintainer of Truth
according to his Power, at whatsoever peril, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the true Reformed Catholick Religion, and
what may conduce to the Honour of our Church, to
the overthrow of that is truly Popery, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
of all erring Sectaries to the Communion of
this Church. And let all of us put up our hearty and
humble Prayers to Almighty God to touch our Hearts,
that we may endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit
in the Bond of Peace; to do good in his good pleasure
unto <hi>Sion,</hi> to build up the Walls of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
his Anointed, our Sovereign in His Throne
and Right, to set aright what is disjoynted in Church
and State, that all of us may be happy here, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Crown of Glory, which the righteous Judge
hath laid up for them that love him, his Truth, and
Christian Peace.

Treatise.</head>
            <p>IT is not my Purpose at this time, to examine
and refute the Opinions and Errours of those,
who either totally or partially, have spoken
against Government, as the <hi>Fratricelli</hi> in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of some, who alledging their Independency
from man, and assuming to themselves an immediate
Being or Derivation from Christ, no less than the
Apostles, and every way as perfect, would submit and
subject themselves to none. Our Independent Ministry
looks this way. Or as the <hi>Begardi,</hi> who did hold that
the Government of Superiours was only for the more
imperfect, but have no Authority over and above the
perfect. <hi>Nec Rex, nec Lex justo posita:</hi> No Superiour,
No Law for the Saints, the holy ones, the perfect
ones. It feareth me this Age fancieth to it self some
such thing; and have learned it of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33502:15"/>
               <hi>Abiram, who have gathered themselves together, against
Moses and against Aaron, and say unto them, ye take too
much upon you, seeing all the Congregation are holy, every
one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherefore then
lift you up your selves above the Congregation of the Lord.</hi>
Both these Sects were about the end of the thirteenth
Age and beginning of the fourteenth Age.</p>
            <p>Nor purpose we to meddle with that mad Heresie,
of the Anabaptists, who condemn all Government
whatsoever as sinful and unlawful. It is an impious
blasphemous Error, destructive not only of humane
Society but mankind it self. You may read in it their
<hi>Antitheses Christi veri &amp; falsi,</hi> published in <hi>Transilvania,
Anno</hi> 1568. The seventh of which is, <hi>That the false
Christ hath in his Church, Kings, Princes, Magistrates,
and the Sword: but the true Christ hath none, nor allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any of those.</hi> We presuppose all with whom we
are to enter in Lists, do willingly grant, <hi>That Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not only Lawful and Iust, but necessary both for
Church and Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither intend we to refute that erroneous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
tenet of some who held that, <hi>Dominium funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
in gratia,</hi> that the right of Dominion is founded in
Grace or any other supernatural Gift. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
it is neither founded, 1. <hi>In gratia praedestinationis,</hi>
in the Grace of Predestination: 2. nor, <hi>In gratia gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
faciente,</hi> in that Grace which is in the stating of a
man in the actual Condition of Grace and Salvation:
3. nor, <hi>In dono aliquo, supernaturali gratiae infuso,</hi> in
any supernatural infused Grace; as soundness of Faith
and profession of the Truth, or I cannot tell what
Character of Christianism they fansie to themselves.

and others after following him, did hold that the
Just did acquire a new Title and Right to what they
possess either <hi>in Dominion of Propriety or Iurisdiction.</hi> If
any de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them to the <hi>Casuists,</hi> where they treat <hi>de Subjecto
Dominii;</hi> pity it is that too many do confidently hold
these or the like Tenets, and in a worse sense than
<hi>Gerson,</hi> for his Tenet with a little benign Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may pass for tolerable if not warrantable.</p>
            <p>Nor is it fit or pertinent for us now, to refute the
Errour of the <hi>Canonists</hi> and others, who hold, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectum
Dominium,</hi> the direct and primarie power su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
whether Civil or Ecclesiastical is in the Pope as
Christs Vicar upon earth, immediately from Christ
derived unto him, and from Him to all Kings whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
mediately by Dependence and Subordination.
The Jesuits are ashamed of this: and therefore will
have the Pope only to have <hi>Indirectum Imporium, an
Indirect Directive and Coercive power,</hi> over all Kings and
States, <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> as civil Power and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses
are related to Religion and Salvation. It is a
curious subtle quirk and nicity of Scholastick Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a jugling Trick to bring all Kings, (Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
at Least) Kingdoms and States, into Subordination
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33502:16"/>
and Subjection, to the transcendent and extravagant
power of the Pope; nor doth this Expression differ from
the other, <hi>in re,</hi> in the matter or extent of the Power,
but, <hi>in modo rei,</hi> in the manner of the thing, as they
claim it. And cometh fully home, that the Pope by
this indirect Right of his related to Religion, by
which, any civil Act or Business whatsoever, with his
School Formalities, he may qualifie with such an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
and Relation to Spirituals, that directly by
this indirect power, he may King and Unking at
his Pleasure. Our Presbyterians if they run not fully
in this way, they are very near to it. I wish we were
so happy this time, as that we had not to do with
other Impugners of Sacred and Royal Authority, but
Jesuits and Canonists.</p>
            <p>That which we have proposed to our selves, in this
short ensuing Treatise, is to consider the main grounds
by which the Jesuit and Puritan endeavour by no
less spurious than specious Pretexts, of Liberty of the
People and Subject, of the reforming of Religion,
purging it from Error, preserving it in Purity, to rob
Kings of their Sacred and divine Right &amp; Prerogative:
making them Derivatives from the People, in whom
they will have all Supream Power originally and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
primarily seated: So that if Kings fail in Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their Duty, the People may supply it, at least
in some cases, may do it of themselves: Nay that
Kings are accountable to them as to their Superiours,
censurable, punishable, and dethronable too. By
which the Copy-hold of a Crown is no better than
<hi>Durante beneplacito plebis</hi> or <hi>communitatis,</hi> during the
good Will of the Community, for by these mens
Principles the People are made Judges; and may find
exigents, which will warrant them to resume, and to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33502:16"/>
exercise this power. Puritan and Jesuit in this, not
only consent and concur, but like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> are
reconciled to crucifie the Lords anointed. A thousand
pities it is, that our Sectaries, pretending such a Zeal
against Popery, and who no less maliciously than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
rub upon sound Protestants, the Aspersions of
Popery and Malignancy, do joyn with the worst of
Papists, in the worst at least most pernicious Doctrines
of Papists. But ten thousand times more pity it is,
that the true reformed and sound Protestant Religion
should suffer by such miscreants, that sound Protestants
should be charged with these Heresies in after Ages.
We will be forced to disclaim them, and say with St.
<hi>Iohn: They were amongst us, but were not of us,</hi> and
<hi>they have gone out from us.</hi> It is not warrantable to be so
large in our charitable Defence of any, as to prejudice
the inviolable and sacred Truth of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Our work is to examine and discuss some new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
State-principles, set on foot in this distempered
Age, which have robbed Church and State of Peace
and Happiness, which these Kingdoms of late and
long Continuance, have plentifully enjoyed under the
Government of our blessed King and his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
to the Envy of other neighbour Kingdoms and
States.</p>
            <p>These may all of them be reduced to five great ones.
1. First, that Royal Authority is originally and radically
in the People, from them by Consent derived to Kings
immediately, mediately only from God. That the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or Donation of the Power is from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
The Approbation only from God. 2. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that God is no more Author of Regal than of
Aristocratical and Democratical Power; of Supreme
than of Subordinate: and that Dominion which is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33502:17"/>
usurped and not just, while it remains Dominion, and
till it be legally again divested, refers to God as to
its Author and Donor, as much as that which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.
3. The third, that Sovereignty and Power
in a King is by Conveyance from the People, by a
Trust devolved upon him, and that it is conditionate,
fiduciary, and proportioned according as it pleaseth
the Community to entrust more or less. 4. The fourth,
that Royal Power in a King is not simply supreme,
but in some cases there is a co-ordinate Power or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral;
nay, that in some cases the King is subordinate
to the Community. 5. The fifth and last is, that the
King in some cases may be resisted and opposed by
Violence, Force, and Arms, at least in a defensive
way.</p>
            <p>These are the main Foundations upon which all those
impious Courses are built, and which have had such
Influence upon disaffected and less knowing Subjects,
to raise and cherish these Distempers and Rebellions,
for which all sound-hearted and good Subjects mourn.
Yet to add the more Lustre to them, there be couched
under them, or added to them, a number of specious
general Maxims apt to ensnare the popular Faction,
which we shall by Gods help clear and demonstrate to
be Untruths and popular Sophisms, as they offer in
their own proper place. The contrary of what they
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>firm, we hold to be sound Divinity, agreeable to
the Truth revealed in Scripture, consonant to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and Practice of the ancient Christian Church, and
grounded upon sound Reason, deducted out of nature
and the best Institutions of Policy and Government.</p>
            <p>That we may the more orderly proceed, we sum up
all into five Questions; whereof the first is this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or not Sovereignty or the Royal Power of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33502:17"/>
King be independent from all Creatures, solely and
only dependent from God; immediately from him,
and neither from the Community, the diffusive, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective,
representative, or vertual Bodie of the People?
In which by Gods grace we will make it appear, that
the King is the <hi>derivative</hi> of the <hi>primative</hi> King, <hi>who
is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is, Whether or not, God is no more
Author of Royal Power, than of Aristocratical or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical?
Of supreme than subordinate? Of usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and not just, than of just Government and Regal?
In which it will appear, that by Gods Institution Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
is graced and authorised above others: that Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,
Democracy, and Monarchy are not, <hi>Species uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocae
regiminis, sed analogicae,</hi> not univocal Kinds and
Species of Government, but equivocal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at best analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
are, howsoever tolerable, and not so perfect, some
way defective, and that they degenerate from the true
and most perfect Species of Government, Monarchy,
in which is <hi>formalis &amp; completa gubernandi ratio,</hi> the
most formal and compleat E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ence of Government.</p>
            <p>The third is, Whether or not, Sovereignty and
Royalty be in a King by Conveyance of Trust, fiduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
and conditionate issuing from the People, by a
Trust devolved upon him in that portion it pleaseth
them to proportion? In which will be evident, that
the Trust of Sovereignty and Government is by God
devolved upon the King. That all Sovereignty rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God is fiduciary and conditionate, but related
to the People is absolute.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, Whether or not by divine Institution
any man or men, some few or many, have any co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,
co-equal, or collateral Power with the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of Royalty? Or whether or not in any case
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33502:18"/>
or exigent, a King can be subordinate? In the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of which Question fitly and conveniently will
be discussed, that <hi>In quo formale Imperii consistit,</hi> that in
which the essence of Sovereignty doth consist; and
without which it cannot subsist; as that it is <hi>supreme,
perpetual,</hi> and freed from <hi>all coercive and coactive Power,</hi>
which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call <hi>Imperium majus,</hi> the Politicks
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The fifth and last is, Whether or not in any case it
is lawful for Subjects, one, any, more, or all to oppose
a Prince?</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Affirmative is maintained, the contrary Opinion is
explained, the Authors and Assertors, some of them with
their Differences, are recited.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE hold the Affirmative, that the King is only
and immediately dependent from Almighty
God, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
and independent in his Sovereignty and Power, from the
Community in what Notion soever you conceive it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a <hi>diffusive, collective, representative, or vertual Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jesuit and Puritan to depress Kings aver, <hi>that
all Power is originally, radically, and formally inherent
in the People or Community,</hi> and <hi>from thence is derived to
the King.</hi> In the explaining of this Proposition, there
is amongst those who lay this Foundation for the
building of their <hi>Babel</hi> a great Latitude of Diversity.
Lately I read in one, who is the Author of the Tract
concerning Schism and Schismaticks, <hi>pag. 29. We have
believed him that hath told us,</hi> that <hi>in Christ Iesus there
is neither high nor low, and that in giving Honour, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man should be ready to prefer another before himself:
which saying cuts off all claim certainly of Superiority by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33502:19"/>
Title of Christianity, except men think that these things
were spoken only to poor and private men. Nature and
Religion agree in this, that neither of them hath an hand
in this Herauldry of</hi> Secundùm sub &amp; supra, <hi>all this
comes from Composition and Agreement amongst themselves.</hi>
I have given you his words, I should be glad to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
and crave him Mercy. But as I conceive him,
this Position is worse than any I know of the Jesuits,
or more moderate Sectaries; both of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a Necessity of Government is taught by Nature
and Grace, and that the Distinction of Superiority and
Inferiority is the dictate of common Reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
Otherwise neither Nature nor Religion may
avoid Confusion or Destruction. God who is the
God of Order and not of Confusion, is the Author
of this Herauldry, of <hi>Secundum sub &amp; supra,</hi> in the
whole Universe, in Church, in State. Hath not God in
the moral Law taught it, <hi>Honora Patrem, &amp;c.</hi> Honour
thy Father, &amp;c? Do not St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter Rom. 13.
1. Pet. 2. 14. v.</hi> command this as the Will of God? And
did not our Saviour practise it, and his Apostles after
him, and after them all the Christian Church? You must
take away humane Society in Church and State, if you
take away this Herauldry of Superiority and Inferiority.
Sure I am, the Jesuits do hold that Government is <hi>ex
jure naturae,</hi> by the Law of Nature. I hope our Sectaries
think no worse in this point than the Jesuits.</p>
            <p>I return to the Jesuit and Puritan, who are very
like-in this Tenet; but give me Leave to say, for as
bad as the Jesuit is, in my conceiving the Puritan is
worse. Let us make a parallel. 1. First, the Jesuit
says, that all Power civil, is radically and originally
seated in the Community or Multitude, God having
made it the <hi>Primum subjectum,</hi> the first Subject in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33502:19"/>
which it is seated. The Puritan joyneth hands here
with the Jesuit. 2. Next, both of them say, it is
from the Multitude by way of Collation and Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to one, as in Monarchy, to some as in Aristocracy, to
many as in Democracy; so that immediately it is from
the People, and mediately from God, and not so much
by Collation, as by Approbation. How the Jesuit
and Puritan walk along in an unequal pace, See <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,
l. de Laicis, cap. 6. Suarez. Defens. Doctrinae
Orthod. contra Sectam Anglicanam,</hi> l. 3. 3. Thirdly,
that the People may change Monarchy into Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or Democracy, or an Aristocracy into a Monarchy,
or Democracy, or <hi>è contrae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which way you will; for
ought I know, they differ not in this neither. 4. But
some of our new State-Divines, do hold that this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is derived to the King from the People, <hi>Cumulativè</hi>
or <hi>Communicativè, non Privativè,</hi> by way of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
or Cumulation, but not by way of Privation;
that is, howsoever the People communicate this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
to the King by trust, yet they denude not
themselves of this Sovereignty. To make it plain, it
is in their Opinion no otherwise than as when the
King of <hi>England</hi> appoints a Lieutenant, Deputy, or
High Commissioner of <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> he denudes
not himself of his Royal Power, but delegates them
with Power and Trust for his Service. If this be their
mind, (for I cannot conjecture at any other, and if they
have any other Sense, I wish they would make it
plain) the King is in a poor case, by such a derived
Power: for then as the King of <hi>England</hi> giving to his
Deputy or Deputies that power only <hi>cumulativè,</hi> he
cannot by Reason or Law, seeing <hi>Potior est delegantis
quam delegati authoritas,</hi> that the Principal his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is more excellent than he delegate's, nor can he

be debarred from that right the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> giveth
him, <hi>Anticipatione, concursu</hi> or <hi>evocatione,</hi> by procogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his own proper entire Right, or Evocation, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
or judge in any thing that concerneth that His
Kingdom. If they authorize the People so, let any
that hath common Sense judge in what Condition
these new-state-divines do put Kings. 4. They aver
(which maketh me the more inclinable to conceive
that to be their mind, which before we have expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
that the same Sovereign Power is, (Howsoever
derived from the Community to the King) in the
people <hi>suppletivè,</hi> that is, that if the King be deficient
in necessary Duties of Government for the good of the
Church and State, the People by their innate power,
may do and supply it. This our Rabbies have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught but practised here and elsewhere in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Dominions; yet in my poor reading I have not
found any Jesuit (although I confess by Deduction
out of their Principles this Consequent may be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
so roundly and right down to say it. It is true
that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith in his Recognitions lib. 3. q. <hi>de
Laicis: populus nunquam ita suam potestatem in regem
transfert, quin illam sibi in habitu retineat: ut in certis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibus
etiam actu recipere possit: that the People do never so
transfer their power into the King, but that they retain it to
themselves habitually: that in some certain Cases they may
resume it.</hi> I find a Tenet bad enough, impious enough,
sacrilegious enough, but he doth not say, that this
power is transferred only <hi>cumulatively:</hi> Nor doth he
talk of any <hi>Suppletivè,</hi> actual supply: Only he telleth
of an <hi>habitual retaining</hi> in the People: and that <hi>upon
some cases</hi> they may resume it, not in every ordinary
case; nor can they do it. It is true, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not the case or Cases, He knew it to be difficult,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33502:20"/>
or would have it, it is like, to be a reserved case for the
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> when it pleaseth him to determine or
define it. But if we may guess at his mind by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jesuit <hi>Suarez,</hi> read him lib. 3. <hi>defens. orthod. fid.</hi>
c. 3. §. 2 and three. and there he telleth you, that he
will have it definite and constant in Law, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and evident: <hi>vel antiquis &amp; certis instrumentis, vel
immutabili consuetudine,</hi> either by ancient and faithful
Records of Law, or by unchangeable and not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Custom. If this cannot be produced, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
case he assigns is, <hi>Si Rex sua potestate in manifestam
civitatis perniciem abutatur,</hi> If the King evidently, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
abuse his Power and Sovereignty to the total
Destruction of his Kingdom, (let none cavil that we
English <hi>Civitas</hi> the whole Kingdom) comprehending
King and Kingdom, for they that have but the Terms
of Policy, know that <hi>Civitas</hi> is the whole Kingdom
and State, with the King; and <hi>Civis</hi> the true <hi>Latin</hi>
word for a Subject. He giveth his Reason why in
such a case this is lawful, <hi>quia potest populus naturali po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate
ad se defendendum uti, quia hac se nunquam priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit:</hi>
because the People may use that power of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence
with which nature hath endowed them, for
they did not divest themselves of this power, nor was
it transferred upon the King.</p>
            <p>The Result of <hi>Suarez</hi>'s mind is, that if there be not
Authentical uncontrolable Records, or immemorial and
not interrupted Customs, to determine the Cases, the
Judges, the way of Procedure, the Bounds and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<hi>Quos ultra citraque,</hi> How far and no fart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er;
there is no case lawful or imaginable, but in the abuse
of Sovereignty to the total Destruction of King and
Kingdom, which case as we think howsoever imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet <hi>in facto esse,</hi> it is impossible; as we will shew
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33502:21"/>
after in the last Question that this is not warrantable
By Gods Institution, nor doth the Charter of Nature
entitle us to this Right of self-defence, in this Case
to make away, nay, to resist a King. And observe how
warily the Jesuit qualifies his case. First it must not
be a feared or conjectured case of Ruine and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to King and Kingdom, but manifest and clear as
the Sun-shine. Next, That not any case of Injustice,
Oppression or Tyranny, doth warrant them to do or
act this, but a manifest actual overthrowing of the
whole Kingdom, King and all Subjects. <hi>Gerson</hi> and
others of the Parisian Doctors, qualifie the case thus:
1. That it is necessary, that he intend and Attempt
the total overthrow and Destruction of the Kingdom.
2. Next, that a jealousie or conjectural Evidence is
not sufficient, I must be manifest, as evident as it
were written with a Ray of the Sun. 2. To these
two must be added invincible and insuperable Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
which cannot by humble Reverence, Depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Supplication, or any other means else, which
becometh a Subject to use in all Reverence, Prudence,
and Submission to a Prince be amended: Let God and
good men judge, if our case this day be so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced
and qualified. Thirdly it is worth our noting,
that he speaks not of resuming Sovereignty to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as to it's proper owner, by which this Resistance
or Censure is to be done: but of a natural Power of
self-defence, of which the People and Community
were never denuded nor divested. That this is the
Jesuits mind, appeareth yet more clearly by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
for saith he, <hi>it is not lawful to the People, to
restrain or limit the Power which they have once tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

donationem semel absolute factam revocari non posse, neque
in totum, ne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ex parte, &amp; maxime quando onerosa sunt;
The very Law of Common Equity alloweth not that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
and Covenants should be repealed; and what is
once transferred by Donation, may not by the same Law be
made void either in whole or in part, nay not when the
Condition is to the Prejudice of the Donor.</hi> He adds more,
That Laws made by a Prince cannot be repealed or
made void by the People or Community, without the
tacite or express Consent and Allowance of the Prince.
No, he adds more, that a Prince doth not <hi>pendere à
populo in sua potestate, etiamsi ab ipso eam acceperit, quia
poterit pendere in fieri, &amp; non postea pendere in conservari:</hi>
Doth not depend from the People in his Sovereignty
and power, although he had it from them; because
saith he, while he was a making, or to be made King,
it was of them, but to continue to be so, it is not
from them. Let me add, with this of <hi>Suarez,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
passage of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> where he contradicts that
he speaketh, which before we cited <hi>Becognit. lib. 3. q.
de laicis.</hi> The Passage you have in his Tract against
<hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> where he grants that a People or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
may have some power of approving or reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

or to be instituted, but not after he is chosen or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:
He proveth this thus: <hi>Quemadmodum,</hi> saith

               </gap>, wedded to the
Conclusions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, Truth and Honesty fell
from his Pen. These things I observe not to plead for
Jesuits, the bane of Christian Peace, nor that I think
that there is more Honesty in them, than in a Puritan,
but only to put our Sectaries in mind that howsoever
their Tenets by Deductions and Consequences are
tant' amount as theirs, yet they are more wary and
prudent than in their Expressions, for I never see how
their <hi>Communicative and Suppletive,</hi> by the most benign
Sense can suffer so favourable an Interpretation, as the
Jesuits Tenets do. Besides our Sectaries have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
by how much more they deteriorate and depress
Kings, committing or appropriating so extravagant a
Power transcendent above them, to the Community
or people, who are the weakest in Judgment, the most
instable in their Resolutions and Conclusions, ready to
cry to day <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and to Morrow <hi>Crucifige;</hi> ready
to cry to <hi>Gideon</hi> now Reign thou and thy Son for ever
over us, and incontinent joyn with <hi>Sichem,</hi> and his
base Son <hi>Abimelech:</hi> kill his seventy Sons all of them,
but <hi>Iotham</hi> who iniraculously by Gods Providence es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped:
who in Scripture are compared to the raging
of the Sea, for their Violence and Impetuosity; and
ever casting up dirt, for their Corruption: than doth
the Jesuit who will not admit people shall do it, till
the Pope take notice of it, as competent Judge by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Appointment or made umpire by arbitrement.
For sure I am, that the most solid and learned of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church do hold, that Subjects cannot by any
be loosed from the Oath of Allegiance till the Pope do
it. Again, I pray you to consider what Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is for Kings and Monarchs to become Nurse-fathers
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33502:23"/>
of the Reformed Church, when by our print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and practices we abase them so far as to make
them the basest extract can be derived from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity;
and that they are deposable and dethronable
by the People, upon any exigent they judge fitting.
Will not any understanding Prince, chuse rather to
submit and subject his Crown to the Popes Mitre, than
to the Fury and Violence of an untamed Beast?
Where Piety should be, reason and Judgment may be,
and if all be deficient, yet wrath may be sooner in
one, in him appeased, than in a <hi>bellua multorum capitum.</hi>
His Avarice or Ambition sooner satisfied than is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
of that insatiable Beast of the Community.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Our Gamaliels hold, that as this Sovereign
Power is originally, formally, radically, inherent in
the People, so it is <hi>Reductive</hi> by way of Reduction
theirs, that is, in case of total Defailance of a King and
his Posterity, or in case a King by just demerit, <hi>exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat
jure suo,</hi> forfeit his Right, This Right reverts and
returns to the Community again. And in this, for
ought I know, both Jesuit and Puritan conspire, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Jesuit sworn to maintain the exorbitant Pride
and Power of Pope, reserveth the Interest extravagant
of the Pope. And as Papelings do it <hi>in ordine ad Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia;</hi>
So Presbyterians come well nigh it, who will
have the King, but <hi>Custos</hi> and <hi>Vindex,</hi> and most put
in Execution what the Presbytery or Assembly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
in Gods Case and Cause: otherwise you know
what they may do, <hi>Excommunicate &amp;c.</hi> and what
follows upon that you know by joyning the Law
and the Gospel. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. It is Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that an <hi>Excommunicate shall be unto thee as an
Heathen or Publican:</hi> and the Tenor of the Law
runs, <hi>Deut. 17. A Stranger shall in no wise reign over
thee.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:33502:24"/>
Because we are sure that our Adversaries in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church will the next day either strengthen their
Tenet, asserting it by the Testimony of our men, such
as they will have us to own without all reason, or
then that they disclaim this part of the Tenet, by
which such extravagant Power is given to the People,
which the Pope may do at Leisure and Pleasure; for
neither he nor any Council of theirs hath as yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it to be <hi>de fide;</hi> and turn it home as a true
Brood of reformed Religion, which I most fear, and
with good Reason; for when the Jesuits were of late
in this our Blessed Kings Reign charged by a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that their Doctrine was seditious, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
concerning Kings; a Jesuit in <hi>Spain</hi> was bold
to answer, that the same Tenets were preached and
printed by ours, and practised, before a Jesuit was,
or ever they did print, gave a Paper with warrand of
the Books, as <hi>Goodman, &amp;c.</hi> and it is well known
here, what was professed and protested by Father <hi>Knot</hi>
in his Epistle Dedicatory to our Gracious Sovereign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Book, entituled <hi>Christianity maintained</hi> about
the time of the Stirs and Distempers in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I say, our Enemies are so malicious and subtle
to take all possible Advantages to wrong us, and our
good Cause, I aver confidently, that those and the
like Tenets were never taught nor believed by the
sound Protestants of the Reformed Churches; but our
Sectaries learned them of their <hi>Bouchier, De justâ abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione,
Hen. 3. Rossaeus peregrinus</hi> his <hi>de justa reip. in
principem potestate. Hottoman</hi> his <hi>Francogallia,</hi> his <hi>de
jure regn. Gal. Mariana</hi> and others. And for my part
I probably conjecture by the Terms they use that they
have borrowed their first main Tenet of the Sorbonists,
and others of that kind; who to oppose the Pope his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33502:24"/>
Infallibility in Judgment, his unlimited Power, and
to subject him to a Council, did dispute themselves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
out of breath, to prove that <hi>potestas spiritualis sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
was by Christ first and immediately given <hi>unitati,</hi> or
<hi>communitati fidelium:</hi> that so the power might never
perish, the Truth might be ever preserved, and that
howsoever for the time it was virtually in the Pope,
yet he had it only from the Community of the faithful
<hi>communicatively,</hi> and in case of Defailance, in them it
was <hi>suppletive;</hi> and in case that the power of the
Church was abused to Heresie or Tyranny, the Pope
was deposable (not only censurable) by a Council.
This Question was acutely disputed before, about, and
after the Councel of <hi>Constance.</hi> In the like manner to
vindicate the Sovereignty of Kings, from subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or subjection to the Sea of <hi>Rome in temporalibus,</hi>
they made the Community of the people, the prime,
first, proper, and immediate subject of all civil Power,
intending at this time only to vindicate Princes from
the sacrilegious and violent Invasion of the Pope of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who most impiously and tyrannically usurped
upon them; as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> says, it may well
be that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, like to a Cooper to right
a bowed or crooked stick, will bend it too much to
the other side, to rectifie it, so these men to right
Princes from the Tyranny of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> run
upon the other extreme, for the time not considering
it; as the Fathers to shun the <hi>Scylla</hi> of <hi>Manicheism</hi>
who imposed an inevitable Fate and Necessity upon all
the voluntary actions of man to vindicate mans Will,
and Freedom from inevitable Necessity, and to assert
to it it's native Liberty; they did run so far to the
other extreme, that they ascribed too much to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Power and Strength of mans free will, and so
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33502:25"/>
seemed in heat of Dispute to derogate too much from
the Necessity of Grace to our doing good. Of which
Expressions the <hi>Pelagians</hi> afterward did make use
against the Orthodox.</p>
            <p>Some there be, who do maintain these Parisians and
others, that howsoever they did think Kings and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
were from the People by their Consent, yet
that power was immediately from God. The main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of this Opinion I honour much for their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and other excellent parts. But give me leave to
say it, I do not see how it can be maintained, though
I intend as much as any man to construe all men in
the best Sense. Do not all of them distinguish <hi>inter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem
Civilem &amp; Ecclesiasticam,</hi> betwixt Civil and
Ecclesiastical power; that Kings and Emperours have
their Civil power at first by Donation from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
but Church-men may be chosen or deputed for
sacred Orders or Functions by men, but the Donation
or Collation of the Power is from God? Do they not
hold that <hi>in fieri,</hi> Kings are dependent from People,
but not in <hi>facto?</hi> While they are instituted, but not
after that they are invested with that Power deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Community? Do they not maintain
that they are immediately from God but in Regard
of Approbation? That, in some, in this point, they
hold the Kings Power, his Constitution <hi>in fieri,</hi> is by
the Peoples Donation transferring their innate inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Right upon him; which being immediately by
God approved of, they depend no more <hi>in conservari,</hi>
upon the People; their Words are, <hi>Ita quod in possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo
illo (scilicet Impèrio) nullum recognoscit superiorem
praeter Deum:</hi> that it is so, that a King in possessing
his Empire and Sovereignty acknowledeth no Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
but God: which in effect is no more, than when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33502:25"/>
any man by Industry or Donation acquireth a Right
or Propriety, if he come well by it, he is righteous
possessour of it, by Gods Confirmation and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
yet do they hold too, that the people and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
may <hi>propter crimen civile &amp; politicum destituere
principem,</hi> for a civil Enormity against the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
depose and dethrone a King. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
they maintain that the Pope may not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
for any civil Crime or Transgression, no nor for
any Spiritual either depose a King, <hi>nisi de per accidens,</hi>
but accidentally; for they hold that the Pope cannot
depose <hi>sententialiter,</hi> legally, judicially, and orderly, a
King or Emperour, although he may excommunicate
<hi>sententialiter,</hi> legally, and by his own innate Power, as
they say; <hi>&amp; finaliter</hi> or <hi>consecutive,</hi> and by way of
Consequence, by his Sentence of Excommunication
compel or move those that have power to depose him:
and so accidentally, occasionally, and by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
only he does depose, not properly by himself
or any Power innate and inherent in him. And on
the other side, they hold that the Emperour <hi>de per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens,</hi>
accidentally may depose the Pope; for if the
Pope abuse his power and place, to the Damage of the
Empire and Commonwealth, the Emperour may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
his temporal estate, confiscate his Goods, and
what else he holdeth as the Vassal of the Empire, and
by this means, that those that have Power over the
Pope, (which in their Sense is an Oecumenical, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council) to depose and degrade the Pope. So
equally keep they the Scales betwixt the Emperour,
Kings, and Pope.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate these Truths by their Grounds and
Testimony, it appears evidently; first, that when they
distinguish betwixt secular and sacred power, sacred
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33502:26"/>
they acknowledge supernatural, and immediately by
Donation from God: but secular to be natural, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
and ordinary, by Donation from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Next that they acknowledge God to have no
immediate hand in collating secular Power, but by
way of Approbation. Thirdly, that they allow the
people Authority and Sovereignty not only to censure
but to depose Princes, as doth also <hi>Marsilius monand.
Patav. ad Ludovic. IV. part, 1. c.</hi> 12. When he hath
acknowledged that <hi>Moses, Ioshua, Saul, David,</hi> and
such had immediate Institution from God Almighty,
for other Kings and Governours, their Right he saith,
<hi>Provenit immediatè ex arbitrio humanae mentis,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the free Election and Concession of
man. <hi>Iacobus Almayn</hi> in his Tract, <hi>De suprema Pot.
Eccles. &amp; Laica, q. 2. c.</hi> 1. saith expresly, <hi>in sola appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batione

Civilis &amp; Laica,</hi> all secular Power and Jurisdiction is
founded in the sole Approbation of God: and that
you mistake him not, he telleth you immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that for the Collation of the power it is not,
but <hi>Aliquibus titulis creatis mediantibus,</hi> by some Right
or Title ordinary, <hi>Scilicet vel titulo successionis, vel hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditate,
vel venditione, vel donatione, vel aliqua permu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione;</hi>
either by the Right of Succession, or the
Right of Inheritance, or by Alienation, or by Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or by some way of exchange. See him more
fully, <hi>cap. 5. ibidem.</hi> where he giveth you the three
ways, which all the Sorbonists conceive to compleat
all the manner, how man may be said to have any
thing immediately from God. Let me refer you again
to another Passage of <hi>Marsilius Patavinus de Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
Imperii cap.</hi> 6. Answering that Objection for the
Popes power above Emperours and Kings, that the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33502:26"/>
Pope <hi>Zacharias</hi> deposed <hi>Childerick</hi> and enthroned <hi>Pipin</hi>'

The Pope had no Authority in the one or other, but
a naked Consent, for the deposing of such a King as
<hi>Childerick,</hi> who was a stupid and naughty man, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beastly in his Pleasures; nor the chusing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as <hi>Pipin</hi> doth not, for most considerable Reasons,
belong either to any Bishop, Church-man, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of Clergy, but only to the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Subjects, or to the Nobles, or to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and better part of the whole. You see here <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi>
speaketh the Language of the Doctors of <hi>Sorbon.</hi>
For you will read their Distinction in answering the
very same Objection, that <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Pope, both in
the Deposition of the one, and Constitution of the
other, had a hand <hi>consensivè,</hi> not <hi>authoritativè,</hi> by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To shut up all this, I refer you to one place, by
viewing of which you shall have explicitly three, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus
Almayn, Iohannes de Parisiis,</hi> and <hi>Ockam,</hi> all of
them Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> and breathing the same thing,
with the Patavin Doctor <hi>Marsilius. Almayn</hi> hath it,
who writ for <hi>Ockam,</hi> and in the words alledgeth <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes
de Paris verbatim de Supr. Pot. Eccles. &amp; Laic. q.
2. c.</hi> 5. where with <hi>Ockam</hi> he grants that the Pope
for Heresie may depose a King, and the people for
transgressing against the Commonwealth. But that
you may conceive all aright, he saith, <hi>Non licet Papae
nec propter civile, nec propter spirituale crimen deponere, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si
de per accidens. Et non pertinet ad Papam sententíaliter
deponere Imperatorem, licet spectet sententialiter excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,
&amp; finaliter per censuram Excommunicationis eos qui
habent Authoritatem deponendi cogere ut illum deponant.
Et sic de per accidens deponit solummodo &amp; non directè.</hi>
The Sense is, It is not proper nor lawful to a Pope to
depose an Emperour, either for any civil or spiritual
Crime, for Errors in Policy or Religion, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally.
The Pope may sentence the Emperour
with Excommunication, but not with Deposition,
and so upon the bye, may move the people or the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
who have Authority over him to dethrone
him. And this is done by the Pope not <hi>properly</hi> but
<hi>improperly,</hi> not <hi>effectively,</hi> but <hi>consecutively.</hi> The like
he subjoyns concerning the Emperours power over the
Pope; that if the Pope abuse the power he hath, to
the Disturbance and Hurt of the civil State, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
may forfeit his State, confiscate his Goods, and so
indirectly make, move and force those who have power
above the Pope, which in their Opinion is the whole
Church, or the Representative which is an oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Council, to depose the Pope, and institute another.

To these I might add <hi>Gerson</hi> and others, I refer you
to <hi>Gerson</hi>'s Considerations, and amongst these that
you will read the seventh.</p>
            <p>I have insisted on this, especially for two Reasons;
the one is, that you may see these Tenets came not
into the World with <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> but were
long before there was any Word of a Reformer. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes
de Parisiis</hi> lived and taught at <hi>Paris,</hi> in King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
sirnamed <hi>Pulcher,</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth's time,
about the year of our Lord, 1296. <hi>Willielme Ockam</hi>
an English born, and <hi>Regius Professor</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> who
writ his Dialogue at the Request of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and
after his Death fled to the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth,
died as some think about 1320. <hi>Gerson</hi> Chancellor of
the University of <hi>Paris,</hi> lived in the time of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Constance,</hi> and died about 1420. And <hi>Almayn</hi>
the first and chief Professor in <hi>Sorbon,</hi> who took upon
him the Defence of <hi>Willielme Ockam,</hi> if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> wrote <hi>Anno</hi> 1512. a book
against <hi>Cajetan,</hi> for the Power of a Council above the
Pope, which was printed <hi>Coloniae</hi> 1514. All these were <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>
to <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin.</hi> Our Rabbies then have drawn
these Doctrines out of their polluted Cisterns.</p>
            <p>The other Reason is, because some too charitably,
and to the prejudice of Verity, interpret the Authors
above cited and their Kinsmen.</p>
            <p>If any man will take and hold them to the better
Sense, I will not be contentious, though I profess I
cannot see it, yet will it appear otherwise that those
are not the Tenets of the reformed, Catholick Church,
but the Foppery of <hi>Popery.</hi> See <hi>Thomas Aquinas 1. de
regim. princ. c.</hi> 6. where he saith, <hi>Si ad jus multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

either that said so, or writ so. Some charitably plead
for him, and shew how averse he was from giving his
Consent: that at first he writ to disswade them from
wronging <hi>Childerick,</hi> who had his Right from God,
and writ thus to wash his hands in Innocency. I will
not take pains to vindicate him, I leave that Labour
to the Popes parasites: yet it is worth our noting,
that when <hi>Pipin</hi> and his Complices were about this
Treason, to rob <hi>Childerick</hi> of his Crown, although
all things were in him that might perswade to such a
Course, <hi>Childerick</hi> being but a <hi>weak King,</hi> a silly man,
drowned and buried in ease and pleasures; childless,
nor any near to him: yet at this time, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all those Circumstances, the like whereof, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I think, occurred before, so odious a Crime it
was to depose and set a King by his Throne, though

               </gap>o all <hi>France</hi> had almost conspired with him; yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33502:28"/>
fearing that the whole Christian World would cry fie
upon them for such an Impiety, they had Recourse to
the Pope, that by a specious shew of his Holiness, and the
Authority of that holy Church, this great Impiety and
Treason might be countenanced and go current. This
President was made a leading case in after Ages, both
for popish and popular Usurpation to intrude, nay,
to invade upon the Sacred Right of Sacred Kings.
Nay, our <hi>Puritans</hi> have from hence learned to colour
and lustre their ugly Treasons and Seditions with the
Cloak of Religion and Righteousness. With the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
of another Opinion of some who make regal
Power resident in the People, and from thence derived
to the King, I will close this Chapter. Some do hold,
that all Sovereign power is primarily and naturally in
the <hi>(universitate civium)</hi> multitude, from it derived
to the King immediately, and mediately from God.
Who intending the Good, Peace and Safety of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which cannot be obtained without preservation
of Order, hath commanded, and by an inviolable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
and Institution, appointed all to submit and
subject themselves to the Laws of Society, not only
for Wrath, but for Conscience sake: not only whilst
they enjoy Peace, Plenty, Justice, and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Benefit of Governours, but also whilst
they do suffer under some Inconveniences or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Abuses. The Reason of which Obligation they
make to be this, because we cannot enjoy nor reap the
sweet Fruits of established Government, unless by
compact we submit our selves to some possible and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
Inconveniences, from which grounds they
extract these Consequences and Consectanes.</p>
            <p>1. First, That after a people have by Contract,
Compact, or Covenant divested themselves of that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33502:29"/>
Power which was primarily and natively in them
they cannot without manifest violation and breach of
inviolable divine Ordinance, and without Breach of
publick Faith, resume that Authority which they have
placed in a King; that being united in one, it may be
enabled sufficiently to protect all, and to exert and
exercise all necessary acts of Government.</p>
            <p>2. The second is, that it were high Sin to trench
upon Sovereign Authority, to rob it of its Essentials
and native Constitutions.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, this ordinance of God is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not without just and urgent Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. First, for if that the primary and native Power
which is in all and every one, were not united entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sovereignly in one, it could not have Strength
enough to protect all and every one, and to do all
Acts and parts of necessary Government.</p>
            <p>2. Next, this Ordinance of God is necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
those fatal and too too ordinary Divisions, which
attend Multitudes, or many endued with equal Power;
where almost every one, upon <hi>real</hi> or <hi>fancied Injuries,</hi>
undertaketh to right himself. The Authors of this
Opinion add, That although before <hi>positive Constitution</hi>
this is not absolutely unjust, yet Reason informeth us,
that it must be fit by some Condition and Agreement
to part <hi>with this native Right entirely,</hi> for a greater good
which will ensue; and to prevent greater Evils,
which without this cannot be avoided; and to restrain
our selves from being our own Judges.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, that either to resume any part of this
Power of which the people have <hi>totally</hi> divested them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or to entrench, usurp upon, or limit it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to its Nature, is not only to <hi>disable Sovereignty</hi>
from Government and Protection, but also to <hi>loosen

                  </gap>he Sinews of all Society,</hi> no less than of Government,
by receding from that Compact which subtle, discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ented
and disaffected men, for their own private ends,
perswade others they might have made more to their
own Advantage.</p>
            <p>I was sometime in Love with this Opinion, nor do
I much condemn it, for it enableth Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a King with an entire and sufficient Power: it
maketh the Person and Office of the King sacred and
inviolable: it determineth that it is Sacriledge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nude
or divest the King of any part of sacred Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that the attempt or practise of any in this
kind is a bad president, nay, a warrant for the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of all Contracts howsoever just, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatsoever advantagious; it reserveth Kings to
the Tribunal of God only; it preventeth <hi>by the law of
Nature the Appointment of God,</hi> all Seditions and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
declaring <hi>vim civium in Regem semper injustam;</hi>
all Opposition by force, resisting of Kings by Arms,
whither in a <hi>defensive or offensive way,</hi> to be against God
and unlawful.</p>
            <p>How fair soever this Opinion be, yet I dare not to
aver it, nor maintain it: for I can never see where
holy Scripture, or reverend and pious Antiquity hath
seated this Sovereignty in the multitude, or <hi>universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
civium,</hi> originally or radically, <hi>tanquam in subjecto
primo,</hi> as in its first Subject: Scripture and Fathers
speak it clearly, frequently, that Sovereignty refers
to God, as to its immediate Author and Donor; but
that it is <hi>underivedly, primarily,</hi> and <hi>natively</hi> in the
Community, from thence transferred to the Prince,
<hi>Ne <gap reason="foreign">

from Scripture or Fathers they would make it appear,
that after the Peoples Constitution, there is a superve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33502:30"/>
accessory Ordinance to secure the Prince his
Person and Function. I leave this, and come to
prove by Scripture,</p>

            <argument>
               <p>That God is the immediate Author of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the King, and that he is no Creature of
the Peoples making.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen we say that Kings are constituted imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by God, and that Sovereignty is by
immediate Donation and Collation from
God, and not from the People, conceive us not to
mean so grosly, that this is <hi>by any special Ordinance sent
from Heaven by the Ministry of Angels or Prophets.</hi> The
Observator if he conceive there is no other way but
this, whereby the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Royalty</hi> may be referred
to God as the immediate Donor, he will grant that
there were but some few such, as <hi>Moses, Saul, David
&amp;c.</hi> But if he know not that some thing may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
proceed from God, and be his proper work,
without a Revelation or Manifestation extraordinary
from Heaven, he is as empty a Divine, as I fear in
the end he'll prove a Politician. I hope he will grant,
that howsoever the Designation of a person to, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
for a sacred Function be by the Church and
man, yet the power of preaching, administrating the
Sacraments, binding and loosing of Sins is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from Christ. To say this Power were derived from
any other is not only unsound, but blasphemous.
This Power in its nature is <hi>divine, spiritual,</hi> and <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural;</hi>
and consequently cannot be but from such an
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33502:30"/>
efficient. The designation of the Person to an holy
Function is from man or men, but the collation of
the Power is immediately from God and Christ, and
yet this is not by any <hi>special Ordinance sent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the Ministry of Angels and Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Apostles are of God and Christ's immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Constitution, none doth deny. That <hi>Matthias</hi>
was one, Who will controvert? That he was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by men is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. Two were set apart, the
Decision was by Lots, and yet, I pray you, was not
<hi>Matthias</hi> an Apostle by immediate Constitution from
Christ? But where read you, where find you <hi>any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Ordinance sent from Heaven by the Ministery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come to Natural things. If the Observator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
with the most part of Divines, that the Soul of
man is by Creation and Infusion, not by propagation
and traduction, although Man and Nature begetteth
the Body, disposeth and prepareth it as a fit matter
to be conjoyned with the Soul, that the Father may
well be said to have begotten the Son, yet will he
acknowledge, that the Soul is immediately from God,
and believe it to be so <hi>without any special Ordinance
sent from Heaven.</hi>

            <p>It were good for our Adversaries to consider, that

saying the same, although not in School-terms,
in many places, as namely, <hi>de corrept. &amp; grat. c. 14.

to the very same purpose, see <hi>Suarez, lib. 3. contr.
Angl. Sect. err. c.</hi> 2. although in his Application he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
foully) do teach us, A thing may be said to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God three wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:33502:31"/>
1. The first is, when it is so <hi>solely from God,</hi> as it
is from no other, and <hi>presupposeth no thing ordinary,
humane, or created, previous or antecedent before the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of it.</hi> Such was the Power <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,
Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had. Such were the Apostles, all of
them were by God and Christ immediately institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
constituted, designed to, and invested with Power
from above.</p>
            <p>2. The second way that any thing is said to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God, is, when the <hi>collation of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and investing of the Person in, and with such Power,</hi>
is from God, as the immediate <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Donor,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be presupposed or interposed, <hi>aliquod
signum creatum,</hi> some previous or antecedent Act hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
or created. The Power Apostolical in <hi>Matthias,</hi>
and appointing him to be an Apostle, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from Christ, although some humane Acts did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede,
and were interposed before his Constitution, as
that the Apostles put two apart, and did cast lots.
Neither of these two acts severally, nor both joyntly,
had either vertually or formally in them that efficacy
or efficiency to collate upon him the Apostolical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Preeminence. A world of Instances may be
made in this kind. A man baptized, by Baptism ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
Remission of Sins, and the Grace of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
yet none is so weak as to say, that the <hi>immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in,</hi> or <hi>aspersion</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> effecteth or produceth
these excellent Effects of Remission of Sins, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.
<hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, King of <hi>Fraence,</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> when one of their
number di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, or was removed, to make choice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in his place: yet none will deny, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Power of a Judge and Senator is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
collated upon the Person chosen by and from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33502:31"/>
the King of <hi>France.</hi> A King giveth to a well-deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Servant the Favour to name any man fitted for
Honour to be a Lord, Baron, or Earl, after the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to whom the Trust is committed hath designed
the Person or man, he is made a Lord, Baron, or Earl.
Who is so stupid to aver, that the Honour of a Lord,
Baron, or Earl is from the Servant, a fellow-subject
immediately? And who dare to deny the Honour is
from the King, the Fountain of all Honour? This is
easily discerned, for when the act interposed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed
to the Production and working of such an
Effect, is such that of <hi>its own Nature it hath no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Contingency with the effect produced, but what it hath
by some Resemblance or Constitution.</hi> We must run to
an higher and more eminent Cause of such a Work
and Effect; of which see more, <hi>infra, c.</hi> 13. where we
prove that the interposing of an humane Act in the
Constitution of a King, as Election, Succession, or
Conquest, impedeth not the constitution and making
of a King to be immediately from God.</p>
            <p>3. The third way is, When <hi>titulo creato mediante,</hi> a
mans Right to any thing he hath power of by <hi>some ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
humane Right or Title intervening,</hi> by which he is
invested with a just and full Right to that is collated
upon him, and the <hi>Approbation or Confirmation of this
Right is immediately from God:</hi> so that the possessour
in possessing what he hath just Right, recognosceth or
acknowledgeth <hi>in the right of Propriety</hi> no Superiour but
Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this, for the first way, we maintain
not that Sovereignty is in a King immediately from
God, by extraordinary Revelation, without any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Act or Sign created intervening, This was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
only to some few.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:33502:32"/>
The second way, we hold that all Kings really so,
are immediately from God: for although some <hi>Signum
creatum,</hi> some humane and created act, <hi>as Election,
Succession, Conquest,</hi> or what else in that kind is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
and possible interveneth, to <hi>the Designation of
the Person,</hi> yet the <hi>real Constitution, the Collation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
and Royalty</hi> is immediately from God; for the
Act or Condition presupposed or interposed contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in it that power to collate Royal and Sovereign
Power: only by Gods appointment it is inseparably
joyned with it, or infallibly followeth after it, so that
it referreth to God as the <hi>proper donor and immediate
Author.</hi> As in Baptism, if there be nothing repugnant
in the Suscipient, the baptized hath from God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Remission of Sins, and Grace of Regenerrtion.
Or as in Sacred Orders, the Designation of the person is
from men and an humane Act; but the Endowment
with supernatural power to act, do and exercise super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Acts, is immediately from God and Christ
<hi>Matthias</hi> his person was designed by the Apostles, but
Christ only made him truly and really an Apostle.
Just so in the Constitution of Kings, <hi>Election, Succession,
Conquest,</hi> or what else, is only <hi>Potestas designativa per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonae;</hi>
but the power of Royalty and Sovereignty is
primarily, formally, and immediately from God.</p>
            <p>That we may conceive things aright in this case, we
must distinguish three things. 1. First, <hi>The Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Royal Power,</hi> which is <hi>forma quaedam,</hi> the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and formal Essence constitutive of a King. 2. Next<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>The Person</hi> of the King, which is <hi>Subjectum,</hi> the seat
or that wherein this Sovereignty is inherent. 3. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>The Conjunction of the Sovereignty with the Person,</hi> or
the Application of Royal Power and Sovereignty to
the Person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:33502:32"/>
The first, that is, Regal Power and Sovereignty is
immediately from God and Christ.</p>
            <p>The second, that is, the individual Person taken
absolutely in its specifick and individual Essence and
Existence, is from its natural Causes constituent: But
<hi>qua talis,</hi> considered as a King and such a one, that is,
as Supreme and Sovereign, the Deputation or Desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of such an individual person for such a Power,
is by Election, Succession, Conquest, or any other
lawful way by which God in his Providence doth
manifest it.</p>
            <p>The third, that is, the joyning of the Authority to
the Person, is immediately from God and Christ.
Election, Succession, or Conquest, may be said in some
Sense <hi>remotely</hi> and <hi>improperly</hi> to make or constitute a
King, although they are not the <hi>proper efficient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent
cause</hi> of that Power.</p>
            <p>To say in the third Sense, that Sovereignty in the
King is immediately from God <hi>by Approbation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
only,</hi> it is too flat an Expression, and doth
not sort well with the magnifick Expressions of Holy
Scripture: as, <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> Prov. 8. 15. <hi>The
Powers that are, are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 2. <hi>I
have said ye are Gods,</hi> Psal. 82. 8. <hi>All Power is given
from above,</hi> John. 19. <hi>God hath spoken it once, twice
have I heard it, all Power belongeth unto the Lord,</hi> Psal.
62. 11. According to this Opinion, the Sense of those
and other such places must be, Kings have their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from below, from the People, by Contract are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of men, and only established by God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
we must change the Phrase, The People have
said you are Gods, your Power is from below: and
Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s ordained of God, is no better than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
or approved of God. Nor is the Title or Right
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33502:33"/>
of a King better, as related to God, than the Title of
what any man possesseth <hi>titulo humano orcato,</hi> by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Right, by Contract, or otherwise in Rents,
Moneys, Revenues, or what else is ordinary in the
Commerce and Society civil of men.</p>
            <p>In brief, our Sense is, <hi>The Royal Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of the King</hi> is from God primarily, formally,
immediately; <hi>The Designation or Deputation of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
is by Election, Succession, Conquest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
<hi>Matthias</hi> was designed by the Apostles setting of
him apart, and the falling of the Lord upon him, but
the Apostolical Power and Preeminence was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
and solely from Christ. The power of the High-priest-hood
in <hi>Zadok</hi> was from God; the Designation
of the Person was from <hi>Solomon,</hi> a pregnant proof and
Illustration of this appeareth in <hi>Iephtah,</hi> Judg. 4. 5, 6,
7. The Elders of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and people by Covenant and
Contract bring him home, agree he be Judge and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour:
and yet notwithstanding, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 11.
The sending of <hi>Iephtah</hi> is no less given to God solely,
than the immediate and extraordinary sending of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbaal,
Bedan,</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi> A Father begetteth the
Child, but God infuseth the Soul. A Woman by her
Choice and Consent designeth her Husband, but the
marital Power and Dominion is only from God; for
how can she confer or transfer that power which was
never fixed in her, nay by God and Nature she is to
be ruled by her Husband. It is more then than mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that an humane Act may design the Person
of a King, and that the Power is conferred by God
alone.</p>
            <p>There is in true Judgement a main Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Potestas deputativa &amp; designativa personae Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae,</hi>
and <hi>Potestas collative potestatis Regiae;</hi> betwixt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33502:33"/>
               <hi>Applicativum personae ad authoritatem &amp; potestatem,</hi>
and <hi>applicativum authoritatis ad personam Regis.</hi> The
first may be done by an humane Act, as a mans
hand may apply a Faggot to the fire; but the other,
in our case, is proper to God, as the Fire only can
make the Faggot burn. It appeareth then clearly,
that Power may and doth come from God alone, and
immediately without <hi>extraordinary Revelation by the
Voice of God, of Angel, or Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sense and Terms of our Tenet thus cleared,
we come in the next place to our Proofs, from the
Holy Scriptures in the first place. God in Scripture,
by frequent, pregnant, and multivarious Expressions,
hath so vindicated to himself the making and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
of Kings, that he declareth fully that he will
have none to share with him in this Work, for he
hath told us, that Kings and their Sovereignty are <hi>by
God, of God, from God:</hi> that they are <hi>Gods: The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the most High: His Servants: His Ministers:
His publick Ministers and Deputies</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
That <hi>their Throne, their Crown, their Sword, their Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
their Iudgment are Gods,</hi> &amp;c. and hath expressed it
<hi>in abstracto,</hi> abstractly; of their Royalty, their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and <hi>in concreto</hi> of themselves with a Connotation
of their Persons; to intimate, that they, and all in
them, their Power, their Function, their Charge,
their Person, are of divine extract: a Constitution of
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to teach us, that the Sovereign Authority of
the King, and the Person of the King, both of them
are sacred, inviolable: God in his Omniscience and
Prescience did foresee, that the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> would
be like to their Father in Transgression, that nothing
will content them but to be <hi>like God;</hi> and before they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33502:34"/>
fail, they will justle him out of his Right, run upon
the Guiltiness of <hi>divine Vsurpation,</hi> challenging to
themselves the Prerogative of the Almighty, Pope and
People, Anti-christ-like, exalting themselves above all
that is called God. The <hi>Iesuit</hi> this day pleased for
the Pope, the <hi>Puritan</hi> for the People, that he or they
have underived Majesty by which they may enthrone
or dethrone, make or unmake Kings at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>We begin first with the Law. In which as God by
himself prescribed the Essentials, Substantials, and
Ceremonials of Piety and his Worship; gave order
for Justice and Piety: so he commanded the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and constituting of the King, to be reserved as a
priviledged case, a proper Prerogative for himself:
<hi>Deut. 17. 14, 15. &amp;c. When thou shalt say, I will set a
King over me, like as all the Nations about me, Thou shalt
in any wise set him King over thee, whom the Lord thy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God shall chuse.</hi> A Law sufficient to prove our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that the King and his Power are originally
and immediately from God, dependent from him
alone, and independent from all others. The Power
and Sovereignty is expressed in the words, <hi>Set over
thee:</hi> This <hi>Thee</hi> is collective, and includeth all and
every one; so Scripture knew not this new state-devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
principle, That <hi>Rex est singulis major, universis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
above every one <hi>severally,</hi> but subordinate, to all
<hi>joyntly.</hi> The person is expressed <hi>in concreto,</hi> in the
Words, <hi>Whom the Lord thy God shall chuse.</hi> Neither
is it to be slightly passed by, that so peremptorily,
emphatically, and authoritatively it is right-down said,
Thou shalt in any wise set him King over thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Which peremptory Precepts dischargeth the People
all and every one, <hi>diffusively, collectively, representatively,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33502:34"/>
or in what capacity else is imaginable</hi> in them to intend,
attempt, or practise the appointing of a King, but to
leave it entirely and totally to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Here we must take off some shifts which <hi>Iesuits,
Puritans,</hi> and others make to elude this and other
Texts of this kind. 1. The first is, <hi>That this was a
priviledged case of the Iewish King:</hi> So <hi>Suarez. lib. 3.
c. 2. defens. orthod. Fid. cont. Sect. Angl.</hi> So <hi>Soto, l. 4.
de Instit. q. 2. art.</hi> 1. So <hi>Navarrus, cap. Novit. Notab. 3.
num. 33. &amp;</hi> 147. and many more, as <hi>Abulensis</hi> and
others: The Sectary averreth the same. Both of them
strengthen their Argument by these Maxims: <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla
specialia non valent ad inferendum regulam universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:
imo solent esse exceptiones à Regula.</hi> To the same
purpose they adduce that Maxim of the <hi>Iurists; Valet
Argumentum à speciali ad inferendam regulam universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
or, <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis.</hi> The
Sum and Sense is, that extraordinary, singular, special,
and priviledged cases, are not firm and valid antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to infer a general, ordinary, and ruled case: that
if we cannot make it appear that all Kings are from
God by immediate Constitution, the priviledged case
of the <hi>Iews</hi> will infer no necessary Conclusion. <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>
in the place above cited, goeth a little further,
affirming that God amongst the Jews did reserve, as
peculiar to himself, the <hi>election onely of the King,</hi> but
that <hi>His Constitution,</hi> or the collation of Royal Power,
was from the People properly, immediately: and that
because the words run in the Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14, 15.
that the People shall set him King over them, and him
only <hi>whom the Lord they God shall chuse. Bellarmine</hi> saith
just the same.</p>
            <p>To remove this first shift, we deny both the one and
the other. We deny first, that it was a proper case
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33502:35"/>
for the Jews to have their Kings immediately consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
and appointed by God. The Scripture is for
us, that all Kings, all Sovereign Powers are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prov. 8. 15. By me Kings reign,</hi> saith a King, and the
wisest of Kings, and a King who had good reason to
say so; for, if the People had right to constitute or
make a King, it had not been King <hi>Solomon</hi> but King
<hi>Adonijah. Adonijah</hi> durst say to King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Mother,
<hi>Thou knowest that the Kingdome was mine, and that all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
set their faces on me that I should reign: 1 Kin. 2. 15.
Solomon</hi> saith not of himself singularly, That he reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, but indefinitely universally, <hi>By me Kings,</hi>
that is, all Kings reign. The first two words, <hi>Per me,
By me,</hi> contain in them the Donor, the Author, the
Efficient, the Constituent of Kings and Sovereignty.
Possibly you will say, this <hi>By me,</hi> is spoken of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
it is true; but that Wisdom is to be taken

which the Lord possessed in the beginning of his

is the same that was created of all things. Kings are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33502:35"/>
from God the Father, but by the Son; as from the
Father, by the Son, all Spiritual blessing in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things come to us, so the greatest of Temporal
Blessings, By him we have Kings, the best Blessing
here, for without them neither Godliness nor Honesty,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. This <hi>Per</hi> is Christ's Preposition. It is
worth your notice taking, that <hi>Solomon</hi> saith not, By
the People Kings reign; had it been so, you know
who had been King and not <hi>Solomon:</hi> Nor he saith
not, By the High-Priest Kings reign: you know he
was engaged in <hi>Adonijah</hi>'s Treason, no: He saith not,
By <hi>Israel,</hi> nor by <hi>Abiathar,</hi> nor by <hi>Zadoc,</hi> nor by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
nor by <hi>Nathan,</hi> Kings reign; But there is a <hi>Per
me,</hi> which is exclusive of all, and to whom onely it
is proper and peculiar, to make Kings, and to make
Kings reign. <hi>Solomon</hi> excludes <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>People, State</hi>
and <hi>Presbytery.</hi> He vindicates the creation of Kings
no less to Christ than the creation of things. This

Kings, by importunity of People, were given way to,
as some blasphemous mouths and Pens have said and
written: and that Monarchy of all Governments is
the least acceptable to God, and to People most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.
Ignorants, or malicious, or both they are,
who dare to say so. Monarchy was the first Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
God ordained in the World, and is yet found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>in paterno.</hi> Why, if it be otherwise, was it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Ahraham,</hi> as the highest pitch and reach of
Temporal Blessings, that Kings should come of him?
Why doth God, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. upbraiding the multitude
of the People, reckon in the last place, as the highest
of his Favours Temporal, That they prospered into
a Kingdom? Why doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> urge obedience to
the King, because that is the Will of God? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:33502:36"/>
11. 15. Why doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> say, that he is <hi>tibi in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
for thy good, and for my good, and for the
good of all. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Higher

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the King that is Supreme. So <hi>Chrysostom, Ambrose, Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
and others interpret it, and the Government then
when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ that Epistle was Monarchical.
They be a cursed brood, who do maintain, that this
<hi>per me Reges regnant,</hi> This, By me Kings reign, is
a <hi>per me iratum,</hi> by me in anger to punish a stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked
and rebellious People. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi>
knew it was <hi>per me propitium, By me in Mercy,</hi> and was
better taught, and sounder in this point of Divinity,
than the great <hi>Gamaliels</hi> amongst our Sectaries, for
she saith to <hi>Solomon: Because the Lord thy God, Loved</hi>
Israel <hi>to establish them for ever; therefore made he thee
King over them, to do judgment and justice, 1 Chron.</hi> 9. 8.
This <hi>per me</hi> implieth then, that they are of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and in mercy Kings are given to us. This <hi>per
me, by me,</hi> implieth, Kings are God's and Christ's <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivatives,</hi>
and that God and Christ are their <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
from God the Father, by the Son their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
their Power; their Sovereignty; for this cause
St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which word is
very pregnant, and signifieth an Ordinance by high
Authority not revocable, nor repealable. In which
sense it is usually read in classical Authors Sacred and
Prophane. So <hi>Sinesius</hi> useth the word <hi>in Epist. ad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Theoph.</hi> So <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Problems. Sect. 28. 50.
<hi>Lucilius Epigr.</hi> 2. So <hi>Appian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in</hi> 2. and <hi>Plutarch</hi> in

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for established
Decrees of Sovereignty. The word from which it is
derived is so used, <hi>Acts 28. Stephanus</hi> a Learned <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
is of that mind, that in this very place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.
it signifieth so much.</p>

The Emphasis of this <hi>per me</hi> is not yet fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.
That wonder of Piety and Learning, Doctor
<hi>Andrews</hi> Late Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> hath well observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Original is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Beth</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
both: So that the meaning is, Kings are first in
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so come forth from him, as that they are
in him. He parallels it a little with that passage in
the Gospel, <hi>My Father in me, and I in him.</hi> Christ in
them, as his <hi>Deputies:</hi> They in Christ as their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Authoriser, he by their Persons, then by his
Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other two words of the Text, <hi>Kings Reign,</hi>
contain in them the Charter, the Donation. <hi>Kings,</hi> is
in the number of many, in the plural number. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
although the wisest of men and Kings, and King
of <hi>Israel,</hi> knew not this time what our new Doctors
know, that it was a priviledged case, for the Kings
of <hi>Israel</hi> to Reign by immediate Constitution or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from God, from Christ. <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely.
In the Schools it is a currant Maxim, that
<hi>Indefinita propositio aequipollet universali,</hi> an indefinite
proposition is equivalent to an universal, except they
can shew where in Holy Writ it is limited, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained.
It lieth on them to prove it, for <hi>affirmanti
incumbit probatio,</hi> He who affirms is bound to prove
it: Logick and Law both of them require it. The
<hi>Iurist</hi> saith, <hi>Vbi Lex non distinguit, nemo distinguere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet:</hi>
where the Law it self distinguisheth not, we are
not to distinguish. <hi>Solomon</hi> then saith universally of all
Kings, <hi>By me Kings reign:</hi> that is, that their Right,
their Power, their Sovereignty is immediately from
God by Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:33502:37"/>
I am glad that in this Text we met with <hi>Reges,
Kings, in terminis terminantibus,</hi> in express terms. Nor
is it to be slightly passed by, that you have it, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto,</hi>
the King with his Sovereignty: He saith not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Per me Regia potestas,</hi> by me Royalty, Sovereignty, but
<hi>Per me Reges,</hi> by me Kings, to intimate that <hi>Royalty
is sacred, and the Person invested with this Royalty too.
Solomon</hi> for all his Wisdom reached not the Subtilty
of this Age, to distinguish betwixt the King, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Will and Condition, and Royal Power, abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered in it self. If you will have it plainly,
These Rabbies have found out a Distinction, with
which the Spirit of God was not acquainted.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Regnant, They reign,</hi> hath its own force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that not onely their Commission is by immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
from God, and so they may say, <hi>He it is that
hath made us, and not we our selves: Gratia Dei sumus
quod sumus,</hi> By Gods Grace we are what we are, and
so justly do write themselves, every one of them,
<hi>King by the Grace of God;</hi> and so their Title is rightly
from God, and their actual Reigning is of him too.
They are not onely <hi>Reges,</hi> Kings by him in <hi>actu signato,</hi>
as invested with this Power from above, but they
Reign by him <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> their Commands are by

If you please to take it larger yet: <hi>To, regnare in

                  </gap>s Psal. 89. 44. He casteth down their Crown to the

of a King, <hi>in abstracto</hi> or <hi>concreto,</hi> in his Person, or in
his Sovereignty, of his Power habitual or actual, of
his Right, or the Exercise of it; of his making, his

immediately by Christ: and this in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is verified of all Kings whatsoever.</p>
            <p>A further proof both to fortifie what is said, and to
bring home our main Conclusion, we adduce from
<hi>Rom. 13. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

I am very inclinable to think that those words
relate onely, at least principally, to Sovereignty, and
that Monarchical. I do not deny but that by <hi>analogy
and accommodation</hi> they may be accommodated to all
Power whatsoever. The Reasons enforcing me are;
First, because they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, expresly called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, is
<hi>a perfect exclusive,</hi> and is <hi>tant' a mount,</hi> as that no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

God alone. If they shake the Force of this Argument,
their strong hold for Justification is overthrown. We
observed before, how that in the next verse, those
higher Powers are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished

and plurality of Expressions how Sovereignty is of God
and Gods, the Spirit of God hath used, that none
presume sacrilegiously to usurp upon God his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
who hath reserved this peculiarly for himself,
that all Kings upon Earth should be his immediate

            <p>Our Adversaries have been much puzled with this
Text; if they give us a new Bible, it is like enough
either this Text will be left out, or we will have a
Gloss upon it to destroy the original Text. It hath

I content my self to take off one, in which they please
themselves much. They say, the Apostle speaketh
<hi>abstractly,</hi> not <hi>concretely</hi> of the power it felf, not of the
person cloathed and invested with the Power; it is an
ignorant shift. <hi>Barcley</hi> in his Book <hi>de Regno,</hi> (who
hath deserved well of all Christian Monarchs) hath
learnedly and truly observed, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> did keep the <hi>Roman</hi> usual <hi>Diction</hi> in
this, with whom it was customable and ordinary by
<hi>Potestates, powers in the Abstract,</hi> to express the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
authorized with this power. He refers his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to classical and good Authors, as to <hi>Pliny, lib. 29.

            <p>I content my self with the Dialect of <hi>Canaan</hi> in
Scripture; in which frequently Expressions in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,
express existents in the Concrete: <hi>Col. 1. 16.
By him were all things created that are in Heaven, and
that are in Earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers.</hi> By
Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertedly
Angels are meant; that the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are abstract is clear as the Sun-shine. To say An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were created <hi>in abstracto,</hi> is to send us to search
after <hi>Platonick Idea</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>This instance it may be is too sublime, let us see
then if we can hit upon one nearer us, and more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the Purpose in hand. I pray them to cast
their Eyes upon St. <hi>Peter, 2. Epist.</hi> 2. 10. where gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Character of the man with whom we have to
do, he saith, <hi>That they despise Government, are presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
self-willed, and not afraid to speak ill of Dignities.</hi>
The fellow of this you have, <hi>Iud. 8. These filthy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33502:39"/>
Dreamers defile the Flesh, despise Dominion, and speak ill
of Dignities.</hi> In which Passages the words <hi>in abstracto,</hi>
Government, Dominion, Dignities, without any
Doubt do express the persons of Governours, Lords,
and Kings. It is worth your notice taking, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how zealous St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iude</hi> were for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and due of Sovereignty, the ray of Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
upon Earth, that they speak so passionately and
bitterly against such as professed themselves Christians,
and did speak Evil of <hi>Cajus, Caligula, Nero,</hi> monsters
of men: O with what a zeal would they be inflamed,
if living now a days they did see what we see, and hear
what we hear! the pretended Levites expressing their
Zeal to God, Religion, Church and State, by railing
against the Lords anointed, the best of Kings in the
World.</p>
            <p>The Fathers do use the word so too, St. <hi>Austin epist.
48.</hi> saith, <hi>Potestas humana saepe est divinae potestati inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:</hi>
humane power is too often, contrary to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God Almighty. The holy Father was not so bad a
Divine, as to think that <hi>Potestas in abstracto,</hi> that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which is Gods own Ordinance can be in
Opposition or Enmity with God: St. <hi>Austin</hi> then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
by the word <hi>Potestas, Power,</hi> meant him or
them who are authorized with power from above.</p>
            <p>If this doth not content our Adversaries, I would
entreat them to look upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text, and I hope
they will find that St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant by being subject to
higher powers, to be subject to him who is invested
with the Power. Doth not he term them <hi>v. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>God did fore-see by his eternal Omniscience how
apt man was to coin Distinctions to deceive himself,
and to wrong Gods Ordinance, that mercifully to us,
he hath expressed in Scripture, that both Sovereignty
and the person cloathed with Sovereignty, are of him,
by him, and from him immediately; and this, that
both the one and the other may be reverenced by us
as sacred and inviolable. The Apostle speaketh <hi>in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracto,
Be subject to the Higher Powers: The Powers that

the Spirit of God by <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>In concreto,</hi> with

            <argument>
               <p>The same Truth is proved by more Arguments
from Holy Scripture.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Scripture hath not delivered any truth
<hi>more purposely, more apertly, more frequently</hi>
than this. The Spirit of God knew well,
that if the Sacred Sovereignty of Kings be not preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Religion, Justice, and Peace cannot be maintained.
This is the reason St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to perswade us to pray
for Kings, <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
in all godliness and honesty, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. It is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 8. speaketh first of the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of Government, before he speaks of the
Works of Creation: to intimate, it is better not to
be at all, than to be without Government. For the
same reason God fixed Government in the Person of
<hi>Adam,</hi> before <hi>Evah</hi> or any else came into the World;
and how Government shall be, and we enjoy the
happy fruits of it, it is not conceivable, except we
preserve to the King his Sacred Sovereignty inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
This, I say, made God in Scripture <hi>non obiter,
raro, &amp; accidenter,</hi> not in a passing way, occasionally,
or rarely, or accidentally, to command this Duty of
Loyalty and Obedience to Kings, Sacred in their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
in their Persons. Almighty God hath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
this Duty in holy Writ, kept the same
course, he kept in setting down Essentials and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Faith and Worship. If any be pleased
to be at the pains to observe it, I doubt if they will
find any thing so peremptorily and frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and with so much reason urged. The Lord
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33502:41"/>
knew how averse corrupt man is to give to the Lords
Anointed his due; without the special Grace of God,
or an over-ruling strong Providence People cannot
be kept in Subjection. <hi>David</hi> magnifieth it, as one
of the highest and most powerful of Gods blessings
towards him, that he delivered him from the strivings
of his People: <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 43. and as ingenuously he
acknowledgeth, that it is God alone who subdueth
his People under him: <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 2. God account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Rebellion against them Rebellion against himself:
and ordinarily in Scripture you have God and the
King inseparably joyned, and the Duties to both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 17. Fear God, Honour the King.</hi> Prov.
24. 21. <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and
meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> This is
purposely done, not onely to intimate the greatness
of the Sin of Disobedience, Disloyalty, and Rebellion,
but also to express the near Alliance Kings have with
God; and the strait conjunction betwixt them and
God, that nothing intervenes to divide or sever them,
<hi>which God hath put together let none put asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have proved that God in the Law hath reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to himself, as his own right, the Constitution of
Kings: We have proved sufficiently that this was not
a priviledged case of Gods People under the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Solomon</hi> indefinitely, and consequently univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
averreth, That all Kings reign by God in Christ.
Because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath delivered the same truth,
That there is no Supreme Power but from God
alone, and so from him alone, that he admitteth no
Corrival to share with him. Thus you have three
Arguments for our purpose. We come now to the
fourth:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:33502:41"/>
Which is this: Scripture right down teacheth us,
that all Kings whatsoever have their Free-hold from
Almighty God alone. Of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> it
is said, <hi>Exod. 9. 7. I have raised thee up. Elisha</hi>
from God designed, anointed and constituted <hi>Hazael</hi>
King over <hi>Syria, 2 King.</hi> 8. 13. Here you see that the
Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> are no less of Gods making
than the Kings of <hi>Israel.</hi> Are not <hi>Pharaoh, Abimelech,
Hiram, Hazael, Hadad,</hi> no less honoured with the
compellation of Kings, than <hi>David, Saul,</hi> or <hi>Ezekiah?</hi>
Be they what they will, Gods creatures they are, and of
his making onely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 9. God doth honour <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> by
naming him his servant: His servant, conceive it
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by way of excellency: The same compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
it is, which God giveth to <hi>David,</hi> a King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own heart. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar the King of

            </p>
            <p>If what we have said cannot suffice, let them turn
over to <hi>Isai. 45. 1, 2. Thus saith the Lord to his Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
'to</hi> Cyrus, <hi>whose right hand I have holden, to subdue
Nations before him; and I will loose the loyns of Kings,
to open before him the two leaved gates, and the gates shall
not be shut, I will go before thee, and will make the crooked
places strait, I will break in pieces the gates of brass,

the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

How much might be said, if we pleased to insist to
prove our point? But leaving this, I come to our fifth
Argument, which is,</p>
            <p>That in the Book of God we are told, <hi>Dominus dat
&amp; aufert regna:</hi> that there be no Kingdom but of his
giving, no Kings but of his making, no King unking'd
but by his doing. We ended our last Argument with
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> we begun the proof of this with him too.

I despair of doing it. I know they will tell me, it is

shift, that serveth them in many cases; if they would
consider it aright, they might see how careful God
has been by extraordinary Works and Manifestations,
and reiterated Precepts and Practices ordinary, to
right their extravagant and extraordinary Tenets and
Humours. If they can be satisfied, we refer them to

When God had revealed to <hi>Daniel Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s
Dream, with the Interpretation of it, he thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God, and saith, <hi>vers. 20. Blessed be the Name of
God for ever and ever, for Wisdom and Might are his. vers.
21. And he changeth the times and the seasons: he
removeth Kings, and setteth up Kings.</hi> Again, vers. 37.
He saith, <hi>Thou, O King, art a King of Kings, for the
God of Heaven hath given thee a Kingdom, Power,
Strength and Glory.</hi> vers. 20. and 21. He ascribeth
the setting up and removing of Kings, no less to God,
than Wisdom infinite, and Omnipotency, which are
Divine Attributes incommunicable. And <hi>vers.</hi> 37. He
vindicates this as proper and peculiar to the God of
Heaven, that Earth and earthly men can have no
part in it. <hi>Daniel in whom was the spirit of the holy
Gods, Daniel whom no secrets troubled, Daniel in whom
was wisdom like the wisdom of Gods,</hi> reached not this
high point, to know that in the People was an <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
Majesty</hi> to be derived to Kings in what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they please, by a fiduciary trust. View the fourth
Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy, and there you will find
it in four-squared Letters; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> for a time
is un-kinged: how, I pray you? <hi>By the Watcher, by
the Holy One, one sent by him from Heaven, commanded
by him to hew down the tree, to cut off his branches,
shake off his leaves, scatter his fruit,</hi> vers. 13. 14. And
to what purpose is this? That <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and
all living may know, that the <hi>most High ruleth</hi> in the
Kingdom of men, <hi>and giveth it to whomsoever he will,
and setteth up over it the basest of men, vers.</hi> 17.
All this is the <hi>Decree of the most High. vers. 24. And
Nebuchadnezzar was driven from men, to live and eat
with beasts, till he should know that the most High ruleth
in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33502:43"/>
will,</hi> vers. 25. It was told to the proud King, swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Pride in his Palace, that <hi>the Kingdom was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from him, the Messenger was a Voice from Heaven,
vers.</hi> 31. After his Repentance, and acknowledging
this Truth, that <hi>Dominus dat &amp; aufert regna;</hi> that
God giveth and taketh away Kingdoms, his Kingdom
was established unto him, his Counsellors and Lords
sought unto him, and excellent Majesty was added
unto him. Whosoever is not over-ruled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Errour, and readeth and considereth these Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
aright, must confess the Truth we maintain. God
open our eyes to see it, and give us hearts to believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that Loyalty &amp; Royalty may have their Place and Right!</p>
            <p>The same Truth is delivered to us again <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 5. A
hand from Heaven, (a miracle it is to confirm this
Truth) writeth upon the Plaster of the Wall, that
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> the King and his Nobles may inquire after
it. That <hi>God had taken the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>own from him.</hi> He did
not acknowledge, that he did hold his Crown of the
King of Heaven; to this Ingratitude, he added Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and prophaned the Golden and Silver Vessels
of the Temple. For these sins his Crown was taken
from him. So horrible a Sin is Sacriledge, and in
Kings especially, that it will throw them into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
cast their Crowns into the dust, and bring
greater Judgments in the world to come if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not. Nor can this Repentance be sound and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
without Restitution. Here that rule of the Holy
Father holds good, <hi>Non dimittetur peccatum ni restitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ablatum. Daniel</hi> reading and interpreting this
miraculous Writ, recalleth to <hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s Memory
Gods dealing with his Father, v. 18. <hi>O thou King, the
most high God gave</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>thy Father a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Majesty, and Glory, and Honour,</hi> (what more
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33502:43"/>
can any conceive in a King, than is here expressed?)
And for the Majesty he gave him <hi>&amp;c.</hi> v. 19. (mark it
well, it is not said, that the People gave it) he swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Pride, was unkinged for a time, till he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that the most high God ruleth in the Kingdom
of men, and that he appointed over it whomsoever
he will. <hi>v.</hi> 21. After this <hi>Daniel</hi> bringeth home his
Application to <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> prudently checking him,
that he had not made right use of that befell before his
Father, but had trode in the same way of Pride, and
added to his Fathers Sin the prophaning of Sacred
things, that for this cause he and his are extirpated
Root and Branch. The writing was <hi>Mene, Mene,
Tekel, Vpharsin.</hi> The Sense is, he was found Light
in Gods-Ballance, his Kingdom was numbred and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and divided or given to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
Who in executing this Vengeance against an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
and sacrilegious King, were nothing else, but
the Instruments, the Axe and Rod of God, as you
may read, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 45. and 44. 28. and <hi>Ier. 51. 11.
Isaiah</hi> 13. 17.</p>
            <p>In the Passages adduced consider: First, who is the
Author? (I mean not the Principal, for without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
it is the holy Spirit) <hi>Daniel</hi> a man eminent
and excellent in Court, Credit and Preferment. But
this is not so considerable, consider him therefore as
one of the Prophets, of most rare Endowments, for
Wisdom and extraordinary Revelations. Secondly,
Next reflect your Thoughts a little, how this Truth
is manifested. It is from Heaven, but how I pray
you? <hi>By Dreams; By Voice; by a crying Voice; by
Writ;</hi> from whom? <hi>from the most high God: from the
holy one: from the Watcher: from the God of Heaven:</hi>
to whom? To <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the Emperour of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33502:44"/>
               <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> to <hi>Belshazzar</hi> his Son; and
all the way miraculous. The Dream is forgotten, to
<hi>Daniel</hi> it is miraculously revealed, with no less won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
interpreted: It is written miraculously, Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and read as wonderfully: and all this in the wise
Dispensation of God, that Kings and all may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that Kings and Kingdoms are of God. Before
this Truth be not known to Kings and all, he will
reveal it extraordinarily, miraculously, by Dreams, by
Voices, by Cries, by Writings from Heaven; and that
all may take notice of it, the Dream is forgotten,
Magicians are sought to; because they cannot find it
out, Death is decreed against them, yet God will not
have it to go unknown, to his Servant he reveals it,
all the Empire take notice of it, all admire it. To
confirm it yet more, the King must live like a Beast,
till he believe, he confess, he profess this Truth;
This Truth is not once spoken, but twice, it is seen,
it is heard: The <hi>Babylonians</hi> had forgotten it; <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
had slighted it, neglected it. When he, his
Counsellors, his Lords are feasting, carrowsing, a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from Heaven writes it, None can read it, <hi>Daniel,</hi>
is sought, he reads it, interprets it, that all may take
Notice of it. The Father for not acknowledging this
Truth, but sacrificing to himself, of a King is made a
Beast, but Repentance restores him. The Son hath
harder measure, He is dethroned, rooted out for ever.
And a way is made; that <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his succeeding to
the Empire, may acknowledge that his Kingdom was
of God, which he did truly, as we told before. Where
can you shew any Truth of this kind, in Scripture so
revealed, so manifested, by such miraculous, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and admirable ways? I think it is hard to
hit upon a parallel to it. God knew well before,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33502:44"/>
How apt we are to rob Kings of their due Right and
Honour, nay, rather how prone, corrupt man is to
intrude upon God and invade his Right.</p>
            <p>If any will be pleased to consider seriously <hi>Daniel</hi>'s
Prophecies, What are they but Predictions that all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
Kingdoms, Majesty, Royalty and Sovereignty
are of Gods immediate Donation? They are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of by the composed Contracts of men, but by
the immediate hand and work of God. All Ancients
and Moderns for the most part acknowledge here in
<hi>Daniel</hi> to be the clearest, the most distinct Prophecies,
Predictions, of the four great Empires. If you will
cast your Eyes upon the historical part of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Book
there is no Truth, which is so much treated, spoken
of, as this Truth, as that Kings and Kingdoms are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
from God alone, and Independent from all
others. It may be, because <hi>Daniel</hi> was a great Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he might not
be judged a time-server, a temporizer, a complier to
vindicate him from Court-flattery, God did so many
ways, so miraculous ways demonstrate this Truth,
confirm this Truth, that Sovereignty, Royal Majesty,
come from Heaven, from God immediately.</p>
            <p>What Prophet almost hath not a hint, an Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this? <hi>Isay</hi> is plentiful in this; as you may see,
in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> in <hi>Cyrus &amp;c.</hi> and all Neighbour
Princes: <hi>Ieremy</hi> taught it to the <hi>Iews</hi> to his own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.
The Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> or rather God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the Prophet with one Breath, in one Verse,
in few words, with a <hi>dedi,</hi> and an <hi>abstuli,</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
hath confirmed this Doctrine. <hi>c. 13. 11. I
gave them a King in my Anger, and took him away in my
Wrath. I gave him, I took him away;</hi> what can you
require more? I pray give me Leave to observe one
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33502:45"/>
thing in the words, besides our main purpose for
which we cited it. He saith, <hi>dedi eis regem in ira mea:</hi>
I gave them a King in my Anger; This King in the
judgment of some was <hi>Saul:</hi> according to the mind
of others, this King was <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> it skilleth not
whether the one or the other. Both of them were
wicked. Yet it is said, <hi>Dedi,</hi> I gave him, and as I
gave him, so <hi>abstuli;</hi> I took him away: None giveth
but He, None can take away but He. God will admit
none to do either the one or the other but himself.
It is observable too, that in giving a bad King, it is
only said <hi>in ira mea,</hi> I gave him in my Anger; but in
taking away a bad King, it is said, <hi>abstuli in furore meo,</hi>
I took him away in my wrath: what difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>ira</hi> and <hi>furor,</hi> anger and wrath, all do know.
What doth this intimate to us then, but, to have a
bad King is a chastisement <hi>Irati Dei,</hi> of an angry
God, who is placable; But to have no King at all, it
is a work of Vengeance, a token a prognostick of an
Implacable God, at least hardly placable.</p>
            <p>If you account <hi>Iob</hi> for a Prophet, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it
skilleth not much which way you term him. He saith,
<hi>Reges collocat in solio, in perpetuum;</hi> and again, <hi>Balthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
regum dissolvit:</hi> the places you have cited before.
What he speaketh for Sovereignty, you shall hear,
qq. 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. For <hi>Solomon</hi> his Suffrage you had before.
What he saith of the heart of Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
Kings, you shall hear it in its proper place,
That a King, there is no rising up against him: what
in the Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> he speaketh of his absolute
Sovereignty, you shall find it in its proper place.
E're long, you shall by Gods grace hear <hi>David</hi> speak for
himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:33502:45"/>
And because we said before, that no truth almost
in Scripture is more apertly and frequently delivered,
than the Sovereignty of Kings, their creation by God
immediately, the Historical part is plentiful in this
kind. In <hi>Genesis,</hi> it is promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that
Kings shall come of him. There it is fixed by Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> with <hi>Iudiciaria</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislativa
potestas,</hi> with the Scepter and Law-giver. In
the Law it is fore-told, his Duty is prescribed. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
dying, prayeth for one onely to rule the People
after his death. In <hi>Iehoshuah</hi> his Book, you have as
compleat as absolute a Monarch as we plead for, as by
express Scripture, in its own place, we shall clear by
Gods grace. In the Book of <hi>Iudges,</hi> the <hi>Sophetim,</hi> the
Judges are Monarchs, and not once, but oftener there
it is told us, that all Evil was in the Land for want
of a King. In the Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> you have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Institutions of Kings, but <hi>Ius Regum</hi> expressed.
To name the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
In the Books of <hi>Ezra, &amp;c.</hi> Look upon <hi>Cyrus,
Darius,</hi> &amp;c. As for the New Testament, See how
Christ taught it, practised it, and his Apostles after
him: to point at this is not necessary. If our <hi>strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced</hi>
Brethren would be pleased to cast an eye upon
<hi>Apocrypha,</hi> I refer them to <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> cap. 6. 1,
2, &amp;c. <hi>Hear ye Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Give ear, you that rule the
People, and glory in the multitude of Nations, for Power
is given you of the Lord, and Sovereignty from the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi>
&amp;c. Yet fearing this Passage will not be current
enough among our Sectaries, I point at two passages
of <hi>David,</hi> till we hear him speak more fully: The
one is, <hi>Psal. 21. 3. Thou settest a Crown of pure Gold
upon his head.</hi> The other is, <hi>Psal. 84. 44. Thou hast
made his Glory to cease, and cast his Throne down to the
ground.</hi>

me, how any man that readeth the Scripture atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
doth not heartily, and without scruple ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that Kings and Sovereignty are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from all, and onely derived from God; and that
this truth is not onely verified of the Kings of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> but all Kings whatsoever. Which truth, we

to add more reasons, and to remove some more

            <argument>
               <p>That Kings are onely dependent from God, and
not from the Community, is more proved by
Scripture. The poor shifts of Suarez and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine

Ergo,</hi> say they, the Constitution is the Peoples, the
Election of the Person is Gods. It is a lame Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
for the words <hi>Constitues super te,</hi> Thou shalt
set over thee, are not to be understood of Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by collating, or transferring from them to the
King, Majesty and Sovereignty: but of Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
by way of Approbation, or of accepting of
him as King, acknowledging him as a King, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
and obeying him as King, whom God
hath both designed and constituted by himself
King. In this Sense, we grant a <hi>Constitues super te,</hi> a
setting over thee: and because this is the last act in
constituting a King, that puts that <hi>in fieri in facto esse,
quasi ultima dispositio inducens formam,</hi> as the last Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which induceth the form in the matter, by a
synecdochical and tropical Speech it is so usually spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Nor is it unusual to the Spirit of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to speak this way, for it is said, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. The
Saints judge the World:</hi> Now it is certain, that the
Judgment of the Saints is only by approving or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to Christs Judgment, which is his only <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

properly; and their act in that great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the last day, is only to approve or consent ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the righteous Judgment of their Lord: yet
Scripture standeth not to say, <hi>The Saints shall judge the
World.</hi> To judge by Authority is only proper to God
the Father, by the Son, to whom the Father hath
given all Judgment; and this leaveth no place, no
Power to the Saints to dissent. The like holdeth in
the Instance proposed.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:33502:47"/>
That this is to be conceived so (which is our sixth
Argument, to confirm that Kings and their Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

that Almighty God in Scripture vindicateth to himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the Acts, real and imaginable, which are necessary

the Letter of the Law, it is an infallible Maxim with
Jurists, <hi>Praxis optimus Legis interpres,</hi> Practice is the
best Commentary of Law: and it is no less a ruled

in that kind. Come then, take the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in <hi>Saul,</hi> the first elected and constituted King
by the Tenor of this Law. In the practice the Phrase
is varied and turned over, the Election is given to
the People, the Constitution to God: 1 <hi>Sam. 12. 13.
Behold the King</hi> (saith <hi>Samuel) whom you have chosen
and desired, and behold the Lord hath set a King over you.</hi>
This Election of the People can be no other but their
Admittance or Acceptance of the King, whom God
had chosen and constituted; as the words, <hi>Whom you
have desired,</hi> imply. Scripture telleth us, that <hi>Saul</hi>'s
Election and Constitution was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 17. when
God said to <hi>Samuel, Behold the man whom I spake to
thee of, the same shall reign over my people;</hi> and when
<hi>Samuel</hi> took a Viol of Oyl, powred it upon his head,
kissed him, and said, <hi>Is it not because the Lord hath
anointed thee to be Captain over his Inheritance? 1. Sam.
10.</hi> 1. Where you have <hi>Samuel</hi> as Priest and Prophet
anointing, doing Reverence and Obeisance to him,
and ascribing to God that he did appoint him Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and Sovereign over his Inheritance. The same
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33502:47"/>
again is totally given to God, 1 <hi>Sam, 12. 13. The
Lord hath set a King over you.</hi> The Expression and
Phrase is the same with that you have of Christ and
his Kingdom, <hi>Psal. 2. 6. I have set my King upon my
holy Hill of Sion.</hi> I am confident none will be so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiously
impudent, as to give to Church, to man
or Angel, Creature or Creatures, any share in any act
of constituting Christ King over his Church, and for
his Church, and in order to it, over all the Kingdoms
of the World.</p>
            <p>By what is said of this first practice it is more than
evident, that God in that Law of making Kings <hi>Deut.
17.</hi> did vindicate as proper and peculiar to himself, the
Designation of the person of the King, and the invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him in royal Power and Sovereignty. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
then were only to admit and accept of their King
by God so designed and constituted, and to yield all
Reverence, Obedience, and maintenance necessary.
It was not arbitrary to them to admit or reject <hi>Saul</hi>
so designed, so constituted by God himself immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
reject him they could not. Yet God in his wise
prudent Dispensation of all things, judged it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to complete and consummmate this Work by the
Acceptation, Consent, and Approbation of the people,
<hi>Vt suaviori modo,</hi> that by the smoother way he might
thus encourage <hi>Saul</hi> to the undergoing of this hard
Charge, and make his People the more heartily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
grumbling or scruple, Reverence and obey him.
As by his Providence he doth all things powerfully,
so he disposeth of all <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for the good of man in
a sweet and mild way. This Admittance possibly add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
something to the Solemnity of <hi>Saul</hi>'s investing, but
nothing to the essential or real Constitution: as the
<hi>Intimation</hi> of a Law, (which in Laws I think hath more
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33502:48"/>
Interest than this Admittance here) it hath no Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon a Law made by supreme Power, yet it is
useful, it Puts the Subjects <hi>in mala fide,</hi> makes them
inexcusable if they contravene. Or this Admittance
was and is as the Imperialists say, truly of the Popes
Confirmation of the elected Emperour, good <hi>ad pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam,</hi>
but not requisite <hi>ad necessitatem.</hi> Or if you will
speak with the <hi>Romanists,</hi> that the confirmation is of
the Pope once elected, is <hi>ad solennitatem,</hi> not <hi>ad neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitatem,</hi>
for the Solemnity, not simply necessary. Or
to come more near and with more certainty and truth;
it is like the Coronation of an hereditary King, which
is only for solemnity, not for Necessity: for before
that Ceremony and Solemnity his Title is as good as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it; and any act of royal Power and Jurisdiction
done before his Coronation is as valid as any done as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Coronation. Or if you will, it is like the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronization
of a Bishop, or installing of a Canon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prebend in a Cathedral Church.</p>
            <p>Scripture maketh this Good plentifully elsewhere; for
it punctually ascribeth all <hi>Acts, essentially constitutive</hi> of
Kings, immediately to God. In one full word, <hi>the
making of a King</hi> is given to God, 1 <hi>Kings 3. 7. And
now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy Servant King
instead of David my Father. The providing of a King</hi> is
given to God, 1 <hi>Sam. 16. 1. I have provided me a
King.</hi> The King in a proper and peculiar way is called
<hi>Gods King, Psal. 18. 50. Great deliverance giveth he to his
King. God exalteth them, Psal. 89. 19. I have exalted one
chosen out of the People.</hi> Not the People, but <hi>God findeth
Kings out, ibid. vers. 20. I have found</hi> David <hi>my Servant.</hi>
Neither Priest, nor Prophet, nor People, really anoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Kings, <hi>God anointeth them, ibid. vers. 20. With mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Oyl have I anointed him.</hi> That we conceive them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33502:48"/>
not to have their Prerogative from Pope or People,
Priest or Prophet, not they but <hi>God adopteth them,
ibid.</hi> vers. 27. <hi>I will make him my first-born, That he
may cry unto him, Thou art my Father, my God, vers.</hi> 26.
To shew their nearer and straiter Alliance, they are
taken in <hi>societatem nominis, numinis, potestatis;</hi> into a
communion of his Majesty, his Name, Power, it is said,
<hi>Psal. 82. 6. I have said, ye are Gods.</hi> To shew their
Generation, their Procreation, their Derivation; there
is a <hi>dixi</hi> to this too, <hi>I have said ye are all of you the
Children of the most High;</hi> not <hi>terrae filii, Cadmus</hi> off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
sprung out of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Kings then are not made, provided, chosen, found,
exalted, anointed, adopted, by Saints, by People, by
Pope, by Presbytery, by any diffusive, collective, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,
virtual Body of the Community; but by
and of God alone: for their Power, their Sovereignty
they are <hi>dii <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Elohim;</hi> the manner of Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Derivation, Communication, is by Filiation, by
Adoption, they are <hi>filii Excelsi,</hi> the Sons of the most
High, and for eminency above all, they are the first
born; this is the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is the Language
of <hi>Ashdod</hi> to say, that a King is <hi>minor universis, singulis
major.</hi> Scripture Reason speak the contrary; <hi>primogenitus,</hi>
the first-born is not above every Brother severally; but
if there were thousands, millions, numberless numbers,
he is above all in Dignity, in Precedency, in Power.
It is statuted by God in the beginning of the World,
that the younger Brother, and Brethren all of them,
<hi>sub te erit appetitus ejus &amp; tu dominaberis illius; Vnto
thee, or subject unto thee, shall be his desire, and thou shalt
rule over him. Gen.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
            <p>To return a little to the Practice of the Law, in
constituting <hi>David</hi> King; you find it was not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33502:49"/>
the collective Body of <hi>Israel,</hi> that found <hi>David,</hi>
chose him, exalted him, anointed him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was
God alone; it was not the Elders of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> his
own City, neither they nor the other knew of it,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 4. Nor were the Saints sharers in this
work with God, they knew nothing of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 19.
Nay, not <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, had it been he, it had
not been King <hi>David</hi> but King <hi>Eliab.</hi> It is worthy
of our labour to take notice, how the anointing of
Kings is wholly attributed to God in Scripture, and
other Kings, besides the Kings of <hi>Iudea,</hi> are called
<hi>The Lords Anointed.</hi> Which is more than evident by
what is before expressed: the phrase of Scripture is
very emphatical; <hi>They are anointed with his holy Oyl:</hi>
the Act is his, <hi>He anoints: The holy Oyl is his,</hi> He
anoints with his Oyl: this Oyl is <hi>sacred</hi> too; it is
not every Oyl, but his Oyl, and his sacred Oyl. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Oyl</hi> it is, which how it can be so denominated,
and come from the People, as its first subject and Seat,
its Origine and Source, is not conceivable in Reason.
<hi>Sacred</hi> it is in three respects. First, from a sacred
Fountain, a sacred Efficient, from God himself.
2. Next, for its sacred Influence upon the Person,
it makes the Person of the King Sacred. 3. For its
influence upon the Charge, the Function, his Power,
his Authority is Sacred too. And both the Person
and the Charge are Supreme, which is most fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
in the Sacramental Ceremony of Oyl, put
Oyl in whatsoever Liquor you will it swimmeth above
in the surface.</p>
            <p>Now all this is so intirely and solely given to God,
that neither Priest nor People, Pope nor Presbytery
have any part in it, <hi>Psal. 89. 20. With mine holy Oyl
have I anointed him.</hi> God finds the Oyl and the hand
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33502:49"/>
to do it. You will say, <hi>Samuel</hi>'s hand did it. The
Principle of the Law will take away this Scruple;
<hi>Quod quis facit per alium, facit per se:</hi> What one
doth by another, he doth that by himself. <hi>Samuel</hi>
was onely the Delegate, God was the Principal
and Delegant; and in reason the Act must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Principal. The Oyl was God's too,
not from the Apothecaries shop, nor the Priest's Vial,
this Oyl descended from the Holy Ghost, who is no
less the <hi>true Olive</hi> than Christ is the <hi>true Vine.</hi> Yet I
pray you mistake it not, to account it of the holy Oyl
of <hi>Gratia gratum faciens, Saving Grace,</hi> as some Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Fantasticks fondly imagine: this is a sacred
Oyl, to make the Person and Function Sacred, as
we have said.</p>
            <p>Our seventh Argument to prove that <hi>Sovereignty in
a King is immediately from God,</hi> and not from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive,
collective, representative, or virtual Body of
the Community, is that all <hi>Royal Ensigns and Acts</hi>
of Kings are ascribed to God. If Kings were the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivatives
of the People and Community, in whom is
that fansied, underived Majesty? how comes it to
pass that the holy Spirit hath not in any place or syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
of Scripture intimated it? and how cometh it
to pass, that in such a particular way and enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all are given to God? 1. <hi>Their Crown is of God,</hi>
by putting it on their head. <hi>Isai 62. 3. The Royal Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
is in the hand of the Lord.</hi> Psal. 21. 3. <hi>Thou puttest
a Crown of pure Gold upon his head.</hi> Hence it was that
the Emperour's Coin of old was printed with an
hand coming out of Heaven, and putting it on their
head. The very Heathen did term them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as
having and holding their Crowns from God: Their
Sword is God's, and he girdeth them with it. <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:33502:50"/>
Professeth so much, <hi>Psal. 18. 39. For thou hast girded
me with strength</hi> (the Sword is the Emblem of strength)
<hi>unto the Battel.</hi> See <hi>Iudges 7. 17. 3. Their Scepter is
the Scepter of God, Exod.</hi> 4. 20. and 17. 9. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word <hi>Sebet</hi> signifieth no less Scepter than Rod.
It is a miraculous one too: We read onely of two
miraculous Rods, <hi>Moses</hi>'s and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s. By <hi>Moses</hi>'s rod
what wonders were wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and what a
Miracle was it that the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> budded, and
none else of the twelve Tribes? and for what purpose
was it that God made both the one and the other
miraculous? Was it not to manifest to the World,
that the Sovereign Power of a King, as <hi>Moses</hi> was King
of <hi>Ieshurun,</hi> and high Sacred Power of the High
Priest, and the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> were not by Derivation,
by Translation, by Communication from the People,
but immediately, independently from God himself?
He is well nigh out of his Wits, that will make any
thing miraculous the Work and Effect of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
4. <hi>Their judgment is the judgment of the Lord,
2 Chron.</hi> 19. 6. Again, 5. <hi>Their Throne is the Throne of
God, 1 Chron.</hi> 19. 21.</p>
            <p>The ancient Fathers and Councels used the same
diction; they called 1. Their Writings, <hi>sacri apices.</hi>
2. Their Presence, <hi>sacra vestigia.</hi> 3. Their Majesty,
<hi>sacra Majestas.</hi> 4. Their Words, their Commands,
<hi>divalis jussio.</hi> The Law speaketh the same Language;
and whatsoever goods belonged to them, they are
called <hi>res sacrae.</hi> See <hi>Brissonius</hi> his <hi>Lexicon lib.</hi> 7. in the
<hi>Sacras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being that in Holy Scripture, in reverend Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in the Law, all their Ensigns, all their Royal
Acts, their Persons, their Right, their Goods, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated
Sacred, and given to God himself: how
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33502:50"/>
can our new Statists, against the expressions of the
Holy Spirit, of the Holy Fathers, and of Jurists, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Kings no better, but to call them Derivatives of
the People? Is this to ennoble them? No truly, it
disgraces Kings, it maketh them the basest Extract of
the basest of Rational Creatures, the Multitude, the
Community. It is certainly untrue, if it be not
blasphemous against God and the King, to fix, as in
its first seat and receptacle, <hi>an underived Majesty</hi> in the
Community, where there is not one of a thousand an
intelligent and knowing man. It is certainly high
Treason against God and the King.</p>
            <p>A world of Reasons to prove that Kings are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
from all, and solely dependent from God,
may be brought from Scripture; but because we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
brevity, and haste to other things, we point at
some few to be considered and enlarged by the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader himself.</p>
            <p>As first, to whom can it be more proper to give
the Rule over men, than to him who is the onely
King truly and properly of the whole World?</p>
            <p>2. Next, God is the immediate Author of all Rule
and Power that is amongst all his Creatures above or
below, why then should we seclude him from being
the immediate Author of Government of Empire
amongst men.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Man in the state of Innocency, in his
first Creation received Dominion and Empire over all
the Creatures below, <hi>Gen. 1. 28. Replenish the Earth,
and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the Sea,
and over the Fowl of the air, and over every living thing
that moveth upon the Earth.</hi> Again, after the Fall,
<hi>Gen. 9. 2. The fear of you, and the dread of you shall be
upon every Beast of the Earth, and upon every Fowl of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33502:51"/>
Air, upon all that moveth upon the Earth, and upon all
the Fishes of the Sea, into your hand are they delivered.</hi>
Can we be so stupid, as to acknowledge the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over all the Creatures below, is given to man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God, and to deny that the most noble
and excellent Government, by which man hath Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Empire over men is not from God, by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and Constitution, but by the Compact
and Contract, the Composition and Constitution of
men?</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, To demonstrate their immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
from God: that their Power is immediately
from him, is more than apparent by this reason.
They who exercise the Judgment of God, must needs
have their Power to judge from God: But so it is
that Kings by themselves and their Deputies exercise
the Judgments of God. The Proposition is sure, and
is both confirmed and illustrated by considering how
that Church-men are rightly said to have received
their Ministerial Power from God and Christ, because
God by them reconciles the World to himself, and
saves mankind, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17, 18, 19, 20. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 16.
How is it imaginable that they can be said to judge
in God's place, and not receive the Power from God?
The assumption is as evident by express words of
Scripture; see <hi>Deut. 1. 17. 2 Chron.</hi> 19. 6. Let no
man stumble at this, that <hi>Moses</hi> in the one place, and
<hi>Iosaphat</hi> in the other, speak to subordinate Judges un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them; this weakeneth no wayes our Argument,
for it is a ruled Case in Law, <hi>Quod quis fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cit per alium,
faci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> per se;</hi> all Judgments of inferiour Judges are in
the Name, Authority, and by the Power of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme;
and are but communicatively and derivatively
from the Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:33502:51"/>
5. Fifthly, Not onely their Power is of God, their
<hi>Iudiciaria potestas,</hi> but the very Execution of it. They
are the Ministers of God in the execution of their
Charge and Power; <hi>ergo,</hi> their Charge and Power
is immediately from God. All the testimonies of
Scripture wherein they are called Gods confirm the
Antecedent, and especially those where the Supreme
Governour is called, the Servant, the Minister, the
Angel, the Publick Servant of God: Doth not this
Argument hold in the Ministry? Doctors and
Preachers of the Church discharging their Charge are
called the Ambassadours, the Legates, the Ministers of
God; and from hence we conclude necessarily, that
the Ministry is from God and Christ. The Apostle
Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6. calleth the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
thrice, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly
expresseth, that the King in the execution of
his Charge is doing Service to God, <hi>vers. 4. He is the
Minister of God to thee for good.</hi> But if thou do that
which is evil, <hi>be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in
vain.</hi> Again, <hi>He is the Minister of God, a Revenger to
execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> Again, <hi>vers. 6.
For they are Gods Ministers, attending continually upon
this very thing.</hi> The Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is well ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>attending continually,</hi> and is in its nature Active,
and so looketh to the execution of his Charge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.
In the Book of <hi>Wisd. cap.</hi> 6. 5. The Author
attributeth to God <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to Kings and Rulers, the
Ministery onely; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
There can be no Argument better to prove, that both
their Sovereign Power and execution of it is from
God, than that properly and primarily God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is King, and all Kings related to him are onely
equivocally so; for he is <hi>Rex regum, &amp; Dominus domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantium,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33502:52"/>
1 Tim. 6. 15. Revel. 1. 5. &amp; 21. 27. &amp; 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
20. &amp;</hi> 17. 14. He is King of Kings, and Lords of
Lords, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, truly so; Kings upon Earth,
are only such, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, more in Resemblance than
Reality, and betwixt the one and the other, the Kings
of Heaven, and Kings on Earth, no more proportion
than is betwixt Heaven and Earth, a thing finite and
infinite: For this cause Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 41. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no better of Kings and Princes on Earth, than
that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not so much truly men
that have Empire and Rule, as such that appear to be
so; from whence then shall we derive Sovereignty and
Royalty but from that true Royalty and Sovereignty
in God alone.</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, the Power and Grace by which they
are inabled for so high a Charge and Employment is
only from Almighty God, then by necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
the Charge must be solely and only from him.
The Connexion is natural, for in right Reason, to
whom can it be due to give a Charge of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
properly, but only to him who is able to
give the Endowments, and <hi>hability</hi> for that Charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now that the Endowment is from God immediately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the sacramental Ceremony of anointing sheweth it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that exactly they are called the <hi>Lords Anointed.</hi>
We need not use symbolical Arguments, seeing the
Schools allow them no convincing force, the Holy
Spirit hath given it to us in plain and natural Terms
right down. Of <hi>Ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>niel</hi> the first Judge after <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
it is said, <hi>Iudges 3. 10. And the Spirit of the Lord
came upon him, and he judged Israel.</hi> The like you have
spoken of <hi>Saul,</hi> after that he was anointed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
King of <hi>Israel, 1 Sam. 10. &amp;</hi> 11. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
The same is said of <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 17. Very
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33502:52"/>
knowing men in Divinity interpret the Passage <hi>Prov.
20. 12. The hearing Ear, and the seeing Eye, the Lord
hath made even both of them:</hi> that the Facility to rule
well, and the Grace to obey Rulers, both of them are
of God immediately: by the hearing Ear understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the actual Obedience of the Subject; and by the
seeing eye, the actual Government and Empire of the
Sovereign: the interpretation is according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of sacred and divine Truth. If any be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to hold it is not the native Sense of the Text, we
will not contest or contend unnecessarily, seeing we
have plain places to the same Purpose. <hi>David</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and acknowledgeth, that the Subjection of his
People to him, was the immediate Work of God,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 2. The like see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 26. when <hi>Saul</hi>
was constituted King, some despised him, but those
<hi>whose hearts God had touched,</hi> followed and reverenced
him.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, where Sovereign power is, as in
Kings, there is <hi>Authority</hi> and Majesty, a ray of divine
Glory. But this cannot be found in people, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the subject of it, whether you consider them
<hi>joyntly</hi> or <hi>singly.</hi> If you consider them <hi>singly,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, for this is not to be found in every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
and according to our Antimonarchical Sectaries,
all by native Right are equally equal born with a like
Freedom. If it be not in the People considered <hi>singly,</hi>
it cannot be derived from them, being considered
<hi>joyntly,</hi> for all the Contribution in this compact and
Contract which they fancie to be humane Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and voluntary Constitution, is only by a Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the native Right, every individual hath in
himself, from whence then can this Majesty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
be derived? Again, where the Obligation is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33502:53"/>
amongst equals by Compact and Contract, Violation
of the Faith plighted in the Contract cannot in proper
Terms be called Disobedience or Contempt of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
it is no more but a receding from, and Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that which was promised, as it may be in States
or Cantons confederate. Nature, Reason, Conscience;
Scripture teach, that Disobedience to sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not only Violation of Truth, Breach of Covenant,
but also high Disobedience and Contempt. That this
Authority is in Princes, it is evident by sense, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
by Scripture, by the Confession of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
The passage we did alledge before proveth this,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 26. To that Passage, add that <hi>cap.</hi> 11.
that when <hi>Saul</hi> hewed a Yoke of Oxen in pieces, and
intimated, that whosoever came not forth after him,
so it should be done as to his Oxen: such was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that the Text saith, <hi>The Fear of the Lord fell
on the People, and they came out with one Consent, 1 Sam.
11.</hi> 7. This is well expressed by <hi>Iob, cap. 12. vers.
18. He looseth the Bond of Kings, and girdeth their Loins
with a Girdle:</hi> By the first Expression, <hi>He looseth the
Bond of Kings, Iob</hi> meaneth, that when God is to
cast off Kings, and to throw their Honour in the dust,
He looseth their Authority, and bringeth them and it
in Contempt. By the other Phrase, <hi>and girdeth their
Loyns with a Girdle, Iob</hi> intimateth, that when he is
to preserve Kings and their Rights, that he strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them with Authority, and maketh people reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
them. That this is the meaning, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it by what he saith, <hi>v. 21. He poureth Contempt
upon Princes, and weakneth the Strength of the Mighty.</hi>
By this Authority and Majesty <hi>Solomon</hi> invested in
Royalty, dissipated <hi>Adonijah</hi> and all his treacherous
Complices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:33502:53"/>
The Heathen have observed, that in Princes there
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, something divine, above the reach of man,
which cannot be derived from them. If we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
prophane Story, this Majesty was so eminent in
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that it was a Terrour to his
Enemies, a Power strong enough to compose seditious
Counsels and Attempts, a powerful Load-stone to
draw the Counsels of his most experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
to imbrace and obey his Counsels, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Some Stories write, that this Majesty was
resplendent upon great Exigents in the Eyes of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
What was that which kept <hi>Pharaoh</hi> from lifting up
his hand against <hi>Moses,</hi> who charged him so boldly
with his Sins, denounced and brought so terrible, so
great Plagues upon him? What was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I pray you,
but this Authority and Majesty resplendent in him,
which was a curb to the Tyranny of his Malice and
Power? When <hi>Moses</hi> did speak face to face with <hi>God</hi>
in the Mount, and when he came down that his Face
shined, so that the People could not behold it till it
was covered with a Veil, what else was it but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solendent
Glory of Majesty? <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. What else
was it that repressed the Fury of the People enraged
against <hi>Gideon</hi> for destroying their Idol, but this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty?
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. And as by Gods Ordinance we set
that the Fear and Terrour of man is upon all the
Creatures living below, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. So what else can this
Fear and Reverence which is innate in the Hearts of
all Subjects towards their Sovereigns be, but the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
unrepealable of God, and the natural Effect
of that Majesty in Princes, with which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
from above.</p>
            <p>8. Eighthly, this seemeth or rather is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unanswerable to prove sovereign Power to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently

the Life of man.</hi> In which words clearly it is told, the
Right is Gods primarily properly, thrice in the words
God vindicates it, I will require it, I will require it,
I will require it. Lest any should think that God is to

or <hi>per hominem,</hi> cannot in Grammar be added to
the Subject or Antecedent, <hi>Effundens sanguinem,</hi> but
must belong to the predicate or consequent, <hi>sanguis ejus

<hi>Effundens sanguinem hominis, per hominem sanguis ejus
effundetur:</hi> just as our Bibles english it, <hi>Who so shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
mans Blood, by man shall his Blood be shed.</hi> The
Reason of this, because in the original the accent <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kephkathon,</hi>
which maketh, as the Grammarians say, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisum

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:33502:55"/>
so that <hi>Baadam</hi> is to be joyned to the next: the

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33502:55"/>
v. 52. All they that take the Sword shall perish with the
Sword.</hi> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> telleth us, that the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is veiled in the Old, and <hi>Vetus Testamentum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velatur
in Novo,</hi> and the Old Testament is revealed in
the New. A better Commentary of God's Speeches
and Words we cannot have, than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, than the Son, the Word of God, and that
Word which is God. In Christ's Speech, <hi>shall perish
by the Sword,</hi> in the Phrase and Dialect of Scripture
we can understand nothing else but the Sovereign
Power that beareth the Sword. Let the Apostle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Master: Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
Subjection and Obedience to Superior Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and <hi>v.</hi> 6. He telleth you, <hi>He
beareth not the Sword in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words thus cleared, we sum up our Argument
thus. God onely hath the Power of man's Life. No
man hath Power over his own Life. Whoso taketh
away the Life of man, in God's Justice and Ordinance
his Life is to be taken away again. This principally
and properly belongeth to God, <hi>v. 5. I will require,</hi> &amp;c.
but God hath given this to some Deputies: This Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not given to every one, as the terrour of an ill
Conscience made <hi>Cain</hi> say, <hi>Whosoever findeth me shall
kill me.</hi> This were to destroy mankind, and make
God the God of Disorder and Confusion. Some man
it is then by Distinction and Excellency who is God's
Deputy, and then this can be none else but he in
whom is Sovereign Power, and this Power is from
none else but from God Almighty: And if this power
over Life be from God, why not all Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
seeing it is <hi>homogeneous,</hi> and as <hi>Iurists</hi> say, <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisibili
posita,</hi> a thing indivisible in its nature, that
cannot be distracted, put away, nor impaired; as a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33502:56"/>
Crown, take any part from it, is no more a Crown.
When God gave this Order, the World knew well
enough what this <hi>Baadam, by man</hi> was; neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time, nor at this time, knew the World any
kind of Government but Monarchical: And this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
was <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Ninthly, As their Judiciary and Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>in actu signato,</hi> the Execution and Exercise of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Power <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> is given to God Almighty,
as to its first and proper Origine and Source; so all
the Acts done by Kings are ascribed to God, and we
find them the immediate Instruments by whom God
worketh here the greatest works of Justice, when he
is to punish men, and the greatest works of Mercy
when he is to bless them. That both for the one and
the other, they are called his Servants; His axe, his
rod; and the works they do, to be such as he hath
prepared of old. In the work of Justice, punishing
his People, look upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> See wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
God fore-telleth by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> by <hi>Ieremy:</hi> In the works
of Mercy extraordinary, look upon <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and for
the Actions both of the one and the other, consider
Scripture, and consider if they be not particularly and
immediately given to God in all their parts, their acts
as if they were nothing but dead and lifeless Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
See the places above-cited, which before we
have named, and for brevities sake we now omit.
To this Argument may be added the immediate work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God hath upon their Hearts, their Counsels; that
their heart is in the hand of the Lord, as a Boat in the
Rivers of Waters; how God sendeth them in their
Expeditions, their Wars; maketh them in his day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
his appointed day, to set their face against <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
or otherwise; casteth his hook in their nostrils to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33502:56"/>
bring them back with shame. To this Argument may
be referred, that when God is to bless a People, he
sendeth them good Kings, the Sons of Nobles; when
he is to scourge them, naughty Kings, weak chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Testimonies of Scripture for all these are
infinite, many, and obvious, which we remit to the
Reader's memory, or dilligent search.</p>
            <p>10. Tenthly, Nor is to be passed by, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
immense Majesty of God is expressed by stiling
and denominating him King, and his Supreme glory
is represented by sitting on a glorious Throne. See
<hi>Isaiah,</hi> see <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Prophets. Let us beware
then that we make not God a Derivative too of the
People, and a Creature of mens making.</p>
            <p>11. Eleventhly, In the Scripture we read that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
three kinds of men were anointed, Kings, Priests,
Prophets: Let any give an instance of a fourth besides
those three. It is granted of all, that Priests and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
have Sacred Charges, and are Sacred Perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of
God's immediate making and Constitution; why
then shall not Kings have the same Prerogative, to
be immediately from God, Sacred in themselves, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
in their Charge, by Divine Ordinance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment?</p>
            <p>12. Lastly, To close up this first part of our Proof
from Scripture, it is a strong Reason to perswade So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
Authority, and Majesty to be from God
immediately, and independently from any others, in
what consideration soever, that the irreverence, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
contempt, rebellion, or any wrong what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
offered to their Persons, to their Authority, is
wrong and contempt offered to God himself. See
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. This made <hi>David</hi> say, <hi>Who can touch the
Lords Anointed and be innocent?</hi> This made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33502:57"/>
say, <hi>Rom. 13. 2. Whosoever resisteth the Power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
the Ordinance of God, and they that resist receive to
themselves damnation.</hi> The like Phrase to the first you
have of the Sacred Ministry in the Apostles, 1 <hi>Thess.
4. 8. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man but
God.</hi> When the People murmured against <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron,</hi> in the Law you have, <hi>They murmure not against
you but me.</hi> The like you have in <hi>Samuel.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of all is, That as the Sacred Ministry is by Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
immediately or independently from God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the designation of the Person may be by men
and the Church; so Kings may be personally designed
and deputed to Royalty and Sovereignty, by <hi>Election,
Succession, Conquest,</hi> or any other lawful possible way;
but their Sovereignty and Power is by Donation and
Collation immediately and solely from God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to him as the only Donor and Author. Again, as
the Person and Function of such as are lawfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with Sacred Power, and in Sacred Orders, is
Inviolable and Sacred, so are the Persons and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of Kings.</p>
            <p>Our order proposed in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
chargeth us now to produce our Proofs from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Antiquity. But I must beg leave of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Reader, to discover the weakness and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a new-devised trick of our Sectaries, That the
<hi>King is God's,</hi> but not <hi>Christ's Vicegerent.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>All Christian Kings are dependent from Christ,
and may be called his Vice-gerents.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHereas hitherto by express Scripture, and by
Arguments from thence by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
deduced, we have proved, That
Kings and their Sovereignty are immediately depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from God, and dependent from no other: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it not so, that hereby we seclude Christ, and him
considered, not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> personally, as the
Second Person in the Trinity, but also <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
in his Capacity, as God-man, the Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of the World.</p>
            <p>Our Sectaries have found out a quirk, or trick ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of late, to hold and argue, That <hi>Kings are Gods,
not Christ's Lieutenants upon Earth.</hi> Their purpose is
the same in substance with the <hi>Romanists,</hi> although
they differ in something; for the <hi>Romanists</hi> and <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
both of them erect in every Kingdom another So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
not onely besides the true Sovereign, but also
above. In this they agree, and are like <hi>Sampson</hi>'s
Foxes, who have their Tails knit together, and do
carry this Fire-brand to consume Church and State.
In one other they differ extremely, for the <hi>Romanist</hi>
and <hi>Iesuit</hi> will have it to be the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
and Sectaries fix this Sovereignty in the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We believe, with warrant of Scripture and sound
Antiquity, that all Crowns and Scepters, Kings and
States, are dependent from Christ the Son of God,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33502:58"/>
as he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God and man, the Saviour of the
World, and Head of the Church.</p>
            <p>We intend not at this time to discuss that curious
Question, <hi>Whether or not by Hereditary Right Christ was
born King of the Iews:</hi> We are speaking at this time of
Christs Kingdom, as the Head of the Church, in order
to all the Kingdoms of the World. The Kingdom
we speak of is not what was due to him, as the <hi>Son
of David,</hi> but as he was the <hi>Saviour and Redeemer of</hi>
David <hi>and all the World.</hi> The right to which he had
<hi>by Hypostatical Vnion, and his perfect Merit and plenteous
Redemption.</hi> Some very Learned men do hold, that
Christ was not entitled to this Kingdom till his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and that then he had <hi>Ius quaesitum,</hi> as the
Jurists speak. There is not much danger to hold this
or deny it, but with reverence to their great Parts,
and humble submission to better Reasons, I dissent
from them, and do think, however it may be granted,
that then he came to exercise it fully and perfectly;
or if you will, that a new Title and Right did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
to him, that what he had before by <hi>Hypostatical
Vnion onely,</hi> now he had it by another supervenient
<hi>Right of Merit,</hi> and so had it <hi>duplioi Titulo,</hi> as Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> saith of him in another case: yet for any thing
I could yet see, I am of the mind from the first instant
and moment of his Incarnation, as God-man, the
Head of his Church, <hi>By the grace of Hypostatical Vnion</hi>
he was <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> It cannot
be denied, that while he was in the form and state
of a Servant, <hi>in statu</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the state of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
as by the no less mysterious than admirable
and wise Oeconomy of God, the Glory of his Deity
did not conspicuously and ordinarily shine thorow the
veil of his Flesh, no more did this Majesty and Glory
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33502:58"/>
of his Sovereignty and Kingdom shine forth to the
Eyes of men. God in his unsearchable Wisdom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
appointed, that <hi>the Kingdom of God should not
come with observation,</hi> and that the <hi>Iews</hi> might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
in their judgment, who did not expect a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
King and Deliverer, but a <hi>Messiah,</hi> to reign tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally
over them, and by him to enjoy all external
Plenty, Peace and Happiness. Nevertheless, such was
the merciful and bountiful dispensation of God in this
cloudy and dark Oeconomy, that sometimes thorow
the thick and dark cloud of his Flesh and Infirmity,
some little rayes of his immense Majesty did appear, as
in his miraculous Operations; even so in the same
manner, at many times, and by many acts, his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
was manifested; and that he was truly King,
it was evidenced. <hi>At his Birth,</hi> The Wise men who
came from the East worshipped him in his Swadling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouts:
They are in Scripture, and by the constant
not interrupted course of the Church to this day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for it. <hi>In his Ministry,</hi> he entred <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
in Royal Pomp: His Disciples and a great multitude
did him obeysance, gave him Royal Honour: and
when the <hi>Iews</hi> grumbled at it, he told them that it
was not onely just but necessary; That if they and
the People did hold their Peace, the Stones would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
him King, and do him Royal Homage. <hi>In his
Arraignment,</hi> when he is to lay down his Soul for his
Sheep, he avouched himself, before <hi>Pilate,</hi> a King. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
demands the Question, <hi>Art thou a King? Pilate</hi>
understood not any Kingdom in his Question but a
temporal one; a Spiritual Kingdom in his conception
was a meer Notion, Fancy, Chimaera: Christ without
dissimulation, equivocation, or mental reservation, <hi>ad
mentem interrogantis</hi> answereth, he was a King. <hi>Matth.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33502:59"/>
27. 11. Mark. 15. 2. He had it written upon his Cross.
Buried,</hi> He had his Grave sealed as a King.</p>
            <p>These things thus premised, we come to prove that
Kings are Christs Vicegerents and Lieutenants upon
the face of the Earth, 1. Our first proof is, the place
we insisted much in before, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. by what is
said, it is more than apparent, that <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi>
hath this Sense, By me Wisdom, the Son of God,
the Word that was made Flesh, Kings reign: you
may find many Reasons by reviewing the most learned
and most pious Bishops Sermons, Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> whose
Memory shall ever be in everlasting Benediction.
1. First <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. This Wisdom is called the Son
of God. 2. Next this preposition <hi>Per,</hi> By, it is the
proper and peculiar preposition of Christ. 3. Thirdly,
it is not very congruous that as by Christ we have all
Blessings spiritual in heavenly things, so by him we
have Kings his Derivatives constituted, the best and
most eminent of temporal Blessings. 4. Fourthly,
Christ he is Wisdom, and by him all Blessings issuing
from Mercy; Kingdoms subsist more by Wisdom than
by Power; why shall we not then from this Wisdom
establish Kings and their Sovereignty? The proper
Work of Wisdom is <hi>ordinare,</hi> to order, and to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
Order; Why then shall not all Monarchy refer
its Origine <hi>to this Wisdom?</hi> 5. Lastly, the original
word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Bi,</hi> is both <hi>in me, &amp; per me, in me and by
me,</hi> to intimate, as we said before, that Kings are first
in him, and so come forth from him; and yet come
so forth <hi>from him,</hi> that they are <hi>in him;</hi> Christ in
them as <hi>his Deputies;</hi> They in him as their <hi>Author</hi>
and <hi>Authoris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r;</hi> He by their <hi>Persons;</hi> They by his
<hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:33502:59"/>
2. Our second Proof we bring from that Scripture
averreth that Christ is not only King of his Church,
but in <hi>Order to his Church,</hi> King over all the Kings
and Kingdoms of the Earth. Christs Kingdom over
his Church. <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 6. 15. in these words expressed
<hi>I have set my King upon my holy Hill</hi> Sion. Over the
whole World, in these Words, <hi>v. 8. I shall give thee
the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermost parts
of the Earth for thy Possession:</hi> which is not to be scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by conceiving it only of the calling of the Gentiles
to the Communion of his Church, but also of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
over all the Earth and Kings of the Earth.
This Ordinance is by Appointment, and a decree irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable.
<hi>v. 7. I will declare the Decree.</hi> The words,
<hi>I shall give thee,</hi> demonstrate that this <hi>potestas</hi> is not
<hi>aeterna &amp; interna,</hi> that eternal Power which is insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from him as God, but <hi>data &amp; externa,</hi> a given
and bestowed Power, which is not conceivable in
Christ, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as man, or God-man, our
Saviour and Redeemer.</p>
            <p>3. A third Proof may be this, that as this was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by Prophecy, so in the Fullness of time it was
really effected and accomplished. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. Our
Saviour saith; <hi>All Power is given to me in Heaven and
in Earth.</hi> The word <hi>Given,</hi> sheweth this Power is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
in that <hi>Capacity</hi> by which he is our Saviour, <hi>all
Power in Heaven and Earth,</hi> universally is expressed,
<hi>all Power,</hi> and by Distribution exegetically amplified,
all Power in Heaven and Earth, which will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nor permit, that we exclude Sovereignty in Kings.
<hi>Vbi Lex non distinguit, nemo distinguere debet.</hi> Let
our Adversaries shew where Kings and their Crowns
are exempted or excepted from this, <hi>all Power in
Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:33502:60"/>
4. Fourthly the Apostle St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 1. 5. telleth
us that God hath appointed the <hi>Son,</hi> by whom he hath
spoken to us in the last days, <hi>Heir of all things.</hi> If this
Inheritance be not over Kings, we are infinitely mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and if Kings refer not their Right to him as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
they have no just Title.</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, The Scripture to take away all Cavils,
hath given us this Truth <hi>in terminis terminantibus,</hi> in
plain and express Terms, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 2. Jesus Christ the
faithful Witness, the first begotten of the dead is, <hi>The
Prince of the Kings of the Earth.</hi> that again, <hi>cap. 11. 27.
He ruleth them with a Rod of Iron.</hi> That this is meant
appliable at least to Kings, see and read it. <hi>Psal. 11. 9.
Revel.</hi> 19. 12. On his head you have many Crowns,
an Embleme of his Sovereignty over all Kings, and
that all are his Deputies, his Substitutes. To what
is said, add that of St. <hi>Paul. 1 Tim. 6. 15. He is the
only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
That <hi>The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> is a note of Excellency. <hi>Revel. 17.
14. The Lamb he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,
Revel, 19. 16. And he hath on his vesture and on his
Thigh a name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
Observe the words attentively, How characteristically
this Power is given <hi>to the Lamb, to Iesus, to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Witness;</hi> That it is <hi>written on his Thigh on his Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture;</hi>
which qualifie this Power as his Due, as he is
the Head and Saviour of his Church. It is worth
your notice taking, that <hi>this name</hi> is written <hi>upon his
Thigh,</hi> that we may learn two things; the one is,
That this Power is fixed in <hi>Christ-man;</hi> The other is,
That all Kings are <hi>De femore Christi,</hi> from him by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>Reason pleadeth for this Truth; 1. First, what is
more suitable and convenient, than that all Kings of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33502:60"/>
all Ages, should issue from him, who is <hi>Rex saeculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
A King whose Kingdom endureth throughout
all Ages? It is the highest Dignity of Crowns to hold
of this Crown.</p>
            <p>2. Next, is it not prophesied by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that Kings
shall be the Nurse-fathers of his Church, <hi>Reges erunt
nutritii tui?</hi> Is it not fit then that they hold their
Crowns of Christ? Is it not fit, that Kings be taught
so much, that with the more Alacrity and Zeal, they
may advance the good of Christs Kingdom?</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, our Divines do acknowledge, that by
men in sacred Orders Christ doth rule his Church me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
in those things which primely concern Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
And that by Kings, their Scepter and Power,
he doth protect and preserve his Church, and what
concerns the external Government in Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
How then can it be denied, that Kings in this
latter Sense, are no less the immediate Vicegerents of
Christ, than Bishops Priests, and Deacons, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?
Look upon the Interpretations are given by
the best and most able of our Divines upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 28.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, what is the reason that all Christian
Emperours and Kings glory in the Sign of the Cross,
and place it upon the Top of their Sacred Crowns? It
is not only by this <hi>Symbolum Christianismi</hi> this ancient
badge of Christianity, to witness that they are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and not ashamed of the Cross of Christ, but also
to acknowledge, that they have received and hold
their Crowns of him. Much more might be said to
this purpose, but for brevities sake, and judging what
is said to be sufficient to prove all Kings to be Christ's
Vicegerents, we spare with more Reasons to transgress
upon the Patience of the understanding Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:33502:61"/>
Some have shunned to speak thus, that <hi>Kings are
Christ's Vicegerents upon Earth,</hi> fearing that because of
the Popes unjust Challenge to be <hi>Christs universal Vicar
upon Earth,</hi> it should usher in a Subordination of the
Crown to the Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re. They scruple without just cause.
What need we to be afraid to speak with Scripture? It
is high Presumption in the Pope to challenge to himself
the Title or Right of <hi>Christs universal vicar upon Earth,
by divine Right.</hi> There is no colour almost or shew of
Reason for it either in Scripture, or reverend Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Pope, the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath no more
by <hi>Divine Right</hi> (what he may have by positive Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Right, it is not pertinent for us now to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and discuss) no higher Priviledge (except it be
in extent) than the meanest Bishop in the World in
his Diocess. Doth not St. <hi>Hierom</hi> say, <hi>Omnis Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
sive Romae fuerit, sive Eugubii, sive Constantinopoli,
sive Rhegii, sive Alexandriae, sive Tanis, ejusdem est meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
ejusdem Sacerdotii.</hi> The learned and holy Father
compareth, with the three great Patriarchs (priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at that time by Ecclesiastical Canons above<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all
others, with the Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> three of the meanest Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
next adjacent to them, the Bishops of <hi>Eugubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
Rhegium,</hi> and <hi>Tanais,</hi> and averreth that by divine
Right they had <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> equal Right, equal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Nor doth that hold better, that the Pope would
make his transcendent and extravagant Jurisdiction
over all, to be grounded upon a fancied Eminency in
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> above his fellow Apostles, <hi>ordinarie</hi> in him,
<hi>extraordinarie</hi> in them, <hi>personal</hi> and <hi>temporarie</hi> in them;
but so fixed in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Person that it is transmissible to
his Successor, and he forsooth, whether God will or
not, must be the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Paradox is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33502:61"/>
against Scripture, sacred Antiquity, and sound Reason.
It is not fit now to prove it, only to satisfie the
judicious Reader, I content my self with the Suffrage
of that Holy Father and Martyr S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who <hi>de
unit. Eccles.</hi> or singular, Prelator saith; <hi>Hoc utique
erant caeteri Apostoli, quod erat Petrus, pari consortio prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti
&amp; honoris &amp; potestatis.</hi> He knew not these Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
these Novators have coyned and forged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Anvil of their own Hearts: His Judgment
was, all the Apostles no less than <hi>Peter,</hi> were endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Order to their Apostolical Charge, with the
same Endowment of Power, and Priviledges of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Would God, both sides in this and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
would submit to the Judgment and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the holy Fathers!</p>
            <p>I wave the accurate discussing of these points, they
require more time, and a more fit place. To what is
said I add, that although we would give to the Pope
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be Christ's immediate universal Vicar <hi>in
spiritualibus,</hi> in spiritual things, there is no Danger, and
so to shun this Inconvenience, we need not be so shie,
as to forbear to call Kings <hi>Christs Vicegerents, Christs
Lieutenants.</hi> For if we should grant the Antecedent,
the Pope is Christs universal Vicar upon Earth (which
is certainly as false as Falshood it self) it is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
a lame Consequence, to make this inference, <hi>Ergo</hi>
all Kings Crowns are subordinated and subjected to
the Pope and his Mitre. Their own Authors, who
advance his Power as high as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> do acknowledge
that all power that was in Christ, <hi>Secundum quod ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
as he was man, was not collated upon St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
They confess moreover, that all the Power that was in
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was not by him transmitted to his spurious
and usurping Successor. They all with one Mouth
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33502:62"/>
profess, that <hi>potestas Excellentiae quae in solo homine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto
fuit,</hi> that Power of Excellency, which is solely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to, and personal in Christ, was not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> They clear and prove it by specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of instances: Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> say they, could not
confer the Effect and Efficacy of the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Sacrament it self; nor could he institute Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of himself, or in his own name, or others
than Christ himself did institute. Do they not all
of them give and grant that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Power of doing Miracles to all his Successors?
So then, although it were granted that the Pope were
Christ's Vicar universal, it will not necessarily follow,
that in this, that Christ is King of Kings, the Pope is
his first immediate and universal Vicegerent.</p>
            <p>I wish the Pope, who claimeth so near alliance and
contingency to Christ, would learn of Christ to be
<hi>meek and humble in heart,</hi> and so not onely should he
find rest to his own Soul, but a great deal of more rest
and quiet should be both in Church and State. It is
very considerable, that in Scripture it is recorded, that
whilst our Saviour was <hi>Minister Circumcisionis,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Circumcision, he both practised and taught
that it was God's Ordinance, that the Mitre submit
to the Crown; and the Shepherd's Crook to the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<hi>Scarce well come into the World,</hi> when he taught
this by his Practice, flying from <hi>Herod</hi>'s Persecution
to <hi>Egypt,</hi> who might have commanded Legions of
Angels against him to destroy him (if it had not been
that it was fitter he should teach us true Obedience)
as at his Word, they published his Birth to Shepherds,
and sung that glorious Anthem, <hi>Gloria in Excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is.</hi>
Some, it is probable, may judge this to be the Act and
Fact rather of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> than of Christ, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33502:62"/>
that they out of their Fear and Weakness not able to
do better, did flee <hi>Herod</hi> and his malicious intent.
If any think so, let him consider, that he hath not
learned as yet that all Christ's Actions and Passions
are full of Mysteries, and nothing acted or suffered by
him, in which there was not an over-ruling wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Providence of God in Mercy and Wisdom: and
withal let him consider, that all his Acts and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are our Instructions. But leaving this, Did he
not in his Ministry teach and practise it? Teach it,
when he commanded to render to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things
that are <hi>Caesars;</hi> when he convinced the <hi>Iews,</hi> who
would gladly have shaken off <hi>Caesar,</hi> and his Right,
arguing that they were by God's Law bound to pay
<hi>Caesar</hi> Tribute, because he was their King, and this he
proved by their Coin, (which with all sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Politicians is <hi>inter jura Majestatis)</hi> which was
printed with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Face and Superscription. Again,
in his Death, Did not our Saviour Christ acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>Pilate</hi>'s Power (that is the <hi>Roman,</hi> of which he
was Deputy) to be from above? Did he not rebuke
<hi>Peter,</hi> who with his Sword would have in a Defensive
way saved him from those bloudy Persecutors? Did
he not tell him, <hi>He that killeth by the Sword, shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
by the Sword?</hi> that is, <hi>Peter,</hi> although thou think
thou hast a good cause, that thou wilt defend me,
and by resisting open force, preserve me thy Master, thy
Saviour; deceive not thy self, it is not lawful by Arms,
in the best Cause, for my Cause, for my Life, to resist
Lawful Authority; if thou kill in my Defence, thou
art worthy to suffer Death by the Sword, by him
that beareth the Sword not in vain. When <hi>Peter</hi>
over-reached himself in this distempered zeal, cut off
<hi>Malchus</hi> his Ear, Christ, before that Offence should
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33502:63"/>
have been done by any of his, in his company, for his
Cause, will be at the pains to cure this wound mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously.
Would God, Pope and Papeling, Jesuit and
Sectary, Puritan and Presbyterian, would fix their
hearts upon these Practices of Christ, by a singular
Wisdom of God so clearly and fully recorded, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Christ's Nativity, Childhood, practised and
taught in his Ministry, practised and taught when he
was a dying, when he was looking Death in the
face, at which time the most sinful man will neither
dissemble nor temporize. I doubt much if in any act
of Christ, during his coming into the World, and his
going home again to his Father, you can instance any
to parallel this; to exceed it, sure I am you cannot.
And what, I pray you, can the Pope challenge more
than to be <hi>Minister Evangelii,</hi> a Minister of the Gospel,
as our Lord was, <hi>Circumcisionis,</hi> of the Circumcision?
He shall never be accounted with me the true Vicar of
Christ, who teacheth contrary to Christ, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
contrary to his Practices: Me thinketh he looketh
more like, and hath nearer alliance with the man
mentioned 2 <hi>Thes. 2. Who exalteth himself above every
thing is called God.</hi> It is very considerable likewise,
that in the Apostolical Creed, which is so full, so
brief, and nothing in it but what is necessary to be
believed to Salvation, that I say in this short Creed,
<hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> (whose memory is accursed) by the
Spirit of God which ruled his Church in setting this
down, is recorded. It is not for his Honour certainly,
but for our good and edification, that there it is said,
<hi>Christ suffered under Pontius Pilate,</hi> that we may learn,
if we expect Salvation by Faith in Christ, we must
submit to Authority, by obedience to what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
if it be lawful; and submitting humbly, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33502:63"/>
suffering, if Authority urge that which is unlawful,
and against God. And that this we are bound to, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Magistrate be as opposite to Christianity as
a Heathen, and the Cause for which we suffer be for
Christ and his Church. We will never help Christ
nor his Church by Arms against Authority, or Religion
by Rebellion. If our Sectaries give us a new Creed, it
will concern them near, with the expunging of Christs
<hi>descent to Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> to raze out
this, <hi>He suffered under Pontius Pilate.</hi> If their Practices
be so contradictory to Christ's, they cannot but <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutivè,</hi>
by consequence, be destructory of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith; where the Reward of those are to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you know too well. It were better for you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to expunge Christ's Descent into Hell, but to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate
Hell it self, which by a close Committee you
may resolve upon, if your <hi>omnipotent power</hi> can be able
to do it: I mean, your <hi>fansied coordinate power,</hi> which
you have of late erected against <hi>Sovereignty</hi> fixed in the
Lord's Anointed, as in the Church you have erected
Altar against Altar. God open your Eyes to see your
monstrous Sins and Errours, and to give to you and
to us all true Repentance, that the fearful vengeance
of God overtake us not, and in the World to come
be forced by sensible, eternal, and horrible pains, to
acknowledge the Truths which now we reject, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
plainly in Scripture declared, in the most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Apostolical Creed determined, and by the
current and not interrupted suffrage of the Fathers,
above seven hundred years believed. Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon us, and turn his Wrath and fearful Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from us. I dare not to express what I fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
I look upon these outrages committed against Sacred
Truth; How God and his Word are abused, His San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33502:64"/>
defiled, His Ordinances repealed, Mischief fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Law, Sacred Persons violated, and the
Lords Anointed fearfully rebelled against. My reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is to dissolve unto Tears and Prayers, and with
my Master say daily, say hourly, <hi>Lord forgive them, for
they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The weakness of this Assertion, <hi>that Kings are not
Christ's Vicegerents,</hi> we have as we hope sufficiently
proved: It is high time now to discover the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. The purpose they have by this and the like
Assertions, is to reserve the managing of all Religious
Affairs in their largest latitude to themselves; vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
it as peculiar and proper, <hi>quarto modo,</hi> to their
Conventicles, Presbyteries, and Assemblies. This So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
they make so Sovereign and Independent,
that all Kings and Sovereigns whatsoever must submit
to it. This Sovereignty Ecclesiastical may restrain and
constrain the King at pleasure. It may repeal his
Laws; correct his Statutes; reverse his Judgments.
It may establish its own, urge Obedience, Cite, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and Censure in case of Disobedience: And if
they be not of Power to execute what they decree,
they may call for or command the help and assistance
of the People, in whom is that underived Majesty;
and to this purpose may promise, covenant, swear to
stand to the maintenance of their Fancies against all
whatsoever, and to defend each another, <hi>contra omnes
mortales,</hi> with their Goods, Lands, Fortunes, Honours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Lives, to admit no divisive motion (which is real,
and to be such, if the Authority of this Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it such) whatsoever, to suppress whatsoever is
contrary to the good intended in this Covenant and
association, if it be in their power; so that this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
maketh every man <hi>armatum magistratum,</hi> to be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33502:64"/>
armed with Power, and the way left to himself; for
ought we know it may be <hi>Ravilliac</hi>'s way, or <hi>Guido
Faux</hi>'s way.</p>
            <p>Surely here is a Despotical Sovereignty, and more
than ever was challenged by any, the <hi>Turk</hi> or King of
<hi>Spain</hi> without <hi>Europe:</hi> This is to tyrannize over
mens Souls, for no man must be suffered to live or
enjoy any Freedom, or Life there, who dissenteth in
the least point of their voluminous Greed from them;
and if he assist not with his Monies, his Arms, his
Hands, to the loss of his Life, <hi>for his Religion,</hi> he is
either Prelatical or Papistical, and <hi>for his affection to the
States,</hi> (a word incompatible with Monarchy, and
of highest Treason) he is at best a <hi>Malignant.</hi> At
pleasure of this Sovereignty every man must give the
<hi>Quota</hi> this Sovereignty prescribeth, the Twentieth, the
Tenth, the Fifth part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must give loan of what
moneys they have by them, or upon Bank, for the
good Cause, upon security of the Publick Faith, (a
<hi>non ens,</hi> which is like, if God prevent it not, to ruine
the Reformed Orthodox Catholick Faith, and moral
Faith and Truth amongst men) or what other they speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and ordain: What a vast Sovereignty is this? the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it is immense; for nothing shall be without the
Sphere of this Power, which hath no motion but ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick;
no Person without the verge of this Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

the beginnings of troubles. The most glorious Church
amongst the Reformed, the staff and strength of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion is broken in shivers, where all things
are lawful except to serve God; and all Sects, all
Schisms allowed, except the Orthodox Truth and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God. This Reformation is written in
Letters of Bloud, acted with the greatest Cruelty,
against not onely Innocent, but Deserving men, with
Calumnies, Rapine, Robbery, Cruelty, that Father,
Mother, and young ones, if they have not been starved
with hunger and cold, have been exposed to extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
indigency, contempt, and mockery. I dare to say,
no Persecution that ever was, can parallel this Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for Impiety, Injustice and Cruelty. What heart
bleedeth not to see these Kingdoms, happy before, to
the Envy of other Kingdoms and States, to be the
mocking-stock of the World; that the <hi>Canaanite</hi> and
<hi>Perizzite</hi> rejoyceth to look upon our Misery, to see the
Desolation standing in the Holy place, and those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
of late the desire of all the Earth, turned into
an <hi>Akeldama;</hi> and no other fruit of this glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
but to kill Christians for Christ's sake,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33502:65"/>
and to plunder for Religions sake? Lord forgive them,
for Christ's sake, and remove our Sins, and those
fearful Judgments: and I beg pardon of the Reader
for this Digression or Regret, which I have poured
out with a sad heart, and wish them no worse than
speedy Repentance.</p>
            <p>For all we have said of this Antichristian Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whereby the <hi>Puritan</hi> and Factious would exalt the
Presbytery and Representative Body above all that is
called God; Let no man imagine that we ran to the
other Extreme, to privilege a King from the direction
and just Power of the Church; or that we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him, or set him on, like <hi>Vzziah,</hi> to intrude
upon Sacred actions, proper to Ecclesiastical Persons,
<hi>Ex vi ordinis, In direction by the Word, administration
of the Sacraments: binding and loosing, in interiori foro
conscientiae,</hi> or, <hi>in exteriori,</hi> by the Spiritual Censures an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Keys. Sure I am, no pious or knowing
King (as blessed be God our Sovereign is) will by
right of his Crown, which he holdeth immediately
of Christ, usurp upon this; but on the contrary, as
a <hi>Son of the Church,</hi> will submit to the Church his
Mother, or rather Christ in Church-men reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him to God. Elsewhere (by Gods Grace, if
God give us Life and Leisure) in a several Treatise by
it self, we intend to lay open this point. In sum,
briefly we say, that men in Sacred Orders, <hi>In rebus
purè spiritualibus,</hi> in things meerly and intrinsecally of
themselves Spiritual, have from Christ immediately a
<hi>directive</hi> and <hi>authoritative Power,</hi> in order to all whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
although <hi>ministerial onely,</hi> as related to Christ:
But this giveth them no <hi>Coercive Civil Power over a

case of not obeying what God in Scripture hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
to covenant, associate, swear, and take Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
upon it, to resist him, oppose him, and force
him to submit to the Scepter of Christ. This Power
over man God Almighty useth not, much less hath
he given it to man: <hi>Psal. 110. His People are a willing
People. Suadenda non cogenda religio, nihil minùs Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis
quàm Religionem cogere.</hi> Nor doth that spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Power which entirely we give to Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons, rob the King, as he is the nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Church, of the power Christ hath endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with, as a Christian King, <hi>in externa guberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
Ecclesiae.</hi> We must not look on Kings as on others
of the Flock of Christ, although we may neither
preach, nor administer the Sacraments, nor bind, nor
loose, nor give sacred Orders, nor excommunicate,
these are things only proper to Priests, <hi>Primi &amp; secundi
ordinis,</hi> of the first and second Order and Degree: Yet
the exercise of these things freely within his Kingdom,
what concerneth the decent and orderly doing of all,
and what concerns <hi>externum hominem,</hi> by coactive
Power, or <hi>externam gubernationem Ecclesiae,</hi> the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Government of the Church, in appointing the use
of things, arbitrary and indifferent, and what else is
of this strain, are so due to the Prerogative of the
Crown, as that we must not rob him of it; nor may
the Priest without highest Rebellion against God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
or usurp upon the King. A King in the State
and Church is a mixed Person, not simply Civil, but
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33502:66"/>
Sacred too: They are not only <hi>Professores fidei,</hi> Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of the Truth, that they have <hi>in the Capacity of a
Christian:</hi> but they are also <hi>Propugnatores fidei,</hi> Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Faith; which is proper to them <hi>in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of a King.</hi> What is the meaning of that, that in
Scripture they are honoured with more than the Stile
of a Son of the Church; they are called by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> or
rather God himself, <hi>The Nurse-fathers of the Church?</hi>
This is not to be so scantled, as if there were no more
Influence from Kings upon the Church, but by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Riches; other great men may and have done
the like; it is meant by some Influence from their
Crown, their Sword, their Scepter. What meaneth
that Charge, <hi>Psal. 2. 10, 11, 12. Be wise, O ye Kings,
serve the Lord with Fear, kiss the Son left he be angry,
and ye perish from the way; When his Wrath is kindled
but a little?</hi> I will believe Saint <hi>Austin</hi> more than all
the glorious pretended Reformers of this happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,

            <p>Religion is <hi>the Base and Bottom,</hi> on which all the

Obedience. Religion rightly ordered <hi>maketh the

Obedience: This made <hi>Aristotle</hi> say, <hi>Polit. l. 7.

               </gap>, Piety and the fear of God is the
safety and only Defence of all things. Religion in Sum
is the only thing to make private and publick Affairs
to prosper. Which thing being infallibly true, it must
necessarily follow, that Religion is the most important
of all Affairs of State and Kingdom. How can it then
subsist and consist with Reason that the King shall have
no more hand or Power in Religion, than to execute
at the Command of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbytery?</hi> To do it or
do worse?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:33502:68"/>
Christ did never institute such a Sovereignty in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
persons, either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Sectaries,</hi> Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from King and Sovereign, with which they are
invested with Power from Christ, from above imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
If it were so, the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbytery</hi> were in
better Condition than the <hi>King.</hi> The Ecclesiastical
Sovereignty hath the Souls in subjection, under no less
Sanction, than with Assurance of Salvation eternal, in
case of Obedience, and Damnation eternal, in case of
Disobedience, and both of them to be extended both
to Soul and Body. Religion is seated in the Soul,
and is a mighty Ruler there: the civil Sovereignty
holdeth only a dead Dominion over the Bodies. That
Sovereignty which hath the Soul in Subjection, the
Conscience at his Devotion, must over-rule Royal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Sovereignty, and shall be able at any time so to
limit, weaken, lessen, yea disable it, that it shall be
no more fearful abroad, nor glorious and powerful at
home with it's Subjects than the spiritual Sovereignty
shall permit. It is most true and consonant to our
purpose, that <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <hi>Orat. in Verr. 5. Omnes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligione

sooner than their lawful and religious Prince: they will
part with what is dearest to them, to advance their

Ear-rings to cast their molten Calves; they will not
spare to sacrifice their Children with the King of <hi>Edom,</hi>
or to cut themselves with Knives like to the Priests of

upon them, that at Pleasure, they commanded the
killing of the King by their own Subjects, none of
them daring to deny or delay to put in Execution
what the Priests commanded: this continued long,

that where a Sovereignty religious, independent is

you to these Stories, Jewish, Ethnish or Turkish, we
may see the doleful Effects, this Tenet with it's pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
hath brought upon these Kingdoms. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities

The Puritan and Presbytery by their independent Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Sovereignty will act as much Mischief e're
it be long, if God in mercy stop not the Current of
their Fury and Malice; as in many Ages past, the Pope

            <p>Let the Christian Reader, whose Affection is right,
and whose judgment is not perverted, judge how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
was our case when Gods Ordinance had place; had
Power, Prince and Priest had their sacred due right,
what Plenty, Peace, what Happiness King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
did enjoy and rejoyce in. And on the other
part, let him reflect his Thoughts, and consider how
since this Sovereignty Ecclesiastical hath been elsewhere
erected, maintained; how here a Sovereignty civil,
co-ordinate, collateral to royal Sovereignty is set up.
And withal let the judicious Reader see how both the
one and the other do concur to the Destruction of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33502:69"/>
Episcopacy, to the lessening certainly, if not the total
overthrowing of Monarchy; but differ extreamly in
this Sovereignty Ecclesiastical, for in one Kingdom the
Presbytery, the Assembly is so Sovereign, so indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in Ecclesiastical and spiritual things, that it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Laws, Orders to the Sovereign Prince and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
and demandeth as due a <gap reason="foreign">

of them, civil Sanction, and Execution upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractories
and Delinquents. In the other, the co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Power erected, over-ruleth, controuleth, and at
Pleasure directeth what they in their infallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and answerable Jurisdiction, judge Orthodox
in Faith, right for the Worship, and orderly for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of Government.</p>
            <p>The last medleth <hi>in spiritualibus,</hi> in things meerly
spiritual and ecclesiastical, <hi>in ordine ad civilia,</hi> in order
to the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdoms. The
other hath so enlarged its Jurisdiction and Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ecclesiastical, that it trencheth upon and medleth
with things meerly civil, but <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia</hi> as
related to Religion and the Church. Both the one and
the other are of equal Extent, for this <hi>in ordine ad civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
on the one part, and <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia</hi> on
the other, are such relative and respective Terms and
Distinctions as can admit, and authorise Church-men
to do, act, and meddle in matters of State of highest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment;
and Lay-men again, to do the like in things
most spiritual, and by divine Right, reserved for men in
sacred Orders. So long as such Tenets are maintained, &amp;
with Practices accordingly strengthened, we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
God's Blessing on Church or State. To both the one
and the other God may justly say, <hi>Quis haec requisivit à vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis?</hi>
Who hath required these things of your hands? and
where God's Ordinance is not, and his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is infringed, that men intrude upon that is not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33502:70"/>
their Right, or usurp upon sacred Right, his Blessing
is not to be expected. Again, we aver confidently,
till this <hi>Babel</hi> be beat down, there will never be peace
nor Quiet in Church or Kingdom, nor shall private
men enjoy the Fruits of their Labours in Peace.</p>
            <p>If this co-ordinate, usurped, and new-fancied So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
usurp so much upon God and the Churches
Right, we shall become a mocking stock to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church: If the other independent, ecclesiastical Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
obtain, it is not to be doubted but that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
Ecclesiastical of sacred Persons and their Goods
shall not only be established, but also raised to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Strain and Pitch than <hi>Romanists</hi> do claim it. This
I say cannot but undoubtedly follow upon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices, if there were not some hope, that
those Creatures whom God never made, and Christ
never instituted, <hi>Lay Elders</hi> I mean, oppose not and
retard the Course, <hi>who are invested with sacred power,
to determine Truth in Controversies and Mysteries of highest
Concernment in Councels; to establish Canons; to prescribe
a Form of Worship, a Catechism; to have the power of
the Keys in all censures Ecclesiastical:</hi> in sum, in all
things Ecclesiastical to have no less power, no less a
Voice not only <hi>deliberativè</hi> but <hi>decisivè</hi> than Priests or
Ministers as they are pleased to call them; these <hi>Lay
Elders</hi> are debarred from nothing, but only <hi>publick
Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Administration of the Sacraments,</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and the Eucharist; it is expected if the <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Ministery,</hi> another Head of this <hi>Hydra</hi> become the
prevalent part, they will justle the Presbyterian out of
this, and restore all the <hi>Laity,</hi> who in their Divinity
are no less the <hi>Lords anointed than Prince, Priest, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
There is some hope, I say that these Lay Elders,
a <hi>non ens</hi> in Scripture, and never known to Antiquity,
will curb them, that they shall not have way for such
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33502:70"/>
               <hi>a vast Immunity,</hi> finding already by sad and feeling
Experience what a measure of Patience is required
to bear their Insolency, and what Prudence is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to disappoint their ambitious and pragmatical
ends.</p>
            <p>There is enough said to lay open the weakness and
wickedness of this <hi>Antichristian tenet, that Kings are
God's, but not Christ's Vicegerents.</hi> They cry out much
against the Pope, to whom they do better service than
they are aware of, (I pray God they were as real and
true Enemies to Popery, as moderate and Orthodox
Protestants are, whom the Pope feareth more than
them, and with just reason) and seeing I have not
much hope that what is said will work much upon
them, let me tell them that in their Tenet and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
they are worse than the good Popes were, and
I dare say, all to <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> (hear it from his

written to <hi>Theodor. Epist.</hi> 64. He saith, <hi>Valdè mihi
durum videtur, ut ab ejus servitio milites suos substrahat,
qui &amp; ei omnia tribuit, &amp; dominari non solum militibus,
sed etiam sacerdotibus concessit. Maurice</hi> was no bad Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33502:71"/>
and <hi>Gregory</hi> certainly was a good Bishop; yet
<hi>Maurice</hi> had commanded that none serving in his
Wars, or any Officer whatsoever accountant unto
him, should be admitted either to Sacred Orders, or
a Religious Monastical Life, without his special War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
Reason may plead for the equity of this charge,
because by the Bounty and Beneficence of Christian
Emperours, men in sacred Orders, and Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
had admirable Priviledges, which might make
his Armies weak by flying to sacred Orders and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Life, and exempt Accountants from doing what
was due in civil Justice, <hi>ex Indulto Imperatorum,</hi> not
<hi>ex jure Divino,</hi> by the gratuite concession of Princes,
and no direct Warrant from God or his Word.
Whatever this was in it self which <hi>Maurice</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Gregory</hi> to keep, and to intimate to all his Suffragan
Bishops, and to be published in all Churches within
the verge of his Jurisdiction; certain it is, in St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>'s
judgment it was unlawful and sinful, for he
saith, <hi>Lex ipsa omnipotenti Deo minimè concordat:</hi> and
again, <hi>Valdè durum mihi videtur;</hi> yet what did he?
He made this Ordinance of the Emperour's to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
throughout all his Churches; here is Obedience:
and although it did belong properly and peculiarly to
him as Bishop, to admit any qualified by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to sacred Orders; He submits to the restraining
Ordinance of Sovereign Authority, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
did not transgress. He pleadeth for no immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

bringeth in Christ himself, saying, <hi>Sacerdotes meos ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nui

thy power, my Priests: and in this case which is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

conceive, at least that part of it, of admitting of able

He knew no more lay upon him than in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and submiss freedom with Reverence to tell and
admonish what he thought fit. The poor man knew
not that as Christ's Vicegerent, in Christ's Kingdom,
he was to oppose, to supplicate, petition, and if there
were not a recalling, a repealing of the Imperial Edict,
that they might excite the People to covenant, swear,
and at last to present a Petition upon the point of a
Pike, by right as he was Christ's Vicegerent. This
holy man knew not this Divinity, it was never heard
of in his age, nor any since the World began, it sprang
not up till many Ages after, that that malicious one
did sow Popple among the good Wheat of Christ's
Field; for a thousand years after Christ, the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Sovereignty Ecclesiastical of the Pope was never
known in the Christian Church. The Presbyterian

Almighty God right in mercy what is disjoynted in

Pope out of doors.</p>
            <p>I may add a world of Testimonies of the Fathers,
who expresly call <hi>Kings Christs Vicegerents upon Earth.
Athanasius</hi> in the Sermon of the Blessed Virgin (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
that of the Psalm, <hi>Et regnabit in domo Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,

            <p>Seeing then that Scripture, Antiquity, and Reason
stand for this Truth, that Kings are Christ's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
upon Earth, let us not be deceived with the no

<hi>own,</hi> a <hi>Sovereignty Ecclesiastical</hi> to domineer over all
Powers else whatsoever. I wish they would here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that passage which otherwise and in another

enormous, extravagant Sovereignty hath been acted
by the Presbytery, how much the intrinsecal right of
Sovereignty hath been restrained and lessened, and it
feareth me, you will hardly find so much acted by all
the Popes since <hi>Hildebrand</hi>'s time, as by them in this
short space. I leave this, and come in the next place
to prove by the Testimony of Fathers, that Kings are
not the Derivatives of the People.</p>

<hi>Antioch:</hi> There at that time he was <hi>Presbyter,</hi> when
by a tumultuary uproar the Statues of <hi>Theodosius</hi> were
broke, and reproachfully-abused. The holy man after
a most passionate and plentiful Regret, expresseth the
Riot thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that it was
a wound so open that no hand could cure it. Then
exhorteth all with <hi>Iob</hi> to sit upon the dung-hill, to
mourn that they were left to themselves to fall into so

               <hi>Saint</hi> Hierom <hi>homologates and confirms what they

changeth Times and Seasons, &amp;c. Non ergo miremur, <hi>saith
he,</hi> si quando cernimus, &amp; regibus reges, &amp; regnis regna

omnium est, &amp; saepè malos reges patitur suscitari, ut mali
malos puniant. <hi>Saint</hi> Hierom'<hi>s mind is fully this, that
Kings and Kingdoms have</hi> their Constitution, Change,
and destitution <hi>by</hi> the sole royal Pleasure of God. <hi>And that
in all, he is no less the Author than he is Creator of
all. Finally, that not only</hi> good Kings <hi>are of God's

            <p>No man hath spoken more home than Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
look upon him <hi>l. 4. de Civit. Dei, c. 33. Deus ille
felicitatis Author, quia solus verus deus est, ipse dat regna
terrena bonis &amp; malis. Neque hoc temerè, quasi fortuitò,
quia deus est, non fortunà, sed pro rerum ordine &amp; tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
occulto nobis, notissimo sibi.</hi> In which Passage St.
<hi>Austin</hi> vindicates the making of Kings <hi>absolutely</hi> to
God, by a reason unanswerable, <hi>Quia solus verus deus
est;</hi> because he alone is the true God. The meaning
is, you may as well deny him to be the only true God,
as rob him of this Prerogative of making Kings; and
in his Sense, he or they that assume this power to
themselves, intrude sacrilegiously upon God's Right.
He amplifieth this, shewing Kings are not casual by
hap-hazard, but causal, God in his wise and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Providence sending bad or good Kings according
to the Exigence of time and the people, to bless or
punish. He resolves all in a <hi>docta ignorantia,</hi> a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
way, that howsoever we cannot reach the way
nor find the reason, why it is so, yet is well known to
God, to which we are religiously to submit, and not
curiously and presumptuously to enquire.</p>

in what Extent for Power and Time he will. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s mind this is not only verified of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Kings, but of the <hi>Assyrian, Persian, Roman,</hi>
and all others besides. Fourthly, Saint <hi>Austin</hi> knew

in which it is fixed, but <hi>in concreto,</hi> he averreth
that both the Power and Person invested with the
Power are of God. Fifthly, it is worth our notice
taking, that the holy Father specifieth only <hi>Empire</hi> and
<hi>Monarchy.</hi> Sixthly, the Extent is most observable,
this Conclusion or Maxim of Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s holds well,
of all Kings whatsoever they be, Heathen, or Jewish,
or Christian; if Christian, bad or good, sound in the
Faith or Hereticks; if Heathen, whether good moral
men or Persecutors. See and consider, how wisely
and fitly he makes a <gap reason="foreign">

was any co-ordinate Power with the Emperour, He
knew he was solely and immediately subordinate to
God, to whom he ought of due to submit and subject
himself, and that with good reason, because by his
immediate Gift and Collation he had the Empire, and
by his Power was protected in his Government. The
holy Bishop raiseth this so high, as to intimate it is a
Doctrine taught by the Holy Spirit; let the World
and good men judge then, what Spirit teacheth the
different or contrary Doctrine. <hi>Stephanus</hi> the sixth
writing to <hi>Basilius</hi> the Emperour, saith, that <hi>He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

Tom. 10. Anno 885. n.</hi> 11. It is like enough the
Church then did not stand to call Emperours <hi>Christ's
Vicegerents.</hi> In brief, in sum, Was it not the usual
Benediction the holy Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> used, writing to
Emperours and Kings, to wish to them Grace, all
Health and Happiness, <hi>In eo per quem Reges regnant,
in God, and by God, by whom Kings onely reign?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were easie for us to adduce numbers of Councels
to prove this truth. The Councel of <hi>Toledo, Tolet. 6.
c. 14. Nefas est in dubium ejus deducere potestatem, cui
omnium gubernatio supremo constat delegata judicio:</hi> It is
an impious thing and unlawful, to call in question his
Power, to whom to rule over all is by Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Decree collated. Amongst the Councels of
<hi>Paris</hi> you have one, which after that it hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
many Testimonies of Scripture, and namely some
of those we cited above, to prove the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33502:77"/>
is worthy to be set in Letters of Gold: the Fathers
there met together will not have the coming at King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
to be <hi>from any act humane, any desire or endeavour

God, and the wise, the secret disposing of God in his

            <p>If it could add any thing to what is said, we might
have a cloud of Witnesses of Humane and Heathen

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33502:78"/>
fixed in one, as in Monarchy; or some few of the
better sort, as in Aristocracy; or in many, as in
Democracy; is derived from God immediately, and
referreth to him as its proper efficient and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent.</p>
            <p>That God is the Author of all Government amongst
his Creatures, and especially of the Government of
mankind, appeareth by reason. 1. The same who is
the Author of all Creatures in their Being and Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
must be the Author of their Subsistence and
Preservation in that Being and Existence. It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Maxim in the Schools, in Nature, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<hi>Qui dat esse, dat &amp; conservare:</hi> He that giveth
Being is the same that preserveth the Being. Creation

Creation: we assume, Things made existent by
Creation, cannot subsist and have continuance, but
by Order, by Government; from whence naturally
it followeth, God must be the Author of this Order
and Government, and consequently hath not left it
arbitrary to man by composition and consent to do it.
Authority strengtheneth this reason. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
writing against <hi>Faustus,</hi> saith, <hi>Aeternâ lege juberi, ut
ordo naturalis conservetur;</hi> It is not arbitrary (in
St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s mind) to man whether Government or
not; for what is <gap reason="foreign">

if we will believe the Prince of Philosophers,
is arbitrary; but in his judgment <hi>jubetur,</hi> it is <hi>jussum,</hi>
a commanded, a necessary thing; and that <hi>aeternâ lege,</hi>
by an inevitable irrepealable Ordinance, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

saith, <hi>Omnibus notum sit nullum principum, nullámque

by whom they have not only their <hi>Being in Nature,</hi> but
also to be <hi>so order'd</hi> for their better Being and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Order. If Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s first Passage above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
be not clear enough, full enough, hear him speak
for himself, <hi>Lib. 3. Confess. cap. 8. Generale pactum est
societatis humanae obedire regibus suis:</hi> It is a natural, a
general, a universal Compact, Covenant of humane
Society to obey their Kings. In the Fathers Dialect,
<hi>Generale pactum</hi> is the dictate of Nature, and he that
disclaimeth <hi>Ius naturae,</hi> the dictate of Nature, to be
<hi>Ius divinum,</hi> the Law and Ordinance of God, hath
made a Divorce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>betwixt himself, and Nature, and
Reason, and sound Divinity. It is observable, that
he saith this <hi>Generale pactum,</hi> this Ordinance of Nature
is <hi>obedire Regibus suis,</hi> to obey their Kings: I beg the
Favour that our Sectaries will shew as much for <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracy</hi>
or <hi>Democracy,</hi> or any other imaginable Spece
of Government.</p>
            <p>The Strength of this Argument is more seen, if you
consider this; If God Almighty be not as much the
Author of the order of the Government of mankind,
as he is the Creator of man and mankind; then Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God hath not perfected his good Work entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33502:79"/>
to, or towards man and mankind, and hath left
man in a worse Condition than all other his Creatures
in the <hi>Vniverse</hi> besides. The Consequence is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for it was not sufficient nor conformable to the
Wisdom and Goodness of God to make man the little
World, the Abridgment of the Perfections of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
except he provided by his Wisdom, Power, and
Goodness, how he should be continued and preserved
in Being and Happiness: but this without Order and
Government is neither imaginable, nor really possible.
These two are indivisibly, inseparably given to God
in Scripture. He is <gap reason="foreign">

is no less the immediate Work of God than the

            </p>
            <p>Do we not see all the Creatures established in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
one to another? See we not in the lifeless
and senseless Creatures that the inferiour giveth a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Reverence, and silent Obedience to the Superiour?
See we not upon the other part, that the superiour
Creature hath a powerful and effectual Influence upon
the Inferiour to its Good and Being, without which
it could neither subsist, nor act what is fitting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to its Nature? In this Subordination, do we
not see that from the lowest we ascend to a Superiour,
from one Superiour to another, till at last we come to
<hi>One Supream,</hi> which receiveth nothing to better it from
any Inferiour at all, but only due Reverence and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and notwithstanding hath a <hi>powerful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign</hi>
Influence upon all beneath it? From whence
I pray you, is this, but from the sacred and inviolable
God of Nature? The impartial may judge how much
this pleadeth for the Excellency of Monarchy; and
how like it is to that Order God hath established <hi>in the
Vniverse.</hi> Look up to Heaven, consider those blessed
and happy Angels in the Heavens; is there not there
this established Order, with this Subordination, and
probably is consummated at last in an excellent one,
supereminent to all? For this I will not contentiously
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33502:80"/>
contend, Order and Superiority with Inferiority, I
am confident no intelligent moderate Divine will
deny. How can it then be conceived, that God hath
left it to the simple Consent and Composition of man,
to make and establish a herauldry of <hi>Sub</hi> and <hi>Supra,</hi> of
one above another, which neither Nature nor the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
doth warrant? To leave it thus arbitrary, that
upon this presupposed Principle, mankind may be
without Government at all; which Paradox cannot
be maintained, seeing without Order (which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and intrinsecally includeth in it a Priority and
Posteriority, a Superiority and Inferiority, a <hi>Sub</hi> and
<hi>Supra)</hi> neither <hi>Being nor happy Being</hi> can be preserved;
which Happiness is more requisite for man, by that he
is a rational Creature, and more necessary for us here,
than for the intellectual Spirits of Angels in Heaven,
who have the Presence and Direction of Almighty
God, in whose Presence they stand, and whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
they expect and perform.</p>
            <p>Nor is it probable to my poor thinking, that when
God Almighty in the Government of all things under
the Cope of Heaven, (I mean bodily) hath made the
Superiour to have by his established Ordinance a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
inherent Superiority, with a powerful and benign
Influence upon its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nferiour, which is no ways derived
from the Inferiour by Communication, in what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
it will, and resumable upon such Exigents as
the inferiour listeth, hath left to the multitude the
Community, the Collective, the representative or
virtual Body, to derive from it self, and communicate
<hi>Sovereignty, whether in one, or few, or more</hi> in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Proportion pleaseth them, which they may
<hi>resume at Pleasure,</hi> at least in <hi>such exigent Cases,</hi> which
sometimes <hi>really may be,</hi> but oftner are fancyed to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33502:81"/>
such: because upon these Grounds presupposed, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Obedience cannot but be uncertain, and
the Sovereign disabled from giving and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that Influence which is necessary for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all and every Inferiour.</p>
            <p>I humbly entreat those who are contrary minded,
to consider seriously, how Almighty God in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of man, before the Woman was made <hi>of him,
and for him,</hi> and before he had any Child or Subject
to govern, fixed Authority and Power for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the person of <hi>Adam.</hi> This to aver, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was fixed in a Governour before he had over
whom he was to bear rule, is no Paradox in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
(if I pleased to insist philosophically to clear it)
nor a more strange thing to consider, than when a
<hi>Posthumus,</hi> one born after the death of his Father, by
right inheriteth his Fathers Honour and Revenues.
Is it not very considerable that God did not make
<hi>Evah</hi> of the Earth as he did <hi>Adam,</hi> but made her <hi>of
the man;</hi> and declareth too, made her <hi>for man?</hi> It is
more than probable then, God in his Wisdom did not
think it fit (that he was able to do it I hope none dare
to deny) to make <hi>two independents,</hi> and liked best of
all Governments of Mankind, <hi>The Sovereignty of one,</hi>
and that with that Extent, that both Wife and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
should submit and subject themselves to him.
If <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, Divines doubt not but Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
had been. Government without Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not conceivable, nor Subordination without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Relations of Superiority and Inferiority. It is not to
be controverted, if <hi>Adam</hi> had never fallen, Aristocracy
or Democracy, or mixed Government had never been
existent or apparent in the world. What spece of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
had been then, I pray you tell me it? <hi>Et eris mihi
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33502:81"/>
magnus Apollo;</hi> If then <hi>in statu instituto,</hi> in the State
of Innocency and Perfection God Almighty did esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
Government, and fix it in <hi>Adam</hi> before his wife
was created, or a subject born, is it not by this evident
that God judged it in his Wisdom, better that neither
Woman nor Posterity should be, than that one should
not be to rule all? The Argument concludes <hi>à minori

in the state of innocency to establish it thus by
Gods own Decree, how much more <hi>in statu p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in our decayed and corrupted state by Sin? And yet
more to assure us, that this Sovereignty was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
fixed in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor that it was lost by <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Fall, or that the state of Sin requireth as more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for it, another spece of Government by more
than one; after the Fall it is declared transmissible
from <hi>Adam</hi> to the first-born, <hi>Gen. 4. Sub te erit appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titus

whether or not with reason it can be said, that this esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of <hi>Sub</hi> and <hi>Supra,</hi> Subject and Sovereign, be
the onely constitution of man. And withal by the
way, let any indifferent man judge what may be said
for Monarchy, its excellency and conveniency above
other species of Government; of which anon, <hi>Quest.</hi> 2.
Yet for all this let none misconstrue me, as though I
condemn Aristocracy and Democracy as unlawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.
I am certainly assured, that when the

               </gap>, which is <hi>authoritativè,</hi> (as we told before)
he recalleth us to the first order and establishment of
Almighty God mentioned in Scripture. And by this
we may be led on to consider how <hi>Monarchia funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
in paterno jure,</hi> how Monarchy is founded in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Sovereignty; and the best way to find out <hi>jura
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33502:82"/>
Majestatis,</hi> the Sovereign's Prerogative, is to consider
well what in Scripture, what in Nature, we find to
be the true and natural right of a Father; onely
probably, because of mans corruption and untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by reason of Sin, it is like God hath allowed
more to Sovereign Power to enable and secure it.</p>
            <p>Again, To enlarge our selves a little more to clear
this Point, seeing it is possible, nay, not onely possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
but actually it hath fallen out so, that because
of mens sins, and by Gods Judgments following Sin,
a multitude may be divided from their natural Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
be dispersed by a War, a Persecution, or some
other necessity imaginable, and yet meet in a strange
Land, or some Territory not inhabited; this case pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed,
I demand, Whether or not this <hi>Populus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditus</hi>
would not condescend presently and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to some Sovereign Power to govern and protect
them? who can deny it? Again, if all these were
descended from one, or sprung up from one root,
and their common Father were with them, would
Nature, Equity and Humanity necessitate them to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to him; and that from him it should be heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
transmitted to his first-born, and so forward?
who doubteth of this? Well: I change the case,
take them not onely as <hi>inconditus populus,</hi> a disordered
People, (which is conceivable where a Head is) but
as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without one common Ruler; that is,
when they are a <hi>farrago Naetionum,</hi> and <hi>diversarum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarum,</hi>
a confused mixture of more Nations, more
Families, when they have not one common Father.
If they condescend that one shall have Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over all, and so by consent shall be surrogated in
the place of the common Father, and that this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
shall be transmitted to his eldest Son, and so
forth. From whence is this Power? Necessity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33502:82"/>
them to a Government, (without it they can
have neither Society, nor Safety, nor Peace, nor Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness)
but all their part is onely <hi>to design or declare
the man,</hi> which is onely <hi>potestas designativa, potestas
deputativa,</hi> but the Power is onely from Almighty God
the <hi>potestas collativa,</hi> the Authority, the Sovereignty is of
God, from God, God's. The reason is evident, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
must have it by the same hand, by the same
means he had it, in whose place he was substituted.
By what is said he cometh in the place of a common
Father, and the Father's right is immediately from
God, and of God. I am ashamed to resume again
that the Apostle saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the eminent
Powers that be, are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the authoritative Establishments of God, no less
than the Authority of a Father above his Son, or of
a Wife above her Husband, is of God, and from
God immediately, and do not refer to the Wife or
Children, as their immediate Donor and Author. <hi>God
hath spoken once, twice have I heard it, that Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Lord:</hi> Psal. 62. 11. If you love to hear
St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speak, read his words in a proper place
upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. where he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>&amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:33502:83"/>
The sum and
sense of all is this: Because paritie in Honour and
Power always worketh War and Contention, God to
prevent this Mischief, hath ordained many kinds of
Powers, and as many kinds of Subjections, as the man
to have Power over his Wife, a Father to have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the Son, a King to rule, and Subjects to obey:
And this is not only apparent amongst men, but also
in the very body of every man, where some members
are superiour to other in Worth and Power, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Inferiour: This established Order hath place
amongst irrational Creatures; as Bees and Cranes do
follow one, Flocks and Herds do the same. In the
Sea this is to be seen, where many Fishes do follow
one as King, war with him against others, and go
following him to places far distant from home. Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
the want of Order and Government, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and always evil, the Mother and Cause of all
Confusion and Mischief.</p>
            <p>The Result of all is, Government is necessary, as
for the Subsistence of all Creatures, so especially for
the good and comfortable Society of men. This is
not left arbitrary to men, but is by the inviolable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God established. Now if it fall forth so,
that a multitude disordered, dispersed by any unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Necessity, be without Government, nature over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by Gods inviolable Ordinance forceth them to
submit and subject to some to govern them, and to
have Sovereignty over them, whether they resolve upon
one, upon some few, or many: The Designation of the
person, or persons, is from this disordered rout, but it is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33502:83"/>
God who investeth them with the Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p>We clear it thus: as, <hi>Posito generationis fundamento,</hi>
when a Father begetteth a Child, <hi>consequitur ex ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione
divina &amp; institutione, vel naturali, vel morali sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio
filii ad patrem;</hi> it is necessary by the inevitable
Ordinance of Almighty God, that the Son begotten
be subject to the Father: So it is by moral divine
Institution, that when any People have deputed and
designed the Person or Persons of the Government, or
Governours; the Collation and Donation of this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Sovereignty is from God <hi>effectivè,</hi> effectually;
and from the Community but <hi>consecutivè,</hi> because <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequitur
ad electionem populi, ex divina &amp; ordinatione &amp;
collatione,</hi> it followeth and is inseparably conjoyned
by God and his Appointment. Take the like; A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
marriageable in her own Power maketh choice
of a man to be her Husband, her Choice and Consent
giveth not to him marital Power, but this Right and
Prerogative of the Husband is from Almighty God;
for who dare say that in the woman is primarily and
radically <hi>marital Power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider yet a little more; the King elected to be
a Sovereign to such a headless, a disordered Multitude
as we presuppose, is surrogated in the place of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father to the whole Community over which he
is to bear rule. The Scripture expresseth him so,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Command. 5. <hi>Honora patrem, Honour thy
Father.</hi> The Heathen conceived it so; See <hi>Aristotel.
Ethic. lib. 8. c.</hi> 10. and <hi>Polit. lib. 1. c. 2. Homer.

are deduced. 1. First, as the natural Father (suppose

Right, Power, or Authority,</hi> from his Posterity, or
those are come of his Loyns; but hath this from God

and the ordinance of Nature, which is <hi>jus divinum</hi> (as
we have said) no more can <hi>the Father surrogated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in
the place and power of the natural Father he said to
receive his Right, his Power, his Sovereignty from the
Community. 2. The second Consequent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
is, that according to the maxim of the Law,
<hi>Surrogatus gaudet privilegiis ejus cui surrogatur;</hi> and
<hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> succedit in locum succedit in jus,</hi> the Person surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
hath all the Power, the Priviledge, the Person
had Right to, in whose place he is surrogated. When
a man hath no Son by Nature or Issue of his own, a
Son adopted is entituled to all the Right, Power,
Revenue, was transmissible to a Son begotten of his
own Body. A base born Son legitimated, is invested
with all the Right, Title, Honour, Inheritance, was
due to a lawful begotten Son. The reason is evident
is pregnant, both the one and the other, the adopted
Son, and the base Son legitimated are surrogated into
the place of the lawful and natural begotten Son.
Why then, I pray you, shall not, should not the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
Father by Election enjoy the Priviledges and
Rights of the Father natural? Methinks more, for the
warrant of the two latter cannot be raised to any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Constitution than humane Appointment, but the
other of the surrogated Father floweth and followeth
the inviolable and unrepealable Ordinance of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God. For my part a King designed in such case,
ought, should enjoy his paternal Right, no less than
<hi>Melchisedeck</hi> or <hi>Abraham.</hi> I am the more powerfully
inclined to this Opinion; that I see in holy Writ,
that it pleased God in his Wisdom and Justice to
transfer the Right of the first born, to the younger,
the surrogated was not one whit lessened in his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
and Power, but had fully entirely what was due
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33502:84"/>
to the first born, in whose place he was surrogated.
Consider this in <hi>Iudah,</hi> when <hi>Reubens</hi> Right of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture</hi>
was forfeited, and he with his Posterity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with it, and surrogated in his place. See, read
and consider the Royal Prerogatives by the Spirit of
Prophecy bestowed upon <hi>Iudah, Gen.</hi> 49. of which by
Gods Grace more largely, <hi>Quaest.</hi> 4. The like may be
seen in <hi>David,</hi> whom God preferred to <hi>Eliab</hi> his elder
Brother.</p>
            <p>It is a ruled case in Law, <hi>Modus acquirendi non tollit
jus possidendi;</hi> the way by which we come to have <hi>jus

(provided it be lawful, otherwise that Maxim is of
undoubted Truth, <hi>Quod ab initio non valuit progressis

secure an injust Title; it is not my purpose now to
enter upon <hi>Vsucapio,</hi> or <hi>Ius proscriptionis)</hi> is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
by the way by which we obtain it. <hi>Iacob</hi>
had no less Right to the Birth-right, having it by a

this, <hi>Quomodocun<expan>

                  </expan> res est acquisita, possessio est de jure
gentium,</hi> if a man come at any thing by a legal Title,
by the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> that is, <hi>by the Law of common
Equity,</hi> the Possession or Apprehension is entire and
valid. Now apply all this, when a People disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are without Government, and destitute of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
to whom by a Title and Right of Nature it
is due, condescend to design or chuse one for their
Ruler, why shall he not, should he not enjoy, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the Right of the deficient Proprietor? and seeing
the Right Proprietor had this Right by God, by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
how can it be, but howsoever the Designation
of the Person is from the disordered Community,
yet the Collation of the Power is from God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:33502:85"/>
and from his sacred and inviolable Ordinance?
And what can be said against <hi>modus acquirendi,</hi> the
way by which such a one elected obtaineth this
right? for seeing God doth not now send <hi>Samuels</hi>
or <hi>Elishas</hi> to anoint or declare Kings, we are in
his ordinary Providence to conceive the Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Election of the Person, is the manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God's Will, <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> as the School speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
just so, as when the Church designeth one to
sacred Orders.</p>
            <p>In few words take all with you. God who made
all things is the Author of Order, by which all things
are preserved; without Order there can be no Being,
but all must either turn to Annihilation, or to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Chaos. God in Scripture is no less the God of
Order than the Creator of all things. In Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Angels we see it established. Amongst all
Creatures betwixt the cope of Heaven and the center of
the Earth it is, a sweet subordination, a sweet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is seen; the Inferiour giving a tacite reverence, a
due obedience to its Superiour, the Superiour having
an over-ruling Power, with a benign influence upon all
Inferiours to it. Can we then dream to ourselves, that
God did leave man without this mean of subsistence,
that it was Arbitrary to him to appoint and specifie
either no Government at all, or what kind or spece
of Government he pleased? <hi>Plato</hi> in his Republick
can tell such a man, that he that can think he may
subsist without a Governour, must either be God, or
something worse than nothing. Hath God provided
so for all Creatures in Heaven and Earth, that he hath
established a Government amongst all, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to every one's nature, and hath he left man,
in some respects the most excellent and perfect of all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33502:85"/>
Creatures, <hi>the Abridgment of the whole World, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosme,</hi>
without this established order? Do we not
see that before the Woman came into the World, or
a Child was born, God fixed Government in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Adam?</hi> Did he not secure it, that it should be
transmitted to the first born, that Government amongst
mortal men should be immortal? and seeing Sin with
much more Misery and Mischief hath brought into
the World, that men should sometimes be driven
from their natural and <hi>proper Father, King and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi>
that for their Subsistence in Happiness and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Protection from Evil and Mischief, they are
forced to chuse one or more, and <hi>to surrogate him or
them in his place,</hi> to whom by God and Nature it was
due to bear rule over them; that he or they coming
in the place and power of the natural Father or King,
have his or their Sovereignty, not by a voluntary
Consent, but by a necessary act; and that the Power
is not by Derivation from the Community, but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Donation from Almighty God.</p>

it is carried to it's chief good: both of these in
sound Philosophy, are not <hi>actus liberi,</hi> free acts of the

Government, which is the brood of that natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension

is not <hi>liber,</hi> not so free, as it may chuse or reject,

Constraint or Necessity, that all and every one are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to it by that Necessity of Obedience Nature
hath layed upon them: from what is said rationally
and by necessary Consequence it followeth that this
Consent in the Community, and every individual is
not <hi>purè activus,</hi> purely and simply active, but hath
more Alliance with a <hi>consensus passivus, a necessary ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
Consent:</hi> from this then it is more than appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that by that our <hi>new Statists</hi> call the voluntary
Consent of the People, nothing is bestowed upon him
or them in whom the Sovereignty is fixed; nor can
the Community be a Donor of any Right or Power
but in Submission and Subjection. It will puzzle infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
our New-state-Philosophy to make any thing in
it's kind passive really active, and collative of positive
Acts and Effects; except that as they have changed
Faith, so they will overturn true Reason: from hence
it will follow necessarily, that by Government esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
the People and Community are stated in a
more perfect, a more happy Condition. <hi>Solomon</hi>
knew it well, <hi>Prov. 11. 14. V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i non est gubernator po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus
corruit,</hi> where there is no Governour the people
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33502:87"/>
perisheth. It is not once but often repeated in the
Book of the Judges, when Idolatry, Rapine and Rapt
abounded, <hi>In diebus illis non erit Rex in Israele,</hi> in
those dayes there was no King in Israel. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
homologates this Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. intimating
that there can neither <hi>Peace</hi> nor <hi>quiet, godliness</hi> nor
<hi>honesty</hi> be where Kings are not. This <hi>natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
necessitated by these considerations, over-ruleth
and overcometh the <hi>natural repugnancy</hi> that is in every
individual, in every singular one. Again, this being
the Dictate of Nature, it cannot but refer to God, as
to its immediate Author, for God is the Author of
Nature.</p>
            <p>Nature hath taught natural men this truth, more
shame it is for us, who would be thought Christians,
to be ignorant of it, or to oppose it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith,
<hi>lib. 1. Polit. c. 1. &amp;</hi> 2. that Man is by Nature <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
made and ordained for Society. <hi>Plato</hi> in his
fancied Republick telleth us, that he must be God and
not man, that can imagine to have that All-sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to live without Society, and Society without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not conceivable, is not imaginable. The
same <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that <hi>Civitas est de natura;</hi> that
Government is not Arbitrary, but necessary, by the
over-ruling command of Nature.</p>
            <p>In brief, the result of all this Argument is, <hi>that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to rule or act the Sovereign,</hi> is not naturally inherent
in the Community, <hi>the collective</hi> or <hi>diffusive Body;</hi> all
the People have is a <hi>capacity to be governed,</hi> with a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
desire</hi> to be stated in a condition of Peace and
Safety, which cannot be effected without <hi>an union
with an actual Government</hi> in some, to which the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity</hi>
submitteth and subjecteth <hi>passively</hi> more than
<hi>actively,</hi> every individual having within him by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33502:88"/>
corruption <hi>an actual repugnancy</hi> to submit to any,
is necessitated to admit of Government by force of
that natural inclination to preserve himself in Peace,
Plenty, and Safety; this being most true in it self, and
verified by the experience and inward testimony of
every one who hath not shaken off natural reason;
How can it be made appear that <hi>this Sovereignty, this
actual Power to rule,</hi> is derived, transferred from the
Community all <hi>collectively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> considered, or every one
<hi>diffusively</hi> considered, or from a <hi>representative body,</hi>
Feoffees of trust from them? A Countrey Clown can
tell you, <hi>Nemo potest dare quod non habet;</hi> It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to give to another that we have not our selves:
and Jurists do tell us, <hi>Nemo potest transferre in alium

                  </gap>se.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What may be judged of their Extravagancies by
what is said, is more than apparent. How dare they
be so impertinent, so impudent to say, that <hi>in the
People there is an underived Majesty?</hi> It is right down
contradictory to Scripture, <hi>Dan. 2. 37. &amp;</hi> 5. 18. It is
said, <hi>God giveth Kingdom, Power, Strength, Glory and
Majesty.</hi> More absurd is that, that they with brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
affirm, this Majesty in a King is derived onely
<hi>cumulativè, communicativè,</hi> so that the People are not
devested of it, but that <hi>in certis casibus,</hi> in some cases
(which if they be not real, People shall fansie them at
pleasure) this same Sovereignty and Majesty is resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.
An old Philosopher would laugh at him who
would presume to say, that a matter passive actuated
and perfected by Union with a Form, could at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
shake off that specifick and individual Form, and
marry it self to another: they may with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
say, that a Husband hath Marital Power from his
Wife, and to gratifie that Sex, with which they are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33502:88"/>
very prevalent, they may endow every Wife with that
Power to resume her Freedom, and to marry to another
at pleasure.</p>
            <p>A third reason against this Paradox in State and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
is this, there is no warrant in Scripture, nor
doth Nature teach, that God hath fixed all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Sovereignty and Majesty, in the <hi>Community,</hi> as
in its <hi>prime and proper subject.</hi> The fittest opportunity
to evidence this Right and Prerogative of the People,
was certainly when <hi>Saul</hi> was anointed and appointed
the first King of <hi>Israel.</hi> Till this time God did retain
the Government in his own hands, and actuated it
by the hands of <hi>Moses, Ioshua, &amp;c.</hi> as his Viceroyes
and Deputies: the Text of Scripture is plain in this,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7. God saith to <hi>Samuel, They have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
thee but me.</hi> Again, 1 <hi>Sam. 10. 18. Thus saith
the Lord God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt,
and delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and
of them that oppressed you.</hi> Verse 19. <hi>And you have this
day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of your
adversities and tribulations; and ye have said unto him,
nay, but set a King over us.</hi> Again, 1 Sam. 12. 12. <hi>And
when you saw that Nahash the King of the Children of
Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, nay, but a
King shall reign over us, when the Lord your God was
your King.</hi> To these passages joyn <hi>Gideon</hi>'s words,
<hi>Iudges</hi> 8. 23. When they offered the Kingdom here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
to him and his Posterity, he replied, <hi>I will not
rule over you, neither shall my Son rule over you. The Lord
shall rule over you.</hi> These places prove clearly a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God's ruling of this People by his substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Deputies. When this extraordinary way, and
peculiar to this People onely, was to cease, and a King
to be established over them like to the Kings of other
Nations, it was most opportune and high time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33502:89"/>
this Native inherent right of the People, in
whom is this National and fancied underived Majesty,
and to leave them by their right to transfer their right
upon him whom they judged most fitting and able to
be King. But here <hi>Ne mu Lucilianum,</hi> not one syllable

and conceited Right; as at large before we
have expressed and cleared: for Scripture vindicateth
to God, as proper and peculiar to himself, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of the Person of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the collation and
bestowing of Royal Sovereignty. It is worth your
notice, that Scripture recordeth, that after he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
and declared King. <hi>The Spirit of God came upon
him:</hi> which without wronging the letter of the Text,
may be interpreted of God's Grace enabling him for
the charge. The very Heathen did acknowledge, that
in Kings there was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, something from above be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
above the ordinary stream of Endowments
incident to man, which how it may subsist with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
of all their Majesty and Power from the
multitude, let them judge who have not made a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
betwixt themselves and sound Reason and
Judgement.</p>
            <p>By no means let us neglect to observe, that God
when he designed <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, collated upon him
Royalty, he left no other act to his People but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him, which was not left to their voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
to admit or reject him at pleasure. Nor
is that to be over-leap't, that God would not allow
them by compact and contract to make their own
conditions, to limit and enlarge their King at pleasure;
but gave himself to the subject <hi>jus Regis,</hi> the Law of
the King, to which the Subjects were to submit in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33502:89"/>
the hardest case. He prescribed <hi>Lex imperandi,</hi> a Law
and Rule to Kings to rule and reign by, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.
But at the admittance of <hi>Saul,</hi> he giveth <hi>Legem paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi>
the Subject a Law of Obedience and Patience,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. which is so peremptory in the extremest
acts of Tyranny and Oppression, that no other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is left but Prayers and Tears, Patience, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lord in the day of Trouble and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Of this by God's Grace more hereafter, <hi>qq. 3,
4,</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>A fourth Argument against this popular Errour and
Deceit is this; if all Sovereignty and Supreme Power
were originally inherent in the People, and from
thence derived to the King; then undoubtedly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie
were the best of all Governments. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is pregnant; that spece and kind of Government
which cometh nearest to its original, must be sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more perfect; but, Democracie, which is
the Government of many, cometh nearer to the
multitude than Aristocracie, where some few of the
better sort, or than Monarchy, where one hath the
Supremacy and Government. The nearer to the
Fountain the Stream runneth more pure and clear.
This Argument cannot well be taken off; and it is a
strong Argument changing the terms in the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Monarchy; it proyeth the excellency of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
above all Governments, because it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nearest to the Government of God, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
who is the Author of all Government; as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
before is made, the Conclusion is most false;
because, howsoever all Writers of Politicks in many
things concerning Policy, differ as much amongst
themselves as Clocks, or our Sectaries, yet all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
accord and agree in this, that of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33502:90"/>
Democracie and popular Government is the
worst; and do prefer Aristocracie to it by many
stages; which likewise enforceth our Argument for
the excellency of Monarchy; for the farther you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from Monarchy, as in Democracie, the worse the
Government is; and the nearer you approach to it, as
in Aristocracy, the Government is the better. Some
have a nearer approach to one than many, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are at a greater distance with one than some few:
which things duely considered and rightly pressed,
will bring home the Conclusion, that <hi>Formalis &amp;
completa gubernandi ratio est in Monarchia:</hi> the proper,
specifick, formal, and complete essence of Government
is in the Sovereignty of one. Review and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all Politicians whom you will, they will grant,
that <hi>Suprema potestas est in indivisibili posua, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>upremacy
and Sovereignty is an indivisible and undivided Entity;</hi>
How can you share it then amongst more or many?
Nay, this forceth them to make Aristocracie, which is
the Government of more than one, and Democracie,
which is of many; that they must be considered as
unum analogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>end or can guess at, if
Sovereignty were primtively fixed in a multitude,
and from thence derived to any or many, I cannot
judge but that Democracie is the onely spece of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
warranted by Divine Institution; and that
all other kinds of Government are unlawful, and
their Acts sinful; or if any should attempt to change
Democracie into Monarchy, it were an high impiety:
which things how they may be admitted, let our
new State-Divines consider and declare. Sure I am
Saint <hi>Austin</hi> was of the opinion, that a corrupted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33502:90"/>
without sin, might be changed into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;
See him, <hi>lib. 1. de liber. arbitr. c.</hi> 6. where
he saith, <hi>Si depravatus populus rem privatam Reip. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferat
atque habeat vaenale suffragium; corruptusque ab
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is qui honores amant, regnum in se factiosis conscelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisque
committat; nonne item rectè si quis tunc extite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
vir bonus qui plurimum possit, adimat huic populo
potestatem dandi honores, &amp; in paucorum bonorum vel
etiam unius redigat arbitrium? Euod. Et ita rectè.</hi>
Saint <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Euodius</hi> agree in this, that if they
who bear Rule in Democracie do corrupt Justice, and
put the Government into corrupt mens hands, and
such as are factious, a good powerful man upon such
an exigent, may mould the Government into an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristocracie
or Monarchy. Good Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> for all
his Learning and Piety, knew not the Jesuit and
Puritans ground; that all Sovereignty and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
all Majesty underived was in the multitude, and
that in their Power it is to change the Government
to what guise they will; he knew not that this was
to rob the People of their native and proper Right,
when one man should reduce Democracie, without the
consent of the People, to Monarchy or Aristocracie;
nor knew he that it was an unjust and Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
intrusion upon God's Right in the People to do
it without their Act, their Consent, their Compact.
To this you may add another Testimony of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which virtually implieth the same, you may
read it, <hi>lib. 9. de. Civ. Dei, c.</hi> 21. where, speaking of the
declination of the Government of <hi>Rome</hi> from the
second <hi>Carthage</hi> War, and the restoring of <hi>Rome</hi> to her
glory by <hi>Augustus</hi> coming to the Empire, he saith,
<hi>Hoc toto tempore usque ad Caesarem Augustum, qui vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
non adhuc vel ipsorum opinione gloriosum, sed contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osum
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33502:91"/>

revocasse cuncta, &amp; quasi morbidâ vetustate col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsum
veluti instaurasse ac renovasse Rempublicam.</hi> The
Passage is very considerable. The purpose of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father is to take off that foul aspersion which the
Heathen put upon Christ and Christian Religion, that
all mischief came into the World since they were
heard of. He proveth by the <hi>Roman</hi> story, that greater
mischief before was upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that from
the second <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandeur
was in its declination and decaying, and at and about
the coming of Christ in the World was restored
again to its Magnificence and Splendour, by the
happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Monarchy and Empire of <hi>Augustus Caesar:</hi>
which happy change Saint <hi>Austin</hi> commends, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
it not: and so do the Heathen Writers: which
the Father could never have done if he had been
of the mind, that no man cometh rightly by Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
but by derivation from the People. It is not
onely Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s, but other holy Fathers observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that God in his wise Providence disposed so of
the Government of the World, as to put the best and
greatest part of the World under the Monarchy of one,
that thus he might facilitate the progress of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
throughout the World. It is foretold in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that Kings shall be the Nurse-fathers of the
Church, our Opposites cannot shew the like of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracies
and Democracies, nor this day do we see it,
or in Ancient storie find it recorded. It is most like,
<hi>Foelicitas temporalis,</hi> Happiness temporal, under <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
the sweetest of Emperours, came into the
World, with <hi>Foelicitas aeterna</hi> and <hi>spiritualis,</hi> with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happiness, when our King and Saviour came into
the World. Of this more. <hi>q.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:33502:91"/>
Our fifth Argument to prove, that Sovereignty in
a King is not from the Community or multitude, is
this, If this Sovereignty be natively inherent in
the Multitude, it must be proper to every individual
of the Community; if it be so, and must be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Tenet, which is enforced by that
other as groundless and false State-maxim, which
they hold and maintain, that <hi>Quisque nascitur liber,</hi>
every one is born a Free-man in the Forrest; then it
will necessarily follow, that the Generation and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of those who have first contracted with their
elected King, are not bound to that covenant, but
upon their Native Right and Liberty may start aside,
appoint another King, and that without breach of
covenant, or any just Title in the King of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to force or reduce them to his obedience: an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way devised to preserve King and Kingdom
in Peace and Safety. Might not the Posterity of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi>
and the Elders living in his time, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to incorporate them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in a serving condition, have made void their
Fore-fathers covenant? And if this be true, How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to pass that the Progeny of <hi>Ionadab</hi> did hold
themselves bound to keep the prescript and strict Rule
of their Father? The <hi>Rechabites,</hi> it seemeth, had not
learned this point of Native Liberty.</p>

&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their ground is, because all Sovereignty is by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Consent and Compact derived from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the King. This we have sufficiently disproved:
to strengthen this, they equivocate in a Maxim, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituens
constituto potior est,</hi> the constituent is above the
constituted in Dignity and Power. If they knew any
thing in Law, or were ruled by Reason, they could
know that there be two sorts of Constitutions; 1. The
one is, when <hi>Constitutio ab initio est voluntatis, &amp; ejus
effectus perpetuo pendet à voluntate constituentis;</hi> when the
Constitution is voluntary at first flowing from the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33502:92"/>
free elicite act of the Will, and whose Effect and
Force dependeth ever from the Liberty and free Will
of the Constituent; as when a King maketh a Viceroy
or Judge <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> enduring Pleasure; or
when a man maketh a Legacy and leaveth so much to
such a one after his death, he may make it void to
morrow, if Death prevent him not, except he hath
appended the last Codicil, as Lawyers speak; in such
like things <hi>Voluntas hominis est ambulatoria,</hi> a man's
Will is not denuded of it's Liberty to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ile or change;
the Will of man being, as Philosophers speak, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
sui actûs,</hi> Mistress and Queen of all her elicite and
commanded Acts. It is a ruled Case in Law, <hi>Nulla
obligatio consistere potest, quae à voluntate promittentis sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
accipit:</hi> No Obligation can absolutely tye where
all its Strength dependeth merely upon the free Will
of him that promiseth. 2. The other Constitution is,
<hi>Quae ab initio est voluntatis, posteà verò effectum habet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitatis;</hi>
which at the first is by the free Elect and
commanded Act of the Will, but afterward is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an Effect of Necessity, that maketh it irrepeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
irrevocable: as when a man maketh over the
Right of his proper Goods to another, this is at first
a voluntary Action, but the Donor having denuded
himself of <hi>jus proprietatis,</hi> of his entire Right, and the
Donee hath <hi>jus possessionis,</hi> hath apprehended Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this act is firm and stable, whether the way of
making over be <hi>titulo lucrativo,</hi> or <hi>titulo onerosa,</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done by gift, or for money, and as good in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
or any other way lawful, this act is no ways
revocable, although it be made to the Disadvantage

Contracts of less Concernment the like should

            <p>Is there any act more freely done, than when a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
not subject to paternal Authority, of perfect Age,

and as she fancyeth? And I pray you, may she after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Law, we know the Husband for Jealousie or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
might have given to his Wife a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement;
that the Woman had the like Power we
read it not. In Gods case which most nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
himself in the case of Idolatry, the Husband
was bound to dilate, accuse, and witness against his
Wife; the Father against the Children: but there is
no Charge to the Wife to accuse or witness against the
Husband, or the Children against the Father; a clear
Evidence how God Almighty would have the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in Reverence, Duty, and Obedience, to carry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33502:94"/>

should be wronged: <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. The tye betwixt King
and People, Prince and Subject is greater, is stricter
than any betwixt man and Wife, Father and Son.</p>
            <p>If our Adversaries will believe <hi>Iurists,</hi> they were
of a contrary Opinion, and did not imagine, that the
People transferring all their Right upon the Prince,
did habitually or in any case retain it or any part of
it, that in case of male-administration, they might
supply it, and in any Exigent resume it, or make over
the Right to whom they would, over-lording their
Prince, but that they were totally and irrevocably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with all power conceivable to be in the People.
Although this Opinion hath not the Truth of all the
Kings Right in it divinely enough, yet is it a safer
Opinion than that of late days hath been taken up and
maintained. <hi>Vlpian</hi> a renowned Jurist, <hi>L. 1. ad Sc.
Tupil.</hi> saith, <hi>Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem:
utpote cum lege Regia, quae de ejus imperio lata est, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
ei &amp; in eum omne suum &amp; imperium &amp; potestatem
conferat. Vlpian</hi> knew no better, but that <hi>The legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Power was in the Prince, and that because the King
is entirely invested with all the Power and Empire was in
the People.</hi> It is probable, he reflecteth upon the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical
Government</hi> which was before the <hi>Empire,</hi>
and so determineth, that what Sovereignty was in
the <hi>Democracy,</hi> was with its full Extent as entirely
and properly in the Prince. <hi>Vlpian</hi> reserveth no
Power to the People, for the saith expresly, <hi>Populus ei
&amp; in eum omne suum Imperium &amp; potestatem confert;</hi>
which ground laid, it is absurd to say, that in any
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33502:95"/>
case, or upon any Exigent, the people or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
diffusive, collective, or representative, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estate
themselves into that Sovereignty, so entirely ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reversibly
made over. <hi>Ex ore duum &amp; trium:</hi> Take
another witness (for in Law, <hi>Singularis testis nullus)</hi>
and a great one too; <hi>Bartolus ad L. Hostes. 24. F. de

of me to be Emperour, it was in your Power; but
the Choice being made, that which you now desire is
in my Power, not in yours. It is your part and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as Subjects to obey, it is in my Power to determine
upon what is fit for the Government.</p>
            <p>If all we have said cannot work upon our new Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
to forsake their Errour, we pray them to consider,
whether or not this ground laid, will not authorize
the Corporations and Shires, upon male-administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Trust committed to their Commissioners in
the House of Commons, or upon Jealousies and Fears,
to resume and make void that Trust committed to
them, and warrant them in case of Defailance to do
better for themselves and Country. Sure I am, <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>
one of their greatest Authors holds, that if a
Parliament determine in a matter of Law, it can esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
nothing but a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a preparatory precogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and that the Influence of a legislative Power is not,
till it be approved and admitted by the Community.
The Observator fearing this Tenet of <hi>Buchana,</hi> may
make void the Orders of the House, leaving here his
Master, and averreth, <hi>That the Right of the Gentry and
Commonalty is entirely in the Knights and Burgesses of the
House of Commons, and will have their Orders irrevocable.</hi>
A wonder it is that they are so favourable in their own
case, and so unjust and unequal in the Kings case: for
if it were granted, which is most false, that all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the King were by Trust devolved upon him from
the People, what is the Reason of the Difference that
he shall not have that Right as entirely, as irrevocable
as the Commissioners of Counties and Corporations?
Reason pleadeth more for this in the King than them,
for otherwise neither Sovereignty nor the person of
the Sovereign can be secured, nor any act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33502:96"/>
certain, but mutable at the pleasure of an erring
and inconstant Multitude. If any will seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they will find that what they take from the King
they give to their Feoffees of Trust, <hi>to Tables, to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
These in case of Necessity have an arbitrary
Power; the Prince in no case can have it, exercise it.
Those have the entire right of the Community devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon them, and the people are totally divested
of their native Right; the King hath his only in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciary
way, some part is habitually reserved, that
in some Cases the People may resume it, may practise
it. So in their Church it is not lawful to a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to meddle in secular Businesses; Their Clergy (if
they be worthy of name) may, do meddle in all
Treaties of Peace, Councils of War, in Commissions
for reversing fundamental Laws of Church and State
in other Kingdoms. This their practise is <hi>Protestatio
contra factum,</hi> it giveth a Lye to their Profession. I
think verily in after ages it shall scarce be believed that
amongst Christians, and such as would be accounted
the best of Christians, such Paradoxes could be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and such monstrous Practises acted, with such
sacrilegious robbing of Prince and Priest of their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Right. It is high time for Prince and Priest to
strengthen one another, and neither of them to think
that by making the other <hi>à publici odii victima,</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to malignant Malice, to preserve himself. It is
high time for the People to consider, how by such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practises they are plunged in such a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Gulf of Miseries, of Calamities, that none but <hi>dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera
excelsi,</hi> the right hand of the Lord can rescue, can
deliver them: How an arbitrary, tyrannical, civil
Power is put upon them, and established in the wrong
hand, that they dare not pretend to Liberty of Person,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33502:96"/>
or propriety of Goods: How such a Tyrannical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Hierarchy of some few Patriarchs, Lords
over their Consciences, make them run into Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and kill both Body and Soul. If these things,
these most fearful of all Judgments, cannot awake us,
it is like we are given over to destruction, more for
the Terrour and Example of others, than that we
can expect to see the Glory and Mercy of God return
again upon this Church and State. Lord of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
make us turn to him timely by Repentance, that
he may turn to us in mercy, make his Face shine
upon us, that we may be saved. To return to our
purpose:</p>
            <p>In fine, Let us still give it to them, that Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is in a King by Derivation from the People, and the
Conveyance is by Contract or Covenant. But then
I demand, how can this Contract be made void? It
must be made void <hi>either by mutual consent, or by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Sentence and Iudgment.</hi> That a Contract may be
made void <hi>mutuo contrahentium assensu,</hi> by a mutual
accord and consent of the Parties Contracters in Law
it holds; the ground is, <hi>Quibus modis contrahitur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractus
iisdem dissolvitur,</hi> and the main thing and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
force in a Contract is the consent of both. The
refiling of one Party Contractor is not sufficient to
void the Contract. Necessarily then it is required,
that both King and People consent to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
void: (whether a King may do this or not, you
shall hear more in the following questions.) The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
alone cannot do it. This contract as yet is not
made void by Royal consent; if it be, you must make
it appear <hi>authenticis Tabulis,</hi> upon evident and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Records. I confess, e're I put you to these pains,
I desire you first to produce <hi>Tabulas contractûs,</hi> this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33502:97"/>
Contract, which in Law must be evident and faithful;
and when you do it in any of his Majesties Kingdoms,
you shall have me to plead for your pretended Right.
Well then, I hope you will not say you have his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Royal Assent; although good and wise men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate,
that by real deeds out of zeal to Peace, and more
than fatherly indulgence, he hath indulged to your
Favours, which lessen his Prerogative, and which
without intrusion upon his Sacred Right you cannot
enjoy, if Scripture be either the Law or Umpire to
determine in this case. Seeing, I say, His Majesties
consent to void this Contract cannot be alledged, or
made appear; (and the Law determines, that <hi>De non
apparentibus &amp; non existentibus eadem ratio,</hi> or <hi>Quod
non apparet, in jure non est)</hi> you must have <hi>a legal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi>
A Legal Sentence cannot be had without a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Iudge.</hi> Who is this Judge? For my part I know
none but Almighty God, the King of Kings. If you
say, that the Judge is the diffusive Body, or the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective,
or the representative (which I see not how
it can be conceived without the Head the King, yet
at this time I yield it to you in your own notion)
and virtual Body; I oppose, that cannot be; are they
not all Subjects? Are they not all under his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Have they not all sworn, or should swear, Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
and Supremacy? How then can they be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
in any other capacity than of a Subject? How
in any other notion, relation, or consideration, but as
the other Party Contractor in this imaginary, noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
and fancied Contract? How can it with Law,
with Justice, with Reason subsist, that you shall be in
your own Cause, in your own Case, in a matter of
so high a Concernment, Judge, Witness, and Party?
The highest that any as yet have gone, is to fancy a
<hi>coordinate Power with the Sovereignty of a King,</hi> which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:33502:97"/>
in effect is a very bull, and is as much as to say, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and not Supreme; Sovereign and not Sovereign;
King and no King.</hi> I deny not but that it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if that your Practice may interpret your Power,
that you have run farther, and reach higher in your
Sovereignty than any King, any Monarch in <hi>Europe,</hi>
except you speak of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Power over
all his Dominions without <hi>Europe.</hi> Never any of
them claimed more but <hi>paternum Imperium,</hi> but with
grief we see this new Doctrine hath erected <hi>Despoticum
&amp; herile Imperium.</hi> I say, the most you have claimed
to your representative Body (and that maimed too)
is a coordinate Power; which in Law, in Reason,
runneth upon equal, upon coequal terms, Now in
Law <hi>Par in parem non habet Imperium,</hi> an Equal can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Lord or Judge over an Equal, much less an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
may usurp it above a Superiour. Amongst
many other reasons why our Lord, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. would not
sentence the Adultress that was taken, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
this is not an unprobable one, that although he knew
her guilty, as God, and as Man, <hi>gratiâ visionis,</hi> yet he
would not act the Judge and Witness. <hi>Omnis Christi
actio nostra instructio.</hi> Learn of him to be meek and
humble, nay, just too; and challenge not to be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Accusers, and Witnesses in your own cause: Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Law, and Ecclesiastical, both condemn it: nay,
the very Light of Nature made <hi>Africanus</hi> disclaim to
be against the Defendant, Judge, Accuser, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
The Casuits, when they dispute and resolve
the Case how a Judge shall proceed in Judgment,
when to his private knowledge he knoweth contrary
to that is like to be adduced, and the Judge tyed to
determine <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> that in such a
case he may (if another competent Judge may be
found) <hi>exuere personam publicam, personam Iudicis,</hi> and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33502:98"/>
witness for Truth, that Justice be not prejudiced. Fie
for shame, that <hi>Iesuits, Romanists,</hi> and <hi>Casuists,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they
hold many of our puritanical Principles, yet are
not so impudent, as our <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Sectaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To hasten to more Proofs of the Truth we maintain,
give me leave to tell you, that I think, or fancy at
least, that this Opinion that Sovereignty is seated in
the Community, every individual having its share,
which by Derivation from all and every one, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred
in the Person of the King, is not unlike that
Dream of <hi>Democritus</hi> and other Philosophers, who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed
to themselves, that the whole <hi>Vniverse</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and diversified <hi>by a casual Concourse,</hi> of what, I
know not, fantastical and imaginary <hi>Atomes.</hi>
            </p>

         <div n="10" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. X.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Wherein the Truth of our Tenet is by more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
asserted, the contrary Error disproved,
and the Absurdities in the Sectaries paradox
involved, are discovered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THis Tenet, that a King hath his Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>communicativè</hi> not <hi>privativè</hi> from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he is so invested with it, that the
People have it <hi>habitually, suppletively, and may resume
it</hi> in some exigent cases, giveth nothing to the King
but only an empty and void Title, which is not only
resumable at peoples Pleasure, but so coarctated and
bounded with Limits and Conditions of their own
devising, that <hi>simul &amp; semel,</hi> at the same Instant and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:33502:98"/>
Moment he both receiveth Empire and Sovereignty,
and layeth down the Power to rule and determine in
matters which concern either the private or publick
good. At the same Instant (without prejudice or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating
from the honour of Royalty, be it spoken) a
King becometh a <hi>Monster,</hi> an <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi> composed
of a <hi>Sovereign and a Subordinate, of a King and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, by this they hold, I see not how they can
difference a King from a Magistrate, which with all
understanding and knowing Politicians, are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by their different specifick Entity and Being.
Nay, a Magistrate is stated into a safer and better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than a King, for the Magistrate is to exercise
Judgment and Jurisdiction <hi>by known Statute and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
Law;</hi> the King is censurable, deposable at the
Pleasure of the Multitude, as they fancy him to have
transgressed. The Magistrate cannot be censured, be
punished, but by Law; the meanest, the basest of
Subjects, may arrest, cite, convene the King before the
<hi>undèrived Majesty of the Community,</hi> he may be judged
by the arbitrary Law that is in the Closet of their
Hearts, and that not only for real Misdemeanour, for
real male-administration, but upon fansied, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Fears and Jealousies, and these not evident by any
apparent Act or Attempt, but intended. If this be
not to seat themselves upon the Tribunal of God, who
hath reserved as peculiar to himself, to judge and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
mens Hearts and Intentions, I know not what
else can be it, except it be that those Seraphical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
make so bold with Almighty God to unfold the
Secrets of Predestination, and to define who are the
Elect, who the Reprobate. Any man that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left but common Sense will chuse rather to live
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:33502:99"/>
the most private and obscure Life, than to expose and
oppose himself with an idle nominal Title of Honour,
to the most corrupt and corrupted Judgments and
Affections of an ignorant, injust, and indiscreet Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
I pray you, when neither the true Grandeur
and Splendour of Majesty, nor the sacred Power of
Empire, nor the highest Pitch of Reverence and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
due to so sacred a Function, and so sacred a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can shelter and protect him, who can be so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
as not only to embrace an empty Title, <hi>Ixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
cloud, but run the hazzard of total Ruine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Disgrace?</p>
            <p>I know what will be answered, good Kings are in
no Danger; this Terrour is only a Terrour, a Curb to
bad Kings. The contrary this day appears, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
the best of Kings are most in danger. Who
knoweth not how ambitious, factious, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Spirits, are most ingenious and solicite, where
no real and just Challenge can be made against a good
King, by specious and spurious Pretexts to incense and
inflame with Fury the erring and deceived Multitude,
who loath things present and at hand, and promise
to themselves foolishly greater and better things by a
Change. Not unlike to a man sick of a burning and
raging Fever, imagineth this or that Bed he lyeth in
is the cause of his Pain; change him to another Bed,
in his Fancy he expects to recover Health, yet is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed,
and putteth himself in a worse Condition.
It is easie for subtle and crafty Spirits to make people
apprehend so, because of the present sense of some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Pressures or Incommodities in the Government:
Which is unavoidable here, because we are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to enjoy a <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Republick,</hi> or a <hi>More's Vtopia,</hi>
an <hi>Eutopia</hi> indeed, that were Heaven upon Earth: that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33502:99"/>
is, there is no Government no where so compleatly
perfect, that it wanteth altogether its Incommodities,
and none so imperfect which hath not with it it's own
Commodities. I may say of the most perfect and best
ordered Government, what the Fathers said against
the <hi>Pelagians, Omnis nostra perfectio imperfecta perfectio;</hi>
there is none so happy that hath not with the greatest
Commodities some Incommodities, and so we may say
with the <hi>Comick, aut haec cum illis habenda, aut illa cum
istis admittenda;</hi> We must resolve to endure some Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
in the best Government, rather than disturb
and destroy Government, and lose the excellent and
sweet Fruits we have by it. Hence they press upon
the weaker and less Understanding, but more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
People, the present seen and felt Inconveniences,
and possess them with Fears and Jealousies of more
and greater ensuing dangers <hi>(Fraus in parvis,</hi> saith <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
sibi fidem praestruit, ut cum operae-precium est magnâ
cum mercede fallat)</hi> that they ought not to lie under
these Burdens, and to be nakedly exposed to more
imminent Dangers, lest unprovided they be taken up
and destroyed. When these Male-contents have laid
this Foundation, then they raise the work by liberal
undertaking, and like the Devil their Father promise
to the gulled people, <hi>Matth. 4. Omnia haec tibi dabo:</hi>
to deliver them from all their Pressures, incumbent
Burthens, and imminent fansied Dangers. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by their big words and promises conceive great
Hopes, cry up those <hi>Achitophels,</hi> those <hi>Absalons,</hi> those
<hi>Shebaes,</hi> as the only Worthies, upon whom should be
devolved the whole Trust and Care of State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
of Reformation of State, of Church. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
these false Hopes, which are but false Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Molaas,</hi> they personate such as had no private
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33502:100"/>
ends, were only publick Souls, resolved to spend
themselves, nay offer themselves a Sacrifice for the
People; they speak as smooth as <hi>Absalon.</hi> and will be
thought to desire nothing but Piety and Purity in the
Church, and Justice, Peace, Liberty, and plenty in
the State.</p>
            <p>When the multitude are thus bewitched, then they
advance the Work, they desire the Assistance of the
numerous and popular part to bring this glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
to effect; pretending the Glory of God,
the Purity of Religion, the Liberty of the Persons,
and the Propriety of the Goods of the Subjects. The
poor people follow <hi>Absalon</hi> in his Treason, usurping
the Crown, pretending he is about to offer a great
Sacrifice to God, but intended to pull the Crown from
his Fathers head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nemo repentè fuit turpissimus,</hi> when they have thus
gained the popular Affection, and are Masters of their
Hearts and Lives; They strike not first at Royalty, but
express their Zeal and Courage in accusing the great
States-men, of purpose to leave the good Prince naked
and destitute of all Good Counsel, and by fierce accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them, and charging them with all the Evils
they fancy in the Government, to flow from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
their Counsels and Courses have upon Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
they prove themselves innocent to the World.
They hope, having set them by their places, they shall
make place for themselves, to make King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at their own Devotion: and before they fail in
this, another Government they will erect. They set
on the furious multitude against men, not only inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
but well deserving, making the people believe
that they are the Authors and Abettors of all Evil and
Mischief, whether real or fancyed, present; and that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33502:100"/>
these are the only Rubs stand up betwixt them and an
happy Government. If they can make no relevant
Endictment, no legal proof against them, before
some of them be not gone, new Laws, new Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
shall be made never to be a leading case hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and others shall suffer first as <hi>Papistical,</hi> but if that
appear not, then as <hi>Praelatical,</hi> but if this cannot be
charged upon them, (a high Crime truly to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a maintainer of that Order, Christ hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
to preserve his Church) they are Incendiaries
<hi>in State, Malignants in Church,</hi> disaffected to the true
Protestant (which what it is but negatively we
could never yet know, for ten of them cannot agree
upon a positive Faith) Religion. And such, say the
<hi>Achitophels</hi> of this time, are the close Enemies of
Church, of State, of Religion, &amp;c. and so much the
more dangerous because they carry their malignant
Purposes, Designs, and Courses so closely, that no
Proofs can be made against them.</p>
            <p>The People thus engaged, thus by Fury enraged,
cry out, crucifie them, crucifie them: are made guilty,
and run so far upon the score, as they cannot be taken
off again.</p>
            <p>If it fall forth so, that <hi>these Worthies</hi> miss their ends,
and others succeed in the places of the displaced; then
they cry out, the malignant Party prevaileth still.
The Pilots are changed, not the Tempest. There is
no Remedy, Power must do it, the Kingdom must
put it self in a Posture of Defence; <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> the
Safety of all, of Religion, of Liberty, of Property, and
what is dear to us, calleth for it; for it is <hi>extremus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitatis
casus,</hi> it hath come to the last Push. But I
pray you who are the competent Judges to determine,
that our case is such? None else but those Worthies,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33502:101"/>
those who are animated with a publick Soul, who are
dead to private ends, have no more life, but what is
to be spent for the Publick, for the safety of it; who
have already, as good Patriots, layed their Lives, their
Honours, their Fortunes at the stake. There must then
be a Power in some hands (God knoweth the worst,
and that have least right) to command men, raise
Arms, seize all Ammunition, command what Supplies
of money is necessary, for <hi>so great, so glorious a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
to rectifie what is amiss, to right what is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted
in Church and State, to repell the dangers
incumbent and imminent, otherwise they are not
sufficiently enabled, for the great Work, <hi>the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the King and Kingdom, Church and State,
Law and Liberty,</hi> and what else is really or imaginably
dear to us.</p>
            <p>In end an <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> that terrour of all
popular terrours, is introduced, is practised; true <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi>
and <hi>Royalty</hi> is wrested from the true Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and the thing we fear most, is placed in a wrong,
a worse, an unlawful hand. The Effects are more
bitter, the Charge is infinitely above all we or our
Predecessors did complain of in many past Ages; the
pressures are intended and multiplied, and total ruine
to the Kingdom is threatned: onely this difference
is observable, that where before with a less bountiful
Duty, Religion and Royalty, Justice and Peace might
have been maintained, nothing could be obtained to
strengthen Sovereignty; but now we are become so
lavish, so prodigal, we give twenty, ten, five parts
of our Goods, our Revenues, spare not our Jewels,
our Ear-rings, to make up a molten Calf; so apt, so
prone is our corrupt Nature to a wicked course. And
whereas before we were like <hi>Rachel,</hi> in the streets, in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33502:101"/>
our shops, crying, we are undone with Subsidies, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> saying with <hi>Micah,</hi> we are robbed of
our Silver, which either we made or were to make
our god: now in pressures voluntarily undergone,
which infinitely transcend all pressures before seen or
felt, we are as speechless as the unworthy Servant in
the Gospel. In this we are not unlike to little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who, when they fall of themselves, and hurt
themselves pitifully, cry not at all, but if any touch
them, and they fall, wth little or no hurt, they cry
out bitterly.</p>
            <p>You see then how easie it is upon this ground main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by our Sectaries, our Adversaries, to disquiet
State and Kingdom, to unking Kings at pleasure.
And that it is so, would to God the Lecture is read
to us this time in the deplorable state of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
did not with much grief and sorrow make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the least-seeing Eye, and did not cry it aloud
in the deafest Ear.</p>
            <p>That the best of Kings, most pious and just in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and of sweetest temper, are liable to these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
this black day of ours confirmeth it; by-gone
Stories evidence it. Was there ever a meeker, a mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Governour upon Earth, than <hi>Moses the meekest of
men,</hi> sensible of no injury done against himself, zealous
of wrongs done to God, and quick enough when
<hi>Aaron</hi> was wronged? Was there ever a greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hatched and set on foot against any than him?
<hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> with two hundred and

Heads are swallowed up living, in Body and Soul, into
Hell; a fearful Example, the first Rebellion we read
of, and so exemplarily punished, that <hi>Optatus</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Milevis,</hi> writing against <hi>Parmenian,</hi> observeth, that
the like is not to be found, to be read again in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
To <hi>Moses</hi> add <hi>David,</hi> not onely a man, but a
King according to God's heart, and one as apt and
inclinable to pardon offences committed against his
Person, that the like you find not, except it be the
Example we have this day before our Eyes; yet what
Treasons were intended, acted, and attempted against
him, Scripture doth plentifully record. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was
not one of the worst Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> yet was he so
over-ruled, or over-awed rather by his Lords and
Councellours, that he confesseth of himself, <hi>The King
was not he that could withstand them,</hi> that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to deliver up <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> the Servant and Prophet
of God, into the hands of their Power and Malice.
Many more may be adduced. <hi>Augustus,</hi> the sweetest
of <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, <hi>Titus,</hi> the <hi>love</hi> and
<hi>delight</hi> of mankind, were tossed and beaten with the
same Tempests. It is infallibly then certain, that the
best of Kings cannot be secured, where this Tenet of
our Adversaries is maintained, especially when Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do preach it as a Truth revealed from Heaven,
to aver that Rebellion is obedience; nay, a necessary
Duty which God commandeth; and Jurists and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
hold, it is consonant to Justice, the established
and practised Laws and Customs of the Land; the
Divine secureth their Consciences, and the Jurist their
Estates and Persons, that they are put out of all fear
of Evil here, or in the Life to come. They will find
at last, that those blind Guides, with their People
misled, will fall in the ditch. God have mercy upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33502:103"/>
the poor multitude who are deceived; the Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
have need of great Repentance before they can
have mercy with God, or should find it with the
King.</p>
            <p>What a fearful thing it is to put Princes, and the
best of Princes, most usually under this Tyranny, that
the People may lord over them, needeth no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
but to consider a multitude in its nature,
which is either the cruellest or tamest of Beasts. <hi>Quod
non audent singuli, audent universi. Livie</hi> telleth us,
that this is the natural temper and constitution of a
multitude; <hi>Vt serviat humiliter, aut dominetur superb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

sciunt. Et non fermè desunt irarum ministri indulgentes,

Expression is full in what we have said.</p>
            <p>In sum, by these new-devised State-principles, no
Kingdom, no State, can be long in quiet, in peace;
no Kings, no Governours can be secured; by these
Maxims we may change Kings and Governours as
often as Moons, learn the Policy of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and
practise it too, that if we be not successful in War,
or have not a plentiful Year, or be troubled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
with any Tempest more than ordinary, all may
be laid upon the misfortune, demerit, or mis-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King, and he, <hi>Ionas</hi>-like, thrown into
the Sea, to appease the Tempest, another enthroned,
to live and reign no longer than we please. A goodly
Tenure for a Kiug.</p>
            <p>Another Argument I bring against this Paradox,
which is this: by this Principle, if it hold good, all
Title to a Kingdom by <hi>right of Conquest</hi> is made void;
for this cannot be said to be derived from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity

               <hi>by contract and voluntary consent.</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture is clear and full for the lawful Title of
<hi>a Sovereign by Conquest.</hi> Otherwise we must deny <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Title over <hi>Aram,</hi> and other Neighbour conterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Kingdoms to <hi>Israel.</hi> God, by his Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>
commanded submission, subjection, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and enjoyned them to pray
for him, and for Peace to his Government; I hope
none will deny his Right to be just, and that by
no other Title than Conquest. Our Saviour did
submit to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Government over the <hi>Iews,</hi> paid
Tribute, and by his <hi>Ius Regale,</hi> his Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Coin, proved <hi>Caesar</hi>'s just Title, that he silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the <hi>Iews,</hi> as much at that time miscarried,
that by their Native Liberty, and God's special Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
they were not to submit to any stranger, as
we are now adayes upon our fancied Conceits.

de translat. Imper.</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> in his Book, which we
have often cited in this little Treatise.</p>
            <p>It is easie to bring a great many more Arguments
to destroy this erroneous Tenet, pernicious to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
it self; onely because we are weary of it, give
me leave in the Close to shew you, that it is <hi>morbus
complicatus;</hi> a Disease, a Distemper made up of the
confluence of many together; and that it hath involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within, or adherent to, and coherent with it, a
great many Absurdities, contrary to Truth in Sacred
Scripture revealed, to sound Reason and Policy. I
shall onely point at them, and leave the enlarging of
them to the judicious Reader.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:33502:104"/>
            <p>1. First, it is absurd to say and maintain in true
Philosophy, that <hi>the Community</hi> is <hi>primum subjectum,</hi>
the first Seat and Subject in which Sovereignty is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fixed. How can it be said so, seeing in
them it was never found, never actuated, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised?
<hi>Vana est potentia quae nunquam reducitur in
actum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Next, this Principle presupposeth the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
of Creatures, Men, to be like <hi>Cadmus</hi> off-spring,
<hi>de terrâ nati,</hi> sprung out of the Earth; <hi>Iuvenes aquilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
creati;</hi> or which is worse, in origine, like to the
most imperfect of living Creatures, <hi>Animalia de putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
orta;</hi> Creatures coming from Corruption it self:
which Paradoxes how well they sute with the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of humane Condition, and which is more, with
the Goodness and Wisdom of God in the Creation of
all: and lastly, how consonant to sacred Truth in
Scripture revealed: if these be well considered, then
I am hopeful our new Statists will forsake their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, this Tenet of our Sectaries presupposeth
that all men coming into the World, are <hi>Iure</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegio
naturae,</hi> by the Right and Priviledge of Nature
<hi>originally born equal, independent one from another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
desparity or Difference one from another.</hi> This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to the word of God, that teacheth God
did fix Government in <hi>Adam,</hi> before the Woman was
made, or Children begotten by him. Is not every
one that cometh into the World begotten of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Is he not thus by the Law of God and Nature
to submit and subject himself in Reverence and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Father? Is he not then so far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>original Power inherent in himself,</hi> that he hath not
his own <hi>Original being in the Capacity of Nature,</hi> but
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33502:105"/>
from his Father? How then can he be freed <hi>from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to</hi> his Father? And if his Father be subject to
another, is he not by the same Law subject to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Superiour? Who can make this Subordination
void, except he will ranverse the Ordinance of God
and Nature? Where then is the Truth of this decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Maxim which worketh so much mischief, <hi>Quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
nascitur liber,</hi> every man is born a free-man in the
Forrest? Are they not subordinate, subject to their
pre-existent Father, and to his Superiour too, if he
have any? Is not the Female Sex by the Ordinance of
God and Nature inferiour and subordinate to the male?
Doth not Nature teach, that the Wife by the Law of
Nature is subject to the Husband; If you will believe
<hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Politicks, he telleth you that a man of
weak Understanding is subject to him who is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and prudent, and (if I forget not) that he is
<hi>naturâ servus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, this ground presupposeth <hi>Anarchy,</hi> to
be <hi>de facto</hi> pre-existent, really, and actually before
Order and Government. Christians must believe,
that as God created all things <hi>in numero, pondere, &amp;
mensurâ,</hi> in a compleat Perfection of all things, every
Creature having its own intrinsecal Weight and
Worth, not only in it's own due Proportion and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but in a measure orderly disposed for it's Accord
and Being, with the Universe; and must believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
that he hath disposed of all things in that
Order which establisheth an unrepealable Government,
by which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the whole Universe, and every
spece and individual in the Universe is preserved and
continued in it's happy natural Being. Who then
can be so stupid to think that God Almighty sends
man in the World destitute of this Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33502:105"/>
which is necessary for the happy Being of the
Abridgment of the World, for whom it was made in
a secondary respect? If the whole world without this
Order could not but return to a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> and
Mass, and from thence to an Annihilation, what other
can be the Condition of Mankind without order esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
to preserve it? See <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Testimony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. cited above. If they will speak philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically,
they must confess <hi>Habitus est naturâ prior pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatione,</hi>
the Habit in nature is presupposed to be exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
before the Privation; How come we then from
our new-state-Philosophers to hear, that Anarchy was
in Nature, was in the world before Government?</p>
            <p>6. Fifthly, by the same Ground, by Consequence it
will as necessarily follow, that <hi>Ius paternum &amp; jus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritale,</hi>
the lawful Authority of a Father over his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and a Husband over his Wife, are derived from
the Children and Wife, and that Children and Wife
in some cases may resume their Power derived from
them, and their native Liberty. If any aver so,
he is <hi>Flagris dignus,</hi> to be cudgelled, not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, this Tenet if it be not blasphemous,
it is certainly sacrilegious; for to say that Power is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically,
originally, fundamentally inherent in the
Community, or as the observator saith, that in the
people is <hi>an underived Majesty,</hi> robbeth God and Christ
of his Glory. Scripture declareth them to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Authors of all Sovereignty, Glory, and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
as we proved above. Doth not Scripture express
the immense Sovereignty of God and Christ over the
World and Church, by the <hi>Compellation of King?</hi> If
you will have Kings then to be the <hi>Derivatives of the
People,</hi> take heed you make not God and Christ the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33502:106"/>
               <hi>Derivatives of Derivatives,</hi> which any pious mind will
be loth to think.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, when the King's Right is made to
be such, that the same <hi>Sovereign Power is habitually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi>
in the People, and the Power in some cases is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumable,</hi>
How can you make the King's Title complete?
Law is against it, when the Donor is <hi>dans &amp; retinens,</hi>
as Jurists speak, <hi>giving a right, yet retaining it;</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not over a full and entire Right: nor can the
Donee lay just claim to it. It is a maxim without
Exception among them, <hi>Nulla obligatio consistere potest
quae à voluntate promittentis statum accipit;</hi> the Donor
is not tyed to make his Bond and Gift good, if at
pleasure he may resume it, as we spoke before.</p>
            <p>8. Lastly, leaving many Absurdities more untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the last place we place it, which in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
moveth us most to abhor it, that you which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this Tenet, must either give us new Bibles, or
find out new Commentaries to the Bible; for what
you say is right down opposite, and contradictory to
all the Bibles we have as yet seen: our Bibles say, <hi>Dixi
dii estis,</hi> I have said, (that is, God himself) ye are
Gods; <hi>&amp; filii Excelsi omnes,</hi> and all of you are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the most high: your Bibles (or some as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
as ours) must say, <hi>Diximus dii estis, &amp; filii
terrae omnes;</hi> we the People have said, ye are Gods,
and all of you sprung from us, from the Earth. We
may say no more with Scripture, <hi>Dominus dat &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert
regna;</hi> the Lord giveth and changeth Crowns and
Kingdoms: but it is the People that do it. It must
no more be thought upon, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
it must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that the Powers
that be are ordained of God; nay, they are ordained
of the People. <hi>David</hi> was far mistaken, who said,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33502:106"/>
               <hi>Power belongeth unto the Lord.</hi> For Christ's <hi>Potestas da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
de super,</hi> saying, that Power is from above, and by
Donation from above, we must have it changed unto
a <hi>Potestas data de subter,</hi> that all Power is given from
below: infinite more of this kind may be adduced.
Let me intreat our Brethren to consider, how sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
a thing it is to rob God of his Glory; who
hath said, <hi>My Glory I will not give to another;</hi> how
tender he is of his divine Prerogative, to be <hi>King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> not only by his Power
over-ruling them, but also effective, endowing them
with Royalty from above; how dishonourable a thing
it is to place it in so wrong a hand, so base a prime
Subject; how they disgrace Kings and Sovereignty,
referring them to so base an origine; how they put
them in so ticklish and lubrick Condition, that better
being any thing than a King; how by this mean they
secure neither their Persons nor Functions, nor either
can be truly or appellatively sacred; how they open
a door to all disquiet in State, in Church, to all Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Rebellion; how they lead People on a way
destructory to themselves, nay to humane Society, and
consequently any Being at all; how, finally, they serve
the Prince of Disorder, and run head-long and head-strong
to Perdition; from which, good Lord, deliver
both them and us.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Scripture by Examples teacheth us, that Kings
of Peoples making, have not had God's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
but have ruinated their Makers.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF any will look upon Scripture with ordinary Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and Judgment, it will appear, that when
people have presumed by themselves to set up a
King of their own, neither he nor they have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in that work. There is reason enough for it; how
can a Blessing be expected, when and where God and
Christ are robbed of their Right, and the People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
usurp, and sacrilegiously intrude upon
them.</p>
            <p>The first King the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had, after that
they were formed into a politick Body, is <hi>Moses;</hi> who
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33. is termed <hi>King of Ieshurun.</hi> To speak tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Government then and till <hi>Saul</hi>'s days was
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God retaining the Government in his own
hands, and actuating it by his Deputies and Vice-Roys.
The People had no hand in making him King. He
was far from them when God sent him to be King
over <hi>Israel.</hi> That his Right was just, his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
successful, none will deny. The next named
King is <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the base Son of <hi>Gideon,</hi> and as base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
created King too. <hi>Israel</hi> did offer an hereditary Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the Crown to <hi>Gideon,</hi> after that he had vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them from the Tyranny and Oppression of the
<hi>Midianites.</hi> He did refuse it; he knew that was not the
right way of purchase, nor Gods appointed time come:

               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:33502:107"/>
Consider how this Work is hatched, perfected, and
what is the end of it. He sets the work on foot by
his alliance the men of <hi>Sichem,</hi> to do for their own
Bloud and Brood. He useth an Argument that was
strong enough in those dayes, better that he one and
alone should reign over them, than the seventy Sons
of <hi>Ierubbaal.</hi> It seemeth that the World was not
then so much out of love with Monarchy, nor doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so much upon Aristocracy, as we do now in this
declining Age. A special mean to enable <hi>Abimelech</hi>
for the Crown, and to effect this unlawful Royalty,
they agree to enrich him with Sacrilege, by spoiling
their God's Temple, and taking out of it threescore
and ten pieces of Silver. To make all sure, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is made, it is sworn too; They were so much
in love with this new Covenant, that they called
their God <hi>Baal Berith,</hi> the Lord of the Covenant;
They will have God to own the Covenant, or then
they Idoled the Covenant so much, that they would
renounce God, if he would not be <hi>Baal Berith, the
God of the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What followeth upon all this? <hi>Abimelech</hi> enriched
by Sacriledge, strengthened by his Alliance the <hi>Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>
they bound to him, not onely by the Bonds of
Nature, but by a tye of a Sacred Covenant, a Vow
interposed, all <hi>Israel</hi> over-awed come to his side;
and the first Act of their Power and goodness is Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they murther the seventy lawful Sons of <hi>Ierub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baal;</hi>
the engaged in mischief knew there was no
safety, but to take away the right Stock, root and
branch. Yet God miraculously preserved <hi>Iotham,</hi> not
onely to denounce Gods vengeance against them both,
the men of <hi>Sichem</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the contrivers of
this mischievous Plot, but to see it executed. You
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33502:108"/>
see then, the first popular King (I mean of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
making) beginneth his work (I mean his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of the Crown) with Sacriledge, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and cruel Murther, and innocent shedding of
bloud.</p>
            <p>Look upon the Success. He is made, he is constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
King, with an uniform, an universal consent:
an universal and uniform Consent is no sure Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the course so established is warrantable, and
approved by Almighty God. Look upon more yet,

Judge not then of a course by a speedy, a universal, a
successful success, to conclude, it is Gods work, and
marvellous in our eyes. It is hard to work great
Works but with great Time, our Nature is averse
from that, the Devil and the World do contribute
their Wisdom and Power to impede a good Work.
It is not so in bad courses; <hi>Moses</hi> could scarce disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
the People of <hi>Israel</hi> in the space of forty years,
in the School of the Wilderness, to obey God, but in
forty dayes they were able enough to erect Idolatry
and practise it. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wondereth
that the <hi>Galatians</hi> were so quickly turned from the
truth of the Gospel. But to reclaim them from their
Errours, was as toilsome and longsome pains and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
as a woman hath to bring forth a child.</p>
            <p>Although Vengeance be delayed, it will come at

betwixt the men of</hi> Sichem <hi>and</hi> Abimelech, <hi>and the men
of</hi> Sichem <hi>dealt treacherously with him:</hi> v. 23. The first
who gave him the Kingdom, sware and covenanted
with him, are the first Traytors, or rather the scourge
of God to begin his Mischief.</p>
            <p>But how, I pray you, goeth this work on? you
have Covenant after Covenant. The first Oath was
unlawful, now treacherously they sware another Oath
against him. What is the Solemnity? They keep a
solemn Festival; (Religion must ever be a stalking
horse) They go to the House of their God, they seal
a new Covenant, a new Association; they not onely
unking him, but also excommunicate him too: <hi>v.</hi> 27.
No Covenants, no Associations, seal them, strengthen
them with Oaths as many as you will, with Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
too, making <hi>Sacramenta pietatis vincula iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
the seals of Piety, the Bonds of Iniquity, they will
neither bind sure, nor make unlawful pacts or compacts
lasting. Read and consider <hi>Psal. 11. Psal.</hi> 83.</p>
            <p>The story is worthy your looking on. Come on
then. <hi>Zabul, Abimelech</hi>'s Governour at <hi>Sichem</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed,
he must comply with the second Covenant.
<hi>Abimelech</hi> advanceth with his Forces towards <hi>Sichem,</hi>
killeth them that sallied out, mans the Gates, enters
the City, kills all in the City, except such as flee to
the Tower: they escape not, all of them are consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with fire. You see then how the first Authors
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>

            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:33502:109"/>
When he hath done Vengeance upon them, he
blocks up <hi>Thebez;</hi> God having done Vengeance by
him upon the Faction, he taketh Vengeance upon
<hi>Abimelech,</hi> kills him by the hand of a Woman, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
end, for a King, a Souldier, and that by
a piece of a Milstone which crushed his Skull. To shun
Ignominy, he calls to his Armour-bearer to kill him
by his Sword, that it be not said hereafter, that he
died by the hand of a Woman.</p>
            <p>This is the first King we read of in Scripture that
was the Creature of the People: How he atchieved it,
how he managed it, and what end both he and they
had, is enough to make us fall out of love with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Kings, the Donatives of the People.</p>
            <p>To this same purpose some bring the Example of
<hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who hold that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was King only by
Gods Permission, and not by his Commission over the
ten Tribes; and that to punish <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for his Uncleanness and Idolatry. Many things
might be said <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con;</hi> we purpose not to dispute
the point accurately. The Reasons which incline
some learned men to hold this Opinion, amongst
others, are these: That there is no anointing bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on <hi>Ieroboam</hi> at his Entry to the Kingdom. The
symbolical Ceremony of his Entry is expressed, by
renting of a Garment in twelve pieces; he taketh ten
of them to himself, Scripture mentioneth not the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of them. The People grieved, pitch upon <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam;</hi>
either by him to get redress of their Grievances,
or otherwise, if that be refused, to assume him to be
their King.</p>
            <p>Consider how the Change is effected: There is a
specious shew made of a glorious Reformation, of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Subjects of many great Pressures, with which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33502:109"/>
they were overburthened in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign: by heavy
Impositions laid upon them to build the Temple, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
Palaces, and to entertain the Magnificence of his
Court, never so rich as in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign, and never
more grudging complaining. These Pretences were
no less specious and real, than the specious and spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Pretences of our glorious Reformers, and zealous
Patriots to day: great Promises are made, great Hopes
of better things are conceived, but behold the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</p>
            <p>God in his secret but just Providence left <hi>Rhehoboam</hi>
to the power of bad Counsellors, he refuseth Redress
of Grievances, the ten Tribes revolt, enthrone <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
and made him King. To bring all to a wished
end, the People and their new King begin at Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Religion must ever be pretended, whatever be
the work, whatever be the Intention. How is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
entreated? By King and People it is subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Policy. Religion is made as Hangings for the
House. New Calves, new Altars, new Feasts are ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and instituted: with a specious Protestation and
Profession, that God may be more frequently, more
fervently served; and the People with more ease to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
to frequent the Service. To this purpose, the
Calves are erected at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> The way of
serving God before established was too too trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
the true cause was, the King feared if Gods
Ordinance were kept, and the ten Tribes should go to
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> to keep the solemn Feasts, do God service
according to his Prescript; true Religion preserved
would reduce the ten Tribes, to their due Obedience
to the house of <hi>David.</hi> New devices in State, in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
necessitate the Authors and Abettors to new
devices in Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:33502:110"/>
That this work may have no Rubbs, the old Priests
must be gone; the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> must be rooted out
Root and Branch: It cannot be, but the old Levites
will cross the new established Government. The ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of the people, Tinkers, Coblers, Coachmen, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
&amp;c. become <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s and his new Subjects
Priests.</p>
            <p>This done, he and they take as much Authority
over and above <hi>their God,</hi> as before they did over and
above <hi>their King:</hi> A Calf must be their God.</p>
            <p>What is the Success? Here is a thorow Reformation
in Church and State, all is unanimously agreed upon
by King and People. Consider the Consequents:
They make to themselves a King to remedy their
Grievances; the King maketh them cast-aways. They
banish from them the true Levites, they place in their
stead the Scum and Dross of the vulgar. By him and
his Successors all the erroneous Religions amongst their
Neighbours are admitted and received; any Religion
is allowed except the only true one. But what? Is
not the King by this made glorious at home, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
abroad? No: no such thing. He is made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of all Kings; his <hi>Motto</hi> for ever is, <hi>Ieroboam
that made</hi> Israel <hi>sin.</hi> This is all <hi>his Excellency</hi> we read
of in Scripture, this is the Horn of his Exaltation.
How fare the People? free-born people, under a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and just King of their own, setting up a King of
themselves, wrought and effected at last their own,
their Kings, their States utter Extirpation, and of free-born
Subjects become the Slaves of strange Kings and
Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>This Story duely considered, is able to rectifie the
Errours of this time, if mens minds be not fore-stalled
with damnable Prejudice. It layeth open to us, that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:33502:110"/>
Kings when they are Peoples Donatives are not Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and discovereth, how popular Reformations (so
much now in this Distempered Age cryed up) are not
Gods Ordinance, and most unhappy in the end:
howsoever for a time, when God is to punish a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they may have some seeming Success, and some
lasting Durance; God in his Wisdom giving way to
them to punish our Sins, and to try our Constancy in
his Truth. Both the one and the other Story prove,
that these Courses when they prevail are the worst of
Judgments. If you joyn them, and be pleased to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
them with our times, you will find a full <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
remonstrance and resemblance with us in many
fit Resemblances; my Prayer to God is to give us all
Repentance, and that speedily, lest the like or worse
befall us, when we shall have neither Opportunity
nor Place, nor Power to help it, and too late acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our Errour.</p>
            <p>All Divines do rightly hold, that <hi>Omnis Christi actio
nostra instructio,</hi> never was any thing acted by Christ,
which hath not in it something to instruct us in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Knowledge and Duty. That Christ was truly a
King born, we proved it before; The wise men did
him royal Homage while he was in his swadling-cloaths;
he entered <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in royal Pomp and
Magnificence; When his Disciples honoured him by
the name of King, he did not refuse it; when the
<hi>Iews</hi> were offended at it, he told them it was not
just, but also necessary; and if all should fail in that
Duty, the Stones would proclaim him King, and do
him Homage; he avouched it before <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he
was looking Death in the Face; by a special Direction
of Gods Providence it was written upon the Cross,
<hi>The Altar where he offered that propitiatory and expiatory
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:33502:111"/>
Sacrifice;</hi> His Grave was sealed as Kings Tombs use to
be: from the Cradle to his Cross, from his Mothers
Womb, till he is buried, in all the times of his Life,
his Royalty and Kingdom is manifested. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of all, when the people would have made him
a King, he disclaimed it, he would have none of it.
When by commission and trust he might have been Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter,
umpire betwixt two brethren differing about the
moitie of their inheritance, he refused it. Many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for it, but without all controversie this is one, to
teach all Christians, that Sovereignty cannot be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the people, from the Communitie: He would
have none of that dignity from them, he chose rather
to want it, than to have it from a wrong hand.</p>
            <p>It is evident by what we have said, that sacred
Truth, as revealed to us in Scripture, as understood
by the Fathers and Martyrs of the Primitive Church,
and sound Reason, doth plead for the truth we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and <hi>Royalty</hi> in a King, is by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
dependency, derivation, and collation, from
God and Christ, who are Kings of Kings, and Lords
of Lords; and it is not onely a simple Errour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
pernicious, sacrilegious, and derogatory to the Honour
of God and Christ, to make it to be derived and
transferred from the underived Majesty of the People;
and that in such a measure, by such a tenor, that they
have it in what portion, what proportion they will
bestow it, with no more certainty and security than
<hi>to be Tenants at will,</hi> to be enthroned, dethroned,
kinged, unkinged at their pleasure. Having said

be said) to establish the positive part, <gap reason="foreign">

worketh or effecteth the work, yet so as some Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:33502:112"/>
sign or created act is previous and antecedent
to, or coherent with the work effected. By Baptism
the baptized obtaineth Remission of Sins and Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Nature; This Effect is immediately wrought
by God himself: The reason is evident, because As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion
of, or Immersion in water of their own nature
cannot take away the Stain and Guilt of Sin, nor state
the baptized in the state of Adoption and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The School expresseth it barbarously, yet preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly
enough; <hi>Deus concurrit ad,</hi> God is concurrent
and operateth with his Ordinance, and by his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
supervenient of his Grace and Power, effecteth
that which Baptism in its nature abstractly cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce:
So as remission of sin, and regeneration <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur
ad Baptismum,</hi> followeth with, and is conjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Baptism. The School giveth us the way to
discern it when it is so; and that is whensoever <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
creatum,</hi> the interposed act or previous disposition
hath <hi>no natural contingency with the effect,</hi> the work
wrought must be produced by some supervenient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
more eminent agent, which is God. School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do confess that the Sacraments do not confer grace
<hi>Vi naturali, Physicâ &amp; inhaerente,</hi> by their natural, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal,
and inherent Power; but <hi>Vi morali, superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali,
&amp; superveniente extrinsecâ,</hi> but by some extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
supervenient Power.</p>
            <p>The like you may observe in sacred Orders; it is
confessed amongst all understanding and sound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
that by Admission into sacred Orders the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
receiveth a supernatural Power in supernatural
things, for supernatural ends. This is not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the interposing of an humane Act, the Imposition
of the Bishops hands, and yet it is most certain, this
is not done by the Bishops act, it is the Power of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33502:113"/>
God concurring and cooperating with his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>In moral things you may see the like, a man marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a woman, becoming her head and Lord, there
precedeth this Power and Right, a created hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Act, the voluntary Consent of the Woman;
yet it cannot be said, that her Consent endoweth or
investeth the man with this marital Right; it floweth
from, and followeth immediately the inviolable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Almighty God: and this tye is so strict, so
perpetual by the same Ordinance, that it cannot be
made void but by God himself; <hi>No man can put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whom God hath joyned together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This holds in the Constitutions of Kings. Some
humane act, as Election, Succession, or Conquest is
interposed, but none of them hath any <hi>natural Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency</hi>
with Sovereignty and Majesty, that by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
Power they can collate it, produce it, work
it, or effect it. The Collation must necessarily then
be immediately from God; and the same way as in
sacred Orders. This was the Sense of the ancient
Church, who ordinarily institute a Parallel, betwixt
Prince and Priest; that as the Priest hath his sacred pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
spiritual immediately from God, so the Prince hath
his sacred Sovereign temporal power independently

God surreptitiously to invade the Kings Right, his

are Kings, <hi>quà</hi> Kings <hi>reduplicativè,</hi> immediately from
God, and by his Donation of Power. 2. As Priests
have a Power incommunicable to any besides, so Kings
have their Sovereignty incommunicable to Subjects, or
any else. 3. That to rob, or surreptitiously to steal
from Kings their sacred Prerogative, is sacrilegious
Usurpation, presumptuous Intrusion upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
no less, if no more, than for a Lay-man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude

            <p>By Scripture then and Antiquity it is clear, that the
interposed act humane whatsoever it be, whether Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Succession, Conquest, or any other lawful way,
doth not collate the Power, but design or declare the
person, and letteth not the Power to be of immediate
Collation from Almighty God; as when the Church
designeth or declareth a man for a sacred Function, it
is God only who bestoweth the supernatural Power,
Faculty, and Ability. Or it is in some case like to
that, when our King sendeth the honourable Order
of the Garter to a Duke or Prince abroad by the hand
of a Gentleman, the Gentleman intimateth it to the
person honoured, but the bestowing or collating of
the honour is from the power of the King, the sole
and proper Fountain of that Honour.</p>

Let this suffice to remove their first scruple: we
come next to examine that which both Jesuit and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan
make much of, that is, A private and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Person, may make away his own native and proper
Liberty, and enslave himself to a Lord and Master;
from hence they conclude, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Community or
Multitude may surrender their own native Liberty to
one or more to rule over them: See <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this Argument, <hi>lib. de Laicis, cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>Suarez,
lib. 3. defens. Doctr. Orthod. cont. Sect. Anglic.</hi> If we
would grant all this, yet this much we will gain, that
as a singular Person, when he hath made away his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to another, he cannot resume it, no, although
he hath made his bargain in a hard condition, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
to himself; then although we give
that their consequence is good, which we will never
grant, it will by as necessary consequence follow, that
when the People have devested themselves of that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
naturally inherent in them, and invested one or more
with it, they cannot resume it, no, not though they
have made it to their own disadvantage.</p>
            <p>It may be they will tell us, <hi>Argumentum à simili in
dissimili non concludit,</hi> that an Argument built upon a
Similitude concludeth not in the point of Dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
We will yield to them this with both our
hands, and upon the same ground we rejoyn, that
there is a wide disparity and difference betwixt the
two. 1. First, because it is certain, <hi>Nemo nascitur
naturâ servus,</hi> None by Nature cometh in the World
in the condition of a Slave. Nature in this is equally
Indulgent to all. But on the other side, it is as true,
<hi>Nemo nascitur liber ab Imperio,</hi> No man is born in that
condition to be free from Government, but with his
natural Being cometh into the World subject to some.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33502:115"/>
Every man is born subject to his Father, of whom
immediately he hath his Existence in Nature, and if
his Father be the subject of another, he is born a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to his Father's Superiour. 2. Next, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great difference; Every man by Nature hath an
immunity and liberty from <hi>despotical and herile Empire,</hi>
and in this may say, <hi>Possum facere de meo quod volo,</hi>
I have this privilege by the Law of God and Nature,
that I am enslaved to none: and consequently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his own voluntary act, making away this <hi>native
and natural liberty,</hi> he cannot be devested of it; and
in his bargain and covenant, may more and less en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
himself: but on the other side, God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have laid a necessity upon all men coming into
the World <hi>subesse imperio,</hi> to be subject to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Again, because this Government, this Empire,
this Sovereignty cannot protect us sufficiently, to make
us enjoy the sweet fruits of happy Government, <hi>Peace,
Righteousness, Plenty, Godliness and Honesty,</hi> except it be
<hi>entirely</hi> endowed with <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power to act its Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
preserve it self, protect us: Almighty God, as he
investeth the Sovereign with entire Sovereignty, so
hath he set the bounds of it, defined it; otherwise,
such is the corruption and natural repugnancy of
every one to it, that forthwith it should be rent in
pieces.</p>
            <p>It is accidental to any to render himself a Slave; it
is occasioned either by Force, as when one is taken by
an Enemy, he is <hi>Mancipium, Servus:</hi> or otherwise some
extreme necessity and indigency forceth one to enslave
himself, to sell his Liberty, to redeem him from Debt,
Death, or any ignominious and intolerable condition,
to state himself in a more tolerable one. In brief, it
is some supervenient necessity that forceth man to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:33502:116"/>
make away his native and natural Liberty <hi>à servitute:</hi>
but <hi>subesse imperio,</hi> to submit and subject to lawful
Government, congruous to the condition of man, and
necessary and convenient for the happy Being of man,
is natural, is necessary by the inviolable Ordinance of
God and Nature.</p>
            <p>This answer to their second Sophism cleareth the
sense of their Maxim, so much cryed up, and so much
abused, <hi>Quisque nascitur liber,</hi> every one is born a free
man; that we need not insist much upon it: yet
to make the general sense of the Maxim appear, and
to discover their adulterate and bastard sense; we say,
it is most true, that <hi>Quisque nascitur liber à servitute,</hi>
Every man is born a free man from slavery; but <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
nascitur liber ab imperio,</hi> none is born exempted
from the subjection of lawful Government, without
a subordination and subjection to a Superiour: Christ,
as man, was not exempted from this: It is recorded in
Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 51. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

did subject himself to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> his putative Father,
and <hi>Mary</hi> his true Mother: the word in the original
is the same which the Apostle useth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.
commanding obedience and subjection to Higher
Powers.</p>
            <p>It were very fit our opposites would consider what
Power the Father had over the Children, by the Law
of God and Nature; that to redeem himself from
Debt, from any distressed state and condition, he
might have enslaved his Children begotten of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
If this Power was not by the right of Nature,
by the warrant of God, I can see no other, for it
could not be by a mutual and voluntary act of Father
and Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:33502:116"/>
To shut up all in few words, give me leave to put
you in mind, that the Stoicks observe three Notions
of <hi>servitus,</hi> of Service and Subjection. 1. The one is,
when a man, contrary to native and natural Liberty,
is made a Slave to a Lord or Master: this they call
<hi>servitutem</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when a man hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
use, dispose another man's Person, as his other
Goods, at pleasure: for this cause the Scripture stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to call a Servant <hi>his Master</hi>'s <hi>Money.</hi> 2. The
other is, when a man's Person is confined or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that he is deprived of living at liberty as he lists;
as Criminals or Debtors; this kind of servitude they
call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when the liberty of going
where we will, or doing what is lawful at pleasure, is
taken from us. 3. The third is, a Servitude, as they
call it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, consisting in Subordination: in the
first sense, every man is born free: in the second sense,
some onely by misdemeanour or misgovernment are
restrained from the liberties of free Subjects: In the
third sense, no man is born free, but subject to his
Father, and to his Father's Father, his Father's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign;
so that all are born tyed to Obeisance and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Allegiance; and seeing Christ fulfilled so all
righteousness, that he subjected and submitted himself
to his Parents, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> too, we must deny to be
Christians, if we deny that we are born <hi>under the tye
of Allegiance.</hi> Of these three enough, we haste to
consider some more of their Popular Maxims and
Sophisms.

            <argument>
               <p>The Maxim, Quod efficit tale, est magis tale;
or Propter quod unumquodque tale, ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
magis tale; or Constituens constituto
potior, is examined.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>ROssaeus</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> and after them the <hi>Observator</hi>
have abused this Maxim infinitely to the great
abuse and wronging of Sovereignty, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Subject above the King, the disorderly
rout of the multitude above the Lord's anointed. The
<hi>Observator</hi> enunciates it thus, <hi>Quod efficit tale est magis
tale,</hi> that which maketh any thing such or such, is in
it self much more such or such; he assumes, but the
People make the King, give him all the Power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
he hath: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people are above the King,
<hi>&amp;c. Aristotle</hi> pronounceth the maxim thus, <hi>Propter
quod unumquodque est tale illud ipsum est magis tale.
Rossaeus, Brutus, Bouchier,</hi> and others give us it thus,
<hi>Constituens constituto potior,</hi> the Constituent is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than the constituted: but the People are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents
of Royalty: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Howsoever they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in the Expression, they agree in the Sense: let us
examine it.</p>
            <p>It were fitter to reserve this to our fourth Question,
but seeing the <hi>Observator</hi> maketh it his first Ground,
we resolve to shew the weakness of it here. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
this, although we would grant <hi>their major, their
Maxim,</hi> in the greatest and most vast Latitude of their
Conception, the Argument concludes not against us;
for the Assumption is as false as Falshood it self: we
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33502:118"/>
have proved that the people in no notion imaginable,
whether diffusively or collectively, or representatively
taken, are either the Efficients, or Constituents, or
Donors, or Authors Sovereignty or Sovereigns:
we might therefore without hurt to the Cause we
maintain, grant <hi>their Maejor, their Maxim.</hi> Yet that
we may undeceive the simpler sort, we will a little
scan the Truth and proper Sense of <hi>the maxim and
major.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no less truly than usually spoken, <hi>Qui versatur
generalibus, versatur dolosè:</hi> there is no readier a way
to deceive the ignorant and little knowing people than
by abusing general Maxims, which are current, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
their Force farther than they can reach. If
Commons, and almost all, even of better place and
understanding, were not too violently zealous for,
and impatient of Instrusion upon, or Violation of their
supposed Rights and Liberties, and were not by the
Corruption of Nature too too apt and facile to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Suggestions which are plausible to their Fancy and
Humour; and withal were not wanting to themselves
in Moderation, they could neither trust nor magnifie
so much such specious, deluding, and deceiving So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisms,
nor would they so madly and closely adhere
to their Masters and Teachers of such Doctrines, as to
be inflamed with Fury, to become mad in Impiety
and Rebellion, with such Impetuosity, that they cease
not, till they become their own Instruments, to ruine
themselves totally, and to bring upon themselves the
imaginary and groundless Evils that they most fear
from others.</p>
            <p>Philosophy teacheth us, that all such general Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
must be bounded and limited with their own true
Limitations and Qualifications, otherwise they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33502:119"/>
not necessarily, firmly. I learned of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in
the School, that this <hi>maxim, Propter quod unumquodque
est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale:</hi> requireth necessarily,
before it bring home the Conclusion, two Conditions.
1. The t'one is, <hi>Vt utrique insit,</hi> that what you are to
conclude, be both of them in the efficient and effect.
2. The t'other is, <hi>Vt recipiat majus &amp; minus,</hi> that
that is really in both, and predicated of both, have
such a Latitude, that it hath a Capacity of more and
less. Without these Limitations the Maxim will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
too much, which in <hi>right Logick</hi> is the equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of that, to conclude nothing.</p>
            <p>Seeing we intend a popular way, that the shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
may understand it, let us prove what we say by
Instances to the contrary, by examples to the contrary.
It is against Sense and Experience to conclude, This
maketh such a thing such, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it self is much more
such: for by the same way I reason, What maketh any
thing drunk, that is much more drunk: but Wine
maketh a man drunk: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Wine is much more
drunk. This concludes not, the reason is, because a
man may be drunk, but Drunkenness is neither inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in Wine, nor accident to Wine. This is taken
off then by that Limitation, <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Parliament cannot like these <hi>Maxims</hi> of the
<hi>Observators,</hi> and if they see and judge right, they must
make an Order against them, and this especially; for
by this Ground it will follow inevitably and necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Counties and Corporations of <hi>England</hi>
may make void all their Commissions given to the
Knights and Burgesses of the house of Commons, and
send others in their place. Nay, more will follow, that
they cannot make orders and Laws, but that the Counties
and Corporations may make much more, undo what
they do, repeal what they establish, establish and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
the contrary. Frame the Argument; The Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
is better and higher in place and dignity than the
constituted; but the Counties and Corporations are
the Constituents of the Knights of Shires, and Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the House of Commons; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may void
their Commissions; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may change the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,

repeal their Orders, establish other Laws contrary and

By this you may know where he put the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative

more shew of reason than the <hi>Observator's</hi> Tenet, who
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33502:120"/>
holdeth that the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> is in the Parliament;
and yet <hi>Buchanan</hi> is more justifiable for this reason;
because, where Majesty is, there is <hi>Legislative Power,</hi>
but according to the <hi>Observator</hi>'s mind, in the People
is the <hi>underived Majesty;</hi> let him then come home to
the Scotish Tenet, and make it an Article of their new
Covenant, or new Creed, (if they will) that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
Power</hi> is in the People, and the Parliaments
Orders and Statutes are only <hi>preparatory precognitions:</hi>
I know the <hi>Observator</hi> thinks to salve all this, that the
whole Power of the Gentry and Commons is entirely
transferred from the <hi>collective</hi> Body to the <hi>representative,</hi>
the <hi>Parliament.</hi> To this we answer two things:
1. The first is, ye and your Brother-assistants the <hi>Scots</hi>
are not of one mind, for in the beginning of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Troubles, when the Subjects there were prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Petitions, by their Declarations and Protestations,
they put all the Power in the collective Body, and kept
their distinct Tables. 2. Next, speak ingeniously and
candidly, <hi>Observator,</hi> shew us the reason of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Disparity, why the whole entire Power
of the Community (if any they have) should not be
<hi>totally</hi> and <hi>entirely</hi> derived from the People to the King,
when they devest themselves of their underived Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and invest the King with it, no less than the
whole entire Power of the whole Kingdom is devolved
upon the two Houses, and that irrevocably too, to
hold in the King, as in your Knights and Burgesses:
you are not able to shew it, but what with one hand
you take unjustly from the King, with another, but a
wrong hand, you ascribe to the Parliament. It is like
in times succeeding and after-ages our wise Kings will
learn to know what is <hi>their Power, Place and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
by that the Parliament hath assumed to them,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33502:120"/>
but we are hopeful they will never exercise it with such
Cruelty and Tyranny. I many times think upon it,
that as the extravagant Ambition and Usurpation of
the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> robbing Kings of their sacred
Right, and assuming to himself such superlative Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
Power for himself and his See, both in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals
and Temporals, hath wakened Christian Kings
to consider better of their sacred Prerogative; and by
what he unlawfully and antichristianly assumed to
himself, <hi>in temporalibus,</hi> to know what Trust God
Almighty hath given to his Vicegerents, his Kings;
so I am hopeful, if God hath mercy reserved for these
Kingdoms and Church, right Bounds and Limits will
be set to Subjects, which will produce happier and
sweeter Fruits of Government, than we see or feel
from these <hi>corrival, co-equal, co-ordinate, fansied Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
and Sovereignty and Royalty be better rooted,
which God of his Mercy grant for the good of his
Church, the happy estate of the Kingdom, and honour
and right of our King.</p>
            <p>If what is said be not enough to shew the Weakness
of these popular Sophisms, I come nearer to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator,</hi>
and put it home in a case, where I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
he will say it is Sophistry: By this way of reasoning
I will prove; there is no better way for the <hi>Observator</hi>
to improve his Wealth, than to make over the Right of
all he hath to me: the Argument will hold good, <hi>Quod ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit
tale, est magis tale;</hi> he that maketh me rich, by giving
me all his goods moveable and immovable, maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
richer; but the <hi>Observator</hi> by giving of all his goods
(my assumption should have been hypothetical, for posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
I know the Gentleman will not do it) to me, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me rich, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he maketh himself more rich. This
Logick, I conceive, is not so powerful as to cheat him
out of his natural, rational Faculty, and so cheat him
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33502:121"/>
out of all his Lands, Chattels, and Revenues: yet it
may be by an order of the House, that in some case
this Logick may serve to good purpose, that
the People giving the twentieth, the tenth, the
fifth part, or the Moity of their Moneys and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and all their Plate, to strengthen the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to advance the good Cause, to cherish (if we
will speak truly) and foment this present Rebellion, it
will not lessen their Wealth, but enrich them more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>quod efficit tale, est magis tale,</hi> it maketh some rich,
and consequently the Donors much more rich. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if this Logick hold, it must be in great request,
for if this Logick do it not, few can see how the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith can be kept; Divinity and Church-rents
(if you sacrilegiously rob God, which God forbid)
will not do it; it must be some Sophism like this, some
Sophism in this kind, that must answer for Publick Faith,
refund the Moneys <hi>borrowed from just Creditors,</hi> and
repay the wise Undertakers, <hi>qui spem pretio emerunt,</hi>
who have brought their Hogs to a good Market.</p>
            <p>To apply this shortly in few words; If I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
rightly this Maxim, <hi>quod efficit tale est magis tale,</hi>
I learned in the University, to be understood, <hi>de prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio
formali effectivo,</hi> of such an Agent as is formally
such in it self, as is the Effect produced; Next, that
it is such as is effective and productive of it self, as
when the Fire heateth cold Water, it is hot formally
in it self, and maketh Water hot likewise. By which
it is necessary, that the Quality inherent in the Effect,
be formally inherent in the Agent; for this reason it
is, that Wine cannot be said to be drunk, because
drunkenness is no wayes inherent in Wine, nor can
Wine be capable of it; and this made <hi>Aristotle</hi> quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Maxim, <hi>quod efficit tale est magis tale, modò utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
insit.</hi> And this <hi>insit utrique,</hi> that it be in both,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:33502:121"/>
maketh that the Maxim holds not in such Agents who
<hi>operate by donation,</hi> for he that is the Donor denudeth
himself of the Right and Power of that he giveth to
the Donee. So here this condition faileth too. And
consequently, if the Right of the King were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by Derivation and Donation from the People,
the Donation devests them totally of it, except the
King have it by way of loan, which to my thinking
never any yet spoke. Next, it is required, that there
be a Latitude, and that that is effected be capable of
a Latitude of more and less, as when (as I said before)
Fire heateth Water, the heat of the Fire is more than
the heat of the Water. Lastly, some add too, that
the Maxim must be understood <hi>ante effectum productum.</hi>
Now all the Argument falleth to the ground, for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
never was, nor can be in the Community;
Sovereignty hath power of Life and Death, which none
hath over himself, and the Community conceived
without Government, <hi>all as equal, endowed with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and native Liberty,</hi> of that Community, can have
not power over the Life of another; and so your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim
may be turned home again upon your self, for if
the People be not <hi>tales,</hi> such by Nature, as have such
Power, they cannot <hi>constituere tales,</hi> make such, that
is, Kings endowed with such Power; But sure it is, (as
it is said) they have not power of Life and Death,
to take away their own Life, or anothers: <hi>Ergo</hi> it
must be <hi>from God, the living God, the God of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing you make so good Use of your Logick, give
me leave to practise Logick upon a more sure Maxim,
which is this, <hi>omnis effectus est in efficiente vel eminenter,
vel formaliter,</hi> whatever is in the Effect that must be
in the Efficient, either <hi>formally,</hi> or in a <hi>more eminent and
superlative way;</hi> But there is something in a King,
which is not in People, either <hi>eminently or formally:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:33502:122"/>
Ergo,</hi> the People are not the Efficient and constituent
of a King. The <hi>minor</hi> and the assumption is clear,
The King hath the Power to take away the Life of
man, which is not in the People, whether you take
them <hi>severally and singly,</hi> for no man hath Power, or
may kill himself: or whether you take them <hi>joyntly,</hi>
for if none hath power over his own Life, much less
over his Neighbour's; and your grounds besides pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose,
that all men are equal amongst themselves.
That the Sovereign hath this Power, who is so mad
as to deny it? <hi>Gen. 9. Rom. 14. He bears not the Sword
in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, this Maxim, <hi>quod efficit tale, est magis tale;
constituens constituto potior,</hi> holdeth well with our tenet.
Thus, he that maketh Kings, and endoweth them
with Power, is much more a King himself, and hath
much more Power: But God and Christ make Kings,
<hi>Ergo.</hi> The Assumption is clear, <hi>for God is King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords, to him all Power belongeth;</hi>
here then, <hi>utrique inest;</hi> and for the other <hi>recipit magis
&amp; minus,</hi> it is certain; for the Power of all Kings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, that ever was, are, or shall be, have no more
measure and proportion to his Power, than a drop of
Water to the Ocean; his Power is like the light of
the Sun; their Powers but a borrowed Light, like to
that in the Moon and Stars. The King's Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to God is not univocal, it is onely equivocal or
analogical; and that to be doubted of too; for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
telleth us, <hi>finiti ad infinitum nulla datur propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi>
It is more than apparent then, that this Maxim
is onely abused by the Deceivers of this Time, to make
themselves and the People both of them miserable.
And the Maxim will conclude, that the <hi>Sheba's</hi> and
<hi>Shimei</hi>'s, these Authors and Incendiaries of Rebellion
are more miserable, and shall receive (if not in this
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33502:122"/>
Life, yet in that is to come) without extraordinary
repentance, a greater condemnation, for they kill
both Body and Soul. They make the simpler sort of
People miserable, by setting them on upon rebellion
against God and his Anointed, to the destruction of
State, Soul and Body, temporally and eternally, to the
reproach and disgrace of Christian, Catholick, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion; and infallibly by necessity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents,
and necessity of consequence, they make
themselves most miserable; for, <hi>quod efficit tale, ipsum
est magis tale.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Other grounds of the Iesuit and Sectary are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
and disproved; as that; that neither
Scripture nor Nature determines the specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Government; nor do they intimate,
why this man more than the other, or he than
a third; or these more than those, should have
the Power of Government. And that great
one is taken out of the way, whereby the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
and difference is found in several Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies,
It is more than apparent, say they,
that Monarchy is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
composition and constitution of man.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUR Sectaries have borrowed, as we told you
before, their great Ordinance of battery against
Sovereignty, from the Jesuits Magazine, any
who is read in them knoweth well enough how they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33502:123"/>
triumph in those Arguments, crying out till they be
hoarse again:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> Neither Scripture nor Nature teacheth that
Monarchy, Aristocracie, and Democracie, or any other ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
spece and kind of Government, is the necessary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Humane kind and society; but that the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and determination is Arbitrary, and of the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of man. <hi>To this same purpose is that other,</hi>
Neither the Law of God nor Nature demonstrate, why this
man more than the other, he than a third; why these more
than those, should have the Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Another great piece of Battery is that, that</hi> there
is such a multiplicity of variety and differences of Kings,
and Royal Power in the Kings of the World; <hi>(look, say
they, upon</hi> Spain, France, Britain, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that this must
necessarily argue, Kings are of Peoples making; <hi>and their</hi>
Power is in that portion and proportion, <hi>as it pleaseth the
People to entrust</hi> them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The third is,</hi> All Humane Societies <hi>are perfect
Republicks, and as</hi> they have in them originally a Power
to appoint their Government and Governours, so they have
a Power to preserve themselves, and in case of mis-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they may resume their Natural, Native, and Original
Power, rectifie by themselves what is amiss; otherwise it
must be that God and Nature <hi>have left them remediless.
The first two we will handle in this Chapter, the last
in the ensuing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To answer the Jesuit first in gross to all; however
he be wary enough in all his courses, yet in pressing
these Arguments against Monarchy, to prove that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
is by Humane Institution and Constitution,
and not by immediate collation from God, he is not
so prudent: for <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> with a little change,
losing nothing of their force; these Arguments <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:33502:123"/>
retorted, and turned home upon the Jesuit, will
bring home the Conclusion, that the Pope is not of
Divine Institution, hath not infallible and universal
Jurisdiction, but is somewhere and by some censura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in case of mis-government.</p>
            <p>First, I pray you, is it demonstrable by the letter of
Scripture, or by necessary and evident Consequences
and Consequents deducible, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
ought and should be Universal Monarch of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Militant Church, Christ's Vicar in the External
Government in the Church, the true Successour to the
ordinary Power and Place of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and secured
from all Errour in Points of Faith, Worship, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
That ever Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himself had so much,
neither Scripture nor Antiquity speak for it; nay,
they speak the contrary. And if it were granted to
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> where have we warrant in Scripture or
sound Antiquity, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and none else
is the true and lawful Successour of St. <hi>Peter?</hi> We
will allow them, that if by Antiquity they can make
it appear that it is so, we will yield what they demand.
But as they frame the Argument against us, they must
give us this in Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in express terms, or
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by immutable and pregnant conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
If Scripture plead not so much for the Pope,
it is more than certain, that Nature is as mute as a
Fish in it. Who ever dreamed that Nature dictates,
that for the good and happy preservation of the
Church, there must be one Universal, Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Infallible Head, and this man to be the Pope
of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, let them shew to us, where in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or
otherwise, <hi>by irrefragable Demonstration,</hi> it can be made
appear, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth, or <hi>Vrban</hi> the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33502:124"/>
eighth, or any else, should be Pope more than any
other.</p>
            <p>Again, let us give to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his Tenet, which
he maintains, <hi>lib. 5. de Pontifice Romano,</hi> where he
endeavours to prove, That the Pope is authorized
with an indirect Power over and above Kings, in
order to Spiritual things; That the Church is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Republick, which God hath not left destitute to
provide for its safety and preservation: If <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
will extract from hence this Consequence, <hi>Ergo</hi> the
Pope, the Head of the Church, in case of Tyranny,
Heresie, or Apostacy, for the good of the Church, may
censure, punish, dethrone a King; Why may we not
more formally, more powerfully conclude against <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
thus, The Catholick Church diffusively or
collectively taken, is a perfect Republick, which God
hath not left destitute of Power or means to provide
for her Safety, in case of Danger and Deficiency:
<hi>Ergo</hi> in case of male-administration by the Pope, in
case of Deficiency, (which are possibly incident to the
Pope, and consistent with his <hi>infallibility ex Cathedra)</hi>
The Community of Christians may supply his Defects,
rectifie his Disorders; and why not excathedrate him
too? Otherwise God hath left his Church remediless.
The <hi>Romanists</hi> must acknowledge the strength of the
Argument to be alike pressing on the one hand,
no less than the other, or then they must fore-goe
these ratiocinations. More of this in the next ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapter.</p>
            <p>Having premised this general Answer, let us now
answer to every one of them apart. And to the first
Argument, which is framed thus; Neither the Law of
God or Nature determines, that Monarchy is the
Government, or Aristocracy the Government, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33502:124"/>
the Government; or why one more than
another, and some few more than many should have
the Supremacy: <hi>Ergo</hi> the donation of the Power, the
collation of Supremacy, is by Derivation from the
People to the Governour or Governours. To the
first Argument, I say, I answer thus, It is an inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
because although I would grant all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,
and that the specification of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the People designing (if ever any People were
so really, to be free of all Government, because it is
imaginable, let us grant it as real) either one to have
the Sovereignty over them, as in Monarchy; or some
few of the better sort, as in Aristocracie; or many, as
in Democracie; it will not follow, <hi>Ergo</hi> Sovereignty
in one, few, or many, is by derivation and donation
from them: Because their act in this is onely <hi>Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
Personae,</hi> or <hi>Personarum,</hi> to appoint one Person, or
more, or many Persons to be Governour or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
for the Government: The collation of the
Power, <hi>Consequitur ad designationem, ex donatione &amp;
ordinatione divinâ;</hi> followeth upon this designation
and deputation of the <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
donation and ordination of God. As when
such and such men are designed to Holy Orders and
Functions, the Designation of the Person and Persons
is the work and act of the Church; but the collation
of the Power is the proper, peculiar, and immediate
Work and act of God, as all knowing Divines do
willingly acknowledge. To reason <hi>à potestate designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva
&amp; deputativa personae &amp; personarum,</hi> from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which designeth and deputeth a Person or Persons
for a Charge; <hi>ad potestatem collativam authoritatis,</hi> to
the power of collating or giving the Power it self, is
the Sophism and caption, which the School calleth <hi>à


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33502:125"/>
figura dictionis,</hi> where there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a proposing in the Antecedent in one kind, and a
concluding in the Consequent in another and different
kind. A Woman may design the Person of the Man
who is to be her Husband; but marital Right and
Power is collated by God immediately, and issueth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
from his Ordination.</p>
            <p>That other Sophism maketh no better Paralogism,
although <hi>Suarez</hi> taketh it for a Demonstration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable.
The force of the Argument briefly is
this; If Sovereignty in a King were immediately
from God, then Power Royal could not chuse but be
Uniform in all Kings, but this holdeth not; for there
is such a latitude of Variety, that some Kings have
more, some less, with a great deal of difference in the
Point and Power of Sovereignty. Before we answer
this, I entreat the Christian Reader to consider, that
we maintain not, we plead not at this time for a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotical
Sovereignty,</hi> which is <hi>Dominium herile,</hi> an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power, such as the Great <hi>Turk</hi> this day exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
over his Subjects, or the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath over,
and in all his Territories without <hi>Europe:</hi> We main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
onely <hi>Regiam potestatem quae fundatur in paterna,</hi>
such Royal Paternal Sovereignty, as (blessed be God)
we and our Ancestors have lived long and happily
under. This, as it hath its Royal Prerogatives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
naturally in the Crown, and inseparable from
it; so it trencheth not upon the Liberty of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or the Propriety of the Goods of the Subject, but
in and by the lawful and just Acts of Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Next, I desire the Courteous and Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to remember, that when we plead for the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of Kings, we understand such onely who are
truly and really Kings, not <hi>Titulo tenus,</hi> by compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:33502:125"/>
onely, as were the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Kings, Execu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors
only of the Decrees and Pleasure of the <hi>Ephori</hi>
which was truly an Aristocracy, no Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Then, the Argument is this; that which is of that
Condition and Temper that it may be enlarged or
straitned; that which actually and experimentally is
found various and different, it cannot be such by any
Constitution of nature, or Institution from God:
But Monarchy is such, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Here <hi>Suarez</hi> cryeth out,
<hi>Clarum est indicium hujus veritatis, quòd haec Regia potestas
non sit aequalis in omnibus regibus, neque cum iisdem proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus
durationis, perpetuitatis, successionis, &amp; similibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> of this Syllogism, or Sophism rather,
must be some way better qualified, otherwise it will
conclude nothing, or too much, which is the equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in the rules of Right and sound reasoning to that,
to conclude nothing. In the same manner I reason,
every man hath not a little measure of Knowledge,
Reason, Discourse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but some are more, some are
less knowing men; some more, some less rational,
<hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> Knowledge, Reason, Discourse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not
natural to man. The Consequence is lame; because
to Reason, <hi>ab actu exercito ad actum signatum,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise,
will not always hold; or to reason <hi>à poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
secunda ad primam vel è contra:</hi> from the Difference
in the Exercise, to conclude a Difference or Disparity
in the first Capacity, is inconsequent. To be rational
in <hi>the first Capacity and natural Power,</hi> is essential to all
men, and equal in all; but in <hi>the use, the Exercise</hi> of
the rational Faculty, there is a vast Disparity, because
of a great Latitude in different actual Ability. Nature
admits a great Variety in the use and exercise of her
natural Powers, that all are not alike fitted and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for the second Acts. In the first Capacity nature
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33502:126"/>
is so just, so equal, so indulgent to all, that the native
first radical power being of it self, <hi>in indivisibili,</hi> is
equal in all; no less, <hi>in homine tenuissimi sensûs,</hi> in the
least knowing man, than in him who in Sharpness of
Wit approacheth nearest to Angelical and Noetical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Take another Instance; the face of man is not much
above a Span in Length or Breath, yet what an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Variety is there in the faces of men? Naturalists
and Moralists do hold, and not without great shew of
Reason, that from the first to the last man, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
hath his own proper peculiar face. Can <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>
or any other from this Variety in the antecedent,
bring home this Conclusion in the Consequent, <hi>Ergo</hi>
a face is not natural to man, but something casual, or
accidental? The Result is, we must pitch upon some
things natural, which are uniform in all, and which
yet admit, in the multivarious Wisdom of God, and
large work of nature, some room and place of Variety,
which Variety doth neither abolish nor destroy the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials.
We will find the like in Monarchy, that all
of them are uniform in their Essentials; and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Varieties do not prove them to be of humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
or Constitution.</p>
            <p>If Instances in things natural do not the Business, let
me entreat the <hi>Iesuit</hi> and <hi>Puritan</hi> to look upon moral
things, where they will find the like. <hi>Vltio scelerum,</hi>
that gross enormous Crimes are to be punished with a
condign proportioned Punishment, is the Ordinance
of God, of Nature, and common Equity. This Truth
is undenyable. Is there not a great Variety and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the measure and manner of the Punishment,
in different Kingdoms and Nations? Theft somewhere
is punished by Death, somewhere by Restitution; and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33502:126"/>
that of Restitution, somewhere twofold, somewhere
threefold, some fourfold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> somewhere it is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Slavery, somewhere one way, somewhere ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. Infinite Instances of this kind might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
Can you from hence conclude, that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Theft is not an inviolable Order and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Almighty God and common Equity? But
that it hath all its Entity and Being by influence from
humane Appointment? A Country Clown would jeer
you for this.</p>
            <p>We deny not but Gods Works are uniform in their
Essentials, <hi>it a ut nec augeri nec minui possunt,</hi> that if you
take the least part of the Essentials (if Essentials may
truly be said to have parts) from them, they perish;
yet this may well subsist with some more, some less
power in the actuating or exercising of this natural
uniform Power. No understanding <hi>Iesuit</hi> will deny,
but acknowledge that Episcopacy with all its essential
Power is immediately from God, and of his Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and yet may it not be, that <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> in the
exercise of this Power some Bishops may have more,
some less power in actuating that which they are not
restrained from, but may do <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> by their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
native Power? A Bishop <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Power of Consecration, may ordain every
where in the World, as many Priests, as many Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
as he will; yet may he not be restrained, that he
shall not do it without his own Diocess? May he not
by the same Power ordain a Priest without a Title or
Cure? and yet may he not be restrained by positive
Consent and Constitution, that he shall not do it? Is
not the case possible and probable, that Bishops of one
particular Church may be more restrained than Bishops
of another particular Church? Can <hi>Suarez</hi> or any other
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:33502:127"/>
than conclude from this Variety in the Exercise of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
that Episcopacy with it's radical Power is not
immediately from God and Christ? He hath more
Learning and Candor than will allow him to be so
absurd.</p>
            <p>The Sectary feeleth no hurt by this Stroke: Well,
let us come home to him. I demand of the Sectary,
whether or not a <hi>Minister made</hi> (I dare not say, a Priest
in sacred Orders, or ordained by Imposition of hands,
this Christian Practice is Antichristianism now a-days)
hath not all the Power naturally inherent in him, that
any other Minister whosoever, or wheresoever else?
I am confident none of them will deny it: Again,
may he not be restrained to do no Ministerial act, as
to Baptize, Preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but within his own Parish,
unless he be otherwise licensed? No moderate Sectary
(if any such be) doth deny this. Come on: In some
cases of Jurisdiction (I fear the Term offends the Ears
and Stomach of the <hi>Precisian)</hi> in some cases of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
I say, of which by Gods Law, and his calling
(excuse me to keep their own Diction) he hath full
Power within his Charge, may he not be so restrained
that some <hi>reserved cases</hi> (this Phrase I fear be offensive)
that some points of Discipline be reserved as peculiar
for the <hi>Classis,</hi> the <hi>Presbytery?</hi> and that their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is only to be executed by the Parish Pope? This
is a known case amongst them. Again, may there
not be some points of Discipline, and Doctrine too,
reserved as proper and peculiar for a Provincial? And
again, some of that high Strain and Concernment,
that they cannot be cognosced or determined, but by
a general Assembly of such a monstrous Composition,
a <hi>Tragelaphus,</hi> such as never Christ instituted, nor
Christian Church knew? All this holds with their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:33502:127"/>
their Practices. Further I demand, may it not
be that in particular National Churches, as the Church
of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Church of <hi>France,</hi> the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> are, in these cases reserved respectively as we
expressed before, that there may be a great Variety
and Difference? Now notwithstanding of all those
Restraints, by which Ministers so evidently and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
differ in the exercise and actuating of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Charge and Function: The Sectary that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
himself aright, will be very loath to have the
Conclusion brought home, that the Ministerial Power
is all by humane Institution, by humane Composition,
Contract, or that his Calling is humane only, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventional
only, pactional only. As he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for himself, I hope he will furnish us an Answer
how to take off this Argument so much triumphed in
both by him and his spurious Father the Jesuit.</p>
            <p>I take the <hi>Observator</hi> to be a Lay Gentleman, and it
may be, as the times are, he careth not much for the
one way of Episcopacy, nor the other way of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
nor the third of Independency, nor any other
way imaginary or imaginable in the Church; we must
therefore some other way satisfie him. Then let me
entreat him to consider what Variety and Difference is
found in oeconomical Government, if he will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the exercise either of marital or paternal Power:
View it, if in different Kingdoms, in diverse Nations
he find not and acknowledge a great immense Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
or will he look upon both at home, not almost
one Family uniform and alike with another: and that
according to the various Temper of Fathers and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
their different Abilities, some being more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent,
some more rigorous, some keeping the equal
mean: Some being more intelligent, knowing, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33502:128"/>
prudent; some of less Knowledge, Prudence, and
Government. The <hi>Observator</hi> will find some wives
like <hi>Sarah,</hi> with Reverence and Submission calling
their Husbands Lord; some <hi>Michols</hi> lording over their
Husbands; some Fathers like <hi>Eli</hi> too too indulgent to
their Children: others like <hi>Iob</hi> happily and piously
breeding his Children, and sacrificing for them when
they are feasting. In brief, look upon the oeconomy
of all Families within your Knowledge, and you shall
find that in Government not one looks like another.
Doth it then from hence follow necessarily, that pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or marital Authority is not from God and Nature,
but appointed at the pleasure and Constitution of
men?</p>
            <p>The result of all is this: That seeing in things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
things moral, things ecclesiastical and spiritual,
and in things oeconomical, this accidental and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Variety in their exercise, destroyeth not the
true Essence and inseparable Essentials of the things
themselves, but naturally they are uniform and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same: So in the different Monarchies of the
World, the Disparity and Difference of the exercising
of monarchical power, which is accidental, maketh
them not specifically and essentially different and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
What these <hi>prime, radical, essential Constitutives</hi>
of Monarchy are, it will be proper to express, quaest. 4.
We content our selves with three, which are agreed
upon to be in all Speces of Sovereign Power, whether
Aristocratical, Democratical, or Monarchical. The
1. First is, that it is <hi>Potestas suprema,</hi> that it is subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to none but Almighty God; <hi>dicit negationem supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioris
in terris,</hi> it admitteth no <hi>coordinate, collateral, coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
or corrival Power.</hi> 2. Next, it is <hi>Perpetua potestas,</hi>
a perpetual Power; He cannot fall from his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:33502:128"/>
but whilst he lives he is the Lords Anointed.
3. Thirdly, the Power of all Monarchs, and of every
Monarch, is <hi>Legibus soluta,</hi> subject to no over-ruling
Power of man. Conceive it not so, that Kings are free
from the direction of, and obligation to the Law of
God, Nature, and common Equity; but from <hi>Coercion
humane,</hi> or any <hi>humane coactive Power,</hi> to punish, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or dethrone them. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> call these, and
what particulars come within their verge, <hi>Majus Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium;</hi>
the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
and where those are equal in all Monarchy, no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
variety can change the nature of Monarchy in
all and every one of them.</p>
            <p>As for other particulars virtually and naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in these three, howsoever <hi>in actu signato,</hi> in
<hi>their first capacity,</hi> they be <hi>propriè propriissimè,</hi> radically
and properly in Sovereignty and in Monarchies; yet
<hi>in actu exercito,</hi> in the exercise of them, they may be
entrusted to the Subject, <hi>Ita ut non defluat radix supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
potestatis,</hi> so that they have it onely by Delegation
and Trust, <hi>communicativè,</hi> by communication; not
<hi>privativè,</hi> not so that these Delegates are invested so
with it, as the King is totally divested. Who can
deny but <hi>Iudiciaria potestas,</hi> the Power to judge in all
<hi>Causes, Criminal, Civil,</hi> which concern the Subjects and
Kingdom, is inherent essentially in the Crown and
Scepter of the King, and the King, to ease his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and that Justice may the more readily and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be done, intrusteth his Judges with it? And here,
is not the Trust less and more, as it pleaseth the King
to give it? Is it not different in some onely for such
and such Cases and Causes, in others, for some others
different? And doth there not lie to the King <hi>extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
appellatio,</hi> the last Appeal? or if that be not, to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33502:129"/>
make Justice more expedite, is there not the equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
reserved, that the Party hurt may by Petition and
humble Remonstrance, make his Case and Cause evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the King, that he in his Sovereignty may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
what is wrong, and punish the Judge abusing
his Trust? By which it is more than apparent, that
this and the like Restraints, the King putteth upon the
exercise of his Native Power, is onely <hi>ad minuendam
solicitudinem,</hi> not <hi>ad minuendam Majestatem,</hi> to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
his Charge, and not to denude or disrobe himself
of that Sacred Right and Prerogative God hath given
to him, as his Vicegerent upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Again, it is not slightly to be passed by, that there
be many Kings, many times too indulgent Fathers to
their People and Subjects, who give away too much
of their Sacred Right, which, when Subjects have
come at, being more than they should, zealous of their
Liberty, will not part with it again, but detain it
sacrilegiously. If a man could be allowed to speak
truth in this distempered Age, it may be said without
sin against God, or crime of laese-majesty against King
or People, that where Monarchy has been too much
straitened, and weakened by loss of its natural and
native Prerogative, it hath been done by imprudent,
at least inconsiderate acts of too good Princes, and of
voluntary concession: and in the end, as they prove
derogatory to Sovereignty, so they prove destructive to
the Peace and Protection, the Liberty and Propriety
of the Subject. Review all the Grants of Princes in
this kind, and you shall find upon Authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
that they be meer <hi>Concessions of grace.</hi> If as
much could be shewn upon as faithful and unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Record, to prove our King a pactional, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventional
Prince, your Plea should be more specious
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33502:129"/>
in the Eyes of the World. And if you could by <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Evidence</hi> make it appear, that such bounds
and limits are put to Sovereignty, as it is more than
manifest that what you claim is by acts of voluntary
Humanity, you should do somewhat which probably
would take the People more; but I must tell you
withal, you totally destroy Monarchy, and must say
right down our gracious Sovereign is no Monarch,
which is against Reason, Sense, all Records extant,
and the universal testimony of all knowing men in
other Kingdoms and States. It is great Discourtesie to
change Princes <hi>acts of grace</hi> bestowed upon Subjects,
into acts of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Debt;</hi> nor is it a ready way to
obtain more grace, to prove unthankful, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
prior graces received. Lawyers and Jurists
do tell you, that from <hi>actus humanitatis &amp; voluntatis,</hi>
from acts of Courtesie and voluntary Concession you
may not reason to conclude <hi>actum necessitatis,</hi> an
act of Necessity and Debt; this is a Paralogism in
Law.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Is it not more than known, that People are
so corruptly disposed against, and opposed to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they are ready to slip the collar, and to shake
off, at least to weaken the yoke of Government? From
hence it issueth, that subtil men wait opportunities to
cheat good and weak Princes out of their Rights and
Prerogatives. And is it not seen, that wise and able
Princes being plunged into inevitable and unavoidable
Difficulties, to obtain Subsidies and Assistance of their
Subjects, to extricate themselves out of such La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths,
are forced to suffer their Rights to be wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of their hands, and to make sale of them? Both
Statutes and Stories witness this truth plentifully.
The truth is, they are ill made away, and a great deal
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33502:130"/>
worse kept away. Necessity may be some excuse for
parting with them, but it is Sacrilege in Subjects to
detain them. It cannot subsist with the Rules of good
Policy and Government, to trench so upon <hi>the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of the King,</hi> as to disable him from doing his
Charge, <hi>to protect and govern his Subjects in Peace and
Safety.</hi> An impotent King is the same with no King:
where in the Book of <hi>Iudges</hi> it is so oft repeated,
when Idolatry, rapine, Blood and Oppression abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <hi>in those dayes there was no King in Israel;</hi> none
is so blockish to conceive that God's People lived under
an <hi>Anarchy:</hi> but the Phrase importeth two things;
first, that they wanted the most excellent of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they had no King, no Monarchy; next that
the <hi>then Government</hi> was so weak and weakened, that
it could neither repress, nor censure disorders of the
highest Enormity: and that whole Book is a full
Commentary that Aristocracy is defective to effect or
work the proper Works and Effects of perfect Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
for you shall find universally in the whole
Book, that while the People were governed by the
<hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> the Princes of the Tribes, and Fathers of
the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the People went a whoring after
other gods; then God, to punish them, delivered them
into the hands of their Enemies; then they cryed to
the Lord in the day of their distress, and then the
Lord raised up to them a <hi>Sophet,</hi> a Judge, a Deliverer,
who, under God, as his Viceroy, had <hi>Iura Belli &amp;
Pacis;</hi> Sovereign Power in War and Peace: a very
observable thing to prove the excellency of Monarchy,
and the weakness and defects of Aristocracy, whose
mis-government could not be rectified but by placing
the Sovereignty in one: Read and consider the whole
Book, and you will find it true what we say: To
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:33502:130"/>
give you one for all, referring the rest to your own
search and trial, read the second Chapter of that Book,
which, in the opinion of the most Learned, is a brief
summary of the whole state and condition of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
from the first time of that story to <hi>Saul</hi> and
<hi>David</hi>'s dayes, and particularly read what you have
<hi>Vers. 17, 18. They would not hearken unto their Iudges,
but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed
themselves unto them, they turned quickly out of the way
which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord; but they did not so. And when the
Lord raised them up Iudges, then the Lord was with the
Iudge, and delivered them out of the hand of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
all the dayes of the Iudge.</hi> And see what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>Vers. 19. And it came to pass when the Iudge was
dead, that they returned and corrupted themselves more
than their Fathers, in following other gods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They
ceased not from their own doings, and from their stubborn
way.</hi> To conceive these words right, you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that the word, <hi>Iudges,</hi> verse 17. and the same
word, <hi>verse</hi> 18. is not used in the same sense; the
reason is evident; for of the first Judges, vers. 17. it
is expresly said, <hi>The People did not hearken to them, but
they went a whoring after other gods,</hi> &amp;c. These Judges
were the ordinary Judges, the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> the Princes
of the twelve Tribes, the Fathers of Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The Judges mentioned, <hi>vers. 18 &amp;</hi> 19. are the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
extraordinarily raised by God, <hi>Othniel, Ehud, &amp;c.</hi>
So the word <hi>raised</hi> imports: Again, these Judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Judges after their going a whoring, and after their
misery and slavery for Sin. Thirdly, of these Judges
it is said, that not onely they delivered the Israelites
from their bondage, but that during their dayes, the
People continued in the right service of God. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33502:131"/>
that after their Death they ceased not from their
doings, and from their stubborn way: which things
are far different from the Condition of the Judges
mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 17. Lastly, it is not to be passed by,
that emphatically it is said, that <hi>God was with the Iudges
whom he raised up,</hi> more blessing Monarchy than Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracy,
because more warranted and liked by God
than any other Government whatsoever: Observe it
well, that under the <hi>Iudges,</hi> the Aristocracy, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
went a whoring; and when the Judge, raised up
by God, died, and the Government returned again to
be Aristocratical, the Text saith, that <hi>they ceased not
from their doings, and from their stubborn way.</hi> Add to
this, that <hi>Abimelech</hi> knew it to be a powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to perswade them to make him King, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
was better than Aristocracy, <hi>It was better one
reign over them than seventy.</hi> Forget not withal, that
in all the Disorders mentioned in the last part of the
Book the Reason is not given for want of Government,
but want of a King in <hi>Israel:</hi> of this more, <hi>Quaest.</hi> 2.
To return to our purpose by what we have alledged
it is clear, that Sovereignty weakened in Monarchy or
Aristocracy cannot do it's work, and is in the next
place and Condition to Anarchy and Confusion.
When <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was over-lorded by his Nobles, he
could neither save himself nor his People, nor Prophet
and Servant of God <hi>Ieremiah:</hi> nor could <hi>David</hi> punish
<hi>Ioab</hi> when he was over-awed by that Power he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had put in his hands. To weaken the head is to
distemper the whole Body: wherefore I doubt not to
affirm but if any good Prince or his royal Ancestors
have been, or are cheated out of their sacred Right by
Fraud or Force, he may at the fittest Opportunity,
when God in his wise Providence offereth the occasion,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33502:131"/>
resume it. Much more lawful it is for Kings to do
this, when Subjects have used or abused rather such
Concessions of Grace to the hurt of Sovereignty, and
the good of the Subject. Let us never seed our selves
in a foolish Paradise, to think the Subject can be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
where the sacred Prerogative of the King is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.
<hi>Contractatio rei alienae</hi> what a Sin it is the Law
decides, determines: <hi>Contractaetio rei alienae &amp; sacrae,</hi>
what a Sin it is Scripture telleth us; it is Sacriledge,
and Intrusion upon Almighty God himself, no less
than when a Kings Ambassadour is violated by a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince. Our Saviour hath taught us, it is not
fit to cast Pearls and precious Stones, you know to
whom; I have a better Opinion and Esteem of all the
Kings Subjects. It is a poor and ignorant shift that
some Pettifoggers, Smatterers in the Law, use to
wrong the sacred Prerogative of Kings, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more for the royal Prerogative, nor what, they
say, the Law municipal of the Kingdom hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
I do not speak this to reproach intelligent Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists,
and reverend Judges, whose places and parts I
reverence as much as any, accounting the knowledge
of that Science next to Divinity, and far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and useful than all others besides. I acknowledge
none have written more divinely almost, nor ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
in maintenance of the sacred Right and Person
of Kings, than some excellent and eminent in the
Knowledge of the Law; as <hi>Bodin, Barcklay, Blackwood,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd others, to whose Travels in this Subject we owe
much: but for these other <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

What is found in the Statutes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
concerning the Prerogative they only declare Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
to the Subject, and add a Sanction penal, in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:33502:132"/>
case of Violation, they do not determine it, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath by himself declared it. We would laugh
at him in the School of Divinity, who would but
mutter that the Decalogue was not a Law till God
wrote it with his own Finger in two Tables in mount
<hi>Sinai,</hi> gave it to <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> intimated it to the
people. What <hi>is morally natural</hi> in it, is <hi>Lex naturae:</hi>
the Dictate of Nature, by the finger of Nature writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the minds and Hearts of all; and what is <hi>positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
morale,</hi> positively moral, was from the Beginning
so, known and practised by the Church from <hi>Adam</hi>
to <hi>Moses;</hi> when <hi>David</hi> commanded what share of the
Spoil those should have, who were the reserve to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Stuff, Scripture calleth this Ordinance a Law
made by David to last for ever; yet we know this was
God's Ordinance before the Law. The very like is
in Statutes and Acts of Parliament declaring the royal
Prerogative of a King, that the Subject may the better
know it, be put <hi>in malâ fide,</hi> if he violate it, and
know what Judgment he is to expect.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to shut up all this Discourse, let us intreat
the impartial Reader to cast his Eyes upon all Story
domestick and Foreign, and especially domestick, and
if they find not the worst Bargains ever Subjects made,
was at any Rate to purchase a possession of the sacred
Rights of Kings; sometimes it hath been no better
than <hi>occidisti, possedisti;</hi> it hath been purchased with a
great deal of Blood. The Market hath been made by
Sedition, Rebellion, Rapine, Murder, plundering
God and man, and sometimes regained again to its
right Owner, but at as dear a Rate and Price. It is
in Morals as in Naturals, <hi>Omne corpus quiescit in suo loco,</hi>
an Element without its place hath never Rest, nor
the World good by it's Operation and Influence, till
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33502:132"/>
it be replaced and seated in it's right Locality. God
hath commanded not a <hi>date</hi> but a <hi>reddite,</hi> not a <hi>giving</hi>
unto <hi>Caesar</hi> of his Right, but a <hi>rendring,</hi> not only as
due, but if it be with-holden or with-drawn to restore
him it. The Stories of these Kingdoms have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
real Proofs of this Truth, I forbear to cite them, or
to refer you to them, I wish of these days, and others
like them, that they be never known nor read of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
<q>Excidat illa dies, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But seeing I treat of this purpose divinely, give me
leave to speak Gods Truth to you, as becometh Gods
Servant and a good Subject, Till those Kingdoms be
purged of Sacriledge so highly committed <hi>against God,</hi>
by wronging his <hi>Anointed,</hi> and <hi>his Church,</hi> and both
of them restored to their sacred Right, we need not
expect true and solid Peace, nor the true and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Blessings of God. Let us fancy to our selves this or
that Accommodation for Peace, if God be wronged in
his Anointed and Church, we add only Fewel or Oyl
to the Fire. Almighty and merciful God, the God
of all Spirits, put it in the Hearts of all Christians and
Subjects, to honour him, and in him, and for him,
his Anointed and Church, rendering to God what is
God's, and to the King what is the Kings; that there
may be a Blessing in these Kingdoms, in our <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
there may be Peace within her Walls, and Prosperity
within her Gates, that the Crown which he hath
put upon the head of his Anointed our Sovereign may
flourish with him and his Seed for ever, and we and
our Posterity may live in Godliness and Honesty under
him and them till the coming of our Lord, when he,
they, and we shall receive that immortal Crown of
eternal Glory, which the <hi>King of Kings, Lord of Lords,</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:33502:133"/>
and chief Bishops of our Souls hath laid up for all them
that fear him. <hi>Amen.</hi>

         <div n="15" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Wherein is examined the Iesuit's Maxim, That
every Society of Mankind is a perfect Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
and consequently, the Community may
supply and rectifie the defects and errours of
Sovereignty. And the Puritan's too, That if
there were not such a Power and Super-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
in People to supply, God had left man
remediless.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Jesuit and Puritan, although they differ
in their Expressions, agree well in the Sense,
and intend both of them one Conclusion. How
this Argument <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be retorted upon the
Jesuit against his <hi>Numen terrenum,</hi> the Pope, we told
in the preceding Chapter; only now let the Jesuit
give me leave to ask him how a Republick is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
is imaginable without a Governour or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and People governed? How can a Society be
imagined without Order? and how Order without
Priority and Posteriority? When the Jesuit then saith,
that every Society of men is a perfect Republick, and
every perfect Republick must have within it self as
much Power as may preserve it self from Ruine, and
right what is amiss, he must necessarily by this Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of men, and Republick mentioned in the Premisses
understand only the Community of the People and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33502:133"/>
Subject, in an abstracted Notion, from the Sovereign
Governour or Governours; otherwise concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to purpose. And here let me intreat the
Jesuit or Puritan to tell me where ever he read the
word <hi>Civitas</hi> or <hi>Republick</hi> ascribed to a multitude, a
disorderly rout, where there is no Governour. It is
alike to conceive a politick Body without a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
as to conceive the natural Body without a Head.
We pardon the Jesuit and Puritan to give us new
Tenets in Policy, seeing they are so bold with
God and his Church, to give us new Tenets in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
            <p>Again, it is worth our observing, that when our
Adversaries come to shew where this Republick is,
where this Superintendent Power is seated, they differ
and vary infinitely. It is no wonder to hear the
Builders of <hi>Babel</hi> speak with different Tongues, we are
hopeful God in his mercy will scatter them upon the
Earth, and cast down <hi>this Babel.</hi> The Jesuits, all, for
ought I know, do ascribe this to the Community;
The Sectaries do differ infinitely, some warrant any
one Subject, any individual Person, to make away a
King in this case; and that such a work is no less to
be rewarded, than when one killeth a ravenous Wolf.
Some will have it in the whole Community with the
Jesuit. Some will have it in the Collective Body,
but how? not met together by the Warrant or Writ
of Sovereign Authority, but when necessity (which is
often fancied and imaginary) of reforming State and
Church, calleth them together. Some will have the
Power in the Nobles and Peers of the Land. Some in
the three States, assembled by the Kings Writ. Some
in the inferiour Judges. In sum, every one fancieth it
to himself, as he resolveth to Idol or serve corruptly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33502:134"/>
the humour and state of the People where he liveth.
When these Classical Authors agree in one, they will
make us think their Tenets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounder, and their courses
more warrantable, which I never hope to see, because
this Spirit of Discord God hath put as a Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Masters of Errours.</p>
            <p>I dispute not whether this Power be in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
or in the Collective Body, or in the Peers and
Nobles, or in the inferiour Judges, or in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or where else you can imagine it, for I know
no where it is to punish or curb Sovereignty, but in
Almighty God; Onely I demand of the Jesuit and
Sectary, that seeing wheresoever they put it, they make
it the last remedy, the onely remedy to supply all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
to redress all Wrongs, to set aright whatever is
dis-joynted in Church or State; <hi>The Subject of this
superintending Power must be secured from errour in Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from errour in Practice:</hi> and how happy are we
now, that in these late dayes we have a Pope <hi>in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus,</hi>
who is no less assisted and endowed with <hi>the
gift and grace of Infallibility,</hi> than the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
determining <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> He is too much in love
with a Community, or with Nobles, or with Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or with inferiour Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who thinketh or
judgeth that they, or any of them are secured from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the reformation of State or Church.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, if the Multitude, the Peers,
the Judges, the Parliaments, are liable to Errour, and
many times actually do err; when they err in this
glorious work of Reformation of Church and State,
doth not the perfect condition of a perfect Republick
require, that there be some authorized with a superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent
Power, to rectifie their Errours, and to punish
their misdemeanours? otherwise God hath left Church
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:33502:134"/>
and State remediless; they must name this Remedy,
and by all appearance this must be the Sovereign again;
and so <hi>Impius ambulat in circuitu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they will say, that to eschew such a ridiculous
regress and circle betwixt King and People, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and King, and to shun <hi>Ne detur progressus in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
that if the Community or Parliament err, the
remedy is to be left to the Wisdom and Justice of
God; Why will not the Sectary acknowledge that it
is as fit, when the Sovereign transgresseth against
the right Rules of Government, that People and
Subjects submit in Patience, and wait till God send
a Remedy, either rectifying or removing the bad Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour?</p>
            <p>Where ever you place this Superintending Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a King, I care not much, for it is but an <hi>Idea;</hi>
by this same Power they who are authorized with it
by God and Natures Right, may call a King to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
censure, and punish him for any errour or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour
whatsoever, for any one act of injustice:
Why might not the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> or Peers, or <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,
&amp;c.</hi> have convented <hi>David</hi> before them, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and punished him for his Adultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi>
and his murther of <hi>Vriah?</hi> The <hi>Romanists,</hi> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of Antimonarchical new Statists, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no case lawful, but either <hi>in Heresie, or in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,
or in Tyranny;</hi> the first two the <hi>Romanists</hi> would
have it to the Popes Power, and at his Discretion;
the last, of Tyranny, all of them do qualifie thus, <hi>Vt
sit universalis, manifesta, &amp; cum obstinatione:</hi> that it be
in such Tyranny onely which is intended, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
attempted for the <hi>whole and total destruction</hi> of the
Publick, which cannot fall into the thoughts and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of any but a mad man. What is recorded in story
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33502:135"/>
of <hi>Nero</hi> his wish in this kind, may be rather judged the
expression of a transported Passion than a fixed Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
Next, this case must be <hi>evident, and clear as
the Sun-shine at Noon-day.</hi> Thirdly, it must be joyned
with such pervicacy and obstinacy, that it is insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and invincible by any ordinary humble Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
and Supplication to the contrary. Although
we give it, that it were lawful in a case so qualified,
for the Community or any else, to resume their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and use it to remedy themselves, and to rectifie
what is amiss, which we cannot grant; we are very
confident, that all the Wit of the Opposites cannot
make it appear, that their case is such at this time.
Upon their grounds we see not how by sound reason,
not onely in such case as is expressed onely, but also
in every case of male-administration whatever it be,
they who have this pretended and fancied Power, may
not use and exercise this superintendent and transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
extravagant Power.</p>
            <p>I pray you, if this Superintending Power in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Peers, or Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> resumable in the exigent
of great necessity, be the onely means and last remedy
allowed, and so necessary that without it neither
Church nor State can be preserved in their integrity;
how cometh it to pass that we have neither Precept
nor Practice for it in Holy Writ? <hi>Deus &amp; Natura non
desunt in necessariis;</hi> God and Nature are not deficient
in things primely necessary. Nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
more necessary for State and Church than such
a Remedy. If then we cannot hit upon express and
clear warrant by Precept or Practice in Scripture, for
a matter of so high and necessary concernment, who
can be so stupid in a Pythagorean way, to believe this
upon an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, upon your Rabbies bare assertion, or
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33502:135"/>
trust it upon an Anabaptistical Enthusiasm. There is
nothing more certain, than that there is not any thing
in Scripture tending that way. If it be, our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
are bound to produce it; for <hi>affirmanti incumbit
probatio,</hi> He that affirms it to be so, is bound to make
his proof appear.</p>
            <p>Next, this tenet argues too great a confidence of
our selves, as if to be left to our own natural Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
were the onely sufficient, competent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
means of Safety and Redress of Church and
State. We hereby presume upon our own strength,
that by our selves we are able to rectifie and preserve
both Church and State. It is Arrogancy too, for
hereby we are puffed up with an overweening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of our own Piety and Integrity, as if our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were so sound, as that it cannot be darkened or
corrupted, and our Affections so orderly, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
over-rule us in a wrong course, to do against that
is pious and just. I was ever in opinion till now, that
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be secured from Sin, was the onely
propriety of God, and that it is antichristian in the
Pope to lay claim to an absolute Infallibility. But this
new Policy will find the like in the Parliament, the
collective Body or Community.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, consider attentively and impartially what
you hold, and you will find it resolve into <hi>Infidelity
and Impatience; Infidelity,</hi> that we do not trust that
God is able to do it; <hi>Impatience,</hi> that we will not
wait patiently till he do it. The Heathen are nearer
to Christianity in this, than our <hi>glorious Reformers.
Tacitus</hi> saith, <hi>Quomodo sterilitatem, aut nimios imbres,
&amp; caetera naturae mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ita luxum vel avaritiam domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantium
tolerate; vitia erunt donec homines, sed neque
haec continua, &amp; meliorum interventu pensantur.</hi> The safest
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33502:136"/>
way, in the wise Historian's judgment, is to endure
the Tempests of ill Government patiently, as we
do other Tempests falling from Heaven; while
men are, faults will be, but will not be alwayes last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and better things will come with compensation of
our losses.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is much better for us, that God hath
reserved this as a peculiar case to himself to punish
Sovereigns, and to rectifie their Errours. But for us
on the other part to usurp upon his Right, it is no less
than intrusion upon his Divine Prerogative, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
along with it <hi>Morbum complicatum,</hi> a number of
Sins against many of his most glorious Attributes.
1. It wrongeth God in his <hi>glorious Wisdom,</hi> that he
hath not prepared such a Remedy for us in this case;
nay, it putteth <hi>foolishness</hi> upon him, that in this case
he hath commanded Patience, and so left us totally
remediless. 2. It wrongeth God in <hi>his glorious Power,</hi>
by making him weak, that by no other means he
could set aright what is disjoynted in Church and
State. 3. It wrongeth <hi>his Holiness;</hi> who for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
support of Church and State by these means,
is necessitated for effecting the Work most concerneth
him and his Glory, to have and use the help of sinful
men, nay, even of their Sins. 4. To what is said,
add this, that this Principle of theirs dishonoureth
Christian Religion; it turneth Religion into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
Faith into Faction, and Christian obedience into
disloyal Treason. Nothing is more powerful to deter
Kings from coming to the profession of Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion, than to hold, that such a Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent
Power is in People or Parliament, to censure
and unking Christian Kings.</p>
            <pb n="237" facs="tcp:33502:136"/>
            <p>Fifthly, Christian obedience and Sobriety teacheth
us to leave all Evils in Church and State to be redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by those means God himself hath appointed, and
when the ordinate means do it not, or do to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we are to keep our selves pure, possess our selves
with Patience, and refer the Remedy to God, who
hath reserved this to himself: We ought not to justle
God out of his Right. Before we have said, that
Scripture affords no warrant by Precept or Practice
to the Community, the collective or representative
Body to do it; But now we add, for them to do it, by
opposing or resisting Sovereignty, is in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbidden: <hi>Romans 13. 2. Whosoever resisteth
the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God; and they that
resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi> Of this more
<hi>Quaest.</hi> 5. We must therefore closely adhere to what
God hath commanded, not turning to the left hand,
to obey unlawful things commanded by <hi>the Sovereign;</hi>
nor to the right hand, with violence to resist lawful
Authority. Let all Subjects remember, that in the day
of their Accounts the charge will be to all <hi>singly</hi> or <hi>joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
considered, <hi>Who hath required these things at your
hands?</hi> Who hath made you Judges and Executers
of matters of so high concernment? And though it
be pretended and possibly intended too, that the work
so done shall make much for <hi>the glory of God, the good
of the Church, the liberty and happiness of the Subject,</hi> it
will not take us off. <hi>We must not do evil that good may
come of it, Rom.</hi> 3. 8. To do God a piece of good
service against his Will manifested, is not to acquit our
selves as <hi>his humble servants,</hi> but to prove us <hi>his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
and proud Masters.</hi> He is most glorified when his
voice is obeyed: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22. God standeth not in
need of wicked man, nor of his sinful wayes. It was a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:33502:137"/>
pious Intention <hi>Vzza</hi> had, when he put out his hand
to save the Ark from falling: yet because it was above
his Charge, God did strike him presently dead,
2 <hi>Sam. 6. 6. 1 Chron.</hi> 13. 10. It is not enough for
these Reformers to be assured in their Consciences,
that the work they intend and are about, tends to a
good, religious, and pious effect: but they must have
a sufficient Warrant from written Truth, that they are
warranted and called to this work.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, as it is against Piety, it is against Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and the good of Policy: Prudence doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us to lose what real Good we have in present
Possession, for any future good which we have only in
uncertain Expectation. By this projected Course of
our <hi>New-Statist-Divines</hi> we loose a good Conscience,
fall in actual Disobedience and Rebellion against the
Lord, and his Anointed. We refuse Gods Tryal, and
with an unwarrantable, indiscreet, and unseasonable
Zeal for Religion, and our temporary Good, come
contrary to God and his Commandments. We ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
nay, shake off the Glory that God expecteth by
our Tryals, and cannot, dare not, expect Gods Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to our Endeavours. If the Root be evil the Fruit
can be no better. Who may expect a Blessing to a
sinful and rebellious Course? Doth he allow us to do
wrong and seek an Opportunity to do Good? God
acteth no Evil, but only permitteth it, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is able to work Good out of Evil; which is
as inseparably proper to God alone as the immensity
of his Power: it is infinitely a superlative Presumption
for us to presume upon the like. We cannot expect
any Blessing without a promise; and have no Interest
in the Promise, but when our Acts and Works pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
Obedience to his Precepts. By such a Course
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:33502:137"/>
as you prescribe, we make the precept of God of none
Effect. Our excuse in this case will prove no better
than the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who taught their Disciples, doing
things unlawful, to say <hi>Corban,</hi> God shall have Profit
by it, in the good we shall do to Church and State.
When we come to Judgment our Works shall witness
against us, and our good Intentions will not save us;
you know it is commonly and truly said, Hell is full
of good Intentions, and Heaven of good works.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, if we look upon the practice recorded in
Scripture, when Gods people were delivered from Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
or Captivity, or when Grievances in Church
and State were rectified and reformed, God never
gave warrant to the Community or to the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi>
but did it by his own high hand, or authorized a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
and put it in his Heart and Power to do it.
Look upon the Bondage of <hi>Aegypt</hi> which lasted 250
years, God did not use or authorize the People to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
themselves by a strong hand, but sent and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
<hi>Moses, Exod. 3. 10. Come now saith the Lord,</hi>
and. I will send thee; a calling he had, Authority from
God he had, and it proved successful. Some pious
and learned men are of the Opinion, that when <hi>Moses</hi>
rescued the <hi>Israelite,</hi> and killed the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> he did
offer himself a Protector and Deliverer to his Nation,
but that for his unwarrantable Intention and Attempt,
he was forced to flee, and with forty years Penance
and Repentance wash away that Guiltiness. As I dare
not condemn them confidently, yet I trust such is their
Charity, to allow me in Modesty to dissent from them.
First, because I hold it a good rule, not rashly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the extraordinary Acts of the Saints, when they
are not evidently in Scripture condemned; it is Saint
<hi>Austin</hi>'s Rule. Next, because of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:33502:138"/>
who, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. expresseth so much, that this was
a <hi>praeludium,</hi> an Evidence that God was to send him
to be their Deliverer. I am certainly assured that God
did not think it a fit way by <hi>Moses</hi> and the People of
<hi>Israel</hi>'s Sword to work his Deliverance. But forty
years after sent <hi>Moses</hi> cloathed with his immediate
Commission, to command <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his Vicegerent to
let his people go; and authorized <hi>Moses</hi> his Vice-Roy
over his own People, that so the Peoples obedience to
his Servant <hi>Moses,</hi> and to the word delivered in his
Name, might be without check or wrong of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in regard of their Allegiance. It is very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and conducible to our Purpose, that God did not
deliver his people by the wisdom of <hi>Moses,</hi> or strength
of the People, or any act that way of theirs, but did
with an high hand by his own immediate Might and
Power. God thereby declaring to us, that before he
would authorize his own People to do it, which had
been a bad president for ever for Rebellion, he would
rather put himself to pains to work extraordinary and
wonderful Miracles.</p>
            <p>So in the Book of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> when the people were
delivered over into the hands of their Enemies, because
of their Sins. He never warranted and authorized the
ordinary Judges or Community to be their Deliverers,
but the Text saith expresly, that when they groaned
under their Oppression, and repented of their Sins,
God <hi>raised up a Iudge.</hi> Is not this a real proof, God
will not have inferiour Judges, or the Community, to
rectifie what is amiss, but we must in patience wait
till he provide lawful means, some Sovereign power
immediately sent by himself to do it? in which course
in his ordinary Providence he will never be deficient,
although the extraordinary way be ceased, if we
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33502:138"/>
will repent us truly of our Sins, and wait in patience
for the Salvation of our God. Is it not worth your
Labour to observe when the gracious Deliverance came
to <hi>Israel</hi> from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which lasted
seventy years, that his people had no hand, no part
in it, not to contribute the least Auxiliary help, but
God effected it by the hand of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Anointed,
immediately and totally? Appeareth it not clearly by
this, how careful God hath been in his Providence,
that People may not right themselves by their own
doing, not when they are under greatest Pressures,
highest Oppressions? For what were the Kings of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
but to speak in our Adversaries diction, <hi>Tyranni
cum titulo?</hi> Who acquired Sovereignty over them by
Conquest, their Consent being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily,
involuntarily.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for these popular Reformations lately so
much cryed up, as the best, the most divine, the most
warrantable, methinks are most unwarrantably magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
It is not to be denied, but people are much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with such Doctrines, and are very ambitious to be
Reformers of Church and State: And subtle factio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
Spirits have great Advantages to work on the People
and their weak Understandings, for there can be no
Government either in Church or State, so eminently
perfect, where something might not be wished to be
amended. No Government is so commodious, which
is not attended with some Incommodities; that as the
<hi>Comick</hi> saith, <hi>aut haec cum illis habenda, aut illa cum his
amittenda sunt:</hi> from those Inconveniences in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
crafty and discontented men take occasion to

the present Inconveniences, shew them their Interest,
how in Conscience they are bound, and by God war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33502:139"/>
to put to their hand, promise them not only a
share in <hi>the glorious Work of Reformation,</hi> but also to
free them from all Errours and Pressures, to mould
and frame such an <hi>Vtopia</hi> in the State, and such a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
of the Church,</hi> that shall not want any thing but
Christ to come and reign actually and personally
amongst them, which they expect, as I hear, and have
defined the time. When people are deceived thus and
transported, these <hi>Achitophels, Absaloms,</hi> and <hi>Sheba's</hi>
desire the Assistance of the people to bring this happy
Change about. They obtain it, engage their Souls by
Oaths, Covenants, and Perjury, and engage them so
much in Treason and Rebellion, that Life, State, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and Honour lie at the Stake; come off they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
By which means they get into their hands sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitiously
<hi>an arbitrary Power,</hi> the thing they most
feared, most abhorred, and practise it too. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the people are made to believe, that they all
and the whole, are interressed, yet really and truly
some few domineer. They command what Supplies
they will, of <hi>Men, Arms, and Monies;</hi> seize all Forts,
press all Horses, &amp;c. and that in that way, in that
quantity, they think necessary, which must be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
otherwise they are not sufficiently enabled to
bring about such a great Work, Reformation of
Church and State, and Preservation of the people.
This is the way by which these Principles find easie
Admittance upon popular Affections, but cunning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
doth so abuse them, that they are cheated out of
their Wits, and follow Courses destructive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and bring upon them the Evils they most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It is not reason that will right these deceived
and abused Fools, <gap reason="foreign">

Misery will be the first competent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33502:139"/>
to undeceive them. The Doctrine and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
we first bring to the contrary of this Tenet, we
know assuredly they will not relish them, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
use will be made, to incense a mad people and
make them more mad: yet Truth forceth us to speak;
for <hi>Vbi resipuerint,</hi> when they come to their Wits, they
will curse their <hi>Gamaliels,</hi> and forsake their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>First then, I demand of those who so magnifie <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi>
Reformations, as the only best, most perfect and
absolute Remedies of what is amiss in Church or State;
who that hath read Scripture, or by Experience hath
remarked the Temper and Constitution of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
can believe that Almighty God hath committed
such a Trust to them? Is there one of a thousand, if
you trust <hi>Iob</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> amongst them of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Was ever any act done by them but in a <hi>tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
way?</hi> And is not their Reformation attended
with <hi>Fury and Violence,</hi> Impiety against God, sacred
Persons, sacred Places, sacred Things? Have not these
mis-called Reformations been acted, prosecuted with
open and crying Injustice, not only against innocent
but well deserving men?</p>
            <p>Secondly, I desire them to shew me in Scripture, or
in Ecclesiastical and authentick Story any popular <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
of Church or State,</hi> happy and successful:
what they alledge in this last Age, are the Instances
controverted; and till they give instances <hi>extra proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
not questioned, by their Favour they only beg the
Question. When God established both Policy and
Church, after the Deliverance of his People from the
House of Bondage, he would not do it, but by <hi>Moses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
his Sovereign Viceroy, <hi>King of Ieshurun,</hi> Deut. 33.
<hi>Ioshua</hi> did the like: <hi>Ios.</hi> 24. The Judges raised by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33502:140"/>
God as they delivered the people from their Slavery,
so they rectified what was amiss in Church and State.
What Desolations were there in Church and State in
<hi>Saul</hi>'s Reign? Both State and Church in the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Sincerity of the Worship in the days of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
came to their <hi>Zenith,</hi> to their highest Perfection

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Beauty: Read you, I pray you, of any doing in
it but by <hi>David</hi> the King, with the Advice and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of some Church-men? Afterwards when it was
corrupted, who made the Reformation? None but he
who was King or Sovereign: as <hi>Ioash, 2 Chron. 24.
Ezechias, 2 Chron. 29, 30, 31. Iosias, 2 Chron. 34. 35.
Ezra, Esd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make Covenants against King or Sovereign, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
or intending, if you will so, the Reformation
of Religion, where read you it? The first Covenant
of a people formed into a politick Body, is that you
read <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. Had either the Community, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
or representative Body any other hand in it than
to obey, as <hi>Moses</hi> King of <hi>Ioshurun</hi> commanded? <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
made another, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 24. consider the place, and
see if either <hi>Tables or Parliament</hi> framed it, urged it.
You have another, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. but it is done and
pressed by the royal Authority of <hi>Asa the King.</hi> You
have another, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. but it is the Act of <hi>Iosiah</hi>
the King. The like you read of <hi>Esdra, Esd.</hi> 10. If
any object the Covenant of <hi>Iehojada</hi> in the Non-age
of <hi>Ioash;</hi> Let them be pleased to remember that this
was the High Priests act, not as High Priest, but as
Governour to the King. By the same Power he did
it, by which he dethroned <hi>Athaliah,</hi> armed the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and enthroned <hi>Ioash.</hi> Shew me one Covenant
in the book of God, which was made without the
King, except it be a Covenant with Hell and Death;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:33502:140"/>
or as <hi>Iudas</hi> covenanted with the <hi>Iews</hi> to sell and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
his Master. Or such a Covenant as the Prophet
<hi>Hosea</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Chap. 10. vers. 3, 4. For now they
shall say, we have no King, because we feared not the
Lord; what then should a King do unto us? They have
spoken words, swearing falsely, in making a Covenant;
thus Iudgment springeth up as Hemlock in the furrows of
the field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reflect upon Popular acts invading Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
and attempting Reformation, and you will
find them as sinful, as little successful, as Kings of
Popular Election. It is recorded in <hi>Exodus,</hi> that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
the Sovereign of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> being absent
forty dayes in the Mountain with God; the People,
notwithstanding that they had lately sworn a lawful
Covenant, forced <hi>Aaron</hi> to make them Gods, a molt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Calf, and forsake the true and living God: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.
11.</hi> Here you have a glorious popular Reformation
in Religion. Take another Reformation in the State,
and see if it be better. The People of <hi>Israel</hi> living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the happy Government of <hi>David,</hi> by the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Absalom</hi> and his fellow-Traytors, possessed
a Prejudice of <hi>David</hi> and his Government, that Justice
was not done, and the State might be better ordered,
assemble without Warrant of the King (a Treason if
any thing else, if we look on Scripture) to <hi>Absalom,</hi>
under pretence of a Vow, shake off <hi>David,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
themselves Subjects to <hi>Absalom</hi> the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
the Usurper: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. The ten Tribes after
the death of <hi>Solomon</hi> supplicate <hi>Reboboam</hi> for a Redress
of their Grievances; not answered to their mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> To strengthen their Kingdom
and Policy, they set up a new Religion, make new
Priests of their own. Their Religion is the same
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33502:141"/>
their Fathers attempted in the Wilderness, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.
and this is the <hi>second glorious Reformation</hi> of Calves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship:
what was the issue, I pray you? it pursued
them to their utter extirpation. What can be said o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that abominable act of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
condemned Christ? Are not <hi>Communities</hi> subject
to dangerous Inclinations from private Incitements?
Are not their <hi>Representatives</hi> subject to mis-leading
Factions, and ambitions of private ends? They are
too much transported with the love of a popular
estate, who can so over-rule their Understandings, as
to force themselves to think, that Communities, or
their Representative bodies, are not molested or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with corrupt judgments and affections for
private ends.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Seeing then to establish the People
to be the last and best Remedy to rectifie all Errours
in State, in Church, establisheth so many Absurdities
and Paradoxes, and hath no warrant by Scripture,
sound Reason, or Experience, we can neither believe
it, nor approve it: for to aver and affirm that a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
diffusive, collective,</hi> or <hi>representative,</hi> is a perfect
Republick to preserve it self, and to right what is
amiss, abstracting the notion of a Republick, from
the Sovereign Governour or Governours, is a notion
not imaginable, nor ever used by any who ever wrote
or spoke right in Policy. It secureth the multitude
from Errour both in matters concerning Church and
State: There is neither Precept nor Practice in Holy
Writ to warrant that the multitude have such a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent
Power above their Sovereign. Nay, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
commandeth us the contrary, not to assume this
Power, or to resist the Higher Powers, under no less
pain than Damnation. This Maxim resolves into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:33502:141"/>
that we trust not God can do it, or will do it;
and into Impatience, that we will not wait patiently till
he do it. Christian obedience and Sobriety teacheth
us to reserve the rectifying of the Sovereign, and his
Errours in Government, to God himself. We must
not serve God against his Will, nor without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Warrant for our doing so. By doing, as our
new Statists warrant us, we run into Rebellion, and
lose a good Conscience in dutiful obedience and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
submission, and prejudice God of that glory he
expects by our tryals. We must not do evil that good
may come of it, nor upon pretences of good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and good effects to follow upon such courses,
prove our selves to be proud Masters, and forsake to
be Gods humble Servants. In all Deliverances God
bestowed upon his own People, in his wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
he effected them, either by his own immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
hand, or by some other hands, not permitting or
allowing to his People any share in the work, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
how we would make it, if it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
a bad president for rebellious courses. Popular
Reformations are neither warrantable nor successful.
The multitude are most of all unfitted for preserving
Church or State. In Scripture we have no Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
recorded, but only such as have been acted by
the authority of the Sovereign. Many popular tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
courses we find attempted and effected by the
People, to the hurt and ruine of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Wherefore let every one, and all of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
be subject to Superiour Powers, in obedience to
that is good, and in Patience suffering what is evil,
waiting patiently till God in his appointed time send
relief, and deliver his Church and us from pressing
and oppressing Evils.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Wherein is examined that Maxim, Salus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli
Suprema Lex esto. And the other, That
the People may be without a King, but a King
cannot be without People.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THis vulgar Maxim, <hi>Salus Populi Suprema Lex
esto,</hi> was one of the Laws of the XII Tables.
It was made for a Democracy, and hath in it
a good and warrantable sense, if it be rightly taken in
its proper meaning: But as it is abused and perverted
by our <hi>Miso-monarchical Statists</hi> and <hi>Sectaries,</hi> it hath
been the Mother of much mischief.</p>
            <p>The Sectaries who abuse it, understand it so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
at least make the People conceive so, that all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Superiority in Governours and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
is primely, nay, only for the Subjects and Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
good. This holds not; for some Government
and Governours are by God and Nature appointed for
the mutual and inseparable good of the Governour
and Governed, of the Superiour and Inferiour, as <hi>in
maritali regimine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; in paterno,</hi> as in the marital and
fatherly Government. Some Governments are prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
principally, and properly for the good of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and Governour, as <hi>in herili dominio,</hi> in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a Lord and Servant; where the good
and benefit of the Servant is but <hi>secondary and consecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
intended; it is not the principal end, but the
external and adventitious; as the gain that cometh to
a Physician by his Practice, is not the proper internal
and principal end of his Art, Science, and Practice, but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:33502:142"/>
               <hi>consequitur ad medicinam,</hi> it followeth and attendeth his
Skill and Practice.</p>
            <p>What can our Adversaries say of a Title acquired to
a Kingdom by lawful Conquest? That such a Title
is good, and a King may be lawful King by Conquest
meerly, without the consent of the People, is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in Scripture as it cannot be denied. In this case,
the good and benefit of the Conquerour is the prime
thing and principal. The Conquerour may dispose
of it at pleasure for his own good, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did give
<hi>Cabul</hi> to <hi>Hiram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, according to the Jesuit's and Puritan's
grounds, as a man may render himself totally under
the Power of a Master, without any conditions or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations,
or bounds whatsoever; why may not the
Body of a People do the like, to have Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
surrender themselves fully into the Power of a
King? May not a Lord of many great Mannors and
Lands (if the Laws of the Countrey do not forbid it)
admit no man to live and gain by living within his
Territories and Countreys, but upon condition of a
full surrender of himself, his Posterity, and all belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, into his Lords power? Doth not <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
tell us, that anciently amongst the <hi>Germans</hi> every
Head of the Family was <hi>Father, King,</hi> and <hi>Priest;</hi> and
that all the Tenants of his Territories had no more
corn for meat, no more number of Flocks, no more
for use of cloaths, than it pleased their Lord to allow
them? <hi>Suam quisque familiam, suo penates regis; fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti
modum dominus, aut pecoris, aut vestis colono injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,
&amp; servus hactenus patet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May not a disorderly multitude, without order and
government, or any subordination at all (this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but let us take it as probable, because imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable)
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:33502:143"/>
conceiving Safety and Good to themselves, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
surrender themselves into the power of one to rule
over them hereditarily? Or may not a people in a
formed and framed politick Body, upon the Receit
of a great Benefit, as Deliverance by one from a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Oppression, surrender themselves thus totally to
their Deliverer and his Successors? It is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the Israelites did offer some such Condition
to <hi>Gideon</hi> and his Posterity, for the great Deliverance
they had from the <hi>Midianites</hi> by his Sword, <hi>Iudges</hi> 8.
Did not the <hi>Campani</hi> in this way, if we may trust <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,</hi>
subject themselves totally to the people of <hi>Rome?
Populum Campanum,</hi> saith he in the words of their
chief Heads, <hi>Vrbemque Capuam, agros, delubra deûm,
divina, humanaque omnia in vestram P. C. ditionem dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
O noble Senators, we surrender and give up
unto your Dition and Power, the people of <hi>Campania,</hi>
our City <hi>Capua,</hi> our Lands, the Temples of our Gods,
and what divine and humane things are ours. By
what is said, it is more than apparent, that this, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
populi suprema lex esto, Let the Good and Safety of
the People be the supreme Law:</hi> is not an universal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
of Nature, a paramont Law, which is universally
verified of all Government and Governours.</p>
            <p>This Speech is as much abused, when by these new
Statists it is applied to Monarchy. I most heartily
grant that the Preservation of the Peace and Safety of
Subjects and People is the <hi>prime end</hi> in the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all Government, but it is not the <hi>sole and adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
end.</hi> The <hi>complete, adaequate, and perfect end of
Government</hi> in Monarchy, is <hi>Salus Regis &amp; Populi,</hi> the
Safety of King and People. Notwithstanding the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Good of the people may be called the <hi>prime and
principal end</hi> in the Constitution of <hi>Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:33502:143"/>
because it is most agreeable with the <hi>joynt Interest
of King and People.</hi> It is a word exceeding well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
a King, to say, <hi>Salus Populi suprema lex esto,</hi>
let the Safety of the People be the <hi>Paramont Law.</hi>
There is no Doubt that the King ought to proportion
all his Laws to this end, this is just, this is necessary,
this is honourable, this is advantageous to the King:
who that is wise, will not provide as much as he is
able, for the Good, Safety, Plenty, and Peace of those,
in whose happiness is his Glory, and in whose Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
his own is involved? And on the other hand it
becometh Subjects well to say, <hi>Salus Regis suprema lex
esto,</hi> and to proportion all their Obedience, Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and Actions for the Safety, Honour, Power,
Happiness, and Glory of their King. It is impossible
the Subject can have Peace or Safety where the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and his Prerogative are weakened so that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
command and protect.</p>
            <p>To reason from the one part of the end of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
Government, the Safety, and the Good of the
Subjects, to the Destruction or weakening of the other
part of the end, of the power of Sovereignty, and the
royal Prerogative, is the Sophism which the School
calleth <hi>à divisis.</hi> Nor can we imagine <hi>a possible or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Existence</hi> of the good and right of the Subject,
without <hi>a pre-existence</hi> of the entire Sovereignty and
Prerogative in the King: this is easily demonstrable, if
we consider what was the prime end of the Institution
or Constitution of Kings. By uniform and universal
Consent it is acknowledged to be for this purpose
primely to preserve people in Peace, Plenty, and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If the King then be not authorised and furnished
with sufficient power to work this effect, how can
the People expect it? By the Suffrage of our anti-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:33502:144"/>
opposites it is granted, that the Multitude
and People were at first necessitated to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>unius imperio,</hi> to the Government of one King,
and to commit themselves, their Lives, their Laws,
their Fortunes, to his Trust and Power; because they
knew such was their Weakness, that they had not
Wisdom enough to rule themselves, to foresee, and
prevent Dangers, nor Power enough to protect them
from wrong of the more powerful either living amongst
them, or nearly adjoyned to them. And for this
cause in their Opinion accorded that for Honour and
Power he should be sufficiently enabled to act and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
all these acts of Government, and to effect and
produce those ends, <hi>his own and their Happiness:</hi> nor
doubted they to entrust him with Majesty (the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Majesty</hi> speaketh two things, <hi>summum honorem &amp; sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
potestatem,</hi> supremest Honour, and supremest
Power) being assured that his Interest was so involved
in theirs, that he could not chuse but most earnestly
and carefully endeavour this end: by which premisses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(which are their own) it is most certain, that <hi>Salus
Populi,</hi> the Safety of the People, issueth from <hi>Salus
Regis,</hi> the Safety of the King, no less than the Life of
the natural Body from the Soul that enliveneth it:
notwithstanding we think they should speak more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely,
if with the dialect of holy Scripture they would
say, that Almighty God knowing that no Society of
mankind could be, nor Happiness in that Society with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Government, ordained for this, and that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be, and the Governours entirely endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and enabled with Power and Honour to do it; and
that conformable to his own Government, at first he
in Paradise fixed this Government in the person of one

Sea,</hi> than to be in a poenal condition, <hi>and that some
shall seek to dye for ease, but shall not find it.</hi> Heathen
Politicians tell us, <hi>Tyrannis potior Anarchiâ,</hi> Tyranny is
better than no Government.</p>
            <p>Scripture is plain and powerful enough for this
truth, that no safety can be to mankind, without the
safety of Sovereignty, and of the Prerogative of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and Government, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. It is the first
Precept of the second Table, <hi>Honor a patrem, &amp;c. Honour
thy Father;</hi> where, by Father is principally (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Commentaries of Ancient and Modern
Divines) meant the King: then followeth, <hi>Thou shalt
do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
not steal, &amp;c.</hi> To intimate to us, that neither Life,
nor Chastity, nor Goods, nor Honour, nor Fame, nor
any thing else can be preserved, except the King have
his Right.</p>
            <p>The expressions of Scripture are admirably empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
to import, that in the King and his strength is
all our Safety, our Life, our Happiness. The King is
called, <hi>Lament. 4. 20. The breath of our nostrils;</hi> this

               </gap> implieth as much,
that he is the very bottom and foundation upon which
the publick good of the whole State, and the private
good of every one is founded and built. Excellent
expressions they be, diametrally opposed to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Policy of this miserable Age. The King is
the breath of our nostrils, then no Life without him;
He is our Head, then all Life, Sense, and Perfection in
him, all Motion from him, and the influence of his
Government; he is our Light, nothing then but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptiacal
darkness and blindness without him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Government; he is our Shepherd, then no
maintenance, no entertainment without him; he is
the Corner-stone, then nothing but he can tye man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
together in a peaceable and comfortable Society;
nay, he is the Foundation, the Corner-stone, and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of the Corner, upon whom all is built and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in whom all are conjoyned, and by whom all are
protected. Turn it over again; take away the King, you
take away our Life, our breath; weaken him, we faint, we
pant; hurt the Head, you distemper all the Body; weaken
the Head, and you feeble both hand and foot, and all
parts and members of the Body; smite the Shepherd
and the Flock will be scattered; if the foundations be
destroyed, what can the Righteous do? If the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
be pulled out, the side-walls and whole Fabrick
must fall; if the Head-corner-stone be removed, there
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:33502:145"/>
is no protection against the Tempest, but Rain and
storm will spoil the whole Building.</p>

they come. If Kings were not, we should be as the
Fishes of the Sea, the greater destroying the smaller, or

            <p>It is worthy your notice taking, that in the Book

two things to us: 1. The one is, that they
wanted Monarchy, the most excellent of Governments.

was so weakened, that in Church and State no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was sound, the grossest Enormities did abound,
and there was no strength in Authority to right it:
Review the story, There was no King this time, and
consequently, there was all mischief this time, and
therefore a fit time to shake off the old, and bring in
a new Religion. <hi>Micah</hi> and <hi>his old doting Mother</hi> will
have a Religion of their own, an Idol of their own, a
trencher-Chaplain of their own, there is nothing to
let it. No matter for sacred Orders, if a Levite may
be had it is better, otherwise it skilleth not much.
The reason is given in the Text, <hi>In diebus illis, &amp;c.</hi> in
those ill dayes there was no King in Israel. I wish
we were so happy that these Times of ours had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
with that time. Well, but it is no great
matter for Religion, if every man can enjoy his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
his Honour, his Peace, live in Safety, what is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to us? If this be Religion, these Times want
not Professours too too many. It will not rest here,
although every man have liberty, or licence rather in
Anarchy, to have and to profess what Religion he will,
the same Scripture telleth us, <hi>where no King is,</hi> Rapine
and Spoil will be; where no King is, plundering will be
good Justice; every man's Lands, Revenues and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
may be <hi>fortiter occupantis,</hi> the stronger may disseize
the weaker; you shall have the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> to spoil
too. Nor is this all, <hi>The men of Gibeah</hi> will abuse the
Levite's Wife, nay, do it avowedly, abuse her to death;
it is no great danger to act and do what mischief you
will, <hi>where no King is. No man's Soul, Wife, Life, or
Goods can be secured, where no King is.</hi> Idols may be
erected, Murder may be acted and allowed, Men rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of their Goods, and all this good Service, <hi>for the
glory of God and the good Cause.</hi> Consider again, how
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:33502:147"/>
universal these Mischiefs are, you have a <hi>Micah</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man, <hi>Gibeah</hi> a <hi>City, Dan</hi> a Tribe, all out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and course. Religion is defaced, Justice is abused,
Honesty and Civil moral Conversation is shaken off;
Dishonesty, Impiety, Uncleanness are avowed. Again
consider, <hi>Micah</hi> was at Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> in the midst
of the Land, <hi>Gibeah</hi> was at one end of the Countrey,
and <hi>Dan</hi> at the other, so that these Mischiefs were not
confined to one corner, but were spred over all the
Land. And seeing Scripture repeats it, let us repeat it
too, all these Disorders, all these Mischiefs were, because
<hi>in those dayes there was no King in Israel.</hi> Turn it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
No better way to keep Religion sincere and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
mens Lives and Wives, Honour, Goods and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Safety; to secure them from Murder, Abuse,
Oppression, than <hi>by Kings.</hi> No doubt, Priests there
were then, but either they would not serve at all, or
then the Priests were over-awed by the disorderly and
sinful multitude, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. or did prescribe their Text,
give them Commentaries, taught them what to say,
what to preach. No doubt, in those dayes Judges
they had, but Justice was not done, or if done, at
pleasure; otherwise Judges were posted and signed
with a <hi>nigrum theta,</hi> marked to be stoned by a rascally
multitude. Though Priests be in the Church, and
Judges be in the Land, they are not able to guard the
Publick or Private from wrong; wherefore it is most
consonant with Scripture to say, <hi>Salus Regis suprema
Populi salus,</hi> the Safety of the King, and his Divine
Royal Prerogative, is the safest Sanctuary for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Vbi non est gubernator populus corruet,</hi> so readeth
St. <hi>Hierom Solomon's</hi> words. I refer my self in this to
the Consciences and Experience of the King's Subjects,
what hath been the security or comfort they have had
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:33502:148"/>
in Person, State, or Goods, since the Lords Anointed,
the best of Kings, hath been wronged. O if they durst
speak! O if they would speak!</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoseah,</hi> cap. 3. 4. threatneth as the
greatest of Judgments in this world, <hi>That the children
of Israel shall be many dayes without a King.</hi> Listen I
pray you, to what followeth, <hi>and without a Prince,</hi>
that is, there shall be no Nobility; and what more?
<hi>and without a Sacrifice;</hi> that is, there shall be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
no true Priest. The same Prophet, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. 3.
sheweth they shall have no King, because they feared
not the Lord. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Lam.</hi> 11. 9. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth
first, that their <hi>Kings were captives;</hi> then, that
they had no Nobility, for <hi>their Princes were captives
too;</hi> then, <hi>the Law is no more;</hi> Justice is gone with the
King; and then, <hi>the Prophets find no Vision from the
Lord;</hi> Religion is gone too. Will not all this lead us
to better thoughts, a better esteem of <hi>Salus Regis,</hi> of
the Safety of the King, the preferring of his Divine
Right, and Royal Prerogative? It may be our Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots

Law that giveth Law to all Laws whatsoever, that
the Law of Prerogative it self is subservient to this Law,
and were it not conducing thereunto, it were not necessary
nor expedient?</hi> Some more superlatively excessive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
the <hi>Observator</hi> and others gives unto this
Maxim; which how they cohere with what we have
brought from Scripture, and said by its warrant, I
humbly submit to the intelligent, to the impartial
Reader; and come to consider the no less lame, than
extravagant consequences the <hi>Observator</hi> deduceth from
this mis-understood and abused Maxim. They be four,
which when we look upon them inwardly, are
such as never Saint of God, nor sound Politician
thought of before; we shall follow him in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>The first Consequence that he knits with this Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
The Safety of the People is the Supreme Law,
is an, <hi>Ergo, The King is bound in duty to promote all and
every one of his Subjects to all happiness.</hi> Certainly,
there is more in the Conclusion than is vertually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Premisses; for when <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> the
Safety of the People, to which the King is tied, to
conclude <hi>omnis foelicitas populi,</hi> all happiness of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and with that large extent, to all and every one,
may well be answered with a <hi>non sequitur,</hi> that the
Consequence is lame: the reason is clear, <hi>Salus populi</hi> may
subsist without <hi>Foelicitas Populi, Foelicitas dicit quid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus;</hi>
the Safety of the People may subsist without the
Felicity of the People, for Felicity of the People is the
Safety of the People, and somewhat more. I demand
of the <hi>Observator</hi> and his Complices, who ever heard
that either by the <hi>Law of God, Nature,</hi> or <hi>common
Equity,</hi> the King is bound to promote <hi>all and every of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:33502:149"/>
his Subjects to all Happiness?</hi> God is not so rigorous a
Task-master: nor is the <hi>notion of the word [protect]</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in it's native or used Sense, to which the King is
bound, so large, as to tye him to promote all and
every Subject <hi>to all happiness.</hi> It is not imaginable,
the tenderest-hearted Father or Mother can do this to
their best beloved Child, nor doth God or Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it. Doth the <hi>Observator</hi> by such Consequences
intend to make a Kings charge intolerable, God injust
to impose it, a King unable to do it, and resolves to
condemn all Kings who do not so provide for the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of all and every one of his Subjects in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
measure? Who will deny but every King is bound
to level all his Actions, Intentions, and Endeavours,
for the Peace, Plenty, and Safety of his Subjects in
common? But to put this Burthen on the King which
neither he nor his Fathers were able to bear, is too hard
a measure. We may expect this from his Goodness
and Bounty, we cannot charge it upon him as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and incumbent to him of Duty.</p>
            <p>Are not all and every one of Subjects by Duty and
Oath tyed to <hi>Salus Regis,</hi> to provide for his Safety,
Honour, Wealth, and Power? Are not we sworn to
it in the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> to assist and defend all
Priviledges, Preeminences, and Rights belonging to
<hi>His Highness, his Heirs, and Successors,</hi> or annexed to
the <hi>Imperial Crown of this Realm?</hi> If all have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this Oath, all born in his Majesties Dominions
are bound to it; of all it may be actually exacted: and
the <hi>Statute 5. Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. ordains that <hi>all Barons,
Knights, Citizens, Burgesses elected for the Parliament,
who shall not take the Oath of Allegiance made 1. Eliz.
at their Entry in the Parliament House, shall have no
Voice in Parliament, but be construed, as if they had never
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:33502:149"/>
been elected, and suffer such Pains and Penalties, as if they
had presumed to sit in Parliament without Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
or Authority.</hi> By this Oath mentioned in the
<hi>Statute,</hi> they are bound <hi>to bear Faith and true Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the Queens Highness, her Heirs, and lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and to their Power assist and defend all Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Priviledges, Preeminences, and Authorities, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the Queens Highness, her Heirs and Successors, or
united and annexed to the imperial Crown of this Realm:</hi>
or likewise by their Oath, 3. <hi>Iac. being bound to defend
him and his lawful Successors to the uttermost of their
Power against all Conspiracies and Attempts whatsoever,
which shall be made against his Person, Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
by reason of any Sentence or Declaration flowing from
the Pope, or otherwise, and to their best Endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and make known to his Majesty, his Heirs, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
all Treasons, and trayterous Conspiracies, which
they shall know, or hear to be against him or any of them.</hi>
Here you see all Subjects and every one to the <hi>uttermost
of their Power,</hi> are bound to assist and defend the Kings
Right and Prerogative, and that none can enter the
Houses of Parliament till actually they swear it: will
it therefore from hence follow, that all and every one
of his Majesties Subjects, at least such as have entered
the Houses of Parliament, all and every one of them
are for-sworn, who have intended or attempted any
thing besides, or who intending or doing it hath not
raised him to the highest degree and pitch of Honour,
Glory and Power? In this case I am hopeful the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator,</hi>
like <hi>Iudah,</hi> will be more favourable to himself
and his Patrons, than he is in the other to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:
Who, before these new Statists, that ever wrote
the Charge of a King, bound him to promote all and
every one of his Subjects to all kind and highest Degree
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:33502:150"/>
of political and temporal Happiness? Is it in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the most puissant Monarch upon Earth to advance
all his Subjects capable and deserving men to the
highest pitch of Happiness and Honour? <hi>Parcius ista
viris, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To shut up all that concerneth this first absurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
drawn from this abused Maxim, I intreat the
<hi>Observator</hi> to remember that Almighty God did never
judge it fit to entrust the People with their own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but in a subordinate way, hath committed this
<hi>Trust to his Anointed, his Vicegerent upon Earth:</hi> from
whence issueth this Consequence, that <hi>Salus Regis
est salus populi,</hi> The Safety of the King is the Safety of
the People: as <hi>Salus Animae</hi> is <hi>salus Corporis,</hi> the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Soul is the Safety of the Body. The Fathers
judged it so; see <hi>Iustin Martyr quaest. &amp; resp. ad Orthod.
q.</hi> 138. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
This holy Father knew no other case of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
than that the King is the Soul, and the Subjects
the Body. Let the <hi>Observator</hi> judge then, where the
Safety is most considerable: and learn from <hi>Salust,
Animi imperio, corporis servitio utimur;</hi> or from <hi>Tacitus,
Nempe iis,</hi> that is, <hi>Imperatoribus, dii Imperium dedere,
nobis obsequii gloria relicta est.</hi> And the Heathen will
learn him to acknowledge, that the Honour and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the King, his Glory, and entire Prerogative is
the Transcendent <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of all Politicks, the paramont
Law, that giveth Law to all Laws concerning private
men, their Lives, Estate, and Honour; and that all
Subjects are to promote the Sovereign Right and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
to the utmost of their Power, as the publick
Soul of the Kingdom, and the Breath of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:33502:150"/>
            <p>The second Corollary, which the <hi>Observator</hi> dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
out of this Principle, <hi>Salus populi suprema lex esto,</hi>
is, <hi>that it were strange if the people subjecting themselves to
command should aim at any thing but their own Good in
the first and last place.</hi> This Consequence presupposeth
two Errors, the one is, that the people are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Authors and Donors of Sovereignty, which we
have already refuted: the other is, that the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Sovereignty is by Trust, and that in that Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and proportion the people please, the error of
which we will by God's grace discover in our third
Question. To take this off briefly, I ask of the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi>
that seeing God hath ordained <hi>Rule and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and directeth mankind to their greatest Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
by Government; and seeing God and Nature
teach, and all do acknowledge that the <hi>Good, Plenty,
Peace, and Safety of the people</hi> cannot be effected or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to, except the King be proportioned to so <hi>high
a degree of Honour, Wealth, and Power, that as Father
he may protect all, administrate Iustice, secure from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and Sedition at home, and from Invasion abroad;</hi>
and have Main tenance proportionable to these ends,
whether or not in Order of Nature, in the first place
it is necessary that <hi>this Power, Honour, and Maintenance</hi>
be secured to the King, without which we cannot
expect Safety, Peace, or Good to the Subject? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we have made a Divorce betwixt our selves and
Reason, we must grant this Truth. If you will trust
Saint <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> hear him speak it upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these words, <hi>He is the Minister of God for good unto
thee,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
In which words two things are
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33502:151"/>
expressed; first, that the King is immediately sent from
God; the other is, that he is sent for our Good; no
Safety then for us without him, and for both Respects
we are to honour him, for all Good which we have
by our Industry is by Influence from his Government,
and he is a co-worker with us, and auxiliary in it. If
this be not enough, turn to him, upon the words,
<hi>Not only for Wrath but for Conscience sake;</hi> where he
saith, that the King is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
He is the procurer of Peace, and Base and bottom of
all politick economy. Innumerable good things come
by Princes Government to the Society of men; which
if you take away, there can be no Cities, no Right to
Lands or Revenues, no House and Family can subsist,
no Commerce and Trade can be had, all shall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
the stronger devouring the weaker. To St.
<hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Suffrage joyn St. <hi>Augustine tom. 9. tract. 6.
in Ioh. Tolle jura Imperatorum &amp; quis audet dicere, mea
est illa villa, aut meus est ille servus, aut domus baec mea
est?</hi> and a little after, <hi>Per jura Regum possidentur posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones:</hi>
the result is this, if you take away the Right of
Kings, none dare say, the Lands are mine, this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
is mine, or I have Right to this House. It is
by the right of Kings that all our Rights and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are secured. It is more than manifest then, that
the Right of King and Subject, the Safety of King and
Subject, are naturally conjoyned, and so intimately
involved the one in the other, that in the moral Notion
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33502:151"/>
they may be esteemed <hi>identically the same,</hi> no less than
Soul and Body make up one identical, personal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence;
or at least, <hi>se mutuò ponunt &amp; tollunt,</hi> destroy
the Kings Right and Good, and with the same Act,
the same blow, you destroy the Subjects too. If you
provide not for the Safety of the King, you cannot
possibly secure the Safety of the People. <hi>What God
hath conjoyned, let none put asunder.</hi> Let it never then
again be spoken or heard by Christians, that the good
of the Subject is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> in Government,
and demandeth <hi>by right the first and last place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Consequence is this, <hi>That the King look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the whole State, reflecting upon what Graces he
hath granted or may grant to his People, he cannot merit
of it, and what he hath granted, if it be for the good of
his. People, it hath proceeded but from his meer Duty.</hi>
Well, by the <hi>Observator</hi> we see the King is placed in
no better condition than a <hi>Servant,</hi> nay, an <hi>unprofitable
Servant,</hi> for when he has done all he can do, he was
onely done his Duty. By these means, <hi>Grace</hi> is not a
fit compellation for Kings; <hi>Acts of Iustice</hi> he may do,
but <hi>no Acts of Grace. O misera Regum sors!</hi> On the
other part, the People are stated in that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
condition, that they may <hi>supererogate</hi> with their
Prince, by doing many Acts of Bounty, Favour, and
Grace. By this Assertion, a Prince is disabled from
doing any <hi>courtesie</hi> to his Subjects. Before this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
distempered Age, was it ever heard, but that it
was the <hi>greatest happiness</hi> of a King, that he was able,
and <hi>his greatest glory,</hi> to oblige his People by Acts of
<hi>Grace, Bounty,</hi> and <hi>Courtesie?</hi> But now the World is so
turn'd topsie turvy, that when he has done all he is
able, he hath onely discharged the duty of a <hi>faithful
and trusty Servant.</hi> Turn the Tables, and then see
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33502:152"/>
what you will judge of the throw, Do not all we Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
owe Duty to the King? Are we not tied to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Honour? Yet upon extraordinary Services
we believe we can deserve well both of King and
Countrey. Will you not, <hi>Observator,</hi> allow the King
the like measure? This Conceit is a popular Deceit,
and not virtually onely, but also really, destroys the
ground of Beneficence in a King, and the duty of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in a Subject. By this it appeareth, that it is a
naked, nay, an hypocritical Complement, when both
Houses in Parliament, after Graces granted, present
their humble thanks, and heartily acknowledge <hi>His
Majesties gracious Favours.</hi> Must not the like hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Father and his Family? And shall we by
these grounds be constrained to acknowledge all the
Acts of a Father to his Family, to be no better than
Acts of meer Justice and Duty? In the Dialect of
Scripture, and Heathen Writers, <hi>Homer. Odyss.</hi> 9. Kings
are Fathers. And yet the <hi>Observator</hi> standeth not to
say, <hi>That the Father is more worthy than the Son in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Son is wholly a Debtor to the Father, and
can by no merit transcend his Duty, nor challenge any thing
as due from his Father, for the Father doth all his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
meritoriously, freely, and unexpectedly.</hi> We will not
be at pains now to examine this, onely I demand, if
this hold according to his Judgment in a Father of a
Family, how comes it to pass that it holds not <hi>in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
Patriae,</hi> in the Father of the Kingdom? The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> to the Father of the Kingdom,
is stronger, is straighter, than to <hi>Pater Familiae,</hi> to our
natural Father. And the School doth teach us, and
all Divines besides, for ought I know, that we are
bound to love the King <hi>appreciativè,</hi> by esteem, more
than our selves, although we cannot do it <hi>intensivè,</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:33502:152"/>
with the same intension, and degree of affection.
<hi>David</hi>'s Subjects said to him, <hi>Thou shalt not go forth
with us to battel, for thou art better than a thousand of
us;</hi> that is, in sound meaning, than all of us. The
<hi>Observator</hi> hath a quirk or trick rather for this, <hi>that
the King is not a Father to his People taken universally
but singly.</hi> Nothing could be said more absurdly. I
pray you, is not the Father of many Sons no less Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
universally to all than to every one? Is not the
King bound no less to protect all his Subjects <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,</hi>
than to protect every one <hi>severally, singly?</hi> Are
not all bound no less <hi>universally</hi> than <hi>singly,</hi> to honour
the King's sacred Person, obey his sacred Commands,
and contribute to the maintenance of his Honour,
Wealth, and Power, to assist and defend him in all
Difficulties? If you will not acknowledge a subjection
upon all <hi>universally,</hi> how can you tye the King to a
protection of all <hi>universally?</hi> In Philosophy this is
most absurd, for hereby you make <hi>tot civitates in regno,
quot subditos,</hi> as many Kingdoms as there be particular
and single Subjects; because the King and every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
make up a perfect City or Kingdom. If it were
not more absurd in Divinity, and contrary to God's
Ordinance, we would not plead much nor press much
the Absurdities of Philosophy. <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in the
holy diction of Scripture are called Heads and Captains
of all the Tribes and People of God. Let never these
consequences be more heard.</p>
            <p>4. The fourth consequence is as impious and absurd
as the other three; which is this, <hi>That a Prince ought
not to account it a strength and profit to him, which is a
loss and wasting to the People,</hi> (I agree to this with all
my heart, but that which followeth I cannot relish)
<hi>nor ought he to think that perisheth to him which is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:33502:153"/>
to the People.</hi> This is most false: Hath not the
King his own Right from Almighty God? Can he
make it away without betraying Gods Right, and the
Trust he hath put upon him, he being God's Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent
onely and Feoffee in trust? How can the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be free of Sacrilegious guiltiness to take it from
him, if lavishly or inconsiderately he will make it
away? This is not onely robbing of Sovereignty of
its due, but <hi>Divine usurpation, and intrusion upon Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God.</hi> What one hath by trust from another, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
intitle another to it, till he have warrant from
him who hath given the Trust. That the King hath
some right incommunicable to the Subject, is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that he that will deny it, must deny Scripture.
Our Lord and Master in the Gospel hath commanded
to <hi>Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars, as unto
God the things that are Gods.</hi> This word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
imports something peculiar; nay, it hath more
in it, that if we will detain it, if we have assumed it,
or would assume it, that by Christs Precept we are to
restore him to his Right again. This the word <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
intimates and commands, and consequently the
King cannot part with it; and if the Subject hath
usurped upon this Right, it is high Sacrilege to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. In this sense Kings, their Persons, their Charge,
their Right, their Authority, their Prerogative, are by
Scripture, by Fathers, by Jurists, called <hi>Sacred;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by Gods sacred Ordinance they are inherent in
their Crowns, inseparably adherent to their Scepters,
which if he grant away, he is no more King, than the
Body is a living Creature after the separation of the
Soul; and the Robbers and Cheaters of Kings out of
these Rights are <hi>Regicides.</hi> Nor are these Prerogatives
onely for the Excellency, Preheminency, and Honour
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:33502:153"/>
of the King above his Subjects, but also to enable him
for actuating his high Charge to Gods Glory and the
Subjects good. These, as we shall by Gods Grace
speak, <hi>Quaest.</hi> 4. are as the Lawyers speak, <hi>In indivisibili
posita, quae distrahi non possunt, alienari non possunt minui
non possunt;</hi> that are so indivisible in themselves, and
naturally and intrinsecally inherent in the Crown, in
his Sovereignty and Supremacy, that they cannot be
made away, or so communicated to the Subject, <hi>ut
defluat radix supremae potestatis,</hi> to divest himself of
them, <hi>ad minuendam Majestatem,</hi> to lessen Sovereign
Majesty, although by Trust and delegate Power the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
may be entrusted to others, <hi>ad minuendam soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudinem,</hi>
to ease him of unsupportable burthen. These
are fitly resembled by the Royal Crown, from which
if you take away the least part, you spoil it so in its
nature and shape, that it is no more a Crown; as
King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed Memory, and others have well
expressed.</p>
            <p>By what is said, I refer it to the Judgment of any
that hath reason or common sense, whether or not it
be true, that a King cannot make away to the Subject
any of his Right without disadvantage; for by what
we have said, it is more than apparent, that he hath a
Right personally inherent in himself and his Successors,
as a <hi>depositum,</hi> a trust from God, which he cannot
part with, without betraying the Trust God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, with which the Subject cannot med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
without Sacrilege in the highest kind; and which
cannot be done, without disabling Sovereignty from
doing that Service to God and his People, with which
he hath charged him.</p>
            <p>Lest any mistake us, I resume what before I have
said, That we maintain not that our King by this
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:33502:154"/>
Right from Almighty God hath <hi>Dominium despoticu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or <hi>herile,</hi> we plead onely for <hi>paternum;</hi> that is, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
the Subject cannot without Sacrilege, Royal and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Usurpation, trench upon Sacred Prerogative of
the King; no more can the King by any Right from
Almighty God trench upon the <hi>Liberty of the Person,
and the Propriety of the Goods</hi> of his Subjects, without
presupposal of a <hi>lawful act of Iurisdiction:</hi> That is, if
any or many of his Subjects transgress against him,
his Laws, or common Equity, he may commit their
Persons, take from them their Lives, seize upon their
whole, or a part of their State, proportionable to the
demerit of their Offence. Our Gracious Sovereign,
blessed be God for it, will never wave that saying of
<hi>Seneca</hi>'s, <hi>Imperium unius, Proprietas singulorum:</hi> The
Sacred Prerogative is the Kings, but it derogateth not
from the Liberty and Property of the Subject: it must
be entirely secured, that it may secure our Liberty and
Property. How unequal and partial are we to think
the King may <hi>prodigally waste away his Prerogative,</hi> and
we may <hi>lawfully invade it,</hi> because no Grant made to
his People perisheth to him, and yet upon the other
part will maintain, that <hi>the King cannot trenoh upon our
Liberty and Property</hi> without highest Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression?
<hi>Medio tutissimus ibis.</hi> Hold both, practise
both; Let the King have his, and the People their
Right, and Peace shall be upon <hi>Israel.</hi> King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have their proper and peculiar, and yet several and
distinct Rights. What Law? what Right? what
Reason is it? that the King may, or should part with
his sacred Right, and yet warrants the People to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Rights, nay, to invade and challenge the
King's Right? It feareth me, that high Sacrilege, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
God his Anointed, and Holy Church, is not the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:33502:154"/>
least crying sin that hath brought upon us these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series;
and many good men fear, that Kings giving
too much way to Harpyes to rob God and his Church,
have made a furious multitude to invade the Sovereignty
of Kings, to teach Kings to be more zealous and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to preserve Christ and his Churches Rights.</p>
            <p>Let us remember that <hi>God and true Policy</hi> have so
inseparably united and conjoyned the Interest of King
and People, that they be almost altogether the same;
upon which necessarily it followeth, that the people
ought not to account it a game or strength to them,
which they obtain and acquire by a Loss and wast of
his Prerogative; nor ought they to think that perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, which is gained to him; and by which
his Prerogative is strengthened, he more enabled to
protect, and they the more secured in safety to enjoy
Liberty and Propriety, with peace and plenty.</p>
            <p>To reason <hi>à salute populi,</hi> from the Good and Gain
of the people, to the weakning or destroying of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and Sovereignty, is sophistical; it is that Sophism
they call, <hi>à dicto secundum quid,</hi> or <hi>à limitato ad abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutum;</hi>
to reason from one end of Government to the
Destruction of the other, which is more excellent, and
which effecteth and worketh the other, is totally to
overthrow Royalty and Government. The compleat
and adequate end of Monarchical Government, is
as we have said, to preserve the Kings Prerogative en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and the Liberty and Good of the Subject too.
If any man reason after this Form, in the case betwixt
the head and the body, the Wife and the Husband, he
will soon discover the Fallacy of this Sophism. It is
right, just, necessary, and honourable for a King to
proportion his Laws and Government for the Good
and Safety of his People; and on the other part, it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:33502:155"/>
is as just, as necessary for the people, to hold that
<hi>Salus Regis suprema lex esto,</hi> the safety of the King, of
his Sovereignty and Right, ought to be the paramont
Law, without which no safety can be to the publick
State, nor to any private mans well-being.</p>
            <p>If such Sophisms as these were confined within
School-walls, for the exercise of Wits, it were no
great matter; but such abused Principles clogged with
such paradoxal Consequences, have a mighty Influence
upon the multitude, and will make them assume to
themselves, or commit to their Representatives an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power, which placed in a wrong hand, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse but produce monstrous Mischiefs. These
Maxims with their absurd Consectaries embolden them,
authorize them to pull his Crown from his Head,
wrest his Sword out of his hands, seize his Ships,
Forts, Magazines, Ammunitions and Revenues, if they
apprehend it fit for their own good: It will make
them break thorow all inferiour Laws, that no more
shall we have or know for Law, but what it shall
please them to unfold at pleasure out of the Closet of
their Breasts. And if this power be in some few, or
in many, who are back't by the greater part of the
people, having a domineering power over the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Affections of the people, gulled with fair
and false promises, and vain expectation of a glorious
Reformation in Church and State: What person how
innocent, how well-deserving soever, can be secured
in the Liberty of his Person, and Propriety of Life and
Goods? Shall it not be a sufficient and just warrant, to
commit innocent men to <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s Dungeon, to prove
them guilty at Leisure, because they are disaffected to
the <hi>Good Cause?</hi> Shall it not be just to take from men,
what Portion, what Moity of their State and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:33502:155"/>
they will, and sequestrate them for the publick,
because they cannot confide in them; and the <hi>Good
Cause</hi> must be maintained upon the Estates of Bishops,
Malignants, and Delinquents? God forgive you.
Remember there is a God in Heaven will call <hi>Ahab</hi>
to an account for <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard; repent in time
and make Satisfaction, before the evil day come upon
you. May they not by the same Grounds disarm
whom they will, <hi>to weaken Gods Enemies?</hi> Those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
and Sophisms will make way to Rebellion, to
murther the most innocent, the most deserving men.
It will at last come at that, except God and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
right it, that it will be a crime to have Wealth,
and Treason to be faithful and loyal to King, Church,
and State. This Maxim with the annexed Sophisms,
is enough to destroy King and Kingdom, Church and
State, and at last send the Authors, and those are
set on by them packing to Hell: from which good
Lord deliver them and all of us.</p>
            <p>But what may be the proper, natural, and innocent
sense of the words, <hi>Salus populi suprema lex esto?</hi> No

            </p>
            <p>Let us come and examine <hi>Literam Legis,</hi> (as the
Jurists speak) the Letter of the Law. <hi>Salus populi</hi> I
find here is <hi>Lex,</hi> a <hi>Law;</hi> and <hi>Suprema Lex, the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
and trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>endent Law:</hi> then it cannot be racked
further, nor wind up to a higher pitch, than to be a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:33502:157"/>
Law, and a supreme Law. The Substantive is <hi>Lex,
the Law;</hi> the Epithet and Adjective is <hi>Suprema, the
supreme Law.</hi> Then this Law of <hi>Salus populi,</hi> of the
safety of the People, is only a Law which is supreme,
and above all other Laws; it doth not trench upon
the Prerogative of the <hi>Suprema potestas,</hi> upon Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
which giveth the Law. Transcendent it is
above all Laws, but seeing it is only <hi>Lex,</hi> a <hi>Law,</hi> it
is not transcendent above <hi>Rex,</hi> the Sovereign in a
Monarchy. To interpret it thus, it giveth to the
Law an heterogeneous Sense, and is <hi>de genere in genus,</hi>
leaping from one kind to another. Do not our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
acknowledge, that during the Democratical
Government of the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> the people had
<hi>Summam Majestatem, summam potestatem,</hi> and <hi>Legibus
solutam;</hi> had the supreme Power, that <hi>Majestas</hi> was
<hi>populi,</hi> the People were so much Master of the Law,
that they might <hi>abrogare, derogare, obrogare,</hi> stop the
Execution of any Law, take from it, add to it, or
totally abrogate it at their pleasure? And will they be
so unjust to force this upon us in a Monarchy, with a
contrary Sense destructive of Sovereignty and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in a King?</p>
            <p>If we will be pleased to look more narrowly upon
the true meaning of this Law, <hi>Salus populi suprema lex
esto,</hi> it will be so far from putting a curb upon Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.
wheresoever it be fixed, in one, few, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and license the People to right Sovereignty upon
real and fansied Exigents in Necessity, that upon the
other part it will advance Sovereignty. It is most true
that all Laws should be proportioned to the publick
Good of the Sovereign and People; and so this Law
is a transcendent Law, for it is found intrinsecally in
all Laws, as the transcendent Affections, <hi>unum, verum,</hi>
and <hi>bonum,</hi> are found intrinsecally in all and every
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:33502:157"/>
               <hi>Entity.</hi> But this is not that which is meant in <hi>Salus
populi suprema lex esto;</hi> The meaning is, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or State, not only possibly and probably, but
really and existently may be such, that the Sovereign
must exerce and exercise an arbitrary Power, not stand
upon private mens Interest, or transgressing of Laws,
made for the private good of Individuals; but for the
Preservation of it self and the publick may break tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all Laws. This case may be, and sometimes is,
as when sudden foreign Invasion, or strong home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Sedition threaten King and Kingdom, State and
Republick with present and almost unavoidable Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.

in case of extream danger, to chuse a <hi>Dictator,</hi> (the
greatest Sanctuary they had in all Extremities) who
according to his own Prudence, Arbitrement, and
Discretion, was to command and do what he thought
fit to be done, and to act for the Preservation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the State? His Commission runs at large; <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat
dictator ne quid detrimenti Respublica capiat;</hi> which
<hi>Videat</hi> was not a charge given, for Discharge of which
he was not accountable to any, but a full Sovereign
intire Commission to rule in Peace and War, in Life
and Death, over Persons and Estate, Goods and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
without Controulment, Reluctation, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
the rule being none else but <hi>Arbitrium boni
viri.</hi> He was <hi>subordinate to none:</hi> none was <hi>co-ordinate</hi>
with him; nor after the expiring of six Months was
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:33502:158"/>
he accountable to Senate, Consuls, Tribunes, any, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or all; nor controulable by Man, by Law, by
Statute, by Custom, or what else in that kind is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>What can be more apparent then, than that this L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w
was never made of purpose to warrant People in a real or
fancied exigent of necessity, to rise against their Prince?
but to allow to Sovereign Power, wheresoever fixed,
a more transcendent Power in the case of extreme
Danger and Difficulty. Nature teacheth, that in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
this is equitable. If any attempt to wound the
Head, Arms and Hands, Legs and Thighs will defend
with the loss of themselves, before the Head be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
If a Canker be in Hand or Foot, before it Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene

            <p>In this sense which we have explained, <hi>Salus populi
suprema lex esto,</hi> is a Law that hath no Iniquity in it,
but hath a good, just, and equitable Sense. Yet it is
not to day onely, or yesterday, that this Maxim hath
been abused to work much mischief. This mis-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
Principle or Law put Christ to death. The
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees, High-Priests</hi> and <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched,
<hi>It was necessary that one should dye for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
the High-Priest spoke it, not knowing how in a
Prophetical sense it was necessary, but meaning that
<hi>Salus populi</hi> required it; the whole Land, and all of
them were in danger. And in this case, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of this Law, it was enough to alledge <hi>their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and unanimous co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt.</hi> They were not tied to
proofs. They had a Law of which they were Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters;
or if not, they had a <hi>Legislative power,</hi> by
which for <hi>Salus Populi</hi> Christ must dye. When <hi>Pilate</hi>
found him innocent, their answer was sufficient, <hi>If he
were not a Malefactor we would not have delivered him
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:33502:158"/>
unto thee. Salus populi,</hi> or nothing else was the Law,
the <hi>Paramount Law,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of all Politicks, to which
<hi>Pilate</hi>'s Power delegate from the <hi>Romans</hi> was subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient.
But what was the effect of this work, wrought
by this <hi>Paramount Law?</hi> It wrought the utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them and their Posterity. The over-ruling
voices of the High-Priests, Scribes, and <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Pilate</hi> to crucifie the God of Glory against his
heart, his Conscience. This was high Injustice in
him, he acknowledged Christ's Innocency, and knew
that for Envy they delivered him up: <hi>Ioh. 19. 6.
Matth.</hi> 27. 18. He knew besides, that without his
Authority he could not be condemned. If we could
or would seriously look upon this Example, and make
right Use of it, it would deter us from making too
much of such deceitful and deceiving Maxims, which
in the end will lead us to our total destruction and
overthrow.</p>
            <p>It was this <hi>Salus populi,</hi> that made <hi>Saul</hi> to spare,
against Gods command, <hi>Agag,</hi> and the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> It
was this that seduced <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> made his Lords over-rule
and over-awe him, and clap up <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in the
Dungeon. It is a great mistake in which a great and
Learned man in this Age doth gather, from the words
of a King to his Nobles; <hi>Behold he is in your power, for
what is the King that he can do any thing against you?</hi>
That the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> by some Power equal to them
or above them, might be counter-manded. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is <hi>de facto,</hi> not <hi>de jure,</hi> intimating that the
good King was so over-awed by his Lords, that he
could not protect the Lords Servant, the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
although he knew he was bound to it, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
too: When a good King is put in such a case,
the state of King and Kingdom are in greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:33502:159"/>
            <p>There is enough said to discover the grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of this abused Maxim, <hi>Salus populi suprema lex
esto;</hi> for by what is said, it appeareth, 1. That it is
not to be conceived in that large sense, as if all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
and Government were principally for the
good of those are governed; it holds not in Marital,
nor Despotical, nor in Royal Government by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
2. Next it taketh as granted (in the sense of
our Adversaries) that the compleat and adequate end
of Government is <hi>Salus populi,</hi> which is an Errour, for
it is <hi>Salus Regis &amp; populi,</hi> and <hi>Salus Regis</hi> hath the
first place, without which <hi>Salus populi</hi> cannot be. It
hath the Prerogative like to the first Table, and <hi>Salus

and Royal Power, is to bring ruine to our selves.
3. Thirdly, it is spoken <hi>in ordine ad alias Leges, non
ad Regem,</hi> in order to other Laws, not to prove the
King the <hi>Extract of the People,</hi> or that by them he is
coerced; But that in case of extreme necessity the King
for his own and the Kingdoms Safety may break
thorow all other Laws, as he thinketh fit in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to preserve himself and Kingdom. 4. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the sense our Adversaries use it, it cannot but
disquiet King and Kingdom, upon real or fancied
Fears and Jealousies. 5. Fifthly, misapplied and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood,
it hath been the Mother of much mischief.
6. Lastly, let every Subject and Christian within his
Majesties Kingdoms consider and remember how he is
bound by Nature and Grace to <hi>Salus Regis,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Kings Right, Priviledges, and Prerogatives,
besides that all of any Quality, and the better sort
have taken an Oath to maintain it. With which how
any can dispense, I profess I see not, I know not.</p>

the People, but the People may be without a King,</hi> with
its Consequence, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the People are more excellent

the strength of this Argument and Consequence; for
if they will resolve their Antecedent thus, or frame
their Argument thus, <hi>The People may be without a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
or Government,</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. The Antecedent is most
false, and so can bring home no Conclusion at all.
We have proved already, better not to be at all, than
to be without Government; and for this cause God
fixed Government in one, and appointed a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
before ever there were People in the World to be
governed. <hi>Cicero</hi> doth tell us this, <hi>lib. 3. de Legibus.
Nihil porro tam aptum est ad Ius conditionemque Naturae,

omnis, nec ipse mundus potest.</hi> I know what the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Jesuit will rejoyn, the People may be under
Aristocracie or Democracie in a happy condition, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
without Monarchy or a King. I do not blame
Aristocracie or Democracie as unlawful Governments,
God sorbid, for then all their acts of lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could not chuse but be sinful; but that they are
univocal species of Government with Monarchy, I can
never be induced to believe, (as by Gods Grace we
will demonstrate it, <hi>Quaest. 2.)</hi> Governments they
are, but defective; If man had never fallen into Sin,
Aristocracie had never been known, nor Democracie
seen in the World, nor were they at first: It was the
corruption of Monarchy produced them into the world.
Monarchy by God in Scripture is much countenanced,
magnified; of Aristocracie or Democracie you have
not one Word in Holy Writ to commend them. That
a People under Aristocracie or Democracie may have
some tolerable subsistence, I deny it not, but that they
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:33502:160"/>
can be in an happy condition I doubt of it; especially
for the Church, whose condition can never be happy
under any Government but Monarchy: for proof
I appeal to all by-gone Ages in the Christian Church,
and pray our Adversaries to shew us, where the Church
is in Plenty and Honour, where Aristocracy is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
In Scripture it is prophecied, <hi>Ecce Reges
erunt nutritii tui, That Kings shall be the Nurse-fathers of
the Church,</hi> there is no word to that sense for any
Government besides Monarchy. If they make use of
this Argument to prefer Aristocracy or Democracy to
Monarchy, there reasoning is not sure, and concludes
not; no more than when I reason thus, a man may
walk without Legs of bone and flesh, for he may walk
on wooden Legs, if he hath lost his Natural Legs with
the blow of a Canon, or by a Gangrene; or he may
walk upon Crutches if he be a Cripple, <hi>Ergo,</hi> wooden
legs and artificial, or Crutches, are better than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
legs and feet man is born with.</p>
            <p>In brief, no Society can subsist without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the best of Governments is Monarchy; and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot be happy, except the King and Monarchy
be proportioned to that height of Power, Honour, and
Wealth, as He be able to secure Himself and Subjects
from all Mischief, Iniquity, and Disorder; and the
Good, Safety, and Happiness of the Subject is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and necessarily involved in the sacred Right and
Prerogative of the King, That whosoever conceiveth
that the Good of the People can subsist with lessening
and weakening the Right of the King, is, as if he should
imagine to see the Branches of a Tree bud, flourish,
and bring forth Fruit, when they are broken o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from
the root; or to see a River of running living Water
divided from the Source and Fountain of living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or to apprehend that the Ray of the Sun can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:33502:160"/>
when it is separated from the Body of the Sun.
Let never a King imagine his Happiness can subsist or
consist without the Happiness, Peace, and Plenty of
his Subjects; and let not us that are Subjects imagine
that we can be happy, or preserve our Right, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
our Property, if we account not the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed
the breath of our Nostrils, and value his Right,
His Prerogative, at a higher rate than our Lives. These
are by God and Nature so involved mutually one in
another, that without destruction to both they cannot
be put asunder.</p>

               <hi>Sovereignty in one, but in more;</hi> That <hi>Quod omnes tangit
ab omnibus tractari &amp; approbari debet;</hi> and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more; all which, by Gods help, we shall examine
in the subsequent Questions, as every one of them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
it self in its own proper place. We now come
shortly to point at the great Charge of the King, as
we have before proved the Excellency of his Sacred
Charge and Person.</p>
            <p>What we have said of the Excellency of Kings, that
they are the derivatives of God, from him by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his first-born, God's upon Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be
rightly weighted, it will humble them in the presence
of God, in their own esteem, and not suffer them to
swell in Pride; it tieth them to a proportionable San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
and eminency in Holiness and Integrity, as far in
degree above the Ordinary, as they are exalted in
State and Honour above the Sons of men. <hi>Isocrates</hi>
writing to <hi>Nicocles,</hi> saith to him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
The sense is the same we have
expressed already, the higher in Honour, they are tied
to a higher perfection in Virtue. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith
well, <hi>Tom. 8. enarrat. in Psal. 137. Quantò sublimitas
altior est, tantò periculosior est. Ideoque Reges quantò sunt
in majori sublimitate terrenâ, tanto magis humiliari Deo
debent.</hi> Kings, as related to men, are <hi>Gods,</hi> in order
to Almighty God they are <hi>frail and mortal men, Psal.</hi>
82. 6. They are gods on Earth, yet onely gods of
the Earth; and are no less, if not more accountable to
God than any other men whatsoever. <hi>He trieth their
works, searcheth out their Counsels;</hi> and if they judge
not aright, <hi>Horribly and speedily he will come upon them;
a sharp judgment shall be to them that are in High places;
Mercy will soon pardon the meanest, but mighty men shall
be mightily tormented,</hi> (Wisd. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.) <hi>For
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:33502:161"/>
he who is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall he stand in awe of any man's Greatness, for he
hath made small and great, and careth for all alike.</hi> No
Difference there is betwixt a Prince and a Peasant
except only in this, that as the Prince is higher
than all, so his Crime and Sin is above all, and his
Punishment will be proportioned to the like and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Height.</p>
            <p>Princes being derived immediately from God, and
with that honour to be the first-born Children of God,
and Sons of the most high; what Measure of Holiness,
what Degree of Righteousness is required in them, so
highly advanced? They should <hi>be holy, as their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father is holy;</hi> They <hi>should be perfect, as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven is perfect:</hi> and this not only in their
private Conversation as <hi>Christians,</hi> but also in their
publick Government as <hi>Fathers of the Kingdom, and
Nurse-fathers of the Church.</hi> Nothing addeth more
to the Disgrace of a wicked man, than when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon him, as descended from a noble and high
Stem. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov. 16. 12. It is an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Kings to commit Wickedness:</hi> and <hi>the fear of the
Lord is the Glory of the King.</hi> No Foundation of a
King so sure as Obedience to him that made the King.
Nothing more dangerous in a King than Rebellion
against God. Happy are Kings when they resolve with
<hi>David, Psal. 85. 8. I will hearken what the Lord will
say unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, Kings are bound to advance Piety
and that both in their private and publick Devotions,
and in their publick Government. They ought to
be more frequent in their private Devotions than any
else, and in the publick to be most reverent in their
Gestures, that their practice in Piety, in Devotion, in
private, in publick may be exemplary:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:33502:162"/>
               <q>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.</q>
This Duty they owe to God as <hi>professores fidei,</hi> but
they are bound to another, as <hi>propugnatores fidei,</hi> that
is, to see that the Purity of Faith and Worship be
preserved with that Solemnity and Decency of sacred
Places, sacred Things, sacred Persons, sacred Gestures,
as God hath prescribed, and the holy Catholick
Church hath practised and allowed. The Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the sacred Right and Prerogative royal is that
secureth and preserveth the Right and Liberty of the
Subject: and it is the maintaining and preserving of
God's and holy Church's Right that preserveth Kings
and their Crowns. Happy is the King who with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
can say, <hi>Psal. 26. 8. Lord, I have loved the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of thy House, and the place where thine Honour
dwelleth:</hi> upon this he may with <hi>David</hi> confidently
pray, <hi>vers. 9. Gather not my Soul with Sinners, nor my
Life with bloody men.</hi> If the King's delight be in the
<hi>Sanctuary of the Lord,</hi> although Trouble fall upon him,
yet <hi>Help will come to him out of the Sanctuary,</hi> that will
save both <hi>him and his Crown, Psal.</hi> 20. The highest
Honour, the greatest Happiness that ever <hi>David</hi> attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, was to bring back again the Ark of God, to
leave a great Treasure for building of the Temple,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 15. 28. and to raise the Church, and
establish the Worship and Order in it's height of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 25, 26. when he finished this
Work, he rejoyced more than ever. Then he said,
<hi>Psal. 84. 10. A day in thy Courts is better than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
elsewhere: it was better be a door-keeper in the house
of the Lord, than to dwell in the Tents of Wickedness.</hi> It
was this that made God send to his King <hi>Deliverance
out of his Troubles, Psal. 18. vers. ult.</hi> It was this that
established his House and Kingdom for ever; it was
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:33502:162"/>
this that crowned him with a Crown of pure Gold
here, and of immortal Glory in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Kings at their Coronation offer their Crowns,
Scepters, and Swords to God at his Altar, and receive
them from thence; the one Ceremony signifieth that
their Sovereignty cometh to them immediately from
God; the other signifieth that they offer all first for
the Service of God: It is a Vow or Dedication of
themselves and their Power for the Advancement of
Gods Glory: To this add, that this is solemnly sworn
by them, to maintain the Purity of the Faith, and
Worship, and the Priviledges and Rights of holy
Church; and lastly, all is sealed with the receiving of
the Sacrament off the Altar: What then can free Kings
from these Ties? And how fearful a thing is it, for
them to be principal Actors, or accessary to bad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and Courses, to give up a Church, or to wrong
Christ and his Rights?</p>
            <p>There be a great many that practise <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
affirming Princes are no more tyed to Church
and Religion, than as both of them are subordinate
and subservient to the politick Government, and good
Temporal: These are truly Atheists, who, <hi>Ierob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>am</hi>
like, care not, at all for God nor Religion, who abuse
them to their own private ends: they may for a short
time flourish, but in the end God will root out them
and their Posterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Memory shall be had in
Execration, as <hi>Pilate</hi> is remembred in the Creed, and
<hi>Iudas</hi> recorded in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>There be others who seem more moderate, whose
Counsels are no less pernicious, because they seem
to speak in a favourable and more specious way, like
to the <hi>Devil,</hi> transforming himself into an Angel of
Light: these advise Kings to maintain a Worship, an
Order, a Church: but that it is not best to be too
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:33502:163"/>
sumptuous and prodigal in the Maintenance, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
the Church richly; nor is it necessary pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
and precisely to adhere to all Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and in some cases, say they, a Prince at some
Times, at some Exigences, may give way to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
of some Ordinances of God and Christ, he may
permit some of the Beauty and Solemnity of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to be eclipsed, devest the Church and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of some Priviledges and Rights, which by <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
Possession</hi> they and their Pedecessors have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to which, besides Dedication and Consecration,
the Church is by all positive Civil Law and Right en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
no less, (if not more) than Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
Corporations, or any Subject or Subjects
whatsoever. These Counsels for a time may prevail,
and the Church may be a little for a little time sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and depressed, but if God have Mercy in Store
for that Kingdom, it will not continue long. These
<hi>Achitophels</hi> tell Kings, that if <hi>Moses</hi>'s ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Apostles twelve Articles of the Creed, and
the six Petitions of the Lord's Prayer be preserved, it
skilleth not for other things, whether Bishop or no
Bishop, whether good Christians preach and do mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Acts, or only men in sacred Orders, authorised
by Consecration and Imposition of hands, whether
any Solemnity in the publick Worship or not, whether
in sacred Church consecrated, or in a private House
or Barn, whether Christ have a Patrimony, or his
Servants be allowed only a Competency at the Disore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Lay-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These Counsels and Courses if
they be not repented, forsaken, and the Church right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will prove destructive to Kings, to their Crowns,
to their Posterity, and to their Authors and Abettors.
King <hi>Saul</hi> for ought we read, did not restrain nor
pollute the Worship he found, nor took from their
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:33502:163"/>
Priests what was their due, but it is manifest he did
neglect God and his Church, his Worship, and his
Servants, had less Esteem of God's Servants than of
any of his Subjects besides, and yet this is punished
with the Forfeiture of Crown and Kingdom to him
and his Posterity, and God provideth a man, a King
according to his Heart, to right the Church, to order
the Service aright, which established his Kingdom and
Crown for ever. The Church was the <hi>Alpha</hi> and
<hi>Omega</hi> of his Government; he consecrated the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his peaceable Reign with bringing home the
Ark; he spent the most of his Reign in ordering and
establishing the Service of God with it's Solemnity,
and ended his Life and Reign exhorting <hi>Solomon</hi> to
do the like, to build the Temple, and leaving by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
a great immense Treasure consecrated to this
purpose.</p>
            <p>If any will look upon these Counsellors, he will
find that they have a mighty Zeal and Care of their
own Honour and Wealth; how much they remit their
Zeal towards God and his House, they intend it as
much for themselves and what concerneth their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate:
they will not willingly dwell but <hi>in Houses of
Cedar,</hi> and can see <hi>the Ark of God within Curtains;</hi>
this maketh them that they can suffer the Church to
be spoiled, if by her Spoils they or theirs can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched;
Christians they cannot be, whatsoever they
profess, they are in a contrary, a contradictory way
to Christ; of him it was said, <hi>The Zeal of thine House
hath eaten me up;</hi> of them it is verified, <hi>that their
Zeal hath eaten up the house of God.</hi> If these men can
enjoy their own, make up a state upon the Ruines of
the Church, or better a prior estate, they care not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Levites usurp upon Priests, Presbyters upon
Bishops, and Christ and his Patrimony be both put
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:33502:164"/>
out of the World: Ten shekels of Silver and a Sute of
Apparel, <hi>Micah</hi>'s <hi>allowance, Iudges</hi> 17. 10. is enough
and too much for the best of God and Christ's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
All in the end will prove <hi>Aurum Tholosanum,</hi> like
the collop the Eagle brought from the Altar to feed
her young ones, so much Fire came with it that it
consumed the Nest and the young ones too.</p>
            <p>When the Church of God is in this distress, it is
not onely sin to be accessary to these Counsels and
Courses, but such as may and are able to prevent these
mischiefs and do it not, God will charge them with
it. Some there be who profess that they like not the
course against the Church, but for reason of State
way must be given to the current of the stream, and a
fit opportunity waited to right what was amiss; I
will not search the hearts of such men, I leave them
to him <hi>who trieth the reins, and knoweth our thoughts
afar off:</hi> onely let me put them in mind, that sins of
Omission, of necessary Duties are high sins in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of the Sanctuary; <hi>Meroz</hi> is cursed that came
not out to help the Lord: and <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. They
are to be condemned in the last Day who fed not
Christ when he was hungry, no less than those who
robbed him of his Food. It is the highest Service to
God, with the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> not to deny
the Faith, <hi>where Satan's seat is, where Antipas suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereth
for the truth, Rev.</hi> 11. 13. If God hath endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any with Wisdom, Power and Trust by Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> time they withdraw their help from
God and his Church, it is like they will call to him in
the day of their trouble and God will not hear them.
Remember, after the reducing of the People from the
Captivity, the Prophets did charge the re-building of
the House of God; the Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> answered,
<hi>The time is not come, the time wherein the Lord's House
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:33502:164"/>
should be built.</hi> None was so impudent to come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to this Charge, but they meant, we are
poor, newly come out of Captivity, we have strong
Enemies about us, we must wait a better opportunity,
a more seasonable time: a jugling trick it is to cross
good Works, and crush them substantially, by opposing
them onely circumstantially: Notwithstanding all this
the Prophet chargeth them, <hi>Is it time for you, O yee!</hi>
(this compellation is very emphatical) <hi>to dwell in your
cieled Houses, and this House lie waste?</hi> Read the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I cease to repeat it, I love not to apply it, and
wish it be not the Judgment of our Times: See <hi>Hag. 1.
vers. 1, 2, 3. &amp; à vers. 6. ad vers.</hi> 12. Do not deceive
your selves with that imposture, that you will wait
upon an opportunity to right all that is disjoynted in
Church, you are not to tempt God, to put him to
extraordinary Providence, when he has put you in the
ordinary way to serve him, and to prevent these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.
Is it lawful and warrantable to you to do
Evil, or give way to Evil, and to wait opportunity
to do good afterward to salve all this? Or can you
expect that God will honour you to make you fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to repair again what is wrong? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you neither deserve it, nor can lay any claim or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to it.</p>
            <p>If these men fear Covenants and Associations, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
them to remember, that as in Scripture the first
and happiest Covenant is <hi>the Covenant of Mercy and
Grace,</hi> so in the next place we have in Holy Writ men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>A Covenant of Levi;</hi> which is the means ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
God hath appointed to preserve the other. The
Scripture telleth us, that it is an high impiety <hi>to corrupt
the Covenant of Levi, Mal.</hi> 11. 8. Both the one and
the other Covenant are Covenants of Salt, that is, of
everlasting durance, from which it followeth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:33502:165"/>
that whatsoever Covenant destroyeth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God in the necessary Government of the
Church, the Ordinances of the Worship and its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities,
cannot be from God, from whence then it
comes you may easily guess.</p>
            <p>Of all impieties in this kind, there is no higher
transgression, than if the <hi>Tribe of Levi,</hi> for some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
to themselves and theirs, and to gain popular
applause and credit with the Faction, assure Kings
they may give way to a popular current and flood, to
suffer God's Ordinances to be destroyed, the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Worship defaced, till a better opportunity
offer. I beg pardon to speak truth in humility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and first to Kings, that although Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
advise Kings upon such exigents, to do such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Acts, yet it will not excuse them in the
Day of their Accounts, no more than it excused <hi>Achab</hi>
that had the warrant of <hi>Zedekiah, 1 Kings</hi> 22. 11. Nor
did it excuse <hi>Pilate,</hi> who had the representative Body
of Priests and State to warrant him they had a Law,
and by their Law Christ was a Malefactor and worthy
to dye. Next, let me tell the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who for
their own good and popular applause, do comply with
a popular Eaction, and set their brains on work to
make specious shews of Reason, and inducements to
perswade or warrant Kings, <hi>by permission and giving way,
or by actual concurrence with their Authority,</hi> to permit
and do Acts <hi>destructive to Christ's Ordinances, or deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to the Worship,</hi> are near to the sin of Apostacy, and
another of an higher degree, which I fear to name.
But of all Levites those are the most miserable, who,
being advanced to the highest of Sacred Orders, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
enriched themselves by the Patrimony of the
Church, to keep their purchase, have abjured that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Order as Antichristian, and yet make not restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:33502:165"/>
of what they have purchased. I wonder how
such mens Repentance could be admitted, for in such
cases they cannot truly repent without Restitution;
<hi>Non dimittetur peccatum nisi restituetur ablatum.</hi> These
men come short of <hi>Iudas</hi> this Repentance, who was
not onely contrite for betraying his Master, but resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Money which unjustly he had purchased by his
Villany. By the detention of their purchase, their
Converts declare themselves <hi>Mercenary,</hi> and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by receiving them into their Communion, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
to the World, they care not what they lose in
truth, if they can deceive the People to make them
think by such a goodly access their evil Cause is
strengthened: I refer these Apostate Bishops to read
the story of <hi>Ecebolus;</hi> I wish them not to be in like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and cease to apply the story. I thank God
there is no rancour in my heart against them nor their
Fathers Converters, my imprecations are no other, but
to pray Almighty God to give them true Repentance
and to forgive them.</p>
            <p>The sum of what we have said is this, that neither
King nor Kingdom can be happy, if Kings fear not
God, and do not from this fear preserve the Right of
God and his Church, protect and promote the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, and advance the Worship and its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermity.
Nor will bad Counsellors excuse them in
the Day of their Accounts, nor will the Counsellors
escape just Judgment, and it is like God will make
the same People a Rod to scourge them, whom they
have followed and given way to, with the loss of a good
conscience, and offence against God.</p>
            <p>As Princes, the Sons of the most High, and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
of Christ upon Earth, are bound to Piety in
their personal carriage above other, and to procure and
protect it in their publick Government, so they are
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:33502:166"/>
bound in their private and publick Conversation and
Government to be excellently righteous. The Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
naturally resembleth its Primitive. God from
whom they are by immediate Derivation, <hi>hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in wickedness, neither doth evil dwell with him, Psal.</hi>
5. 4. Kings hold their Scepters from Christ, <hi>The Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Christ's Kingdom is a right Scepter. He loveth
righteousness and hateth wickedness, Psal. 45. 6, 7. They
are by generation from the Father, Psal.</hi> 89. They issue
from the thigh of Christ, <hi>Rev. 17. 14. &amp;</hi> 19. 14. They
degenerate then if they be not righteous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Kings live and govern piously and justly, their
Thrones shall be established, their Crowns secured, and
their Posterity be blessed,</hi> Prov. 25. 5. By righteousness
the Throne is established; <hi>The good of this will redound
to the whole Kingdom,</hi> Prov. 29. 4. The King by Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
establisheth the Land, but he that receiveth gifts
overthroweth it. Foelix Respublica in qua qui imperat ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Deum. <hi>See God's charge to Kings,</hi> Ier. 22. 1, 2, 3.
Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
&amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. For if ye do this thing indeed, then
shall there enter in by the gates of this House Kings sitting
upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> riding in chariots and on horses,
he and his servants and his people. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. But if you will
not hear these words, <hi>&amp;c. vers.</hi> 7. I will prepare destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
against thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> David <hi>the King knew this,</hi> Psal.
33. 16. There is no King saved by the multitude of an
host. <hi>How then? vers.</hi> 18. The eyes of the Lord are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.
<hi>He practised it,</hi> Psal. 61. 4. I will abide in thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
for ever, I will trust in the covert of thy wings. <hi>The
meaning is, his constant purpose and practice should
be holy and just, and to advance Piety and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
from this issueth that confidence he subjoyneth</hi>
vers. 6. Thou wilt prolong the King's life, and his years
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:33502:166"/>
as many Generations. vers. 7. He shall abide before God
for ever, O prepare Mercy and Truth which may preserve
him. <hi>See</hi> Psal. 72. <hi>wholly;</hi> Prov. 20. 8. &amp; 29. 4, 14.
&amp; 16. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>This Truth believed by Kings, that they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
sent from God, and Vicegerents upon Earth,
is a ground of great Confidence in God in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Troubles, which usually are great and frequent;
for as the tallest Cedars they are exposed to the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of greatest Tempests; their only way is to run to
God for Protection and Deliverance. They may lay
claim to it more than any. God is the Principal, they
only Lieutenants and subordinate: more favour is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to them, greater Protection promised to them.
<hi>Psal. 89. 26. He</hi> (that is the King) <hi>shall cry unto me,
Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Also I will make him my first born.</hi> David, <hi>Psal.</hi>
44. 4. approacheth to God in this Confidence; <hi>Thou
art my King, O God, command Deliverance for</hi> Jacob.
A Subject claimeth Protection from the King as his
Due, so may the King from his Lord and Master. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
upon this ground that God had set him upon
the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> begged Government and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to go out and in before his People: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.
The Lord did not refuse it, but in his Bounty supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
what was fit for his more Magnificence. God
hath a secret and unknown way in directing and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Princes, and no less admirable a way in guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Persons, and delivering them out of all their
Troubles: <hi>Prov. 21. 1. The heart of the King is in the
hand of the Lord as the Rivers of Waters; He turneth it
whithersoever he will.</hi> Psal. 18. vers. ult. <hi>Great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
giveth he to his King, and sheweth Mercy to his
Anointed, &amp;c.</hi> The Heathen have acknowledged in
Kings some <hi>Heroici impetus,</hi> some strange and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:33502:167"/>
Inspirations and Directions, seconded with as
admirable Successes and Protection; that a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
them, something extraordinary above that God in his
ordinary Providence by Direction or Protection vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
upon others. I refer you to read and meditate
what you have written, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 25, 27. and <hi>Isai.</hi>
42. 1, 27. and you will doubt no more of this Truth.
<hi>This day is this Truth fulfilled in our Ears;</hi> we have
before our Eyes such a wonderful over-ruling Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Protection of our Sovereign in this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that we must acknowledge <hi>it is the Lords work,
and marvellous in our Eyes,</hi> Psal. 118.</p>
            <p>This Truth is a strong Motive to perswade Subjects
to all Duty. First, to honour, reverence, and obey
the King next to God, and above all others. The
<hi>Fear of God and the King</hi> are immediately conjoyned
and enjoyned together in Scripture: <hi>Prov. 24. 21,
22, 23. My Son, fear God and the King, &amp;c. 1 Pet. 11.
17. Fear God, honour the King.</hi> See <hi>Tertullian</hi> to this
purpose in the places we cited before: and <hi>Gregory
Nazianzen. Orat.</hi> 20. which is a funeral Oration for
<hi>Basil</hi> the great. The Moral Law hath mixt to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we owe to God in the first Table, placed in the
first place, <hi>Honora patrem,</hi> Honour the King. What
Divinity then can it be which this miserable unhappy
Age hath invented and vented, that the Fear of God
and the King are inconsistent; and the best Badge of
a Christian is to oppose the just and lawful Demands
and Commands of Kings? This is none of Christs,
his Apostles, nor ancient Christians and Martyrs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
What Christian heart can be so hard as not
to mourn for this, and cry out with that holy Martyr
<hi>Polycarp,</hi> Good Lord, for what times hast thou reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:33502:167"/>
Again, this Truth that Kings are Gods Vicegerents,
sent by immediate Commission from him, tyed us to
maintain our Kings in Honour, Wealth, and Power,
proportioned to so high a Calling. This the word
<hi>Honora patrem,</hi> honour thy Father naturally in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Dialect of the Scripture, imports, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.
17, 21. Almighty God, although his Immensity be
attended with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an able suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi>
and all <hi>Felicity,</hi> yet hath he sequestrated and
set a-part some persons peculiarly for his sacred Service,
some place for his publick Worship, and some <hi>Quota</hi>
of our Revenues and Industry, that all men may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>His Sovereignty,</hi> and their own Dependency
from, and Subordination and Subjection to him; so it
is the good will and pleasure of God, that all Subjects
should in Testimony of their Subjection to Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in true Acknowledgment of their Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
contribute some of their Means for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and honour of the King: this is the Apostles
Doctrine, <hi>Rom. 13. 6. For, for this Cause pay you Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
also; for they are Gods Ministers, attending continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
upon this very thing.</hi> What can be more fully said?
They are immediately from God, They are Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
for this Cause then we are bound to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.
And let the <hi>for</hi> in the Frontispiece of the verse
make you reflect your eyes upon that which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and you will find it is not <hi>an arbitrary Right</hi> they
have to this, which is given upon them by <hi>a voluntary
Compact or Grant,</hi> or <hi>extorted by Fear,</hi> the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this we do, <hi>not only for Wrath,</hi> (that is, for fear of
Punishment, for in their Power it is to punish those
who will not do this Duty) <hi>but for Conscience sake.</hi>
This our Lord and Master both taught and practised,
<hi>paying Tribute to</hi> Caesar, and commanding <hi>to render to
Caesar the things that were</hi> Caesar's; due to him as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:33502:168"/>
not by grant or compact from the People. And
Reason it self evinceth, that this Maintenance should
be proportioned to that high Degree and Measure, as
may preserve his Glory and Majesty, that it be not les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened
or contemned, and as may sufficiently enable
him to act and effect the happy works and Fruits of
Royal Government to preserve all in Peace and Plenty.
See to this purpose <hi>Iustin Martyr, Apolog.</hi> 2. and St.
<hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon <hi>Rom. 13. passim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine, that Kings are immediately from
God, and independent from all other Creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
teacheth also, that it is high Rebellion against
God to oppose or resist the King. This Consequence
the Apostle thus deduceth, <hi>Rom. 13. vers. 1. The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that be are ordained of God. vers.</hi> 2. Ergo, <hi>Whosoever
therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of
God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
Pardon me to cite <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon the words;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
He that obeyeth not the King, fighteth
against God, (what do they then that come in Arms
against him?) who by his Law hath established Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and not Resistance: and the Apostle every
where, always, and upon all Occasions, endeavoureth
this mainly, that our Obedience to Kings is not arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
conditional, or by compact; but necessary, and
imposed upon us by God. Holy Scripture is so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
we oppose not sacred Authority, that it hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
it in all it's kinds, all it's degrees. 1. We are
not to think a bad Thought of them in our Hearts,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 20. 2. The Tongue is not to speak Evil
of them: <hi>Exod. 22. 28. Iud.</hi> 8. Consequently neither
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:33502:168"/>
Pen nor Press are to write, or print, to their Disgrace
and Disadvantage. 3. We are not with <hi>Iudas</hi> to lift
up our heel. 4. <hi>David</hi>'s Heart smote him when he
smote <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment. 5. The hand cannot stretch
out it self against the Lords Anointed, and the Actor
be innocent. 6. It is to fight against God; for he
that rebelleth against the King, rebelleth against God.
He that blasphemeth the King, blasphemeth God:
1. <hi>Kings</hi> 21. The Prodigal in his Return acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he sinned no less against Heaven than his Father.
God hath taken them <hi>in Societatem nominis, in societa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
numinis: Psal.</hi> 82. 6. 7. The greatness of the Sin
may appear, that the greatest of Judgments fall upon
Traytors and Rebels. Scripture is plentiful in Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of this kind, and all Story witnesseth for it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Story of <hi>Rudolph</hi> Duke of <hi>Suevia,</hi> who
sware Allegiance to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, by Pope <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi>
was loosed from his Oath, but miserably died
he; and before his Death the right hand with which
he sware, was cut off, and say he could to the Bishops,
This is the hand was lifted up when I sware Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to my Emperour, justly cut off for my Perjury
and Rebellion, for which you are to answer, who
put me upon this mischievous Course and Rebellion.
See <hi>Aventine</hi> and others: infinite Examples may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
If they escape the Judgment of men by their
scarce warrantable Meekness and Clemency, God hath
Executioners in store, and ready for them: He will
revenge for his own Interest. If the King will not
do Justice against a Traytor, God will make his own
Friend do it, and if that fail, his own Breast, or both
of them, This was <hi>Absalom</hi>'s case: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 14.
Thy Confederates will do it, This was <hi>Sheba</hi>'s case:
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 22. Before an Executioner be wanting,
thy own hand shall do it; This was <hi>Achitophel's case
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:33502:169"/>
who hanged himself: 2 Sam.</hi> 17. 23. And <hi>Zimri</hi>'s <hi>case
too, 1 Kings</hi> 16. 18. If no man will do it, Earth and
Hell will do it; This was <hi>the case of Korah, Dathan,
Abiram, and their Complices: Numb.</hi> 16. 23. This
is the first Rebellion in Scripture, recorded against
Prince and Priest. And take with you <hi>Optatus</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Milevis</hi>'s note upon it, no Sin in Scripture recorded
hath a Judgment parallel to this. If all Creatures
should fail to be Executioners, God will do it by
his immediate hand from Heaven: <hi>Psalm</hi> 144.
8. To shut up this, God allowed no Sanctuary for
Treason and Traytors, as is manifest in the case of
<hi>Ioab,</hi> pulled from the Altar, and Justice done upon
him.</p>
            <p>Lastly, seeing the King is sacred in his Person, in
his Power, in his Royal Christian Prerogative, it is
high Sacriledge, and Intrusion upon God and the
King, to rob him of any part of his Sacred Right.
The ancient Church did judge so. <hi>Hosius</hi> writing to
<hi>Constantius</hi> an Arrian Emperour, saith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
This Holy
Father and the whole Church in his time did account
it a Theft, and an Opposition to God and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
by Fraud or Force, to cheat or extort from a
King any thing due to his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his Empire, his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.
It was not dreamed of then, that <hi>an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
could be set up against <hi>a Majesty,</hi> or a <hi>Coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
power</hi> erected with <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> In the happy time
of the Christian Church this was the greatest Robbery,
the highest Sacriledge, the most violent Intrusion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God and his Anointed.</p>
            <p>The best and readiest way for all Happiness to a
Kingdom, is when the King considereth that his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Glory consisteth in the Happiness of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and proportioneth all his Actions and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:33502:169"/>
to their Peace and Plenty; and the People on the

are thus affected, it will move Kings for the

<hi>Ionathan;</hi> or with <hi>Codrus,</hi> to dye himself for the
Safety of his People; or with <hi>David,</hi> in great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from God, to be powerful Intercessors with
God to remove his Plagues, to say, <hi>Quid meruere oves?</hi>
what have the poor sheep done? smite me and my Fathers
house: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. Like to the <hi>good shepherd, to lay down

that they will be ready to lose Lands, Riches, Honour,

               </gap>e well, the Body fareth the better, and when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is in good health and constitution, the Head is the
better, less trouble, no pain: For proof of this, I refer
you to that noble passage of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> cited before,
<hi>quaest. &amp; respons. ad Orthod. q.</hi> 138. Read the whole
passage, it is an expression <hi>in de propria,</hi> in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and proper place.</p>
            <p>In Sum, the Result of all is, that from this truth,
that Kings are immediately from God and Christ, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
from all others, there issueth a great many
excellent and useful Corollaries: as first, That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of their Dignity is not a motive (if it be
well weighed) to make them swell <hi>Lucifer</hi>-like in
Pride, for the weight of their great and difficult Charge
will force them of all men to be most humble. <hi>Officiis
quis idoneus istis?</hi> Their Crowns are dependent from
Christ and his Crown, and truly considered are onely
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:33502:170"/>
               <hi>Crowns of thorns:</hi> such as <hi>Dionysius</hi> said, an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man would not take up if it were lying at his
feet. Secondly, as Kings are nearer to God than any
Creatures in the low Universe, so are they tied to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
nearest to him in Holiness and all Humane and
Christian Perfection. Thirdly, they are bound to all
care, endeavour, and zeal for Christ's Glory, his Truth,
the Sincerity and Solemnity of his Worship, and that
not onely as men and Christians, but as Kings and
Fathers of the State, and Nurse-fathers of the Church.
Fourthly, howsoever exempted from Humane Law
and coercion, yet they are to live and reign according
to the Law and Prescript of God and Christ, which if
they transgress, they shall receive Punishment propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to their high Dignity, and according to their
Demerit for betraying the high Trust put upon them.
Fifthly, Although the Royal Right be not founded
in <hi>saving holiness and sanctity,</hi> but is <hi>sacred in another
respect,</hi> by a delegate Power and Trust, yet the way to
secure their Crowns, their Posterity, in the Right
transmissible from them, and to make their Kingdoms
happy, is to live piously in Private and Publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to intend at first, and do it most in their
Sacred Government. Sixthly, next to Almighty God,
the highest Honour, Reverence, and Obedience is due
to him. Seventhly, and Maintenance from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
proportioned to their high Dignity, and to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them to act and do what is necessary and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for God's Glory, the good of the Church, and
Peace, Plenty, and Protection of the Subject. Eighth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to resist him, oppose him, in thought, word or
deed, is Rebellion against God himself. Ninthly, it is
high Sacrilege, and not onely Royal but Divine Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
to trench upon the Kings Sacred Right.</p>
