         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(Good Reader) the estate of
this oure myserable tyme,
knowing that CHRISTE
in his Gospell hath geuen vs

vs therfore to th'intent
that our mindes should not
be troubled or caried aboute, as the weather Cocke is
commonly with euery puffe and smal blast of Winde.
Let this therefore aduertise thee, that thou looke not
backe from that Canonicall and heauenly doctrine,
Which our maister Christe hath taught, and confirmed
as his blessed will and Testament, with the price of
his precious death and bloudshedding on the Crosse:
with which he hath sealed the same, and left it vnto vs
and our posterities, that we and they vvhich shal come
after vs might teache it vnto our Children, as a law
giuen by him to be obserued for euer: Then sith he
hath so mercyfully and louingly delt with vs, shall we
rewarde his good will, with ingratitude? or shall we
in recompence of so greate benefites yelde or quit him
with disdaine? No, rather like obedient and louynge
children, let vs indeuer to obey his commaundements,
and to show our selues followes of his worde, not

ought at all: for faith and not workes are our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion,
yet I condemne not workes, for they are the
fruites of faith and testefie the same: sundry causes haue
mooued me, though vnworthy to take this labour in
hande: the one, the mutteringe of Papistes, whiche
mutter there and here, as oportunitie seruith their
turnes, strange lies and newes far distant from truth.
Another cause is, that the mindes of many men are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
and brought out of frame by the vngodly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes
of suche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as not only rebell against God and his
worde, but also agaynst the estate of this Realme, our
Queene and dignitie of her Crowne: and so through
the meanes and actions of a few vnnaturall braunches,
stande halfe in doubt whether they may turne to the
right hande or the left: this therefore may be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the one, to discourage and vtterly deface th'other:
Whiche not only purpose the ruine aud spoyle of their
naturall Nourse and countrie, but also as their vniust
dealynges, their craftie attempts, and subtill pretences
plainly showe and demonstrate the domage and decay
of our moste gratious and excellent Princesse, whose
high renowne of maiestie euery true and faithful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
as far as life and goods wil stretch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,

lawfull heire of the famous Prince Kinge Henrie the
eight (who was) a suppresser and ouerthrower of all
superstition and Idolatrie, so our Delbora doth not
only studie to vanquish and confounde the same: but
followeth the trace of hir most excellent Father, a wise

as our God seing our ingratefulnesse deliuered vs into
the hands of the Bulles of Basan, who no only defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the buildinge substancially framed and begon: but
more then this, gaue the greedy Boare of Rome free
libertie to enter therunto: whose spoiling Tuskes did
spoile aud roote vp such good and godly Braunches,
as therin did beautifie and cause the same increase: and
after in their steads planted Dernell weedes and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Brambles, which fruict was vnsauery and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
before GOD, who for the greeuous grones, the
Teares, and plaintes, most bitterly throwne forth of his
litle flocke and Churche, restored vs againe from the
yoke of Cruell and bloudy Pharo, and in place of CY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERA
or DIOCLESIAN, who alwayes were bente,
to worke the destruction of his people and Churche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
shortned their rage, abated their pride, and gaue vs a
wise and wittie HESTER, a godly IVDITH, a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
DEBORA, or rather a chaste SVSANNA, to rule,
to gouerne, and raygne ouer vs, whose clemencie we
can witnesse, whose loue, wee coulde neuer want, but
euer hath abounded towarde hir subiectes: and as for
the loue she hath to GOD wee are able sufficiently to
witnesse: hir mercie, the verie obstinate and blinde
bluddringe BALAMITS can sufficientlie recorde;
Why then doo wee so disdainefully recompence hir,
whom we are bounde by GOD and nature to loue and
obey? as it becometh good and godly subiects to do.
