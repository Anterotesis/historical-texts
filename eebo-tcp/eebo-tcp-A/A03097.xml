            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Retily was it aunſweared of Praxiteles (right worshipfull) who beeyng demaunded whych of both were moſt to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Paynter or the writer of Hystories: whether of the two would you chooſe (quoth he) to be dumbe and make a ſigne aptly, or to haue the vſe of your tongue, and tell your tale fitly? So that hymſelfe beyng a Paynter, and the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo greatly regarded as then it was, yet beyng made a iudge of two notable ſciences, he thought meeter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate ſomething from his owne arte, then to defame a better. Such were the dayes then, and the people ſo farre enamoured wyth the Arte of Paynting, that to haue skyll in the draught of shadowes, and the apt framing of pictures, was deemed the beſt quality that could reſt in a Gentleman: touchyng whiche, wee may well ſay as dyd Parrhaſius, who paynting one that ranne in a race, and not able to make hym ſweate, added this for a note, No farther then coulours. So that Praxiteles with his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill shall make the ſigne, and being not vnderstoode, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus shall tell his tale, by meanes whereof, that whych wanteth in the one, shall be ſo plentifully ſupplyed in the
<pb facs="tcp:6434:3"/>
other, that dyſpiſing the Paynter for ſetting downe to little, we shall ſuſpect the wryter for alleadging to much, finding faulte with one for obſcuritie, and in the other fearing flatterie. So lyuely in many things, and ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in all things is the pleaſaunt diſcourſe of hystories, that a better cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfayte may be drawne wyth two pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of incke in Herodotus tale, then with two potfull of coulours in Apelles table. But to leaue the Paynter to his coulours, it was fitly ſayde of Cicero, that to knowe no more then that which was done in his owne time, were ſtill to be a childe, meaning that the chiefeſt parte of wiſedome by the which we fartheſt ſurmount the boundes of childish ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is to be well ſeene in ſtoryes, out of the which, whether more profite or pleaſure redounde to thoſe that reade them, it is hard to ſay. For what greater commodity may there be, then to fit our-ſelues with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſortes of examples, to direct our wits, to frame our manners, to gouerne the courſe of our whole lyues, an infinite number whereof are offered in ſtories to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulare profite of the posteritie. Vertue blaſed with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, vice defaced with infamy, famous cities vtterly destroyed, ſmall townes highly aduanced, auncient frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship turned to enmity, mortall hatred conuerted to ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, free cities brought vnder tribute, and ſuche as were tributarie, restored to freedome, briefly, all things in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, that may eyther for profite auayle the reader, or for pleaſure delight hym. It is lefte to memory of Scipio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus a noble Gentleman of Rome, that ſeeking to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the example of Cyrus which was fayned by Xenophon, he atchieued that fame of wiſedome and valure as fewe had attayned before hym. The lyke happened to Selimus prince of the Turkes, whoſe auncetours hating ſtories, he
<pb facs="tcp:6434:3"/>
cauſed the actes of Caeſar to be drawne into his mother tongue, and by his example, ſubdued a great parte of Aſia and Africa. And Caeſar himſelfe had neuer aſpired to the type of ſo great renowne, but by following of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, reading whoſe victories, he braſt out into teares, forſomuch as at the ſame age whereat Alexander had ſubdued the whole worlde, hymſelfe had done nothing woorthy memory. The delyghte wee receyue by readyng hystories, is euery way ſingulare, a ſoueraigne medicine for the cares of the minde, a ſpeedy remedy for the griefes of the body. So that Alphonſus Kyng of Spayne, lefte by Phyſicke as incurable, recouered his health by readyng Lyuy. In which kynde of delightſome veyne, ſithence of all other Herodotus moſt excelleth, both for the pleaſaunt courſe of the ſtory, and the plentifull knowledge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned therein, I thought him not vnfit at his firſt entry into Englande, to growe in fauour wyth ſo noble a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by whoſe countenaunce gaynyng credite, hee may with leſſe shame and greater acceptaunce aduenture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of ſuch as shall reade hym. I leaue hym ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your worships hands to entertayne as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and as he deſerueth to make hym familiar, not forgetting to wish hym good fortune as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyner, and to your ſelfe increaſe of fame, and the fauour of God to youre lyues ende.</p>

Why my Lord (quoth he) that which I haue done I haue done by iuſtice, for our towne boyes, in whoſe crew this <note place="margin">Cyrus his bold anſvveare to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiages.</note> was, appoynting me their king, as the meeteſt of them all to beare rule, this fellow would not obay me, and thought ſcorne to do as I bad him: for which cauſe according to hys
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6434:41"/>
due deſert I ſharply puniſhed him, and if I for ſo doyng be worthy to be beaten, here I am do with me what thou wilt. Whyles the boy ſpake theſe wordes, <hi>Aſtyages</hi> his hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to riſe: for he ſeemd to himſelf to acknowledge the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of the boy, callynge to mynde the forme and ſignes of his face, beſydes, his ſtately and liberal geſture: the terme alſo of his yeares hit ſo pat with the time of his caſting out, that he verily thought hym to be his yong nephewe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at ſome what aſtonied he remained ſilent for a ſpace, &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the length returning to himſelfe (being deſirus to ſend away <hi>Artembares,</hi> to the end he might talke alone with the heardman) he ſpake thus. My meanyng is O <hi>Artembares</hi> (quoth he) in ſuch ſort to deale in this matter that you ſhall thinke your ſelfe ſatiſfyed, and your ſonne haue no cauſe to complayne. With which wordes <hi>Artembares</hi> taking hys humble leaue of the king, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was lead into an inner par lour. <hi>Aſtyages</hi> beyng now alone with the heardman, began to parle with hym where he had the boy, or how he came by hym. Who thinking it beſt to ſtand to hys tacklinge affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſtoutly that he was his own ſonne, and that his mother was liuing with hym at home at his houſe. To whom the king caſtyng an angry ſmyle: Certes (quoth hee) good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thou art not thyne owne freynd to runne wilfullye into the briers, and to be cauſe vnto thy ſelfe of a terrible death: and preſently making a ſigne to hys gard to lay hold on him they toke him in purpoſe to haue lead hym awaye. But the miſerable neatheard oppreſſed with extremity and driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſo nere a ſtrayght, reſolued with hymſelfe abandoning all fayned allegations to ſeeke refuge by confeſſynge the truth: wherfore openyng the whole matter from the firſt head and begynning, he fell downe on his knees, and humblye craued pardon of the kyng. <hi>Aſtyages</hi> hearyng hym without gloſe or colour to ſpeake as it was, made light of his fault and let him goe, ſending certaine of his court for <hi>Harpagus</hi> againſt whom hys ſtomacke was inflamed with greate wrath and
<pb facs="tcp:6434:42"/>
indignation, to whom appearing in prefence hee ſpake as followeth. Tell me <hi>Harpagus</hi> in truth (quoth he) by what death didſt thou murder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childe that I gaue vnto thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten &amp; borne of my daughter <hi>Mandâne:</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradates</hi> the heardman preſent, thought it not beſt to diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: he ſayd. My ſoueraigne lord and King, after I had receiued the Infant at your graces hand, I caſt in my head the beſt way &amp; fitteſt meanes to obey and fulfill your wil: and that in ſuch ſorte alſo, that auoydinge your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyes diſpleaſure, I might neyther be a mineſter of bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to your princely ſelfe, nor to your noble daughter. For which conſideratian I wrought thus. Sendinge for this heardman graſier of your maieſties Neat, I gaue into his handes the new borne brat, with a weighty and preciſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement from your gratious highneſſe to put him to death: and in ſo ſaying I ſpake no more then truth, for ſo much as your pleaſure was it ſhould be ſo. In this ſort I committed vnto him the babe with an earneſt and carefull charge to lay it out in the deſert chaſes of the wilde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable rockes &amp; mountaines, adding a hundred thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d threats of the moſt cruell and peſtilent death in the worlde if in caſe he ſhould let, or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt point refuſe to perfourm it with diligence. Which done by him and the infant beyng dead, of my moſt aſſured and truſty ſeruauntes I ſent ſome to behold the child hauing nowe expyred and breathed forth hys laſt blaſt who fynding it cold, and without ſence, layd it in the earth and buryed it. This ſtandes the caſe O king and by this death the child periſhed. Now as touching this diſcourſe of <hi>Harpagus</hi> his talke was directed and grounded on a flat and ſincere truth.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Aſtyages</hi> makinge no ſemblaunce of anger of that which had happened, began and told him fyrſt of the heard
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6434:42"/>
mans confeſſion procedinge orderlye with the reſt, till at length he came to ſay thus. For that the childe liueth and by the benefyte offortune and fauour of the Gods hath eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped death I greatly reioyce as beyng diſquieted with no ſmal anguiſh and torment of conſcience to conſider the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany and wicked treeſon wrought agaynſtyt, and beyng of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten challenged by my daughter, for the priuy murder and concealed death of hyr child, I was not a litle gauled and aſtlicted in thought. But in that fortune hath turned all to the beſt: ſend me hether thy ſonne to bee a playfellow and companion to my litle nephew, and ſee thou come thy ſelfe backe agayne and accompany me at ſupper. For the truth is I am in purpoſe to do ſacrifyce to the Gods immortall for the ſafe recouery of the child, to whom the honour and chiefe prayſe of this gracious and fortunate happe doth eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially belong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harpagus</hi> hearynge this, dyd hys humble reuerence to the kinge, exceedynge ioyous at the fauourable yſſue and good euent of his fault, and not a litle glad beſydes that as a fellow and companion of the kynges mirth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort he was inuyted to ſupper.

At the comming out of the chappell, there is alſo to be ſeene an aultar of cleane gold: not farre from the which ſtandeth another of ſtrange and wonderfull bignes, whereon are offered all ſuch beaſtes as are of perfect age and ripe growth: contrarywiſe on the aultar of golde it is not lawfull to ſacrifice any but ſucklings, and ſuch as are newly drawne and taken from the teate. On the greater of the two aultars, the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Chaplaynes burne incenſe to the god, with expence of a C. M. talents of frankincenſe. In the ſame temple is alſo another image of. 12. cubites in length of maſſy and beaten golde, which albeit I ſawe not with mine owne eies, yet preſuming vpon the credit of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> I haue aduentured to ſet it downe.

parſe of theſe laid their wealth &amp; treaſure on the trimming &amp; beautifying of the city walles: other ſpared no coaſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich &amp; adorne the temples &amp; palaces of the gods. In the line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſcent of the bloud royall, mention is made of two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: the one of theſe raigned fiue ages before the later, and was called <hi>Semiramis.</hi> This Queene cauſed to be caſt vp &amp; raiſed great mounts &amp; mighty banckes, very wonderfull to be ſeene, which kept the riuer within the courſe of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall chanell, beeing wont before time to ouerflow &amp; couer the whole plame. The ſecond Queene named <hi>Nitocris</hi> was of wit more ſharp &amp; ſubtile, and of much more fiue inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former, by whom both other things were brought to paſſe right woorthy memory, whiche wee purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: and chiefly this, that perceiuing the power and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the <hi>Medes</hi> to grow and increaſe, and as well other townes, as alſo the city <hi>Ninus</hi> to be vanquiſhed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe forethought all the meanes that could be deuiſed, to arme &amp; defend hirſelfe againſt the enemy. Firſt of all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Euphrates</hi> that whilome by a ſtreight &amp; equall courſe ſtreame throughout the towne, flowing in a right line to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea by meanes of certaine trenches caſt vp and digged for the ſtreame, ſhe drew into a confuſe and intricate race, folding &amp; winding many waies, inſomuch that in three ſundry places it hath eftſoones recourſe vnto one little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in <hi>Aſſyria</hi> called <hi>Arderica</hi> ſo that they which come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſea to <hi>Babylon</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreined to ariue thrice at <hi>Arderica</hi> &amp; that alſo in three ſeuerall dayes. This was alſo one worke of hers which ſhe did about y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the borders wherof beſides ſhe hath hemmed &amp; garded in with a banke ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous, &amp; what for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hignes &amp; bignes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame, it would greatly aſtoniſhe thoſe that do view &amp; behold it. Somewhat aboue the city, a little off from the riuers ſide, ſhe cauſed a place to be caſt &amp; trenched for the receipt of a ſtanding water or poble, which they digged ſo deepe, till they came to the water, extending
<pb facs="tcp:6434:63"/>
euery way in breadth the ſpace of. 320. furlongs. The earth that was voyded heerefro was referred and employed to the bancking of the riuer. The edge and brinckes of the poole were layde aboute and paued with ſtone. In both which things, as well in turning the courſe of the water, as in deluing the trench or lake, ſhe had this purpoſe, that the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the floud being hindred by ſo many windings and turnings, might flowe in a more quiet and peaceable ſtreame: then, that the paſſage from the maine ſea to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> might be made more troubleſome to the ſaylers, by the often creekes and circuites of the water: finally, that the next way and readieſt path from <hi>Media</hi> to <hi>Babylon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut vp, and intercepted by the mutable courſe of the riuer, the <hi>Medes</hi> hindered from mutable trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize with the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> might be ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull of hir aſſayres and counſayle. Thus did Queene <hi>Nitocris</hi> on the lower ſide of <hi>Babylon</hi> prouide for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and good eſtate of the Realme, hauing another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the fenne or mariſh which ſhe cauſed the people to digge aboue the towne, for the City being ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into two partes, by meanes of the riuer which flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth through the middes, vnder the raigne and dominion of other Princes, whoſoeuer of the Citizens was deſirous to go ouer on the other ſide, he was fayne to be feried ouer, and paſſe by a boate, whiche coulde not be voyde of greate toyle and trouble, of which extremity by the good inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Queene <hi>Nitocris,</hi> the City obteyned ſpeedie releaſe by one and the ſelfeſame meanes, leauing behinde two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of perpetual memory. Wherfore hauing turned the riuer into the maine gulfe or lake that was caſt vp and digged in the plaine, ſhe incontinently cauſed mighty ſtones to be hewed out, ſquared for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe. The floud hauing a breach and iſſue another way, within the compaſſe of his owne chanell became drye and voyde of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Nitocris</hi> therefore fenced the bankes and ſhores of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6434:63"/>
riuer within the Citie, with a ſkirt or edge of bricke, to ſaue the water from abating and wearing the earth. In like maner the ſteppes leading downe from the braſen wickets to the water, ſhe framed of bricke layd and mortered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in like ſorte as the walles. About the middeſt of the Citie ſhe made a bridge ouer the water, built of ſtone cut and poliſhed to the ſame ende, which ſhe cauſed to be knit &amp; mortered together with leade and iron. This bridge in the day time ſhe couered with planckes of foureſquare forme, to giue paſſage &amp; recourſe to her ſubiects: which in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were continually drawne &amp; remooued from thence, to the end all occaſion of mutual theft and villany in the night might be foreſeene &amp; preuented. The worke being ended, ſhe wrought the meanes for the water to returne to his proper courſe, eftſoones boyding the lake againe, which then by continuall feeding of the ſtreame, drew to be full. Thus the end prooued the deluing of the fenne to be very profitable &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious, by meanes whereof a bridge was made for the vſe &amp; benefit of the city. The ſame <hi>Nitocris</hi> alſo put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe this ſubtile and deceitfull inuention. Aloſt vppon the moſt ſtately and portlike gate of the City in open ſhew and appearaunce to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe built her a Sepulchre, engrauen with this title or ſuperſcripcion: <hi>If any of the Kings of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon after me ſhall ſtand in neede or pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some of theſe palmes (as they vſe alſo to do in other) the <hi>Graecians</hi> call male trees, the fruite wherof they eate not, but only bind it to the fruite of the female trees, whereof breedeth a ſmall woorme or flye, which with her ſharpe and forcked nebbe biteth through the fruite of the female palme, whereby it commeth to ripeneſſe and matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being otherwiſe wont to drop off and decay before it arriue to full growth and perfection.

Let vs now proceede vnto that which next after the city it ſelfe, is (in my fancy) the ſtraungeſt mirrour and wonder of the whole region. The veſſels wherein they are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to paſſe downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtreame to <hi>Babylon,</hi> are made circle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and of round compaſſe, drawne ouer on the outſide, and couered with leather: for the people of <hi>Armenia,</hi> whoſe countrey lyes aboue the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> hauing hewed &amp; ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed out of willow certaine round veſſels very hollow and deepe, they caſt ouer a paaſt or couering of leather, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them both to the vſe of houſhold affayres to contemne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in &amp; ſuch like, and alſo to rowe in and paſſe the water. They haue neither head nor tayle that a man may poynt at with his finger, there to be the noſe and forepart of the ſhippe, and heere the hinder part or ſterne, but are contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into a circulare forme like a buckler or target. The bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of theſe veſſels they matte and fence with ſtrawe or ruſhes, wherevpon laying their chaffer and merchandiſe, they commit themſelues to the water. Theyr chiefeſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is ſmall roundlets or firkins of wyne, makyng the caſke it ſelfe of the leaues of palme.

of the ſwiftneſſe and violence of the ſtrcame, which is the cauſe alſo that they make their veſſels not of wood, but of ſkinnes.

In their ſhowes following the cuſtome of the whole countrey, they vſe all one faſhion, not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Thebane</hi> ſlippers. Their hayre very long, tied and bound vp behinde with a coyfe. In all partes of their bodye embaulmed with ſweete oyles and precious oyntmentes. On their fingers they we are a ſignet: bearing in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds a ſlender rod in forme of a ſcepter, very ſkilfully and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially wrought, on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top whereof is carued either an apple, a roſe, a lilly, an eagle, or ſome ſuch like thing, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted wickedneſſe with them, and againſt all lawe, to carry a rod or ſcepter without ſuch an enſigne on the top. And thus much for their attyre.</p>
            <p>The lawes which they vſe are theſe. One moſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and for the ſingulare wiſedome and commoditie thereof greatly to be regarded. Likewiſe another, which (if I be not deceiued) the people <hi>Eneti</hi> comming of the <hi>Hlyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do commonly practiſe throughout their whole lande. Once in a yeare they obſerued this cuſtome. The virgins that were arriued to the due time and eſtate of marriage, they aſſembled all into one place, faſt behind theſe ſtoode a great multitude of yong men and batchelers. When all were come and the company was huſh, there aroſe vp a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cryer, proclayming ſeuerally the ſale of euery one to ſuche as were minded to buy them, and in the firſt place ſhee that was the paragon and moſt beautifull damoſell
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6434:67"/>
of all the route, was in like manner firſt publiſhed and ſet forth to be ſold, whom ſome one or other hauing purchaſed with a great ſumme of money, ſhe that was next in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the faireſt, was next priced, with a condition annexed, that they whiche bought ſhoulde alſo marry them. Suche therefore of <hi>Babylon</hi> that were of good wealth, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wines, bought vp the braueſt wenches, euery one ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding beſt for beautie that badde beſt for the beautifull. The baſeſt ſorte of yonkers that were not ſo deyntely toothed, contenting themſelues with the homelieſt laſſes, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take a good nutbrowne wench with a dowrie, with whome to practiſe the daliaunces of <hi>Venus.</hi> The market being made of the beſt and fayreſt, incontinently the moſt vggly and fouleſt droſſe of the company was by the voyce of the crier cyted to appeare, whome he ſet foorth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the liking of any, who with the leaſt expence and ſinaleſt charge that might, woulde be contente with a wife. In which ſort ſhe ſtandeth, til there ſtep foorth a mate that will holde himſelfe ſatiſfied with a ſluttiſhe wife and a ſlender dowrie, euermore making a gayne of thoſe vppon whome nature and the heauens had largely beſtowed theyr graces and treaſures, whereas with the reſt, that were ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impotent, lame, or in part of the body diſfigured, or generally ſluttiſh and ylfauoured, they endowed with a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goodes the ſooner to procure and get them huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Neither was it free and indifferent for any man to place and diſpoſe his daughter to whome he would: nor for the byer without ſufficient warrant or ſuretie of his good vſage of hir to take hir away: but hauing brought ſuch as ſhould plight their faith and honeſtie in his behalfe, that he ſhould vndoubtedly vſe hir in place of his wife, he tooke hir with him, whereof if by fortune they coulde not agree, the law commaunded that the money whiche was geuen for price of the virgine ſhould be eftſoones reſtored to the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: wherein the cuſtome was not ſo ſtrict and ſeuere, but
<pb facs="tcp:6434:68"/>
that a couple of contrary villages might match together, and enter the eſtate of mariage one with another, the man alwayes rendering a certaine ſumme and price for his wife if ſhe were worth the buying. This law was very well and wiſely ordeyned by them, which within a while after loſt his force, and was vtterly neglected: albeit in later dayes they coyned a new deuiſe that no man ſhould abuſe or any way iniurie a woman, nor carry hir away into a ſtrange ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for the citie being taken, and themſelues ſhamefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by their enemies, in ſo much that the moſt part of them had waſted their goodes and ſubſtance, the poore lay people that were in great extremity and want of ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, cauſed their ſtocke, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> care of their honeſty &amp; chaſte liuing ſet apart, to purchaſe lucre by the common vſe of their bodies. Another law and ſtatute they had of equal prayſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation with the firſt, whereby it was prouided that all perſons poſſeſſed with any griefe or diſeaſe, ſhould be cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and layd in the open market place, to the end that (v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no Phyſicions) euery one might giue their verdit of their ſickneſſe and maladie. As euery one therefore appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth neare vnto the diſeaſed, if at any time they haue had triall and experience of the like payne and diſtreſſe eyther in themſelues or in other, they let not to miniſter connſaile to the ſicke, &amp; preſcribe ſuch order &amp; dyet, as hath bin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore either profitable to themſelues, or wholeſome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: vtterly abhorring from all lawe and ciuility, to paſſe ſecurely &amp; careleſly by the feeble, &amp; not to enquire the ſtate and maner of his griefe. They eſteeme it no ſmall bliſſe to them to be buried in ſepulchers, reſembling very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cuſtome of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in funerall ſorrow and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation for the dead. As oft as they haue ſociety and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with their wiues, placing themſelues in ſeates one ouer agaynſt another, the men take ſweete perfume, and burneth it, the women likewiſe doing the very ſame. At the drawing neere of the euening they waſh and wrinſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6434:68"/>
themſelues very cleane, not attempting to touch any thing with their hands, before they haue thoroughly cleanſed and purged the filth from their bodies, which thing is in vſe likewiſe with the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſelfeſame <hi>Babylonians</hi> acquaint themſelues wyth an order full of all abhomination and wickedneſſe. All the women of their nation once in their whole liues, reſort to the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> where abandoning their chaſtity, they giue vp themſelues to be defiled and corrupted by ſtraungers: howbeit, ſuch women as are of great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and haue wealth at will, diſdeining to ſit and accompany with the reſt, are drawne to the temple in charlots or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters caſt ouer and couered with a vale of leather: whether being come, leauing the trayne of their meyny and ſeruants behinde them, they place themſelues in ſeates before the gates of the palace, which is the common vſe of all ſuch as are of high degree. Within the Churche they ſit in greate multitudes, bound about the temples of the head with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of ſweete and pleaſaunt flowres, ſome of them are comming, others going, for certayne paſſages and wayes ſeuerally made by cords &amp; lines, leade and direct the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to ſuch as they fancy beſt and haue moſte minde to. Moreouer, hauing once taken her ſeate in the Temple, ſhe neuer returneth home vntill ſome one or other of foreigne countreys hath geuen her money, and reapt her chaſtitie, who approching neere to his lady whome he liketh, ſayeth thus: <hi>The goddeſſe Militta be fauourable and gracious vnto thee.</hi> By this name <hi>Militta</hi> is <hi>Venus</hi> called with <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians,</hi> neither is it lawfull to deſpiſe the money which is geuen, how much or how little ſoeuer it be, being applied to a ſacred &amp; holy vſe. Neither may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be her own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to reiect any y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commeth to her, but whoſoeuer is her firſt chapman him ſhe immediately followeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out reſpect of perſons: with whome, after ſhe hath accompanyed for a while, hauing made her offring to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goddeſſe, ſhe returneth
<pb facs="tcp:6434:69"/>
home, for the time to come not to be allured by mountaynes of gold to acquaint themſelues with any in the like ſort. Of this noble route ſuch as are moſt prayſeworthy for beautie and comely proportion of the body, haue ſooneſt made theyr market and are gonne, the groſſer and baſer ſort being held by the law to remaine there ſo long, till they haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the rites and cuſtomes of the Countrey, ſo that it chaunceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwhiles to abide in the Temple a yeare or two, yea ſometimes three, before the poore ſoules can be acquit of their ſeruitude. The like ordinaunce is of force &amp; vertue in ſome part of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Theſe are the lawes of the people of <hi>Babylon,</hi> of whome there be three ſortes, ſome which liue only by fiſh, whiche beeing purged and dried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſunne, they vſe in this manner, firſt they powne &amp; bray it in a morter, which done, they preſerue and keepe it in linnen ſheetes, whereof they take at their pleaſure, and putting thereto liquour, they kneade and bake it in maner of bread.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſian</hi> prince <hi>Cyrus</hi> hauing obteyned the victorie ouer all the countrey of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was pricked with deſire to bring into his power the people of the <hi>Maſſagetes;</hi> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very large, and in armes couragious and valiaunt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their habitation in the Eaſt towardes the morning ſunne beyond the floud <hi>Araxes,</hi> right ouer againſt the <hi>Iſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> and being (as ſome men ſuppoſe) a part of <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia.</hi> The Riuer <hi>Araxes</hi> is both greater and leſſe then the mighty ſtreame called <hi>Iſter,</hi> wherein alſo are many Iles not inferiour in compaſſe to the Iland <hi>Lesbus.</hi> The people of thoſe Iles liue in the ſommer time by all kinde of rootes whiche themſelues plucke vp and gather, reſeruing the fruite of their trees that is ripe and ready to be eaten for their winter foode and ſuſtenance. By theſe people were found out and deſeryed certayne trees, whoſe fruite beeing caſt into the fire (which they vſe to kindle ſwarming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great flockes) doth no leſſe incharme and make
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6434:69"/>
drunken the ſenſes of thoſe that fit by, with the ſauour and ſmell proceeding therefro, then their wyne doth intoxicate the heads of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> being ſo much the more idle in their braynes by how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more they burne of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid fruite: euen ſo farre at length, that they fall to ſinging, dauncing and leaping paſt meaſure. Now the floude <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes</hi> (like as alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryuer <hi>Gyndes</hi> which <hi>Cyrus</hi> broached and deuyded into 360 trenches) beginneth at the <hi>Mantien</hi> hylles parting it ſelfe into ſixty ſeuerall ſtreames, the reſt (one only excepted) haue their endinges in fennes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe groundes: where certayne people are ſayde to make their abode, which are nouriſhed by rawe fiſhes, being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and apparelled in Seale ſkinnes. The other parte of <hi>Araxes</hi> continueth his courſe vnto the ſea called <hi>Caſpium,</hi> which is a ſea of it ſelfe, not permixt and mingled with any other, for aſwell the ſalte water through the which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

The weſt ſide of this ſea is edged in by the mountayne <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> being of incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble height and greatneſſe: vpon this hill one people of all ſortes inhabyting: very many &amp; diuerſe ſuſteyned by wilde foode and fieldiſhe reliefe. The leaues which their trees beare are much like vnto ours in ſhew, though different in nature: theſe they beate to powlder, and rempering them with a quantity of water they make of them a certayne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſuch force and vertue that paynting therewith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their garments the ſimilitudes of ſundry wilde beaſts, it neuer chaungeth hue, but euen as if the pictures had bene wouen and wrought in the cloth: ſo together with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woolle it ſelfe they weare out and decay. Theſe men after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Firſt by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of his birth and infancie, whereby he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to thinke and imagyne him ſelfe to bee more then halfe a god, farre aduaunced aboue the mortall eſtate of humane kinde.

            <p>The kingdome of the <hi>Maſſagets</hi> after the deceaſe of the prince hir huſband was held by the moſt noble and vertuous Queene <hi>Tomyris,</hi> vnto whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> addreſſinge certayne meſſengers in fained gloſe of deceiptfull words, demaunded hir mariage: but the prudent and couragious lady percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his bent, how not for the loue of hir ſelfe, but for deſire of the kingdome he had couloured a ſute of diſſembled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, flatly forbadde him to come within the lyſtes and boundes of hir countrey. <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſeeing his pollicie to be in vayne, lead his power to the ryuer <hi>Araxes,</hi> in open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed wiſe, threatning vengeance and all kinde of cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the realme of the <hi>Maſſagets:</hi> wherefore hauing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the ryuer with certayne bridges, whereby to trayne and conu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now king <hi>Cyrus</hi> hauing committed to his ſonne <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> the gouernaunce and adminiſtration of the realme, he delyuered into his hands <hi>Craeſus</hi> king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

The firſt is, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer flow of <hi>Nilus</hi> commeth of none other cauſe, then that the windes <hi>Eteſiae</hi> ſo named, blowing directly vpon the ſtreame thereof, hinder and beate backe the waters from flowing into the ſea, which windes are commonly wont to ariſe, and haue their ſeaſon a long time after the increaſe and riſing of <hi>Nilus:</hi> but imagine it were otherwiſe, yet this of neceſſitie muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all riuers whatſoeuer hauing a full and direct courſe againſt the windes <hi>Eteſiae,</hi> ſhall in like maner ſwell and grow ouer their bankes, and ſo much the rather, by how much the leſſe and weake the flouds themſelues are, whoſe ſtreames are oppoſed againſt the ſame. But there be many riuers as well in <hi>Syria</hi> as in <hi>Africa,</hi> that ſuffer no ſuch motion and change as hath bin ſayd of the floud <hi>Nilus.</hi> There is another opinion of leſſe credite and learning, albeit of greater woonder and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration then the firſt, alleadging the cauſe of the riſing to be, for that the riuer (ſay they) proceedeth from the Oeean ſea, which enuironeth the whole globe and circle of the earth. The third opinion being more caulme and modeſt then the reſt, is alſo more falſe and unlikely then them both, affirming, that the increaſe and augmentation of <hi>Nilus</hi> commes of the ſnowe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters molten and thawed in thoſe regions, carying with it ſo much the leſſe credit and authority, by how much the more it is euident that the riuer comming from <hi>Africa</hi> through the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6434:79"/>
middeſt of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> runnes continually from the hotter countreys to the colder, beeing in no wiſe probable, or any thing likely that the waxing of the waters ſhould proceede of ſnowe. Many ſound proofes may be brought to the weakening of this cauſe, whereby we may geſſe how groſſely they erre whiche thinke ſo greate a ſtreame to be increaſed by ſnowe. What greater reaſon may be found to the contrary, then that the windes blowing from thoſe countreys are very warme by nature. Moreouer, the lande it ſelfe is continually voyde of rayne and yee, being moſt neceſſary that within fiue dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall of ſnowe there ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſame is confirmed and eſtabliſhed by the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſwartneſſe of the people, couloured by the vehement heate and ſcorching of the ſume: likewiſe by the ſwalowes and kytes which continually keepe in thoſe coaſtes: laſtly by the flight of the cranes toward the comming of winter, which are alwayes wont to flye out of <hi>Scythia</hi> and the cold regions to theſe places, where all the winter ſeaſon they make theyr abode. Were it then that neuer ſo little ſnow could fall in thoſe countreys by the which <hi>Nilus</hi> hath his courſe, and from which he ſtretcheth his head and beginning, it were not poſſible for any of theſe things to happen which experience prooueth to be true. They which talke of <hi>Oceanus,</hi> grounding their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vppon a meere fable, want reaſon to prooue it. For I <note place="margin">That there is no ſea called Ocean.</note> thinke there is no ſuch ſea as the Ocean, but rather that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> or ſome one of the auncient Poets deuiſed the name, and made vſe thereof afterwardes in their tales and poetry. Now if it be expedient for me hauing refuted and diſalowed other mens iudgements, to ſet downe mine owne. The reaſon why <hi>Nilus</hi> is ſo great in ſommer I take to be this. In the winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <note place="margin">The true opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe things.</note> the ſunne declining from his former race vnder the colde winter ſtarre, keepeth hys courſe ouer the high countreys of <hi>Africa,</hi> and in theſe fewe wordes is conteyned the whole cauſe. For the ſunne the neerer he maketh his approch to any region, the more he drinketh vp the moyſture thereof, and cauſeth the riuers and brookes of the ſame countrey to runne
<pb facs="tcp:6434:80"/>
very lowe. But to ſpeake at large, and lay open the cauſe in more ample wyſe, thus the caſe ſtandeth. The bringer to paſſe and worker heereof is the ſunne, beeing caryed ouer the hygh countreys of <hi>Africa:</hi> For the ſpring time with them beeyng very fayre and cleare, the land hote, and the wyndes colde, the ſunne paſſing ouer them workes the ſame effecte as when it runneth in the middeſt of heauen in ſommer, forſomuch as by vertue of his beames gathering water vnto him, he cauſeth it to aſcend into the ſuperiour regions, where the windes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">The cauſe vvhy the South and Southvveaſt vvind bring rayne.</note> it, diſpearſe the vapours and reſolue them againe, which is chiefely done by the South and Southweſt winde that blowe from theſe countreys, beeing ſtormy and full of rayne. Now the water drawne out of <hi>Nilus</hi> by the ſunne, doth not in this ſort fall downe agayne in ſhowres and drops of rayne, but is quite ſpent and conſumed by the heate. Toward the ende of winter, the ſunne drawing towards the middeſt of the ſkye in like manner as before, ſucketh the water out of other riuers, which is the cauſe that being thus drawne vntill much rayne and ſhowres increaſe them agayne, they become fleete and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt drie. Wherefore the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> into whome alone no ſhowres fall at any time, is for iuſt cauſe loweſt in winter, and bigheſt in ſommer, foraſmuch as in ſommer the ſunne dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth moyſture equally out of all riuers, but in winter out of <hi>Nilus</hi> alone, this I take to be the cauſe of the diuers and changeable courſe of the riuer. Heereof alſo I ſuppoſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the dryneſſe of the ayre in that region, at ſuch time as the ſunne deuideth his courſe equally, ſo that in the high coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Africke</hi> it is alwayes ſommer: whereas if it were poſſible for the placing and ſituation of the heauens to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that where North is, there were South, &amp; where South is, North, the ſunne towardes the comming and approach of winter departing from the middeſt of heauen, would haue his paſſage in like ſort ouer <hi>Europe,</hi> as now it hath ouer <hi>Africke,</hi> and worke the ſame effects (as I iudge) in the riuer <hi>Iſter,</hi> as now it doth in <hi>Nilus.</hi> In like maner, the cauſe why <hi>Nilus</hi> hath <note place="margin">Iſter a great riuer in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</note> no miſt or cloude ariſing from it according as we ſee in other flouds, I deeme to be this, becauſe the countrey is exceeding

Of the immeaſurable deapth of the fountayne, the ſcribe affirmed, that <hi>Pſammeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> King of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had taken triall, who ſounding the waters with a rope of many miles in length, was vnable to feele any ground or bottome: whoſe tale (if any ſuche thyng were done as he ſayde) made me thinke, that in thoſe places whereof he ſpake, were certayne gulfes or whirlepooles very ſwift, violente and raging, whiche by reaſon of the fall of the water from the hilles, would not ſuffer the line with the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding leade to ſinke to the bottome, for which cauſe, they were ſuppoſed to be bottomleſſe. Beſides this, I coulde learne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any man.

Hauing finiſhed forty dayes iourney along the riuer, take ſhipping againe, and paſſe by water twelue dayes voyage, till ſuch time as you arriue at a great city called <hi>Meroe,</hi> which is reputed for the chiefe and <note place="margin">The City Meroe.</note> Metropolitane city of the countrey, the people whereof, only of all the gods worſhip <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whome they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence with exceeding zeale and deuotion.

then ſome one of the Chaplaynes taking a boule of wyne in his hands, drinketh ouer the oblation with his face towarde the temple, and calling with a loude voyce vpon the name of the god, giueth the beaſt a wound and killeth him, the head and hyde whereof, they beare into the market place, with many <note place="margin">The head of the beaſt that is ſacrificed is accurſed.</note> deteſtable curſſes, and diueliſh bannings, making ſale thereof to the Merchaunts of <hi>Greece.</hi> Such of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> as haue no place of ſale or vſe of Merchaundiſe with the <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> caſt both head and hyde into the riuer <hi>Nilus.</hi> In curſſing the head of the ſlaine beaſt they vſe this manner of imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if any euill or miſfortune be to happen either to thoſe which do the ſacrifice, or to the whole realme and dominion of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it would pleaſe the gods to turne all vpon that head.

I ſuppoſe that many men miſcarry and came ſhort home, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they flatly denie that of a wound ſo taken any man euer periſhed. The homelings and peculiar people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey alleadge this reaſon of the battell.

For it is ſeene (ſay they) how other things that haue life and ſence, meddle themſelues <note place="margin">A reaſon dravvne from the vſe of beaſtes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men.</note> each with other euen in ſuch places as the gods were worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which if it were a thing ſo odious and diſpleaſaunt in the eyes of the higher powers, no doubt the beaſtes themſelues would eſchue and auoyde it, whoſe doings together with their iudgement I flatly diſalow. Howbeit, vnderſtand we, that as well in theſe things whereof we haue intreated, as in all other the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> are led with a ſingular ſuperſtition. <hi>Aegypt</hi> alſo itſelfe albeit it abutte and poynt vpon the countrey of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> yet is it not ouermuch peſtered with beaſtes.

otherſome are more wilde, fierce, and intractable, refuſing ſo gently to come to haud.

The ſame King made an equall diſtribution of the whole countrey to all his ſubiects, allotting to euery man the lyke <note place="margin">A diuiſion of land.</note> portion and quantitie of ground, drawne out and limited by a foureſquare fourme.

The cauſe he was ſtricken blynde, is ſayde to be this. At what tyme the waters of the floud increaſing, by reaſon of a mightie raging winde, had drowned the lowe countreys eyghteene cubites deepe. The Kyng inraged at the vnaccuſtomed ſwelling of the ryuer, tooke hys darte and diſcharged it into the middeſt of the waters, for whyche hys, vnrcuerent facte, the fame is, that hys ſighte incontinente was taken from hym, and hee became blynde the ſpace of tenne yeares. In the eleuenth yeare, there aroſe a prophecie in the city <hi>Butis,</hi> that the tyme of hys miſerie was nowe exſpyred, and that hys ſyght ſhoulde eftſoones bee reſtored agayne, if in caſe hee waſhed hys eyes in the water of a woman, whych neuer knewe man but her owne huſbande. For further proofe of thys phetis medicine, <note place="margin">An exquiſite medicine for the eyes.</note> the Kyng beganne firſt wyth hys owne wyfe, whych working not the effecte he looked for, he tryed many others, but all in vayne, laſtly, lighting vppon a poore ſeely woman that had neuer woorſhipped more Sainctes then one, hee ſpeedely recouered hys ſighte agayne, and cauſing all thoſe whome

            <p>The King thus healed, and freely acquited of hys former miſerie, began to be deuoute, increaſing the temples of the gods with giftes of exceeding value. All which deſerue for theyr excellencie to be had in memorie, and chiefly thoſe that he offered in the temple of the Sunne, which were theſe, two mighty great ſtones which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in theyr tongue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Obeli,</hi> in faſhion like a ſpit or breach. 100. cubites long, and in breadth. 80.</p>
            <p>Next after hym the kingdome deſcended to a certayne man of the citie <hi>Memphis,</hi> whoſe name in the greeke language <note place="margin">Protheus King of Aegypt.</note> was <hi>Protheus,</hi> to whome the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> erected a temple, which is yet to be ſeeue in <hi>Memphis,</hi> very fayre and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, garniſhed wyth rich and ſingulare giftes.

to touch him, which order was kept inuiolate vnto our agea The ſeruauntes of <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing of the lawes of this temple, forſooke their Lorde, and fled vnto it, and in humble manner ſubmitting themſelues before the god, they accuſed their mayſter (whoſe death they all deſired) ſhewing in what manner he came by <hi>Helena</hi> &amp; the great iniury he had wrought to her huſband <hi>Menelaus.</hi> The ſame playnt alſo they framed before the prieſts of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the chiefe gouernour of the port named <hi>Thonis.

Whereat <hi>Thonis</hi> without any farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, tooke this yong gallaunt of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſtrayned hys ſhips, and brought him with the Lady <hi>Helena</hi> and the reſt of his retinue to the city <hi>Memphis,</hi> where the King at that tyme made his place of abiding. Beeing arriued at the Court, the King aſked <hi>Alexander</hi> in theſe wordes: Yong gentleman, what are you, and from what countrey are you landed heere in <hi>Aegypt? Alexander,</hi> who was not to ſeeke of an aunſwere, with a comely grace made aunſwere to the King, deſcrying both his countrey and lynage, the place alſo from whence hee was arriued, and to what coaſtes he directed his courſe.

The vaſſals hauing ended their ſpeeche, <hi>Protheus</hi> turned hymſelfe to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and tucked hym vp with thys rounde tale: my friende (ſayde hee) were it not for the reuerence I owe to ſtraungers, with whome my cuſtome is not to deale by rigour, I woulde ſurely pipe yee ſuch a daunce for the wicked villanie wherewith thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed thyne hoaſt in <hi>Greece,</hi> that all vnthankefull wretches ſhoulde take example by thee how to vſe thoſe that ſhewe them courteſie in a forraigne lande.

and quyet ſea, arryued at <hi>Troy,</hi> were rather intruded by ſome other poet then inuented by <hi>Homer,</hi> who contrarywyſe in hys <hi>Illiads</hi> maketh mention of his errour by ſea.</p>
            <p>To leaue <hi>Homer,</hi> and come to the affayres of the <hi>Troianes,</hi> being deſirous to vnderſtand of what truth theſe things were <note place="margin">Of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane vvarre.</note> which are bruted to haue beene done by the <hi>Greekes</hi> at <hi>Troy,</hi> I ſollicited the matter with the prieſtes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who tolde me in ſuch manner as themſelues beforetime had beene aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by <hi>Menelaus.</hi> After the flight of the Lady <hi>Helen,</hi> there aſſembled, in the cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings brother <hi>Menelaus,</hi> a puiſſant armie of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who embarking themſelues into <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cria,</hi> and incamping in theyr coaſtes, ſent in ambaſſage to the city <hi>Troy</hi> certayne of theyr chiefe peeres and nobles, amongſt whome, was <hi>Menelaus</hi> brother to the Kyng. Beeyng entered the city, they made clayme of the Lady <hi>Helena,</hi> with the goodes and treaſures ſhee tooke wyth her, requyring alſo a ſufficient ſatiſfaction to be made for the iniurie. Wherevnto the <hi>Troianes</hi> aunſwered, that they ſpente their ſpeech in vaine, to rechallenge eyther women or goodes of them which they neuer ſawe, alledging, that the thyngs they challenged were ſurpriſed by the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> neyther was it reaſon why they ſhoulde beare the faulte of others, and make reſtitution of that which they neuer had. Howbeit, the <hi>Greekes</hi> imagining they had ſpoken it in deriſion, to ſhift off the ſiege for the tyme, bent theyr whole force agaynſt the towne, continuing the ſiege and batterie ſo long, tyll they had brought it to vtter ruyne and ſubuerſion.</p>
            <p>The citie taken, when <hi>Helena</hi> could not be founde, and the ſame aunſwere was rendered the <hi>Graecians</hi> as before, they gaue credite at length to theyr wordes, and ſente <hi>Menelaus</hi> into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the courte of <hi>Protheus,</hi> whether beeyng come, and declaryng the cauſe of hys arriuall to the Kyng, he gaue him greate entertaynemente, reſtoring vnto him hys Lady with all his treaſure, without any manner of loſſe or imbeſelment.

<pb facs="tcp:6434:105"/>
countrey this iniurie for a farewell. For indeuouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence, and wayting a fauourable wynde to fit hys pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by meanes whereof, he ſtayde a long tyme in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> to knowe the ſtate of hys voyage, what fortune ſhould thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betide vnto hym, he tooke two children of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> ſlewe them, and paunched out theyr bowels, whereby to take view of his future ſucceſſe. Which beyng knowne, and percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hymſelfe to be mortally hated and purſued of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauntes, he ſped hym thence into the Iſles of <hi>Africa</hi> lying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againſt them, from whence alſo makyng as good haſte as he coulde, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> heard no more tydyngs of hym. Of all theſe things they were partly informed by the knowledge of hyſtories, beeyng much more certayne of ſuch thyngs as were done in theyr countrey. Thus farre the prieſtes of <hi>Aegypt</hi> proceeding in diſcourſing of <hi>Helena,</hi> whereto I adde thys ſurmize of myne owne, that if <hi>Helena</hi> had beene in <hi>Troy,</hi> no doubt for ought that <hi>Alexander</hi> could haue ſayde or done, <note place="margin">That Queene Helena vvas neuer at Troy.</note> ſhe had beene deliuered to the <hi>Graecians.</hi> For who woulde thynke that Kyng <hi>Pryamus</hi> wyth the reſidue of that lignage were ſo madde, that to the ende <hi>Alexander</hi> might enioy the delighte of hys Lady, would imperill theyr owne lyues and theyr childrens, with the flouriſhing eſtate of ſo famous a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. In whych fond opinion, if in caſe they had bene at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yet vndoubtedly they woulde haue recanted at length when as many valiaunt ſouldyers of the <hi>Troianes,</hi> and two or three of the Kings owne ſonnes, (if any credit may be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the poets) were moſt lamentably ſlaine by the <hi>Graecians</hi> in fight. By theſe things I am driuen to coniecture, that if <hi>Helena</hi> had beene in their keeping, <hi>Pryamus</hi> to rayſe the ſiege from the walles of hys city, woulde willingly haue wrought meanes to reſtore her agayne. Neyther was <hi>Alexander</hi> heyre apparaunt to the crowne, ſo that his father beeyng crooked wyth age, the adminiſtration of the kyngdome ſhoulde reſt in hys gouernemente, one there was betweene hym and home, namely hys brother <hi>Hector,</hi> as well in number of yeares hys elder, as in nobleneſſe of mynde hys better, whome it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not to ſmooth vp his brother in hys filthy leachery, ſeeing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6434:105"/>
ſuch imminent perill to threaten not onely himſelfe, but alſo the whole kyndred and nation of the <hi>Troianes.</hi> But it was the iuſt plague of God inflicted vppon them for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they ſhoulde neyther delyuer <hi>Helena</hi> whome they had not, nor be credyted of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> to whome they fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, to the ende all men myght learne, that they whyche ſtryke wyth the ſwoorde, ſhall be beaten with the ſcabberde, being euermore ſeene, that vpon greeuous iniuries the gods alwayes powre downe greeuous reuengements. Thus much I thought conuenient to ſpeake of mine owne fancye.</p>
            <p>After the deceaſſe of <hi>Protheus, Kampſinitus</hi> tooke vppon hym the rule of the countrey, who in memorie of himſelfe, <note place="margin">Kampſinitus.</note> lefte behynde hym certayne porches of ſtone, planted weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward agaynſt the temple of <hi>Vulcane,</hi> right ouer agaynſt the whych, ſtoode two images of fyue and twentye cubites in length. One of the which ſtandyng northerly, they call ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the other lying to the weſt, they tearme winter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all reaſon and order. This King in aboundance of wealth, and plenty of coyne, ſo farre excelled all thoſe that came after hym, that none coulde go beyonde him, no not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch neere vnto hym in that kynde: wherefore deſirous to poſſeſſe hys goodes in ſafetie, hee builte hym a treaſurie or iewellhouſe of ſtone, one of the walles whereof bounded vpon the outſyde of hys courte. In framing whereof, the workeman <note place="margin">A tale of a cunning theefe.</note> had wrought thys ſubtile conueyance, one ſtone in the wall hee layde in that ſorce, that a man might eaſily at pleaſure plucke it in or out, which notwithſtanding ſerued ſo fittingly to the place, that nothing coulde be diſcerned. When the building was finiſhed, the King cauſed his treaſure to be brought into it, minding henceforth to be ſecure and to lay aſide all feare of miſfortune. In proceſſe of time, this cunning artificer lying at the poynt to dye, called vnto him his two ſonnes, and diſcloſed vnto them in what manner he had prouided for theyr good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, in leauing a ſecret and moſt priuy paſſage into the Kings treaſurie, whereby theyr whole lyfe myght be lead in moſt happy and bleſſed condition. In briefe, hee ſhewed them all that was done by hym, delyuering them the iuſt meaſures
<pb facs="tcp:6434:106"/>

            <p>Theyr father beeing dead, they made no long delay to put in execution theyr determinate purpoſe, but repayring to the court by night, they found the ſtone, which with ſmall force remoouing it from the place, they ſped themſelues wyth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of coyne, and ſo departed. In ſhorte ſpace after the Kyng entering hys treaſurie, and fyndyng the veſſels wherein hys money lay to be ſomewhat decreaſed, was exceedingly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not knowing whome to accuſe, ſeeyng both hys ſeales, whyche he had ſet on the dore, vntouched, and the dore faſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked at hys commyng thyther. Howbeit, repayring ſundrie tymes to beholde hys wealth, and euermore perceyuing that it grewe leſſe and leſſe, deuiſed with hymſelfe to beſet the place where hys money lay with certayne greens or ſnares to entrappe the theefe in. Theſe ſubtile merchaunts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to theyr former wont approching the ſpring head where they had dronke ſo oft before, one of them wente in, and groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for the money, was ſo faſt intangled in a ſnare, that for hys lyfe hee wiſt not how to ſhifte, but ſeeyng hymſelfe in theſe braakes, hee called hys brother, to whome he diſcloſed hys euill happe, willing hym in any wiſe to cut off hys head, leaſt beeyng knowne who hee was, they both myght bee ſerued wyth the ſame ſauce. His brother hearing hys coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle to be good, did as he bade hym, and fitly placing the ſtone as hee founde it, departed home, bearyng wyth hym the head of hys ſlayne brother.</p>
            <p>The nexte day the Kyng opening hys iewell houſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpying and headleſſe theefe ſurpriſed in a ginne, was woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſtonied, ſeeing euery place ſafe, and no way in the world to come in or out at.</p>
            <p>In this quandary, vncertaine what to thynke of ſo ſtraunge an euent, be deuiſed yet to go another way to the wood, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the body of the theefe to be hanged out vppon the walles in

            <p>The Mother of theſe two Breethron not able wyth patiente eyes to beholde the wretched carkaſſe of her piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſonne, called the other brother vnto her, aduiſing him <note place="margin">The affection of a mother.</note> by ſome meanes or other, to take awaye hys brothers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and burie it, threatening moreouer, that in caſe he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to accompliſhe it wyth ſpeede, ſhee woulde open all hys thefte and treacherie to the Kyng. Whome her ſonne endeuouring wyth many woordes to perſuade, and nought auayling (ſo tender was her affection towardes her childe) hee ſet hys wittes abroache to the framing of ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyle conceyte, to beguyle and inueigle the Kyngs watche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

Contraryly, the watchmen geuing hym very fayre and gentle language, hee ſeemed better contented, leadyng aſyde hys Aſſes out of the way to newe girde them, and place his carriage in better order. Manye woordes grewe betweene them whyles he was addreſſing hys Aſſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede on theyr waye, till that one of them bolting foorth a merry ieſt, cauſed hym to laugh hartily, ſo that lyke

a good fellowe, he beſtowed amongſt them a bottle of wyne. Which courteſie they all tooke in very good parte, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hym to ſitte wyth them for companye, and drinke parte of hys owne coſt. Whereto hee willingly conſenting, they dranke a carouſe, euery man hys cannikin, tyll the wyne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to runne of the lyes, whyche thys coapeſmate percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, ſet abroach another bottle, and began to quaffe afreſhe, whyche ſet my keepers on ſuch a tantarra, that beeyng well wetted, they ſet more by three drammes of ſleepe, then ſyxe ounees of witte. When all was huſhe, and the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men faſt aſleepe, hee tooke the bodye of hys brother, and in mockage, ſhauing off the hayre of theyr right cheekes, he returned home, beyng right gladly enterteyned of hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Kyng ſeeyng hys deuiſes no better to proceede, but for ought he coulde imagine the theefe ſtill beguyled hym, waxed woonderous wrath: howbeit, determining to leaue nothing vnattempted, rather then to let ſuch a villayne eſcape ſcotfree, he built yet another trappe to catch the foxe in. He had at that time abiding in hys courte a goodly gentlewoman his onely daughter, whome he tenderly loued from her childhood. This Lady he made of his counſayle, willing her by the duety of a chylde, to a bandon chaſtity for the time, making hirſelfe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtalant for all that would come, on condition they ſhoulde ſweare to tell her the ſubtileſt and the ſinfulleſt prancke that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they had played in all theyr lyfe tyme, and who ſo confeſſed the facts lately atchieued in imbeſileing the Kings treaſure, and ſtealing away the theefe, him to lay hold on, and not ſuffer to depart.</p>
            <p>The gentlewoman obeying her fathers will, kepte open houſe, hauing greate repayre vnto her out of all partes of the countrey. Now the theefe whyche knewe full well to what intente the Kyng had done thys, deſirous to bee at oaſt wyth hys daughter for a nighte, and fearing the daunger that myghte enſue, beeyng of a verie pregnaunt and readie witte, deuiſed yet another ſhifte wherewythall to delude the Kyng: he ſtrake off the hande of hys brother that was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6434:107"/>
dead, and cloſely carying it vnder his cloake, he repayred to the place where the Kings daughter lay, who demaunding hym the queſtion as ſhe had done the reſt, receyued of him this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the ſinfulleſt acte that euer he committed, was to cut off his brothers head, beeing inueigled in a ſnare in the Kings treaſurie, but the ſubtileſt in that he had deceyued a ſort of drouken aſſes, whome the King had appoynted to watch the body. The Lady that had liſtned to his tale, hearing the newes ſhe longed for, ſtretched out her hand to lay hold on him, who ſubtilly preſenting her with the hande of his brother, (which beeing darke, ſhe faſt griped in ſtead of his owne) hee conueyed himſelfe from her and was no more ſeene. The King heereof aduertiſed, was ſtricken with ſo great admiration as well of his wit in deuiſing, as his boldneſſe in aduenturing, that forthwith he cauſed notice to be geuen throughout all partes of his gouernment, that in caſe the party whiche had done theſe thinges. woulde diſcloſe himſelfe, and ſtande to his mercy, he woulde not only yeeld him free pardon, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and honour him with ſo princely rewards as were fit for a perſon of ſuch excellent wiſedome. My yonker yeelding cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to the Kings promiſe, came foorth in preſence, and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe, with whome <hi>Kampſinitus</hi> ioyning his daughter in mariage, did him the greateſt honour he could deuiſe, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him for the wiſeſt man that liued vpon the earth, holding it for certayne, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> excelled all others in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, amongſt whome he iudged none comparable to hym. The ſame King (ſay they) whiles he was yet liuing, trauelled ſo farre vnder the ground, till he came to the place which the <note place="margin">Kampſinitus iourney to hel.</note> 
               <hi>Graecians</hi> call the ſeates infernall, where he played at dyce with the goddeſſe <hi>Ceres,</hi> and ſometimes winning ſometimes loſing, he returned againe at length, beeing rewarded by her with a mantle of gold. In the meane ſpace while <hi>Kampſinitus</hi> vndertooke this voyage to hell, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> kept holyday, prolonging the celebration till ſuch time as he retyred backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which ſolemne obſeruance, ſince our memory hath bene duely celebrated. But whether this be the cauſe of that ſacred feſtiuall, I dare not auowe, howbeit, the prieſts ſhewed me a

certayne cloake, wouen in the ſpace of one daye, wherewith once ayeare they attyre ſome one of theyr petie vicares, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreouer hys eyes wyth a myter. Beeing in thys ſorte attyred, they conduct hym to the hygh way that leadeth to the temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Ceres,</hi> where after they haue placed hym, they leaue hym grabling in that place, and departe their waye.

For myne owne parte I haue thought it meete to make relation of ſuch things as I heard amongſt them, going no farther in many thyngs then he areſay.</p>
            <p>Amiddeſt the infernall powers, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> affyrme that <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Liber</hi> haue the chiefe authoritie.</p>

The <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> likewiſe mention that to the tyme of <hi>Kampſinitus,</hi> religion, iuſtice, and true order of gouernement greatly flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed among them.</p>
            <p>After whome, the royall dignitie came into the handes of <hi>Cheops,</hi> a man fraught with all kynde of vicious demeanour, <note place="margin">Cheops.</note> and wicked conuerſation. For cauſing the temples of the gods to be faſt locked vp, he gaue out through all quarters of hys Empyre, that it myght not be lawfull for any <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> to offer ſacrifice, to the ende, that beeing ſeduced front

the ſeruice and reuerence of the gods, he might ſecurely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in hys owne affayres. Some were appoynted to digge ſtones in the mountayne <hi>Arabicus,</hi> and from thence, to conuey them to the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> where they were receyued of others which pheryed them ouer the riuer to the roote of a greate hill named <hi>Africus.</hi> The whole number of thoſe that were conuerſaunt in the Kings affayres, was tenne thouſande men, ſeruing by turnes, euery three monethes a thouſand. In which manner, he helde the people the ſpace of tenne yeares, in all whiche tyme, they did nothyng but hewe and cary ſtones, a labour of no leſſe importaunce (in my iudgemente) then to haue built the pyre it ſelfe, or towre of ſtone, which is in length fiue furlongs, in breadth tenne paces, and in height where it is greateſt, to the number of eyght paces, beeyng framed of ſtone, euriouſly carued and ingrauen with the pictures of beaſtes. Heerein alſo were conſumed other tenne yeares, <note place="margin">The building of the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> cauſing certayne chambers to be cut out vnder the grounde, vndermining the ſtoneworke vpon the which the towres were founded, whyche hee prouided for hys ſepulcher. The ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heere of was in a ſmall Ilande, through the whyche by a trench or ſmall draught, he cauſed the riuer to haue paſſage. The pyre was made ſtearewiſe, aſcending by ſteppes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees orderly placed one aboue another.</p>
            <p>Hauyng in ſuche ſorte finiſhed the lower worke, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed certayne engines or wreſtes to heaue vp ſtones from the grounde to the fyrſt ſtayre, and from thence to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, and ſo conſequently tyll they came to the place where the ſtone ſhoulde lye, hauyng vppon each ſtayre a wreaſt: or (that whyche is more likely) vſing one for all, beeyng framed of lyght wood, to the intente it might the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be remooued.</p>
            <p>The groſſe worke finiſhed, they began to poliſhe and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the towre from the toppe downewardes, comming laſt of all to the neathermoſt ſtayre, wherein they made a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ende and concluſion of the beautie and grace of all theyr woorkemanſhippe. In thys pyre, were intayled

certayne letters in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> language, declaring the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the King was at in the time of his building, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If this were ſo, how much ſhal we deeme to haue bene ſpent vpon other things, as vpon tooles, engins, victuals, labouring garments for the workemen, being tenne yeares buſied in theſe affayres? I recken not the time wherein they were held in framing and hewing of ſtones to ſet them in a readineſſe for the mayne worke: neyther all the ſpace that paſſed ouer in the conueyance and cariage of the ſtone to the place of building, which was no ſmall numbers of dayes, as alſo the time which was conſumed in vndermining the earth, and cutting out of chambers vnder the grounde, all whyche things draue the King to ſuch a narrow ſtraight, that he was fayne to cloute out his deuiſes with a moſt wicked inuention, which was this: Perceiuing his golden mine to draw low that the diuell might daunce in the bottome of his bagge and finde neuer a croſſe, he made ſale of his daughters honeſtie, willing hir to entertayne tagge and ragge all that would come, in caſe they refuſed not to pay for their pleaſure, ſithence <hi>Venus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth not the deuotion of ſuch as pray with empty hands and threadbare purſſes.

This prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſurpaſſe all that had bene before him, left in memorie of himſelfe an excellente pyre built all of clay, wherein was a ſtone ſet ingrauen in theſe wordes: <hi>Compare me not to the reſt of the pyres, which I ſurmount as farre as Iupiter excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the meaner gods, for ſearching the bottome of the riuer with a ſcoupe, looke what clay they brought vp, the ſame they employed to the building of me in ſuch forme and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as you may beholde.</hi> And this did <hi>Aſychis</hi> imagine to aduance the fame of himſelfe to the time to come.</p>
            <p>After whome, the ſcepter was held by one <hi>Anyſis</hi> a blynde man, inhabiting in a city called after his owne name <hi>Anyſis.</hi> In time of whoſe raigne, <hi>Sabbacus</hi> King of <hi>Aethyopia</hi> inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Anyſis the next King.

If any of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> made a treſpaſſe, he neuer vſed to do any man to death for his offence, but according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his fault, to enioyne him to arrere &amp; make higher by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine ſupply of earth and ſtone, ſome parte of the city wherein he dwelt, for which cauſe, the cities became very high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, being much more loftely ſituated then before. For firſt of all in time of <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> ſuch earth as was caſt out of the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (which were made to geue the water a courſe to the cities that were farre off) was employed to the eleuation &amp; aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the lowe townes, and now agayne vnder this <hi>Aethyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> they had increaſe of freſh earth, and grew to be very high and lofty. Amongſt the reſt, the noble city of <hi>Bubaſtis</hi> ſeemeth <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the temple of Diana.</note> to be very haughty &amp; highly planted, in which city is a temple of excellent memory dedicate to the goddeſſe <hi>Bubaſtis,</hi> called in our ſpeach <hi>Diana,</hi> then the which, albeit there be other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches both bigger and more richly furniſhed, yet for the ſightly grace and ſeemelyneſſe of building, there is none comparable vnto it. Beſides, the very entrance and way that leadeth into the city, the reſt is informe of an Ilande, incloſed round about with two ſundry ſtreames of the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> which runne to either ſide of the path way, and leauing as it were a lane or cauſey betweene them, without meeting, take their courſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Theſe armes of the floud are eache of them an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foote broade, beſet on both ſides the banckes with fayre braunched trees, ouerſhadowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waters with a coole &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſhade.

The temple it ſelfe ſituate in the middeſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city, is euermore in ſight to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paſſe to and fro.

Round about the which goeth a wall ingrauen with figures &amp; protraitures of ſundry beaſts.

From the entrance of the temple Eaſtward, there is a fayre large cauſey leading to the houſe of <hi>Mercury,</hi> in length, three furlongs, and foure acres broade, all of faire ſtone, &amp; hemmed in on each ſide with a courſe of goodly call trees planted by the hands of men, and thus as touching the deſcription of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> temple.

The roomes and lodgings therein conteyned, are of two ſorts, ſome lower, wrought cellar wiſe vnder the ground, other aboue theſe, being together in number three thouſand and ſixe hundred.

On the toppe of ech towre is a great image wrought of ſtone, ſitting in a chaire of maieſtie, ſo that the towres conteyne in heigth an hundreth paces.

And theſe were the meanes whereby <hi>Pſammitichus</hi> obteyned the dominiou of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> As touching the oracle or ſeate of prophecie, we haue made many wordes, and will make more, as of a thing moſt worthy to be mentioned. This oracle is planted in the temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Latona</hi> in a great city named <hi>Butis</hi> ſtanding againſt the mouth of <hi>Nilus</hi> which is called <hi>Sebenniticum,</hi> into the which they haue entry that from the vpper parte of the ſea cut againſt the ſtreame. In this city alſo are the temples of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and the great pallace of <hi>Latona,</hi> wherein is the place of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uination, hauing a gallery belonging to it tenne paces high. Heerein ſuche things as might lawfully be ſeene, and deſerued greateſt admiration, of thoſe I meane to make report. In this temple of <hi>Latona</hi> is a ſmall chappell framed of one ſtone, whoſe walles beeing of equall heigth, were in length forty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites: which ſemblably was coped ouer the top with another ſtone, beeing foure cubites in thickeneſſe. Wherefore of all thoſe things that were pertayning to the temple, there was nothing that deſerued greater woonder then this little chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Next to this is an Ilande called <hi>Echemmis</hi> ſtanding in the middeſt of a deepe and wide lake a little beſides the chiefe <note place="margin">An Iland that ſvvimmeth.</note> temple, whiche the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſuppoſe to ſwimme and to be borne vp of the waters. Howbeit, I neither ſawe it ſwimme nor mooue, maruayling very much (if it were true) that an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhould be caryed in the waters. In this Ile is planted the

temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> a greate and ſumptuous building, lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe three rewes of aultares, and many fayre palme-trees, ſome very kynde and bearing fruite, other fruiteleſſe and barren.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> alſo render a cauſe of the ſwimming of this Ilande, ſaying thus: that at what time <hi>Latona</hi> (which is one of the eyght ſaints that are of greateſt antiquity amongſt them) dwelt in the city of <hi>Butis</hi> whereas nowe the oracle is helde: ſhe tooke the ſauegard of <hi>Apollo</hi> commended vnto her <note place="margin">Iſis, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Apollo</note> by his mother <hi>Iſis,</hi> and preſerued hys lyfe in the ſame Ilande, beeyng at that tyme ſtedfaſt and immoueable, when as <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> made ſo diligente ſearche in all places to finde out the ſonne of <hi>Oſyris.</hi> For heere we muſt vnderſtande, that thys people imagine <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> to be the children of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius</hi> and <hi>Iſis,</hi> and that <hi>Latona</hi> was but theyr nourſe and bringer vp, that delyuered them from perill. <hi>Apollo</hi> in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> tongue is called <hi>Horus. Ceres</hi> hath the name of <hi>Iſis: Diana,</hi> of <hi>Bubaſtis,</hi> from whence <hi>Aeſchilus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Euphorion</hi> drew his opinion, which alone of all the reſt of the poets maketh <hi>Diana</hi> daughter to <hi>Ceres,</hi> after which euent, the Ile (ſay they) became looſe, and was marked to floate and mooue in the water.</p>

Wherefore, hauing attayned to the kingdome, which of the gods ſoeuer had acquited him of theft, he had no regard to their temples, did no honour to them, gaue no gyftes, offered no ſacrifice, eſteeming them vnworthy of any reuerence, hauing geuen out a falſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite. And ſuch as had pronounced him guilty, to theſe as to the moſt true gods, whoſe Oracles were agreeable to iuſtice, hee perfourmed the greateſt honour hee coulde deuiſe.
