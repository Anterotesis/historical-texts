         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I beseech thee to <hi>send him</hi> at this time vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to let thy people goe, for this is a worke worthy his paines. I know, some later Writers reiect this interpretation, but their exceptions against the ancient Interpreters are not concludent, and therefore not to be admitted, especially when the better sort of later Writers, with whom I accord, doe imbrace the interpretation of the Ancients. Againe, although God had sent <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> on as great an Embassage as this of <hi>Moses,</hi> He was <hi>sent</hi> as <hi>a Messenger to prepare the wayes of the Lord;</hi> yet hee doth not affect, but doth vtterly disclaime this title of being <hi>him, whom GOD hath sent,</hi> as knowing it to be peculiar vnto the Sauiour of the World: for so hee speakes of him, in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto himselfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 34. <hi>For hee whom GOD</hi>

Vnto this question or demand, beeing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire tenor of <hi>Iohns</hi> solemne Embassage, and the summe of all which hee desires to know concerning Christ, our Sauiour vouchsafes no other answere than what hath beene read vnto you; <hi>Iesus answered,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now if wee consider that ample testimony which our Sauiour in the words following my Text, did giue of <hi>Iohn</hi> in the audience of the multitude; <hi>to wit,</hi> that hee was a <hi>Prophet, yea, and more than a Prophet,</hi> that of all that <hi>were borne of women, there was none greater than Iohn:</hi> Charity and Christian modesty will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine vs to presume, that this question, <hi>Art thou hee that should come, or doe wee looke for another?</hi> beeing thus solemnely by <hi>Iohn</hi> proposed, was no idle but a serious and vsefull question; fit not onely for him, but for posterity to be resolued in. Againe, if wee consider that this answer which I haue read vnto you, was made by our blessed Sauiour, wee stand bound vpon our allegiance to beleeue, that as the question

               <hi>Iustin Martir</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> were not afraid to say and deliuer in writing to posterity, that <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe did at this time truely doubt and distrust, whether he, that wrought these miracles here mentioned in my Text, were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Seede or no; and that out of this doubt or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust in himselfe, he sent this message vnto our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Art thou he that should come, or doe we looke for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7861:7"/>
formerly bin endued, <hi>(to prepare the wayes of this his Lord)</hi> as great flames draw flying sparkles to them, or sucke out the lesser lights or candles that are neere them. As if <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> himselfe, when hee said, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet illum crescere, me autem decrescere,</hi> had vnwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or otherwise prophecyed, that the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phefie should decrease in him, as it did increase or more amply manifest it selfe in our Sauiour. Yet this interpretation, I must tell you, though auouched by two of the most ancient Fathers, whose writings are now extant, is slenderly seconded by later Writers, whether of Romish, or reformed Religion. <hi>Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> a learned Iesuite, doth thus censure them, or rather the times wherein they liued; <hi>In illa nimirum aetate, nondum satis culta theologia hujusmodi spinas aliquando proferebat:</hi> that is, that goodly garden of God, which we call <hi>Diuinity, was not in that age so well dressed, but that it did sometimes bring forth such thornes and bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as these were.</hi> Should the best of our Writers or Preachers speake on this fashion of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Romish Church would take it as a sufficient testimony to condemne vs for Heretickes. Howbeit we will not condemne it, as an heresie in her Children for speaking or writing thus, but rather wish they would be constant to themselues, and vnpartiall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs; to permit vs that liberty, which they take in refusing the authority of the most Ancient Fathers, especially in the interpretation of Scriptures. Others there were, and these very ancient too, which disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Iustin Martyr's</hi> and <hi>Tertullians</hi> interpretation of this place, would qualifie it thus; <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist did not question nor doubt, whether Iesus whom hee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7861:7"/>
had baptized, were the Sonne of God, the promised and long expected Messias or no, but <hi>vtrum esset ad inferos descensurus, whether he were to taste of death him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or whether hee would come to rescue the dead from the power of Hell and the graue. Et in hanc sententiam</hi> (saith the same <hi>Maldonat) maxima pars veterum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesserunt: the greatest part of the Ancient Fathers were</hi> (by his confession) <hi>of this opinion, concerning the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this place.</hi> But will he therefore subscribe vnto them, or rest vpon their interpretation? No; he hath no reason so to do, seeing the Fathers themselues did follow this interpretation, because as then, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was found out. We haue gained thus much from this learned Iesuite for some after disputes, that latter ages may finde out some better exposition of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall passages of Scripture, than most of the best &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest Fathers knew.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What then is that better exposition of this place, whereunto he and most of his fellowes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe? It is this: <hi>Iohn</hi> did not moue this question out of any doubt or distrust of his owne, but onely for the better instruction of his Disciples, in whom he could hardly beget any true conceit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> estimate of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours worth. So factious they were for their Master, that they disdained or enuyed, that our Sauiour should haue more followers then hee had. So it is storied, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 25, 26. <hi>There arose a question between some of Iohns Disciples and the Iewes about purifying: and they came vnto Iohn and said vnto him, Rabbi, Hee that was with thee beyond Iordane, to whom thou barest witnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the same baptizeth, and all men come vnto him.</hi> Now seeing <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the Authors of this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7861:8"/>
thinke, could not asswage this humour in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (which he earnestly labours in the fore-cited place) but the more he debased himselfe in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, the more worthy they thought him of greater honour: hee therefore now sends them vnto Christ himselfe, whose instructions being graced with miracles, hee presumed would bee more effectuall in them, than all the exhortations he could bestow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The maine streame of later Interpreters, as well Protestants as Papists, runne this way. And if the question did arise from distrust or diffidence, these imperfections were in all likelihood more incident to the affectionate Schollers, than to the sanctified and prudent Master.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Others there be, but not so many to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, as to make a few, which would deriue the former question, <hi>Art thou he that should come, &amp;c?</hi> not from any doubt, much lesse from any diffidence or distrust either in <hi>Iohn,</hi> or in his disciples; but rather from ioy of heart in <hi>Iohn,</hi> as if it were rather, <hi>vox ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultantis vel iubilantis, quam dubitantis.</hi> And it cannot be denyed, but that men oft-times make patheticall expressions as well of present ioy as of dislike or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content by way of Interrogation. Thus honest house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers or hearty Hoasts will sometimes welcome their gratefull and long expected guests with this or the like salutation, <hi>Are you come?</hi> when they cannot truely doubt whether they are come or no, if they will beleeue their own senses. We see the wisest men not apt to giue swift credence vnto extraordinary good newes, lest their sorrow should proue greater, if the report should proue false. And naturally, when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7861:8"/>
excessiue ioy either springeth too fast, or groweth too rancke, wee seeke to allay or snip it by a fictitious or imaginary distrust of those truthes whence it groweth, of which we cannot make any reall or constant doubt. So he saith in the Poet,</p>

            <p n="8">8. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt from what disposition soeuer the former question, <hi>Art thou he that should come, &amp;c.</hi> did arise, whether from ioy or exultation in <hi>Iohn,</hi> or from distrust or diffide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in his Disciples, or partly from the one, and partly from the other; (nor are the diuers opinions concerning this point, incompatibly opposite:) there yet remaineth a question of greater difficulty and of farre more vsefull enquiry, for right vnfolding the contents and pith of my Text. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is this, <hi>How this answere of our Sauiour could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly either confirme or ratifie Iohns former beliefe of Christs person, office, or actions, or adde any increase to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or comfort, or lastly giue any part of satisfaction to the distrust or diffidence of his Disciples;</hi> seeing there is nothing more contained in this answere, than <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Disciples vndoubtedly knew before. For so it is said in the second verse of this Chapter; When <hi>Iohn</hi> being in prison had heard the workes of Christ, he sent two of his Disciples, and said vnto him; <hi>Art thou hee that should come, or doe wee looke for another?</hi> Now what workes done by Christ could <hi>Iohn</hi> heare of in Prison, which were not truely miraculous, which were not the very same with those, which our Sauiour
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7861:9"/>
in my Text informeth <hi>Iohn</hi> to haue bin wrought by him, as <hi>restoring of the blinde to their sight, the lame to their limbes, the sicke to health, the dumbe to speech, the dead to life, &amp;c?</hi> And that which most increaseth the difficulty, amongst other workes of Christ, which, <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples being present (as it seemes by Saint <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>verse</hi> 27.) relate vnto him, his raising vp of the widdowes sonne of <hi>Naim</hi> from death to life to the great astonishment of the spectators, was one. Now who did euer knowe a man truely dead, as this widdowes sonne was, who was not withall more than deafe, more than dumbe, more than blinde of both his eyes, more than lame of armes and legs, of feete and hands? Wherefore, in as much as Iohn knew before, that Christ had <hi>raised him vp that was dead, and made him sit vp, and speake, and deliuered him to his Mother;</hi> he could not be ignorant, that he had made one that was more than dumbe to speake, one that was more then halt to goe, one that was more than blind to see. What satisfaction then could this answer giue either to <hi>Iohn</hi> or to his Disciples, both of whom knowing thus much before; especially seeing the one of them at least, as most Interpreters thinke did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust or doubt, whether Christ (notwithstanding all this) were <hi>He that should come;</hi> and both of them could not but expect some ratification or confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their former beliefe from his answer?</p>
            <p>For cleering this difficulty or exception, we are to examine these two poynts. <note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Quere, proposed Parag. 3.</note>

Thus much they manifestly include, if wee rightly make the deductions, according to the true Logicall extent of their naturall sence. For although it bee a rule most infallible, that the truth of an indefinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position may be salued or supported by the truth of one particular; as if a man should bargaine with a day-laborer, promising him in these indefinite termes, <hi>to giue him so much for his worke, as other neighbours did,</hi> though some of them gaue twelue pence, some tenne pence, and others but eight pence: the Law would vpon these termes or agreements award him no more than eight pence, because it can constraine the hyrer onely to make good his couenant to the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and his couenant is performed, if he make his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise true. Now, if but one or two Neighbours giue but eight pence, and he giueth as much, it is euident he giueth as much as his Neighbours do, &amp; this is enough to salue the truth of his promise, according to Law and Logicke: although to vse the benefit of eyther to a poore mans preiudice, would ill beseeme a man of better note and fashion. In like manner, although our

But though it be certaine that an indefinite proposition is oft-times true, if one or two particulars be true, yet oft-times such indefinite speeches include a multitude of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and sometimes an vniuersality or the whole number of all the particulars, which the words can lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally comprehend or signifie. As for example, if a man should bid his friend take heed how he deals; for the world is naught, and men are cunning: no man would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue his meaning to be, that there were but one or two naughty or cunning men in the world: but rather that the world were in a manner full of them; and that no Society or Corporation were free from such men. Againe, if a man should aduise his friend not to rely vpon mens words in matters of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, without some reall assurance, because men are mortall; no man would conceiue his meaning to bee, that this or that man were mortall, but that all were mortall.</p>

Not one man throughout all the Land so deafe, so dumbe, or lame, but that if their friends would haue brought them vnto him, and haue supplicated for them, being not able to supplicate for themselues, they might haue had their perfit hearing, their speech or limbes restored vnto them.

Finally, the whole glory and pompe of warre, when they are at the height, and at the best, are but like a bright and furious flame, which must be continually nourished with mans bloud, as a Lampe is with Oyle, or the Fire with Wood. The best warre that euer was vndertaken, was but <hi>malum necessarium.</hi> It was well obserued by the wiser sort of Heathen, that no warre was euer iust, but when it was necessary. And, as another saith, <hi>Bellum gerimus vt pace fruamur,</hi> The only right vse and end of warre is to procure an honourable and secure peace. If such peace may be had without warre, they are but fooles and vnhappy men, vnfit members of the world, that will vndertake warre and kindle dissentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Nation and Nation.

Then, said hee, I will conquer the Gaules and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; and when hee had done with them, hee would bend his forces against Africa. But when you haue conquered them, and as many more as you intend to conquer, what doe you last resolue vpon? His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, to liue merrily and at ease, in plenty and pleasure. Why, quoth the Philosopher, this you may doe already, without eyther hazard of your owne, or your followers liues: for none of these Nations which you intend to vanquish, are likely to indanger you, so you will not begin with them. The present Nation of the Iewes were of <hi>Pirrhus</hi> his temper, and sought after that, as it were by a <hi>round</hi> or <hi>circle,</hi> which was in a manner put into their hands, so they would but haue looked neere about them, and not haue set their proud imaginations vpon such rouing proiects as <hi>Pirrhus</hi> did.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7861:13"/>
some good Preachers, and may exercise the wit of a good Interpreter. First, how could the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which were farre more than a maior part of all Nations (here intimated) be said at that time to <hi>desire</hi> him, in whom they did not in any sort beleeue, whom they did not at all expect? For how should they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him, how should they beleeue in him, of whom they had not heard? The Iewish Nation indeed or seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> had heard of him, and did expect him, and yet as the Prophet had fore-told, so it came to passe, <hi>that when they saw him, they saw no beautie in him, that they should desire him. Esay</hi> 53. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. And was it possible, that hee should be the <hi>desire of all Nations,</hi> whom no Nation did desire? Yes. In as much as God had consecrated <hi>him</hi> to be the onely Fountaine of that <hi>happinesse,</hi> which all men, which all Nations naturally doe desire, and which is all that any man of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soeuer, Iew, Gentile, Greeke or Barbarian can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; he is truely instiled by the Prophet, <hi>The desire of all Nations.</hi> To say, that as many as desired happinesse, did desire our Sauiour Christ, can seeme no paradoxe, if wee consider (what no Philosopher will deny) that euen such as follow poysoned pleasures, seeke after happinesse and life in these by-paths, which leade to death and misery. Though most men take the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to death and misery, yet no man desires to dye or to be miserable, but their contraries.</p>
            <p n="13">13. So that our Sauiours answere, though it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med doubtfull in the premises, is in conclusion as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as if hee had directly and expresly said: Goe, tell <hi>Iohn</hi> that I am hee that was to come, and that you are not to expect another, seeing whatsoeuer you can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7861:13"/>
or desire in any one or more, whom you may <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> imagine yet to come, <hi>That</hi> you may haue in mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: for true blessednesse is all that you or any man can desire, <hi>and Blessed is Hee whosoeuer shall not bee offended in mee. Matth.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Esay</hi> 53. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. But though <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Disciples could desire no more of him that was to come, than to bee truely blessed in him: yet might they desire some further proofe than his bare assertion or authority, that they might be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessed in him. For this blessednesse whereof hee speaketh, was none of those things which they did heare or see, seeing it cannot be knowne by corporall sight or hearing. It is like that new name spoken of in the Reuelation, <hi>which no man can reade, but he which hath it.</hi> All this is true, yet not withstanding all this, the things which they did heare &amp; see, were vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pledges &amp; visible assurances of this inuisible bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse which heere hee promiseth, and of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man might haue vndoubted experience in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so he would not be offended in him. For though our Sauiour with farre better reason might, yet did he neuer exact such absolute beliefe vnto his words, as the Pope or visible Church of Rome doe to theirs, to whatsoeuer they shall decree, without eyther expresse warrant or testimony of Gods Word written before, or experimentall knowledge in themselues. This will better appeare in the second poynt proposed, which was, <hi>what these words did intimate or suggest to Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poynts now to be inquired after, are two:</p>
            <p n="1">[1.] First, what is it to be blessed and happy in Christ, or wherein this happinesse or blessednesse which here he promiseth, doth consist.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:7861:14"/>
[2.] Secondly, how these particulars here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>the blinde receiue their sight, the lame walke, &amp;c.</hi> doe induce or inferre this vniuersall conclusion, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is hee whosoeuer is not offended in mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. The former will draw the later after it: and in <note place="margin">Wherein the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised doth consist.</note> discussion of the former, I must craue pardon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the opinions of such of the Heathen as sought to bee wiser than the rest (that is, of their Philosophers) concerning <hi>happinesse</hi> or <hi>felicity.</hi> Not that I rely vpon their saying or authorities; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the probleme proposed is generall, <hi>to wit,</hi> [what satisfaction this answere could giue to any vnpartiall Auditor, whether Iew or Gentile:] I must giue such satisfaction as is fittest to such perhaps as are too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much addicted vnto the Philosophy of the Heathen. Besides, it will be a good meanes for vs to finde out the right and safe way, if wee shall obserue where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue gone wrong, or plunged themselues.</p>
            <p>To the former. The very name or common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of blessednesse, happinesse, or felicity, doth import as much as <hi>[Summum bonum] the chiefe or supreme good,</hi> or Crowne of goodnesse; That, (as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which all men naturally doe desire, and which is all, that any man can desire, That which is onely able to satiate al the desires or appetites of the humane soule. It is agreed vpon as well by the wisest of the Heathens, as of Christians, that <hi>[bonum]</hi> &amp; <hi>[appetibile]</hi> are termes conuertible; <hi>that is,</hi> They mutually fit the one the other, as the measure and the thing measured; whatsoeuer is good, is desirable; and whatsoeuer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable; is good to the party which desires it, at least as for the present he stands affected: and that onely is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7861:14"/>
truely good which ought to be desired. For the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> of our desires, the Heathens went thus farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, [That the desires of sense, or the inferiour part of the soule, were to be guided and directed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:] We Christians know, that euen reason it selfe must be regulated by the Word of God, or rule of faith; otherwise it will outray farther in its desires, then sence, without the check or controule of reason, could doe. The things which we may desire, are of three sorts:</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <label>1</label>
                  <item>Profitable,</item>
                  <label>2</label>
                  <item>Pleasant, or</item>
                  <label>3</label>
                  <item>Honest.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>All these three branches of Goodnesse, or rather these seuerall sorts of good things are required vnto true happines; yet so, as true happines or the chiefe good consists properly in the fruit of the third branch or stemme, to wit, of <hi>Bonum Honestum,</hi> in its full growth or maturitie. This chiefe or prime good is not onely desired for it selfe and for no other end, but it is the end for which all things else, whether they be inferiour branches of <hi>Bonum Honestum, Vertue</hi> or <hi>honesty,</hi> or whether they are pleasant or profitable, are desired. Euery branch of <hi>Bonum Honestum,</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>honesty,</hi> though it be to be desired for the chiefe and prime good, yet is it to be desired in it selfe, and for it selfe; so to be desired for it selfe, that we must bee content to loppe off all the other branches of pleasure and profit, rather than hinder the growth of this. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is great gaine,</hi> and it hath bin an old Prouerbe amongst you, <hi>It is a good sport to bee honest.</hi> The issue of that sport, delight, or gaine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7861:15"/>
our growth in godlinesse or honesty may be preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, is losse and griefe. Things pleasant are to bee desired in themselues, and for themselues; yet so farre onely, and at such seasons, as their desire may not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pursuite of things good and honest. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of these latter, must giue bounds or limits to the desire of the former. Things pleasant may be desired in greater measure, than for themselues they can bee desired, in case they bring aduantage to the course of <hi>honesty,</hi> of <hi>piety</hi> or <hi>vertue.</hi> Things meerely profitable, are not desireable at all for themselues or in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but onely so farre as they are conducent to the purchase of delights lawfull and honest, or of honesty it selfe. For which reason, <hi>profit,</hi> as the more iudicious Schoole-men determine, is no true and proper branch of goodnes, nor are things meerely profitable, truely and inherently good, but good onely by extrinsecall denominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or by accident. Of this ranke is Physick, which no man desires for it selfe, or in such manner or measure as he desires wholsome foode; it is in its nature distastfull to sense, yet to be desired as a means for procuring health, which all men desire for it selfe, because it is truely good and pleasant, and yet withall to be desired, as a meanes profitable for the exercise of piety, and performance of vertuous actions: of this ranke likewise is that which most men, vpon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour, most of all desire, to wit, <hi>gold</hi> or <hi>coyne,</hi> or other externals, before we haue occasion to vse them. These are not good in themselues, saue onely with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the procuring of things pleasant or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. In Countries wherein gold is not by custome referred to this vse, men esteeme it no more than <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops</hi>

               </gap>inent to our present purpose is that diuision of goodnes or good things which the Philosophers haue made vnto our hands in this very argument whereof we treat. For vnto <hi>felicity</hi> or true <hi>happines,</hi> they require a threefold ranke or order of good things. The first was (as they call them) <hi>[Bona fortunae,] the goods of fortune,</hi> which we call means and maintenance, as monies, lands, goods, possessions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenews, or whatsoeuer other externals. The second, <hi>[bona corporis]</hi> as <hi>health, strength, agility, beauty or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of body.</hi> The third was <hi>[bona animi,]</hi> the <hi>endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the soule or mind,</hi> which they comprehended vnder the names of <hi>vertue</hi> morall and intellectuall: of whose seuerall parts some did answere in proportion vnto health or welfare of the body, as Iustice, Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Temperance, in which the health of the soule did euen in their iudgement more specially consist, as the strength or agility of the soule did consist in valour, wit, or resolution. As for Arts and sciences, these they accounted as the attire, or externall comelinesse of the soule. Their chiefest errours in these disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, that they thought (at least some of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7861:16"/>
of them) that this felicity or happines might bee compleat in this life. Howbeit some of them did thinke, that no man was to be accounted or adiudged happy before his death. Not that these men, for ought we can gather, did hope for any extraordinary happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse after death; but that such happines or prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as man is capable of in this life, and such as they obserued some men to enjoy, was so brickle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, as no man could safely passe his sentence of them whether they were happy or no, vntill they had finished their course of life. But the greatest errour in this argument (wherewith the greatest Philosopher himselfe was ouertaken) was, that this happinesse might be attained vnto by good education, or by the wit and industry of man: for he denyeth it to be the free gift of God. But we Christians beleeue &amp; know, that if all good things be the gift of God, then the chiefe or supreme good must bee the extraordinary and speciall gift of God. And yet withall wee must consider, that God who giueth all good things freely, neuer casteth such precious pearles as this vnto swine Although it cannot be purchased by mans industrie, yet God giueth it only to the industrious, only to such as seeke after it with the best faculties and indeuours of their soules, content to forgoe all things else, for the purchase of it. But of this hereafter.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Yet heerein <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers were more orthodoxall, than some rigid Stoicall Christians, in that they thoght no man could be truely happy without health of body, or whilest he continued in want &amp; penury, much lesse whilest he continued in such paines and torments as: Regulus or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7861:16"/>
other like vertues or good patriots did endure rather <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> then they would wrong their conscience or vndoe their Countrie. He that shall accuse these Heathens as carnally minded in this, considereth not, that in thus accusing them, he condemneth the generation of the iust. Our Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had greater peace of conscience, than <hi>Regulus</hi> or any other <hi>Roman</hi> could haue. That part of happines which consisteth in the health and welfare or other endowments of the soule, was as compleat and perfect in him during this life, as any man, whilest cloathed with mortality, can expect: yet saith he of himselfe, and others, euen of all that were alike minded as he was; <hi>If in this life onely wee haue hope in Christ, wee are of all men most miserable;</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. vers. 19. What occasions soeuer other good Christians of these times had to ioyne with him in this complaint; his owne occasions, to speake, to thinke and write, as heere he doth, are else-where by him specified at large, and are most iust. <hi>Are they Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ? I speake as a foole, I am more: in labours more abundant, in stripes aboue measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft: of the Iewes fiue times receiued 1 forty stripes saue one; Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwracke: a night and a day haue I bin in the deepe, In iournying often, In perils of waters, In perils of robbers, in perils by my owne Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in perils by heathen, in perils in the City, in perils in the Wildernesse, in perils in the Sea, in perils among false brethren: In wearines and painefulnes, in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakednes. Besides those things which are without, that which commeth vpon mee dayly, the care of all the</hi>

               <hi>Churches; who is weake, and I am not weake? who is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and I burne not?</hi> 2. Cor. Cap. 11. vers. 23. to the 30.</p>
            <p n="17">17. These grieuances of bodie and perplexities of minde were of themselues rather branches or degrees of misery than of felicity; things in their own nature not to be desired but auoyded, as being in that ranke of euils which we call <hi>[malu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poenae,]</hi> such as all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or chastisements, whether iustly or iniustly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, are. For whatsoeuer is contrary to that which is truely <hi>good,</hi> must needs be so farre truely <hi>euill,</hi> as it is contrary vnto that, which is in its nature <hi>good.</hi> Now all <hi>[malu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poenae]</hi> that is, all punishments, chastisements, or bodily grieuances, are directly contrary to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch of <hi>goodnesse</hi> fore-mentioned, which the Schooles call <hi>[Bonum Iucundum,]</hi> the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of lawfull pleasure, of harmelesse delight, of blamelesse ease or contentment, all which are degrees or branches of felicity. But though these grieuances before mentioned by our Apostle, were in themselues truely euill, yet was it good for him, as it is for all men else, to suffer them for the Gospels sake, or for the confirmation of others faith. Both parts of this true doctrine or assertion are auouched by the same Apostle, Heb. 12. vers. 11. <hi>No chastening for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent seemeth to be ioyous but grieuous; neuerthelesse after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it yeeldeth the peaceable fruites of righteousnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them which are exercised thereby.</hi> So that no chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or bodily grieuance, which befalleth vs for Christ's or the Gospel's sake, is so true or great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in one sense, as it is good in another, to wit, in the first ranke of goodnes before mentioned, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7861:17"/>
or vsefull. All persecutions, whether in body, <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> goods, or name, haue the same reference or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto the soule, or to its welfare, health and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, that bitter and vnpleasant Phisicke hath vnto the body. Now there is no man, but will be willing to lay downe his bodily life as a wearisome burthen, rather than to liue continually vnder the Physician's or Chirurgian's hands without any ease or intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And yet euen the bitterest and most vnpleasant Physicke, such as in it selfe is to be loathed, is good, and by all wise men to be desired, so long as there is certaine hope, that it may be a meanes to ease their bodies-of lingring paine or torture, or procure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration or long continuance of former and wonted health. In like manner, our Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would haue wished neuer to haue professed the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, rather than to haue liued eternally in such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, as he sometimes suffered, because they were in themselues euill, and distastefull vnto the humane nature: notwithstanding he reioyceth and glorieth in them, as they haue reference to that exceeding waight of glory and crowne of righteousnes, for the attaining whereof they were, though not causes, yet as meanes ordained by God, vsefull, and for those times necessary. And therefore our Sauiour saith, <hi>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnes sake, for theirs is the Kingdome of heauen.</hi> And againe, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are ye when men shall reuile you and persecute you for my sake.</hi> Matth. 5. 10. 11. <hi>Reioyce and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen; for so persecuted they the Prophets, which were before you. vers.</hi> 12. So then such as suffer persecution for righteousnes sake, are blessed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7861:18"/>
               <hi>[spe, non re,]</hi> whilest they suffered persecution; That is, they are not in the actuall possession of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes, which they hope for, nor can they expect, (as our Apostle in the fore-cited 15. Chapter to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 19. vers. teacheth vs) that their hopes of blessednes in Christ, shall bee accomplished in this life, because neither the endowments of the minde, nor of the body, whose perfection and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are necessary to true and perfect happinesse, can be perfected and accomplished, vntill this corruptible haue put on incorruption, and these our mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies become impassible and immortall. As for those externall comforts or supplyes, which are necessary to that small portion of happinesse, which we haue in this life, as meate, drinke, apparell, and the like, wee shall haue no need nor vse of them in the life to come. In that life wee shall bee so fully happy within our selues, and in the fruition of God, as wee shall neede nothing without vs, nothing besides Gods presence, and the fruition of our selues. The want or penurie of any thing vsefull in this life, is a degree or part of misery: but not to neede them, not to want them, is a portion of true felicity. And for this reason happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, that amongst all the good workes and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which our Sauiour did, wee neuer reade, that he made any needy beggers exceeding rich in worldly riches, because riches are neither vsefull nor necessary to that happinesse, wherevnto all his miracles doe leade and draw vs: but as he did neither make, nor promise to make his followers rich, so hee would not suffer any of them, whilest hee liued heere on earth, to continue in want or penurie. These euils or degrees
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7861:18"/>
of misery in this life, he often preuented by miracles, <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> when they were ready to befall them.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Here we are by the way to consider, that whilst our Sauiour was bodily present with his Disciples and followers, none of them were in want or need, but he instantly relieued them. If any fell sicke, he presently cured them: if they were in danger by Sea, they could no sooner cry out, <hi>Master, wee perish,</hi> but he as soone checked the winde with the breath of his mouth, and turned the storme into a calme: he did not suffer them so much as to weepe or mourne, but rather ministred continual matter of ioy and comfort vnto them: Nay, as wee reade <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. It was a solaecisme for them to fast, whilest he was with them. <hi>When Iohns Disciples, or the Pharises came vnto him, and demanded of him, Why doe the Disciples of Iohn and of the Pharises fast, but thy Disciples fast not? Iesus said vnto them, Can the Children of the Bridegroome fast, whilest the Bridegroome is with them? As long as they haue the Bridegroome with them, they cannot fast: but the dayes will come, when the Bridegroome shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those dayes.</hi> Thus you see a great difference betwixt the estate of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whilest he was with them, and whilest hee was taken from them: the one was an estate of ioy and contentment, without bodily grieuance or molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the other had his ioy and internall comfort mixt with sorrow of bodily discontentments. What was then the reason of this difference? Surely it was our Sauiours will and pleasure in affording these content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which did accompany his bodily presence here on earth, to exhibit a perfit Map or Modell of that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7861:19"/>
of all ioy and contentment, which wee shall be made partakers of by his bodily presence with vs in heauen. So then, for conclusion of the first poynt, and for more commodious passage vnto the second, our Sauiour by the miracles here mentioned, and the like, did openly and euidently declare himselfe to be the Author, Lord, and free doner of all these three rankes or sorts of good things, which the Heathen by light of nature saw to be requisite or necessary for the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true felicity, or in the fruition whereof in full and perfit measure, true and perfit happinesse did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
            <p n="19">19.

               </note> call <hi>[Bona fortunae]</hi> (as meat, drinke, apparell, or means necessary for maintenance of life) without which wee can rather receiue no contentment, than be throughly contented with them; albeit our Sauiour gaue them in lesse measure than worldly mindes desire them, yet his bounty in bestowing of them, did herein farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the magnificence of greatest Princes, in that hee herewith pleasured his Disciples without any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance vnto others. This was a foundation of publike happines, which no Monarch or State-founder could euer lay, in that, no man did euer fare a whit the worse because his followers or fauourers, (how many soeuer they were) did fare the better. For thus our Sauiour plentifully fedde multitudes of people in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without occasioning any dearth or scarcity of bread or victuals vnto such as remained in the townes or villages. The reliques or offalls of the Feasts that hee made, were alwayes greater than the prouision it selfe. Once wee reade of his feeding fiue thousand
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7861:19"/>
men with seuen Barly-loaues, and two Fishes, and the <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> fragments or broken meate was seuen Baskets full, <hi>Marke</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. Another time of his feeding fiue thousand men with fiue loaues, when there remained twelue baskets full of fragments. Nor did this his bounty extend onely in cases of necessity or for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting want or penury, but vnto matter of delight or decency. For as hee fed thousands of people in the Wildernesse, where no food was to be had for them without miracle; so, to grace the marriage feast at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in Galilie, hee turned water into wine, not of the worst sort, but of the pleasantest and cheerefullest taste. Thus when tribute or pole-money was vniustly exacted of him, hee did not demand a beneuolence from those men on whom hee had wrought those mighty cures, or whom hee had otherwise benefited extraordinarily; Hee supplyeth himselfe and <hi>Peter</hi> with this <hi>necessary</hi> from a Fish, which had no more vse or need of money whereof the Romane <hi>Caesar</hi> had want, than the poore Indian had of the Spaniards gold. So that albeit he sent his pole-money to Rome with others, yet was there not one penny lesse in Iury than there was before.</p>
            <p n="20">20. But to come to the second sort or ranke of good things, which the Heathens by light of nature saw necessary vnto felicity, as <hi>[bona corporis;]</hi> what greater bodily happinesse could befall the blinde or lame, than for the one to be restored vnto his perfit fight, the other to the right vse of limbes? What could the deafe more desire than to be able to heare, or the Lepers than to be cleansed from their leprosie? What so great a bodily blessing, if any at all besides
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7861:20"/>
could be bestowed vpon the dead, as to be restored to life againe? Yet those and many like blessings our Sauiour bestowed vpon all that were not offended in him, by his meere word, thereby shewing himselfe to be the Lord and disposer of all the blessings or parts of happinesse which concerne the body. And <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples might heare and see the parties here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, made thus farre truely happy by him. Happy they were in respect of all other men, happier by much than those men which still continued blinde or lame, or leprous, or deafe, or in that estate of death, from which our Sauiour raysed these dead here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Againe, happier they were than such men as neuer had beene blinde, or lame, or leprous, or deafe, or neuer had tasted of bodily death. For albeit the blessings of life, of health, of strength, of soundnesse of limmes, were in themselues (if wee measure them by themselues) the selfe-same in both: yet these men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my Text, knew much better how to value or prize these bodily blessings aright, or how to vse them to their right end by their former long want or absence, than others could doe by their continuall presence or fruition of them. Againe, happy they were in respect of themselues, or their former estate, much happier in that they were now able to walke, whereas before they had beene lame; much happier, in that whereas now they see, they had sometimes bin blinde; that whereas now they are cleansed, they had sometimes bin Lepers; in that such of them as now liue, had beene sometimes dead. For, although the habit be in it selfe much better than the priuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as sight is much better than blindnesse, health
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7861:20"/>
much better than sicknesse, soundnesse of limbes much <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> better than lamenesse, life much better than death; vet sometimes the sufferance of want or priuation of things in their nature good and pleasant, may be more profitable or vsefull for attayning some greater good, than the present possession or fruition of good things. Now it was not the habit or present fruition of life and health, not the right vse of limbes and bodily sences, but the former want or priuation of them, which was as the root or stock wherein the third part of that happinesse which consists in the health or wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the soule was ingrafted. If some of these men had alwayes inioyed their perfit sight, it is more than twenty to one but that their owne right eyes had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them; and better it were they should haue beene plucked out, than haue offended them: but best of all, that they had none to offend them, or draw them from Christ the Fountaine of happinesse, vnto other vanities. If others of them had beene alwayes sound of body and limbes, their owne right hands or feet would haue bin as a stumbling-blocke to them in the way of life, and haue hindered them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Christ. If others of them had not bin smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with leprosie or other like grieuous diseases, they had not sought to Christ as to their Physician: and not finding him so happy a Physician as they found him for the body, they would not so earnestly haue sought vnto him, as the only Physician of their soules; although he be vsually found of none but such as seek him. Finally, vnlesse the Lord had humbled all of them with some one or other bodily grieuance, or with want and pouerty, they had not become so
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7861:21"/>
humble in minde, or poore in spirit, as now they are; and not being such, they had not beene capable of the greatest miracle or best blessing heere bestowed, <hi>that is,</hi> they had not beene <gap reason="foreign">

And howsoeuer the word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall be rendred by Interpreters, the thing signified by it, is the greatest miracle in this Catalogue. That the Gospell should be preached vnto the poore, as <hi>Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> would haue it, was <hi>[valdè mirum]</hi> a great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wonder. And why so great or reall a wonder? Because, saith he, to haue the Gospell preached vnto them, was as much as to haue a promise to be made Kings, as he rightly proues from diuers places of this Gospell by Saint <hi>Matthew. [Quid autem admirabilius quàm pauperem Regem fieri?] What more admirable or wonderfull, than for poore men and beggers to be made Kings?</hi> He further addeth, that although the Gospell
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7861:21"/>
were equally and indifferently preached to all, yet it <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> pleased our Sauiour onely to mention the poore, both because that was most strange and vnusuall according to the custome of the world, that the poore should haue the promise to bee made Kings; and withall, that hee might shew himselfe to be the Messias or the Anoynted of the Lord, who, as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> had fore-told, should preach the Gospell to the poore. Thus farre <hi>Maldonate.</hi> But vnder correction, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> imports a great deale more than eyther <hi>Maldonate</hi> expresseth in Latine, when he saith, <hi>[Euangelium praedicatur pauperibus,]</hi> or than is expressed in our latter English, <hi>the poore haue the Gospell preached vnto them.</hi> Our former English cometh somewhat neerer the Originall, when it saith, <hi>the poore receiue the Gospell.</hi> But the vulgar Latine, though it misse it many, yet in this particular best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth the meaning of the Euangelist, if the Romish Priests and Iesuites, which hold it to be Authentique, did vnderstand the meaning of it, or improue it to the best sence; for so it renders the Originall <hi>verbatim [Pauperes Euangelizantur.]</hi> For right vnfolding the contents of this speech, or taking the full value of the Originall, we are to obserue that Verbes passiue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, or English, may include or import a two-fold passion; the one meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grammaticall or intentionall; the other reall, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall or supernaturall. One and the same Verbe may sometimes include the former onely, sometimes the latter, according to the diuersity of the matter or subiect whereunto it is applyed. To giue instance in that speech of <hi>Melchizedeck, Genes.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Blessed</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:7861:22"/>
               <hi>be Abraham of the most high GOD, possessor of heauen and earth. And blessed be the most High God which hath deliuered thine enemies into thine hand.</hi> Now, though the word in the Originall be the same, though it be for signification as truely passiue, when it is said, <hi>Blessed be the most High God,</hi> and when it is said, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be Abraham of the most High God:</hi> yet wee must alwayes note this difference in the thing it selfe, that whensoeuer God is blessed by man, as here he was by <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> mans blessing can produce no reall <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>alteration</hi> in God: it can adde no degree of blisse or happinesse to him. But whensoeuer man is blessed by GOD, his blessing alwayes addeth some increase of blessednesse eyther in his goods, in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or in his soule. Againe, if one man giue another poyson, the other may be said to haue poyson giuen him, or to be Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matically passiue. But it is one thing to haue poyson giuen him, &amp; another to be poysoned. This latter includes a real passion or bodily mutation, though from better to worse, from life to death. He that hath a medicine giuen him, is in common speech termed a Patient, and is Grammatically passiue. But euery one that is thus farre passiue as to haue a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine giuen him, is not instantly medicined, cured, or healed; for this includes a reall operation or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which was amisse in the body. In like manner, in as much as our Sauiour preached the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell equally and indifferently to all, all that heard him, might bee alike truely and literally said to haue had the Gospell preached vnto them, if wee respect onely the Grammatical sense and signification of the word. But it is one thing to say that all had the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7861:22"/>
preached vnto them; and another thing to say, all <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> were <hi>Euangelizati.</hi> For this latter was peculiar only to <hi>the poore in spirit:</hi> They only tooke this stampe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Gospell, which was preached to all. Briefely, the originall phrase doth literally and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally import as true or reall an alteration or transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the soules of such as were poore in spirit, as the former miracles heere mentioned, did in the bodies of the blinde, the lame, the deafe, the Leprous, or dead. Now it is not said that the blind had their sight proffered or promised vnto them, or that the lame were onely made to walke, or the Leapers cleansed onely in hope, or by way of promise. But all of them were truely and actually cured of their infirmities of body; and so no question were the poore in spirit as truely cured, as truely healed of their infirmities of their soules. They had beene as truely dead vnto the life of the spirit, as those whom Christ is heere said to haue raised vp, were vnto the life of the body. But now they are raised vp to newnesse of life, enlightened to see the truth, and enabled to walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit. And whereas before they had beene the bond slaues of sinne, wherewith their soules were more foulely stained or tainted than these Leapers bodies were with leprosie, they are now freed and cleansed from the guilt and raigne of sinne, and made the seruants of righteousnes. Thus much is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in these last words, <hi>[Pauperes euangelizantur;]</hi> and this transmutation of their soules was, or might haue bin, as conspicuous or obseruable to <hi>Iohns</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as the changing of <hi>Sauls</hi> mind or spirit was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Israelites, after <hi>Samuel</hi> had anoynted him King.

This Interpretation of this place is made vnto our hands by our Sauiour himselfe, the best Interpreter of his owne words: for so hee saith, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Blessed be yee poore,</hi> (setting his eyes on his Disciples) <hi>for yours is the Kingdome of God.</hi> This blessing of Interest in the Kingdom of God here bequeathed by our Sauiour vnto the poore, is in effect the same with these words in my Text, <hi>[Pauperes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelizantur;]</hi> of which, their Interest in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is the true reall and formall effect. For the Gospell is called the Kingdome of God, because it instateth such as receiue the impression of it, that is, the <hi>Euangelizati,</hi> in the Kingdome of God or of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The Kingdome of God in Scriptures is twofold, and hath two importances. Sometimes it importeth the Kingdome of Grace, which the poore in spirit at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it in this world: Somtimes it importeth the Kingdome of Glory, which no man shall attaine vnto but in the world to come. The Kingdome of Grace there bequeathed had two parts; the one ordinary, to continue throughout all ages, which did consist in the raigne or soueraignty of the spirit ouer the flesh: the other extraordinary, yet vsuall in that time, and did consist in the raigne or soueraignty of such poore men, as Christs Disciples were, ouer Satan and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And this part of the Kingdome of grace, or this effect of it, was more conspicuous and visible vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and was one of those workes or miracles which <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples might heare and see, and make faith or true relation vnto their Master. Now the blessednes heere promised by our Sauiour, or so much of it as men are capable of in this life, consisteth in the former
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7861:23"/>
part of the Kingdome of Grace, that is, in the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty <note place="margin">Mem. 1.</note> of the spirit ouer the flesh. Both parts of this obseruation are set forth vnto vs by our Sauiour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. vers. 17, 18, 19. <hi>The Seuentie returned againe with ioy, saying, Lord, euen the Diuels are subiect vnto vs through thy name. And hee said vnto them, I beheld Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan as lightning fall from heauen. Behold, I giue vnto you power to tread on Serpents and Scorpions, and ouer all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any meanes hurt you.

You haue heard, and I make no question but you doe beleeue, That whatsoeuer your hearts can desire, euen the fulnes of that true happines, which is all that you or any man can desire, is only to be sought in Christ, in whom it may be found by all. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming your particular Interest in him, and in the blessednes which heere he promiseth: the right recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this blessed Sacrament is of all other meanes most effectuall. For your better preparation to the due receiuing of it, it will bee auaileable to consider the doctrine which my Text affoords; that although Christ be a fountaine of happines infinite, and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible; although his death (whose memory we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, whose vertue in this Sacrament we seeke) be, as it were the opening of this fountaine; yet are the streames of blisse and happines which issue from him by his death, deriuable onely vnto such as are not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in him. Though the <hi>Gospell,</hi> as our Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ver. 16. <hi>be the power of God vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> yet, as my Text saith, the poore in spirit only take the impression of it.

goodnesse infinite, sufficient in it selfe to saue all, <note place="margin">Mem. 2.</note> though in number infinite; is effectuall only in such as are of an humble and contrite heart. Of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or contrition, or their poorenes in spirit, which is heere mentioned in my Text, that might be truely said, which our Sauiour doth of <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle his faith: <hi>Thomas, thou beleeuest because thou hast seene, happy are they which haue not seene and yet beleeue.</hi> The most of these men were therefore poore and humble in spirit, because the Lord had humbled, broken, or chastised them, some with bodily blindnes, others with lamenes, some with deafenes, others with lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or like grieuous sicknes, some with death. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming once truely humble and poore in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though by these and like meanes, all of them were truely happy in Christ: but much happier and more blessed shall they be, whom the Lord hauing not so grieuously chastised in body, yet doe become as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and poore in spirit, as they were. The best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration I can commend vnto you, for working this humiliation and contrition of spirit, is this, that as the Ceremonies of the Law were but shaddowes of these things which are now fulfilled in Christ; so all the bodily calamities, which Christ heere cured in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seuerall bodies, were but as so many sensible types or shaddowes of more grieuous maladies in euery mans soule; although by nature wee doe not feele them. Some of them were dead in body, and <hi>all of vs,</hi> as our Apostle saith, <hi>are by nature dead in trespasses.</hi> Now if we doe as truely and heartily bewayle this deadnes of our soules, as the poore Widdow of <hi>Naim</hi> did the bodily death of her onely sonne; then, as our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7861:25"/>
Apostle saith in the same place, <hi>Wee are quickned in Christ,</hi> and he will deliuer our soules vnto vs safe and sound, as he did him vnto his mother. Some of those were blind in body; all of vs were darke in mind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the wombe: and if we supplicate vnto him with like earnestnes to enlighten our minds, as these poore men did to receiue their bodily sight, wee shall bee as happy in this cure, as they were in the other. Some of them were halt and lame, and not able to go; and we, after we haue seene and knowne the wayes of God, are more vnable to walke in them, than they were to runne a race. Some of them were Leapers in body; so are we all by nature Leapers in soules. But whatsoeuer lamenes, infirmitie or disease hath befalne our soules by <hi>Adams</hi> transgression or by our owne corruption, he is both able and willing to worke more miraculous cures vpon our soules, than hee did vpon these pooremens bodies, so we intreat him as earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heartily as they did.</p>
            <p n="23">23. None of you, I hope, conceiueth Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence to be either necessary or expedient for curing or healing your soules. No mans faith in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more commended than the Centurions, which did not desire our Sauiours bodily presence, when he offered it, for the healing of his seruant. His answere was, <hi>Lord, I am not worthy, that thou shouldst come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my roofe, but speake the word onely, and my seruant shall be healed.</hi> Matth. 8. 8. If this acknowledgement were a document of liuely faith, and Christian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in this Centurion; what can it be but arrogancy and vnbeliefe in the Romanist, to thinke himselfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, not only of Christs bodily presence vnder the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7861:25"/>
roofe of his house, but vnder the roofe of his mouth, <note place="margin">Mem. 2.</note> yea in his stomach? But farre bee all such vncleane and carnall thoughts from any heere present. Let vs stedfastly belieue, that Christs Word is now as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull in heauen, as it was on earth; yet haue wee not onely his Word, but the visible pledges of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood for the healing of our soules. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer other defect there may be in our preparation for receiuing these pledges of his passion, let vs be sure, that our intention to humble our selues, and amend our liues, be sincere and without hypocrisie.</p>

apart from the wombe, yea, sanctified vnto it euen in the wombe, as you may reade, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>verse</hi> 41. As this qualification made him more docile or capable of good instructions than other children were, so his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Zacharias</hi> was better able to instruct him in the knowledge of Christ, of whose Kingdome and Office he had prophesied, than any other Priest or sonne of <hi>Aaron</hi> could. For <hi>Zacharias</hi> was, for ought that wee can gather, the onely Prophet then in Israel, at least the spirit of Prophesie, which for a long time had bin as a fountaine dryed vp, did first breake forth in him. After that <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe came to maturitie of age and vnderstanding, he was directed by speciall commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his God, to vsher Christ into the world, to induct him into his Propheticall function, to declare him to be the Redeemer of Israel, to proclaime him to be the high Priest of our soules, that was to make the full atonement for the sinnes of the whole world.

Now for your better edification in this poynt, giue <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 1.</note> mee leaue to breake this portion of the Bread of life which I haue in hand, into three parts:</p>
               <p>The first, The generall meanes by which euery <note place="margin">Three branches of this second member.</note> mans faith or beliefe in Christ is wrought or groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or by which it is or may be confirmed.</p>
               <p>The second shall be the vnfolding of those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places of Scripture on which <hi>Iohns</hi> beliefe was grounded, as also the signes of the time by which his faith before his imprisonment, (or before the framing of this question) was ratified and confirmed.</p>
               <p>The third, What correspondency, concord or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy the particulars heere mentioned, and those places of Scripture whereunto our Sauiour in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer referres <hi>Iohn,</hi> or the signes of this very time wherein this answere was made, haue vnto the other parts of Scripture, or signes of the time by which <hi>Iohns</hi> former faith had beene established and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Of these three in their order by Gods assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Concerning the first poynt, we all beleeueand know that Gods Word is the only rule on which our faith must be grounded, by which wee must be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp as the <hi>house</hi> by line or leuell. <note place="margin">The first Branch. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the manner how our beliefe in Gods Word, or in Christ is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the 36. parag.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In this generall we and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> agree: The first breach or poynt of difference betwixt vs and them is, Whether this Word of God by which the Temple of God must be raysed, be partly written and partly vnwritten? Wee say, that the whole rule or Canon of Faith is written or contayned fully in the Bookes of the Old and New Testament. They grant these Bookes to contayne part of the rule, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7861:27"/>
the other part, which in effect they make the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, is (as they say) contayned in vnwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of whose truth or true meaning the visible Church for the time being, is the sole Iudge. This indeed is the roofe or couering of their Edifice, which (as elsewhere we haue shewed, and by Gods assistance shall more fully shew hereafter) doth vtterly raze or ouerthrow the foundation it selfe, whereon they would seeme to put it, to wit, <hi>the written Word of God,</hi> and the truthes concerning Christ contayned in it. But our purpose is not at this time to shew you, in what manner they ouerthrow the foundation of Faith or Word of God, but rather the manner how our faith is grounded on it.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Now though it be true which we lately said, that faith must bee grounded onely on the written Word; this saying notwithstanding must be restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the time since. GODS Word vnto his Church or people by his appoyntment was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto writing. Wherefore you must remember or take notice, that there was a time wherein no part of Gods Word was written: for <hi>Moses</hi> was the first that committed Gods Words to writing, the first that made a Register or Record of what God had spoken vnto the Patriarkes. Now, the beliefe of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes was grounded on Gods Word though then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, after the same manner as ours is on the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word. For (as you will easily conceiue) it is not the writing of Gods Word which makes it to be the ground or rule of faith. Yet heere happely you will demand, To what other end then was it written? To this we answer, That the writing of it by such speciall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7861:27"/>
Registers as God had appoynted for that purpose, <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 1.</note> and the strange preseruation of the Records written by them, is to vs an infallible argument that what they haue written, is the Words of God, not the words of men. And this, to know that the words which wee beleeue or giue credence vnto in matters concerning our happinesse or saluation, are the words not of any mortall man, but of the immortall God, is the first ground of faith.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Vnto the right grounding of our faith in this <note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction not of any but of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the Authors of the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to haue bin inspired by God.</note> first po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt, two things were euer required: The first, prediction or fore-telling things to come: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was, the euent or experiment answering to the prediction. Yet is it not the prediction of any euent that shall fall out, though for a long time after, that can argue the prediction it selfe to haue beene Gods words, or the fore-teller of such euents to bee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. For the Astronomers can fore-tell you the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses of the Sunne or Moone for many yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fall out or happen; yet no man takes their skill as an argument that they are true Prophets, or that they are enlightned by the Spirit of God, by which the Scriptures were written, or the mysteries contayned in them were fore-told. But if an Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer could as distinctly fore-tell what kinde of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euery moneth or euery day for two or three yeeres following should bring with it, as hee can fore-tell what day or houre the Sunne or Moone shall be eclipsed, or in what degree or measure eyther of their bodies should be obscured or hid from our sight; you would conceiue of him as a man more than ordinary, and that he could not know this by ordinary skill or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7861:28"/>
art, no not by the blacke art it selfe, or by dealing with the Deuill. He that could certainely fore-tell all the particular changes of weather, or the alteration of States and Kingdomes, or the seuerall Eclipses or il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations of Gods true visible Church heere on earth for the next Generations that are to come; might iustly challenge the reputation of a Prophet or Messenger sent from God, at the hands of all such as had heard or read his predictions before the truth of them was sealed by their manifest vndoubted euents. What then is the reason why the certaine and known prediction of some euents, whose truth afterwards becometh visible and manifest vnto the world (as the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone, or the coniunction of Planets, which shall fall out some forty yeeres hence or more) should not as infallibly argue the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the diuine Spirit, or reuelations immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made from God, as the fore-telling of all change of weather, or matters of greater consequences doe, as matters of States or Kingdomes, or Gods visible Church? The reason is, because God by his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Decree hath appoynted the Sunne and Moone their constant and certaine course, and priuiledged them from all impossibility of impediment or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in their seuerall courses, which eyther man or infernall spirits can attempt against them: whereas by the same euerlasting Decree, Hee hath ordayned such variety or inconstancy in the ayre or other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Elements, as no wit of Man or Deuill can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the possible changes of weather, which may happen within some few yeeres following. For though Satan and his angels be enstyled Prince of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7861:28"/>
Ayre by Gods Saints, yet doth not this title any way <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 1.</note> import that they haue absolute independent power or Monarchicall Soueraignety ouer the ayre, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that He who is supreme Lord of Heauen &amp; Earth, of all the World, and of all in it, oft times permitteth those infernall spirits, for the iniquity or sins of men, to exercise such power in the ayre, as hee neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them to vse or exercise in the higher Region, whence they are vtterly banished or excluded. So that albeit they oft times know much, and more than man by meanes naturall can doe, concerning the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or change of weather; yet can they know no more concerning these or like effects, than God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them to know, or suffereth them in his iust iudgements to effect or worke. Againe, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of ciuill affaires, of gouernement of States or Kingdomes, GOD, by his euerlasting Decree, hath left vnto men such variety of choyce, such a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency in their consultations, such a freedome of will in contriuing or proiecting their seuerall ends, as it is impossible for any man liuing in this Age, though he should consult with Witches or familiar spirits, to prognosticate or fore-tell what the successe or finall issue of what hee himselfe at this present proiects or plots, <note n="*" place="margin">

From this faculty or rather facility in fore-telling things of this nature, which for diuers Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations after shall certainely come to passe, the Lord himselfe doth pleade, and proue his Title of infinite wisdome, that He is the onely wise immortall God, that besides him there is none that can doe or say as He doth. <hi>Produce your cause, saith the LORD,</hi>

Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that wee may know that yee are gods: yea, doe good, or doe euill, that wee may bee dismayed: and behold it together.

And againe, chap. 47. vers. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Sit thou in silence, and get thee into darknesse, O Daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called the Lady of Kingdomes: I was wroth with my people, I haue polluted my Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and giuen them into thine hand: thou diddest shew them no mercy; vpon the ancient hast thou very heauily layde the yoke. And thou saidst, I shall bee a Ladie for euer: so that thou diddest not lay these things to thine heart, neyther diddest remember the latter end of it.

               </p>
               <p n="28">28. Let mee giue you two instances or examples of things fore-told by God, (by his Prophet <hi>Isay)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the strange alteration of States or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, both which predictions were exactly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeably fulfilled and accomplished; the one about an hundred, the other about one hundred and seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres after, the Prophet from the mouth of the LORD had fore-told them. The former is related in the second Booke of <hi>Kings, chap.</hi> 20. and in the 39. of <hi>Isay, vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8. The summe of both those Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is this: After <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had shewed his House and all his Treasure vnto the King of Babylons Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, which came to congratulate his late reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery from that dangerous sicknesse, of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isayas</hi> had by Gods appoyntment cured him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first secured him not onely of his instant recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but of the continuance of his former health, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7861:30"/>
prolonging of his dayes by a signe from Heauen: the same Prophet came vnto him, and telleth him that this his kindnesse or courtesie to the Embassadours in shewing them his Treasury, was <hi>[factum malè omina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,]</hi> and did abode a future misery to his posterity. <hi>Heare the Word of the LORD, saith Isaiah to Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Behold the dayes to come, that all that is in thine House, and that which thy Fathers haue layed vp in store vntill this day, shall be carryed to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord. And of thy sonnes that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away, and they shall bee Eunuches in the Palace of the King of Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if wee consider the strength of Iudah and of Aegypt in those times, and the small power which the Babylonian had in respect of his Neighbour the mightie King of Assyria, who then layde clayme to Iudah; the accomplishment of this Prediction or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie was in all politique esteeme or humane conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture more improbable and more incredible, than if a man in this Age should take vpon him to fore-tell that the Duke of Saxony, or some other Prince of Germany, should conquer the Low-Countries, France and Spaine, and leade all the Royall Race of both those Kingdomes Captiues vnto Dresden, or to some other Princely Court of Germanie within these hundred yeeres next following. He that should fore-tell thus much at this present, would be recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a true Prophet or Messenger from God in the ages following, by such as liued to see the euent or prediction fulfilled or verified. Now there was not one part or circumstance of the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7861:30"/>
but was notoriously and remarkeably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished <note place="margin">Mem. 2 Branch 1.</note> in <hi>Iehoiakim, Zedekiah,</hi> and their Children, both of them being sons to good King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> both of them being confederates with the King of Aegypt, whose ioyned strength could not resist the greatnesse whereto the Kingdome of Babylon within three or foure discents was growne: For <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> had made himselfe Lord of Iewry, of Aegypt, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Assyria,</hi> The same Prophet (which is more remarkeable and more admirable) about the same time foretels the sudden desolation of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire, before it was growne to halfe its height or greatnes, and names the Party which was to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the worke of the Lord, more than an hundred yeeres before he was borne. <hi>Isai.</hi> 45. vers. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The accomplishment of this Prophesie by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the Lord would haue aswell the Gentile as the Iew to take speciall notice of, as an impregnable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or irrefragable testimony of his power, in raysing vp <hi>Cyrus</hi> to take vengeance on the <hi>Babylonians</hi> in the height of thier pride, for the wrongs which they had done to <hi>Iudah</hi> his Sanctuary: an impregnable argument likewise of his exceeding mercy and louing kindnesse towards his people, whom <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after hee had conquered <hi>Babylon,</hi> did set at liberty, and gaue them Licence to re-edifie the City and the Temple. <hi>Thus saith the Lord to his anoynted, to Cyrus, whose right hand I haue holden, to subdue Nations before him: and I will loose the loynes of Kings to open before him the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaued Gates, and the Gates shall not be shut. &amp;c.</hi> to vers.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The manner of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his suddaine surprizing <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> in that night, wherein they celebrated the Feast
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7861:31"/>
of their Idol <hi>Bell,</hi> is recorded at large by two heathen Writers, <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> as long after this Prophesie was fulfilled, as the prediction was before it. Their Relations of it are so plaine and constant vnto the predictions of <hi>Isay</hi> and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and specially to the Relation which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath made (who was in <hi>Babylon</hi> when <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke it) that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediblest Gentiles of that age were inexcusable. Now the reason why the Lord seekes to win credit to his Prophet in these his strange predictions of alterations in States and Kingdomes, was that neither Iew nor Gentile should haue any pretence to distrust the same Prophets more admirable predictions concerning the <hi>Messias</hi> which was to come; in which predictions this Pophet aboue others, is so plaine and so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that he was enstiled by the Ancient Fathers, the <hi>Euangelicall Prophet.</hi>

the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Ancients haue rightly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Mem. 2.

So that the branches of the literall sense, taken according to its full latitude, (as it is oposed to the mysticall or meerely typicall sense) may be as many as there bee tropes or figures of speech, whether Rhetoricall or Poeticall, besides the proper plaine Grammaticall or Historicall expression of things to come. The mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call sense or meaning is that, which is portended by some deede or fact, as by some Legall type instituted by <hi>Moses,</hi> or by some reall euent which the sacred Historians or other faithfull Writers according to their predictions relate. For Heathen Historians oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make historicall Relations of the euents which the Prophets fore-told. And the euents so related &amp; foretold, become reall Prophesies of other like euents to come, as <hi>Isayes</hi> predictions concerning <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> predictions concerning <hi>Alexanders</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (being both accomplished diuers hundred yeeres before Christ was incarnate) did mystically fore-shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow such euents as the Euangelists haue historically related concerning Christ and the successe of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.

It shall suffice heere to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you, that our beliefe (especially as it concernes the mysticall sense of Scriptures) must be alwayes grounded on the intention and meaning of the holy Ghost, or of God speaking in Scriptures, not on the Prophets present apprehensions of what he speakes, vnto whom perhaps part of the holy Ghosts intention was reuealed: the rest being wrapt vp and hidden, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the euent or signes of time which it concerned, did more fully vnfold it. The <hi>mysticall</hi> and <hi>literall sense</hi> oft-times concurre; sometimes so, as the same words may be vniuocally verefied of the type, and of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery portended by it. As for example, in the 12. of <hi>Exodus, vers.</hi> 26. <hi>not a bone of it shall be broken:</hi> This was literally meant of the Paschall Lambe, which these words immediately and directly point at; for this was the Law of the Paschall Lambe, that <hi>not a bone of it shall be broken.</hi> And all Lawes are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and interpreted according to the plaine literall and Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maticall sense of the words. But inasmuch as the Paschall Lambe it selfe was a reall type or shadow of the Lambe of God, which was to take away the sins of the world by his bloody death vpon the Crosse, the selfesame words which were literally and histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally verefied of the Paschall Lambe, were as truely and more exactly fulfilled of Christ, according to their mysticall (and yet vniuocall) sense. And the fulfilling of this mystery was the cause (as I doubt not but you all know) why our Sauiours bones were not broken vpon the Crosse, when the bones of the other
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7861:32"/>
two which were crucified with him, were broken. <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch. 1.</note> GOD in his wisedome had preuented all occasion of breaking his bones by hastening his death, before the other dyed which were crucified with him. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the same words may be verefied of the type and of the body, not according to their vniuocall sense or importance, but aequiuocally, or analogically; properly verefied of the body, &amp; catachrestically of the type. As for instance, these words; <hi>I will be to him a father, and he shall bee to me a sonne,</hi> are truely meant both of <hi>Salomon</hi> and of <hi>Christ,</hi> but not <hi>secundùm vniuocam ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem.</hi> The title of the Sonne of God, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto <hi>Salomon</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> differs as much as <hi>[homo,</hi> and <hi>homo pictus,]</hi> as a <hi>man, and a painted man.</hi> Some euents there are concerning our Sauiour or his actions, which were not at all foretold by expresse word of Prophesie, but only foreshaddowed by deed or fact, or by some reall type or representation; at the least they are not literally foretold in the same places in which they are really fore-shaddowed. Thus was his death vpon the Crosse really represented by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the brazen Serpent in the wildernesse, yet not litterally foretold by <hi>Moses;</hi> so was his imprisonment or abode in the graue really foreshaddowed by <hi>Ionas</hi> imprisoned in the Whales belly, but <hi>Ionas</hi> did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres thus much by word or Prophesie. But of these &amp; the like types we shall haue occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speak hereafter. Of all the testimonies or fore-significations of Christ, or him crucified, those testimonies wherein is a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of fore-significations aswell by fact as by word, are the most pregnant, and most concludent against the Iewes; and therefore the furest grounds of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe

Author of it; for whose authority and excellent skill in the Hebrew tongue and Iewish antiquities, as I will not peremptorily auouch it, so I dare not reiect it. The Authors of this opinion concerning our Mother <hi>Euahs</hi> mistaking her first borne sonne for the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed seed, haue attributed the like errour, though not altogether so grosse, vnto <hi>Lamech</hi> the Father of <hi>Noah. Lamech</hi> had as true a prenotion or stedfast beliefe in this generall as <hi>Euah</hi> had, that mankind should bee comforted concerning their labours, that they should bee freed from the curse which the first man had brought vpon the earth, vpon himselfe, and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, and that this freedome or comfort should bee brought vnto them by man, by one that was borne of a woman. And yet out of his ouer-reioycing at the birth of the first sonne which God had sent him, hee did (as these Authors thinke) mis-apply his generall prenotion or beliefe concerning the promised seed, to his new and first borne sonne. <hi>Lamech</hi> (saith <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 28.) <hi>liued</hi> 182. <hi>yeeres: and begate a sonne. And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort vs concerning our worke, and toyle of our hands, because of the ground, which the Lord had cursed.</hi> But to waue this question: [Whether <hi>Lamech</hi> did imagine this his sonne to be him that was to come, or whether besides him he looked for another,] it is questionlesse, that he vttered this speech by the spirit of Prophesie, and as the speech it selfe was verified or fulfilled of <hi>Noah,</hi> according to its plaine Grammaticall literall sense, so it was exactly fulfilled or accomplished in Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the full importance of its mysticall sense, that is, Christ and his office was as truely and really
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7861:34"/>

Branch 1.</note> or actions, as <hi>Noahs</hi> office or qualifications were literally fore-told or prophesied of in this speech of <hi>Lamech: Noah after the Floud offered a Sacrifice vnto the Lord, and the Lord smelled a sweet sauour, or a sauour of rest,</hi> and vpon this Sacrifice engaged himselfe by promise, <hi>not to curse the ground againe for mans sake. Genes.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 21. Here you see <hi>Lamechs</hi> Prophesie literally verified in <hi>Noah:</hi> howbeit the Sacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> was but a smokie shaddow of that reall and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall Sacrifice which was offered by the Sonne of GOD vnto his Father <note n="*" place="margin">Walke in loue, as Christ also hath loued vs, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for vs, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and a sacrifice to GOD for a sweet smelling sauour, Ephes. 5. ver 2.</note>. The comfort which <hi>Noah</hi> afforded vnto the World concerning the worke and toyle of their hands, or the ground which the Lord had cursed, was but a slight surface or liuelesse picture of that glorious blessing of life, which Christ, hauing freed vs from <hi>Adams</hi> curse, hath by his death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed vnto vs. <hi>I heard a voyce from hence, saying vnto mee, Blessed are the dead which dye in the LORD, from henceforth yea saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their workes doe follow them.

Againe, <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, Christ was more, &amp;c. <hi>Noah</hi> built an Arke, into which whosoeuer entered not, did perish, into which likewise, whosoeuer did enter, were saued from the Deluge; so did Christ build one holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique and Apostolique Church, without which none can be saued; in which whosoeuer is found, shall be vndoubtedly saued from those euerlasting flames wherewith the World shall be destroyed.</p>
               <p n="32">32. So then our beliefe that Christ the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> was the promised Seed which was to come, and that

Nor is error in particulars of this nature (so long as men stedfastly beleeue the generall) altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so dangerous as some men thinke it, vnlesse it be accompanied with wilfulnesse or obstinacy: for that is it which turnes errors into Heresies. <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe, after his <hi>beliefe</hi> in Gods promises concerning the promised Seed, was <hi>imputed</hi> vnto him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; did commit a greater errour in misapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that very promise, whose beliefe was imputed vnto him for righteousnesse, then <hi>Euah</hi> or <hi>Lamech</hi> did in misapplying Gods promise concerning the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Seed vnto their First-borne; if happely they did so misapply it. For <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Sarahs</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, thought Gods promise or prediction concerning his Seed, should be fulfilled in the seed or off-spring of <hi>Hagar, Sarahs</hi> hand-maid; and continued in this perswasion, vntill the Lord rectified it, and set his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe aright by expresse promise of <hi>Isaacs</hi> strange and miraculous birth. And the euent answering to this promise or prediction, was a reall fore-signification or prefiguration of the more strange and more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous birth of our Sauiour. So likewise was the strange birth and conception of <hi>Samson,</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and of

For after the deliuery of his message, and his reioynder to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest reply, <hi>How shall this be, seeing I know not man?</hi> He finally concludes the Dialogue on his part, <hi>Behold, thy Cousin Elizabeth, shee hath also conceyued a sonne in her old age, and this is the sixt moneth with her, who was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led barren; for with God nothing shall be impossible.

Nor did the blessed Virgin refuse to make tryall of the signe which hee had giuen her: for immediately after the Angels departure from her, <hi>shee repayred vnto her Cousin Elizabeth,</hi> (as the Text saith) <hi>in haste,</hi> where shee found the Angels prediction fully ratified by the euent or fact.

conceyued by power and vertue of the Holy Ghost, her Cousin <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> vpon her salutation, was filled with the Holy Ghost in her heart, and out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of her heart thus filled, her mouth did speake and vtter that propheticall salutation which the Angell had vsed vnto her, with a loud voyce; <hi>Blessed art thou amongst Women, and blessed is the fruit of thy wombe, vers.</hi> 42. And by this spirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did then know that that blessed Virgin had conceyued by the Holy Ghost, and that then the Childe conceyued by her, should bee her Lord and Redeemer: the blessed Virgin againe, vpon fresh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of these facts fully answerable to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels prediction, was filled with the Holy Ghost, and the spirit of prophesie, by which shee vttered that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent saying, <hi>My soule doth magnifie the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>

Concerning miracles I haue not much to say, beeing loth to put my sickle into another mans har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, from whom I hope you shall reape full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Onely this caueat I would commend vnto you, which heeretofore I haue published, That although it be granted, that the Diuell by his owne power can worke no true miracle, that is, nothing that shall bee aboue the force or power of nature, or contrary to it; or it beeing granted likewise, that God doth neuer lend the vse of his omnipotent power vnto Satan his angels or ministers, to work any true miracle thereby to try the faith of Christians: yet all this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in generall, if we descend vnto particular wonders, we must haue as great skill in the force and power of nature, how farre it may extend, as Satan hath; Wee must bee as cunning in discouering his slightes, iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or delusions, as he is in iugling or deluding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be secure, that hee cannot put one of the two iuggling trickes vpon vs. As first, that he cannot make vs beleeue those wonders which we see effected to exceed the force or power of naturall causes, when as in truth &amp; in deed they doe not: or that hee cannot make vs beleeue, that such wonders or miracles, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed exceed the force of nature, to bee wrought by him or his Instruments; when as they are wrought by God himselfe, for some other speciall end or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

or for some other vse then he or his Instruments could referre them vnto.

Howeuer, the production of the like or greater tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest then this was, is not enough to perswade this or that point of controuersed doctrine. For suppose some poore Amoritish Widdow, pittifully oppressed by one or more of these fiue Tyrants, had out of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of her soule, about this time, presented her complaints to <hi>Nemesis</hi> at <hi>Rhamnus,</hi> a place wherein the power of this reuengefull Lady was, in the conceit of the heathen, vsually manifested, in as remarkeable and peculiar sort, as the vertue of our Lady (in the opinion of the Romish Catholikes) is at <hi>Hall</hi> or <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now seeing the Scriptures or Rule of faith, hath manifested vnto vs, wherein the Kingdome of Christ and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan or Antichrist doe consist, the point, wheron euery miracle or wonderment must be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7861:40"/>
is this, Whether it tend to the establishment of the Kingdome of God or of Christ in our soules, or to the erection or propogation of the Kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ through this world.</p>
               <p>Suppose some man or woman amongst vs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally possest of a whole legion of Diuels, &amp; that some Turkish, Iewish, Muscouitish, Greeke, or Romish Priest should take vpon him by exorcisme to make all the Diuels goe out of the Parties body possessed, one after another, in as visible and conspicuous manner, as hee could driue bees out of their hiue through a quill or pen, and cause euery one of them to tell you his name, or what place he holds in Hell; yet the true vse of such miracle or wonderment could be no other, than to resolue you, that there may be a reall possession of some bodies in this age, and a reall dispossession of these Diuels, which had taken possession of it. But if the party which had thus really dispossest them, should vpon this wonderment exhort or require you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that that visible Church whereof he is a Priest or member, is the onely true Church of God, whose proposals or doctrines you are absolutely bound to beleeue, without further examination or tryall of them by the written Word of God, <hi>the rule of faith;</hi> this were a true &amp; infallible argument, that the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was wrought by the power and slight of Satan, not by the vertue and power of God, or of Christs true messengers. For if wee duely consider, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage or possession Satan might by this means gaine ouer our soules; if any Diuell in hell would bee so proud, so obstinate, or wilfull, as to refufe to obey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priest, Iew, or Turke, that would adiure him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7861:40"/>
vpon these conditions out of any mans body <note place="margin">Mem. 2.

Wherefore, if any Priest or other, shall at any time tempt you to admit of the infallibility of the Romish Church, or to beleeue in all poynts as that Church beleeueth, only vpon fame or sight of such a wonder wrought by one of her children; yee stand bound in conscience, and vpon the allegiance which you owe to Christ, to craue respite vntill you can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your consciences, whether the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such absolute infallibility, as the moderne Priests and Iesuites ascribe vnto the moderne Romish Church, or the submission of your beliefe vnto all her doctrines, (especially to this) be not a flat Apostasie from Christ vnto Satan, and a true acknowledgment of his Soueraigntie made vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to his proxie or deputy for this purpose. Againe, if any Priest should worke such a wonder as hath beene mentioned, by such exorcisme as they vse, as by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the consecrated Hoast, (as they call it,) their crucifixes or holy-water vnto the partie affected, or by examining the Diuels by oath vpon the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; you are bound in conscience likewise to craue respit to be resolued, whether these or the like solemnities or ceremonies as they haue vsed of late in this Land, bee not magicall sacrifices, true and proper feats of witcherie and sorcerie. These are points wherein no exorcist, no Romish Priest or Iesuite this day liuing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7861:41"/>
in this Land, can giue any ingenious vnderstanding man any tolerable satisfaction. The former poynt, concerning the infallibility of the Romish Church, is else-where handled at large, and I shall be willing to acknowledge my selfe a thankfull debtor vnto any Priest or Iesuite, or other wel-willer of the present Romish Church, that shall giue mee occasion or ground of reason to thinke better of their Religion in this point, then hitherto I haue thought, or can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe to thinke. And better then flat Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stafie from Christ I neuer thought it, since I was able to reade the Trent Councell, <hi>Bellarmine, Valentian,</hi> or other defendants of the Popes absolute and plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie power.

Euery errour presupposeth some branch of Ignorance; but Ignorance doth not alwayes include errour. Whence it will follow, that if the best of Gods Saints might erre in partculars concerning themselues as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, there is no question but they and others might be ignorant of many particulars which became mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to posterity. Thus the Pharises or the Priests &amp; Leuites, which were sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>question Iohn Baptist,</hi> had a true prenotion or beliefe in generall, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7861:42"/>
God in latter ages would raise vp an extraordinary Prophet like vnto <hi>Moses.</hi> But whether this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prophet should be the Christ or Messias him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or rather his fore-runner, his attendant or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, they were ignorant. They had againe a true prenotion or beliefe in generall, that God would send a solemne Messenger to prepare the wayes of the Lord or the Messias whom they did seeke: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Messenger should be <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, the same indiuiduall person which was taken vp in a fiery Chariot into heauen, or some other in power and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie of spirit, in zeale to Gods true worship and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion like vnto him, they were ignorant. And to haue beene meerely ignorant had beene no fault, or at least no dangerous fault: but this their ignorance declined to errour and stiffe presumption, that this Messenger foretold <hi>Malachy</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. should be <hi>Eliah</hi> the <hi>Tish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi> himselfe. They had a true prenotion or beliefe in generall, that the Messias his comming into the world, or manifestation to it, should be solemnized with some extraordinary Rite or Ceremony to bee performed by water; as by washing or baptizing: but whether this solemnity of <hi>baptizing</hi> or washing should bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Messias himselfe, or by <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they lookt should be his messenger, or by the Prophet like to <hi>Moses,</hi> (who as they expected, should bee a person distinct from Christ;) In all these points they were ignorant, at least doubtfull. Howbeit their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion of this <hi>indefinite</hi> or <hi>generall truth</hi> did most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline vnto the first point, to wit, that this <hi>solemnity</hi> of baptizing should be performed by the Christ or Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias himselfe. Thus much may probably bee gathered

from <hi>Iohns</hi> emphaticall deniall that he was the Christ <note place="margin">Mem. 2.

And he confessed and denyed not: but confessed, I am not the Christ. Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. Thus much he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed voluntarily, as may be gathered from Saint <hi>Luke: And as the people were in expectation, and all men mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their hearts of Iohn, whether hee were the Christ or not: Iohn answered, saying vnto them all, I indeede baptize you with water, but one mightier than I commeth, the latchet of whose Shooes I am not worthy to vnloose, hee shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire. Luke</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16. This voluntary acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, was in effect to deny that hee was the Christ: but what hee here intimates by way of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or preuention of the people that doubted whether hee were the Christ or no, he plainely expresseth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing solemnely and formally asked the same Question by the Priests and Leuites, which the people tacitly made; <hi>I am not the Christ.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 20.</note> Now, his answer to this first interrogatory, being so full and plaine; they frame a second, <hi>What then? Art thou Elias?

                  <hi>Elias which was for to come.</hi> And againe, <hi>Marke</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>When the Apostles asked him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Why say the Scribes that Elias must first come;</hi> (to wit, before the consummation of the hopes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, or their redemption by the Messias) <hi>He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and told them, Elias verily commeth first, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things, and how it is written of the Sonne of man, that hee must suffer many things, and bee set at nought. But, I say vnto you, that Elias indeed is come, and they haue done vnto him what soeuer they listed, as it is written of him.</hi> This hee spake of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> after hee was beheaded. And what reason had <hi>Iohn</hi> to deny he was <hi>Elias,</hi> when he was asked this Question, seeing our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, after his denyall, hath twice affirmed it? <hi>[Non male respondit, malè enim prior ille rogauit.]</hi> The fore-man or speaker of the Priests and Leuites, did propound this Question amisse, and in such a sence, as <hi>Iohn</hi> could not answer affirmatiuely to it. For the meaning of the Interrogatory was, Whether he were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7861:43"/>
that very <hi>Elias</hi> the Thisbite, which was taken vp into <note place="margin">Mem. 2 Branch 2.</note> Heauen in the fiery Charriot; and <hi>Iohn</hi> knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe not to be this <hi>Elias,</hi> nor did our Sauiour euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that he was this <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39. But some men happely will reply, That albeit they were mistaken in this particular, to which <hi>Iohn</hi> did well to giue a negatiue answer; yet <hi>Iohn,</hi> hauing so faire an occasion to rectifie the error of the Priests and Leuites, might haue done better, if hee had more fully expressed himselfe, and answered with a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he was not <hi>Elias</hi> the Thisbite, but yet <hi>that Elias</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> had fore-told the Lord would send, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. For <hi>Iohn</hi> could not, in all probability, be ignorant of the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> his meaning, seeing the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> had expresly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to his Father <hi>Zachrias, Luke</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>Hee shall goe before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turne the hearts of the Fathers vnto the children, and the disobedient to the wisdome of the iust, to make readie a people prepared for the LORD.</hi> But this perhaps was more than <hi>Iohn</hi> had occasion to call to minde. He might be ignorant, without offence, whether <hi>Elias</hi> himselfe was not to come after him. For euen the best of Gods Saints and Prophets (as was obserued before,) knew no more of Gods will concerning things to come, than it was his will and pleasure to impart vnto them. Each of them knew his Cue, the the signes of the time when hee was to begin, and when to end; each had the part, which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted him to vtter or act, perfectly by heart; Each knew the tenor of his owne Commission: but none, or few of them, did so well vnderstand anothers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7861:44"/>
vntill they had seene it sped, or the meaning of it vnfolded by the euent. Now, although the words of <hi>Malachy</hi> were literally meant of <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> yet were they a kinde of Riddle, vntill our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did vnfold them. And it seemeth by the phrase which our Sauiour vseth, <hi>Matthew</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. that their true meaning was a mystery, which he himselfe or <hi>Iohn</hi> onely knew, and was to bee reuealed onely to such as were already true Disciples.

Finally, although <hi>Malachy</hi> did prophesie of <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> comming before Christ <hi>in the power and spirit of Elias;</hi> yet <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did not receiue his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions from this Prophet, nor had hee his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for being Christs fore-runner, or his warrant

for baptizing from <hi>Malachy,</hi> but from the Prophet <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Isay.</hi> And therefore when the Priests and Leuites prest him further, saying, <hi>Who art thou, that wee may giue an answere to them that sent vs? What sayest thou of thy selfe? He said, I am the voyce of one crying in the Wildernesse, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet Esaias.</hi> This was the peremptory answer which he meant to stand vnto. This, and other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the same Prophet being ioyned with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall testimony of the Spirit, which did interpret their true meaning vnto him, was his warrant for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he did; for baptizing, or for preparing the way of the Lord which was to come. But whether the Lord would send <hi>Elias</hi> or some other greater messenger than himselfe, was more than he durst take vpon him to resolue the Priests and Leuites in, (speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seeing they were of the sect of the Pharises:) and more perhaps than hee in his religious modesty or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety did question or inquire after. But when the same Priests and Leuites did by way of demand or Interrogation seeme to vpbraid him with arrogancy, in taking more vpon him than was befitting him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he were eyther the Christ, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like to <hi>Moses;</hi> to some of which so great a worke as the administration of baptisme did solely belong: hee modestly answeres <hi>[distinguende;] I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you, whom yee know not: He it is, who comming after mee, is preferred before mee, whose Shooes latchet I am not worthy to vnloose.

I will not trouble you, but rather request you not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your selues with that needlesse Question (and for the most part as ill stated by such as haue most med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it, as it is needlesse) <hi>how Iohns baptisme did differ from Christs baptisme,</hi> or Whether they were two baptismes altogether distinct.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Thus much you may euidently conceiue out of what hath beene now deliuered. First, that the Priests and Leuites (at least the Sect of the Pharises, of which Sect, the Priests and Leuites which questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iohn</hi> concerning his Baptisme, were) did not erre in their prenotion or beliefe in generall, that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias his comming or manifestation to the world, should be solemnized by Baptisme, nor did they fayle in their coniecture, that the Christ or Messias himselfe was to baptize: but with what baptisme hee was to baptize, they were ignorant. Secondly, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had not onely a prenotion, but a distinct beliefe or knowledge in particular; that as he himselfe did baptize with water, so the Christ or Messias, whose fore-runner hee was, should baptize with the holy Ghost and with fire. The onely vsefull or pertinent questions which remaine to be resolued or discussed, are but two. The first,</p>
               <p n="1">[1.] Whether the Priests and Leuites, or the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises had their prenotions or beliefe in generall, [that the Messias his first manifestation to the world, should be solemnized by baptizme] from vnwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Ancients onely, or whether it were groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the expresse testimony of Scripture, or
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7861:45"/>
the written Word of God. The second, <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">[2.] Whether <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> firme beliefe of Christs baptizing with the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> and his owne baptizing with water, were grounded onely vpon the internall reuelations made to him in priuate, by him that <hi>sent</hi> him to <hi>baptize</hi> with water; or whether they were grounded likewise vpon expresse testimonies of the written Word, interpreted and made knowne vnto him by the same spirit by which the Word was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>To both these Questions the answere must be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue; as well the ones prenotion, as the others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct beliefe, were both grounded vpon the expresse testimonies of the written Word. The onely search or inquiry then to be made, is vpon what expresse te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony the one or other was grounded, and how our beliefe may be grounded vpon the same testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p n="42">42. I must request you to remember, that God in the Old Testament did fore-shew things to come two wayes: eyther by expresse testimony or prediction, or by matter of fact or reall representation. One and the same future euent is oft times declared or fore-sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified both wayes. Now predictions merely prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall are of two sorts. Sometimes the Prophets fore-tell <note place="margin">Two sorts or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the literall sence.</note> things to come in proper and literall termes, so as euery man at the first hearing may vnderstand their meaning. As the Prophet spake to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings chap.</hi> 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 42. <hi>Because thou hast let goe out of thy hand a man, whom I appoynted to vtter destruction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy life shall goe for his life, and thy people for his people.</hi> Sometimes they fore-tell future euents of

greater consequence, as truely &amp; as certainely, but by way of parable, embleme, or allegory. Now, this kind of prediction, and the types or figures of the Law, or reall euents, haue the same proportion as Poetry and painting. It was wittily said, <hi>[Poema est pictura lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens, &amp; pictura est Poema silens,] Euery Poem is a kind of speaking picture, and euery artificiall picture a kinde of mute and silent Poem.</hi> And so likewise euery type or ceremony of the Law, <note n="*" place="margin">Hence saith our Sauiour, <hi>Mat.</hi>

And this kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall expression of things to come, we call the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall sence or literall Allegory: so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though euery Poet bee not a Prophet, yet euery Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Lord was a true Poet; not in faigning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents which neuer were, nor neuer should be, but in framing pictures of future euents in themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, as <hi>exact</hi> and fresh, as any Painter can make of the man whom hee seeth with his eyes, or whose pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath beene drawne to his hand.

Howbeit some of these Prophesies, perhaps some passages in all of them, point out future euents in literall proper and historicall termes. And of euents thus literally and punctually fore-shewed, some came not to passe vntill the Messias was reuealed: Others were histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically verefied long before; yet so, as the euents which then hapned, were by Gods institution true types or shaddowes of mysteries reuealed in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or to bee reuealed during the time of grace. So that one and the same Prophesie, is sometimes or in respect of some part of its totall obiect, fulfilled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plaine literall sense: sometimes, or in respect of other parts of its obiect, it is fulfilled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literall Allegory: sometimes, or in some respect, it is fulfilled according to the mystical sense or reall Allegory.

               <p n="44">44. From these &amp; the like particulars in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, we may obserue this generall; That in all or most places, wherein the manifestation of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, or propagation of his Kingdome is mentioned, there is still foretold some strange miracle or wonder to be wrought in the desart, and in particular the bursting out of waters. The question is, in what sense these and like places haue beene fulfilled, or whether the predictions were plainely literall, or rather by way of Parable or Allegory. Whatsoeuer may bee said or thought of some of these predictions, certaine it is, that others of them were neuer verefied or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled according to the literall, plaine or natural sense of the words, either before or about our Sauiours manifestation in the wildernesse. That is as much as to say, The mysteries heere truely foretold vpon <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, were not fore-shaddowed or prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by matter of deed or fact, or by any such reall representation as these words properly imply; or by any naturall or visible alteration of the soyle or trees in the wildernesse. Onely the manner of the Prophesie or prediction is Emblematicall or Allegoricall, that is, the mysteries heere fore-told, were such in respect of mens soules, bodies, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as these alterations in the soile or trees of the wildernesse (if they had literally falne out) might haue beene true shaddowes or pictures of them. To begin with that place whence <hi>Iohns</hi> Commission tooke his beginning. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 40. <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>The voyce</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:7861:48"/>
                  <hi>of him that cryeth in the wildernesse, Prepare yee the way of the Lord, make straight in the desart a high way for our God. Euery Valley shall bee exalted, and euery Mountaine and Hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made streight, and the rough places plaine.</hi> We are not hence to beleeue, as some later Iewes foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreame, that all the Hils in the wildernesse or place where the Messias was to be ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ifested, were to be leuelled with the Valleys or lower ground; or that all the high-waies for men to come vnto him, should be made as plaine &amp; smooth as a bowling-Alley or Garden walke. The intent or purport of the Prophet was, that this <hi>Cryer</hi> in the wildernesse was so to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the hearts, the affections, and dispositions of mens minds, that they should not bee offended in Christ or the Messias, when he should be reuealed; that they should remoue all stumbling blockes of pride, arrogancy, couetousnesse, peruersnesse, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, or the like, which did hinder them from comming vnto him with all their soules and all their hearts. So when it is said, <hi>The Lord would turne the thorne into the Firre tree, or the bryer into the Myrtle tree in the wildernesse;</hi> we must not imagine such a reall or corporeall transmutation vpon our Sauiours approach. For if this Metamorphosis had bin made, <hi>Iohn</hi> should not haue been a Cryer in the <hi>wildernesse,</hi> but in the garden.

And there hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the hungry to dwell; that he may prepare a City for habitation.</hi> Psalm. 107. vers. 35, 36. Yet because this is but probable or coniecturall, wee will make it no ground of our intended inference. Supposing then that these predictions were as meerely figuratiue or metaphoricall as the former, they might not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding truely and prophetically prefigure, or by way of Embleme fore-shaddow, aswell the internall comfort of the Spirit wherewith Christ baptizeth vs, as the externall baptisme of water which <hi>Iohn</hi> administred. The water, you know, hath two naturall properties, from which many metaphors (vsuall in sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) are borrowed; by which the true intent and meaning of the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> figuratiue or emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall expressions of the waters in the wildernesse is to be valued. The first naturall property of water, (specially in hotter countries, where thirst is more vehement, and waters more pleasant) is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh or comfort the wearie soule: The second, to bee the <hi>Nurse</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> of fruitfulnesse, aswell in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7861:50"/>
trees or grasse of the Field, as in plants, hearbes, or flowres of the garden. According to this latter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the Prophets prediction of springs bursting out in the wildernesse, was a true Poeticall Embleme or shaddow of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptizing with water, who was to be by his office, as the Gardiner, to water and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish those fruitfull trees and plants of righteousnesse, with which God had promised to adorne the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For euen the Publicans and sinners, Aliens by nature from the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> beeing made partakers of the baptisme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> were ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Abrahams</hi> stocke, made fruitfull branches of that Vine which GOD had planted in Iewrie, and heyres of that heauenly Kingdome which <hi>Iohn</hi> did preach: whilest <hi>Abrahams</hi> seede according to the flesh were dis-inherited. <hi>All the people that heard him, and the Publicans iustified God, being baptized with the baptisme of Iohn. But the Pharises and Lawyers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected the counsell of God against themselues, beeing not baptized of him. Luk.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30. <hi>vide Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. According to the first naturall property of water, which is, to refresh the weary, or such as are ready to faint for thirst, the same predictions of <hi>springs or waters bursting forth in the wildernesse,</hi> did prefigure the internall comfort of the spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ alone baptizeth vs. For though <hi>Iohn</hi> did plant and water those plants of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> yet was it Christ alone that gaue the increase. And this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall baptisme was really fore-shaddowed, not onely by figuratiue or Propheticall manner of speech, but by historicall and reall matter of fact. And so likewise was the externall baptisme by water literally foretold
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7861:50"/>
by the Prophet <hi>Isaias,</hi> that it should be a type or signe <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note> of Christs baptisme with the Spirit. This internal bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, (to omit other instances) was really fore-shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by the waters which issued out of the rocke in the Wildernesse, when the people murmured against <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> as if they had brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth out of Aegypt to haue killed them with thirst in the desart. Now this wee take as granted, that euery miracle which God wrought in the Old Testament, was a true shaddow or picture of some great mystery to bee fulfilled in the New Testament, or after the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of Christ. In this the Iewes agree with vs; onely they expect, that the miracles which their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias should worke, should be more glorious to the eye of sense, than those which <hi>Moses</hi> wrought. But wee say they are not onely greater, but of another kinde: otherwise they shold not be true miraculous mysteries but meer miracles. Now that the waters issuing out of the rock, were a type or shaddow of this mystical bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of the Spirit, wee haue the testimonies of the Prophet <hi>Esay, Chap.</hi> 48. <hi>verse</hi> 28. before cited. and of the Apostle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our Fathers were vnder the cloud, and all passed thorow the Sea, and were all baptized vnto Moses in the cloud and in the Sea; and did all eate the same spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meate; and did all drinke the same spirituall drinke: For they dranke of that spirituall rocke that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them: and that Rocke was Christ.</hi> How was it Christ? not literally, not identically. Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the God-head, was not so present in, or so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the rocke, as he is now to our flesh; yet was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7861:51"/>
it Christ, the second person in Trinity, the Sonne of God, which made the water (wherewith the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, his people, were comforted and refreshed in the extremity of their bodily thirst) to issue out of the rocke when <hi>Moses</hi> smote it. The mystery porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or fore-shaddowed by this miracle herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; That the same Sonne of God (who was truely God) <hi>which</hi> gaue them plenty of water out of the rock, should afterwards become the Rocke of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; the Fountaine of life vnto the thirsty and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soule. This internall baptisme, which was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fore-shaddowed by the waters in the rocke, was literally fore-told. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 36. <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>They shall bee abundantly satisfied with the fatnesse of thy house: and thou shalt make them drinke of the Riuers of thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.

According to this sense is that other place of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> fulfilled in Christ, that is, in <hi>God made man; The Lord shall reigne for euer, euen thy God, O Sion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Generations. Psal.</hi> 146. <hi>v.</hi> 10. That the God of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as God, should reigne for euer, was no new thing, no matter of wonder, or worth notice-taking to any Inhabitant of Ierusalem or man of Iudah. All of them, (from the least vnto the greatest) knew well that Hee which had made the World, had no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no end of dayes or soueraignety. But that this God of Sion, who was Lord likewise of Heauen and Earth, should be as visibly enthronized in Sion as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> had beene; and that hee should begin to erect a Kingdome which was neuer to haue an end; this was a wonder worthy to bee taken notice of by all the world. Now, that this God of Sion, by whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection <hi>Moses</hi> had led Israel out of Aegypt, vnder whose conduct <hi>Iosuah</hi> brought them into the Land of Promise, that hee who had anoynted <hi>Dauid</hi> King, should himselfe be anoynted King ouer Sion, was the true and literall meaning of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in this and the like places; of which hereafter. Of this ranke is that Prophesie of <hi>Isaias, chap.</hi> 40. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. with which <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was well acquainted; for hee had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from it: <hi>The glory of the Lord shall be reuealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</hi> Such an open, distinct, and full sight, as these words literally import, supposeth an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect truly visible and within ken of ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

sight. God in his glory is altogether inuisible to flesh and bloud, and though he had taken visible shape vpon him in the Heauens, yet so hee had still remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inuisible to men that haue their habitation here on earth. That vnto them hee might become visible, and that they might see his glory together; so see it, as they were seene of it; that hee might see them, and they see Him with the eyes of flesh: He tooke vp our flesh for his Tabernacle, and walked and talked amongst vs in more visible and audible manner than Hee did in the Campe of Israel, than He did with <hi>Moses</hi> in the Tabernacle of the Congregation. This which <hi>Isaias</hi> heere speaketh from the mouth of the Lord, the Lord himselfe did after vtter with his owne mouth, and yet with the mouth of man, <hi>to wit,</hi> that hee <hi>which had seene him, had seene his Father,</hi> because the glory of God was manifested in Him. And when the Prophet saith, <hi>That the glory of the Lord should bee reuealed, and that all flesh shall see it together,</hi> it is in this speech included, that this glory of God should bee reuealed or manifested in <hi>the flesh.</hi> The best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Prophets words that I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto you, must bee from Saint <hi>Iohn. chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 14. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Mount. But all that saw the man Christ Iesus at his <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2</note> Baptisme with their bodily eyes, did so see the glory of God reuealed from Heauen. And he was so seene of all flesh. <hi>Some</hi> of all sorts, though not all of euery sort, did see him baptized, and heard him declared from Heauen to be the Sonne of God. Some then present were Pharises, others Sadduces, some Iewes, others Gentiles, some Publicanes, some Priests and Leuites, some Samaritanes, others Galileans. Not at that time onely (though the Prophets words be espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially meant of that time) but euer after, all flesh might haue seene the liuely characters of those <hi>glorious</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Saluation, which the Prophets and Psalmist had appropriated to the God of Sion, to make distinct and reall impression in the man Christ Iesus.

miraculously issued out of the rocke. The best Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of both places is deliuered by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> by way of Comment vpon our Sauiours words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 38, 39. <hi>Hee that beleeueth on mee (as the Scripture hath said) out of his belly shall flow Riuers of liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> This intersertion or parenthesis <hi>[as the Scripture hath said]</hi> stands like the <hi>tongue</hi> in a ballance, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to whether part of the Sentence wherein it is contayned, it inclineth. Some Interpreters would draw it to the first part; <hi>Hee that beleeueth in mee, as saith the Scripture,</hi> that is, in such wise, such sort and measure as the Scripture requireth, <hi>out of his belly shall flow Riuers of liuing water.</hi> Others would draw it to the later part, and render it thus; <hi>Hee that beleeueth in mee, out of his belly shall flow Riuers of liuing water, as the Scriptures hath fore-told.</hi> Though both interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may be true, though both may stand with the generall Analogy of faith; yet the later (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) is more pertinent, and more consonant to the true intention of this place. But then it will be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, What Scripture hath said that, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour here doth, <hi>to wit,</hi> that riuers of liuing water should flow from such as beleeued in him? The very expresse words are no where else to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for they are, (as most of our Sauiours are, when hee speakes of greatest mysteries) parabolicall. Their importance, or reall sense, is expressed by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the same place; <hi>This hee spake of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> Now, if by the <hi>riuers of liuing</hi> water, our Sauiour meant (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs hee did) this plentifull effusion of his Spirit; the same Scriptures which fore-tell the plentifull effusion of the Spirit, whether in

termes plainely literall or emblematical, fore-tell like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch. 2.</note> the riuers of Liuing water which were to flow from true beleeuers. The manner of our Sauiours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Spirits effusion <hi>by riuers flowing out,</hi> implyeth, it should be powred out in such a plentifull measure, as would be not onely sufficient to satiate the soules of them that thirsted after it, but in a measure ouer-flowing to the Saluation of others. And such were these admirable gifts of the Holy Ghost, which after our Sauiours Ascension were bestowed vpon his Apostles and Disciples. The Scriptures, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly fore-tell this plentifull effusion of the Spirit, are many: these following are, if not the principall, yet the most apposite to our present Argument, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 28, 29, and 32. <hi>And it shall come to passe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that I will powre out my Spirit vpon all flesh, and your Sonnes and your Daughters shall prophesie, your old men shall dreame dreames, your young men shall see visions.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7861:54"/>
mysticall sense of the former words. And <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> might from this place alone easily collect, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee might powre water vpon mens bodies, though hee did plunge or wash such as are compared to dry Land, in the waters, and by this externall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ingraft them in the stocke of <hi>Abraham:</hi> yet he could not <hi>powre</hi> out the Spirit of God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the blessing of increase vpon them. This hee knew must be the worke of him that <hi>sent him,</hi> who had bestowed some portion or measure of the Spirit or blessing here mentioned vpon him, as a sure pledge or experiment of the like blessing to bee bestowed on others; specially on such as had beene partakers of his Baptisme. From the same place likewise <hi>Iohn</hi> might easily gather, that the <hi>baptisme</hi> of <hi>water</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee himselfe baptized, was in order of time to goe before the baptisme of the Spirit, which was my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically prefigured by it, and fore-told by our Sauiour in the fore-cited place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 38. though (as we said before) in a figuratiue or allegoricall sense, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the next words after, <hi>vers.</hi> 39. hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto vs: <hi>This spake hee of the Spirit, which they that beleeue on him, should receiue: For the Holy Ghost was not yet giuen, because that Iesus was not yet glorified. Iohns</hi> meaning is, <hi>the Spirit was</hi> not <hi>powred out</hi> in such plentifull measure, as this place of <hi>Isay</hi> and that other of the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> did import. For, after our Sauiours glorification, all such as were baptized with water, were likewise baptized with the Holy Ghost: most of them filled with the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or gift of tongues, enabled to conuey the words and waters of life vnto the soules of others. All this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7861:54"/>
was fore-signified by the holy Ghosts descending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note> our Sauiour at his comming out of the water. For his baptisme was a prefiguration of his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: and by his resurrection he was really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Sonne of God, and fulfilled the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists prediction; <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee.

Which prediction was further ratified, and the meaning of it determined by the voyce from heauen; <hi>This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleased.</hi> The same truth thus often declared as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by predictions as by matters of fact or reall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, was finally testified by the descending of the holy Ghost vpon his Apostles and Disciples. So that another Branch of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> meaning, or if you will, another <hi>shoote</hi> of the former branch, is, That the holy Ghost, at the time when our Sauiour vttered those words, <hi>Hee that beleeueth in me, &amp;c.</hi> did not appeare as an authentique witnesse to ratifie his Doctrine. His testimony concerning our Sauiour was reserued till our Sauiours glorification, after which it was <hi>publique, frequent</hi> and <hi>visible.</hi> Iesus, (saith Saint <hi>Peter) whom ye slew and hanged on a tree: Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Sauiour, for to giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Israel, and forgiuenes of sins.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7861:55"/>
to some, and these by condition Gentiles, before they had beene partakers of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, or any Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call rite or Sacrament. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44, 47. <hi>While Peter yet spake these words, the holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</hi> Whence he concludeth; <hi>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which haue receiued the holy Ghost, aswell as we?</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tooke more special notice of our Sauiours words from this experiment in <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family, than hee did from the holy Ghost descending in cloue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tongues vpon himselfe and his fellow Apostles, which had beene baptized: <hi>And as I began to speake, the holy Ghost fell on them, as on vs at the beginning. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred 1 the Word of the Lord, how that hee said, Iohn deed baptized with water, but yee shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Acts</hi> 11. 15, 16. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> beliefe in this point, was grounded vpon our Sauiours words, and confirmed by this experiment: <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the same conclusion, was grounded vpon the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> predictions. <hi>Iohn</hi> did foretell the same <note place="margin">Matth. 3. vers. 11.</note> truth which our Sauiour did, before he was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him or knew him by face: and yet <hi>Iohns</hi> knowledge or beliefe of this mysterie was confirmed by a visible signe, by the descending of the holy Ghost. Concerning which, and the maner how <hi>Iohn</hi> came to know our Sauiour before he baptized him, with the signes of the time that did accompany or ensue vpon his baptisme, we are in the next place to make enquirie.</p>
               <p n="48">48. From the: former Dialogue betweene the Priests and Leuites and <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> concerning his office and ministery of Baptisme, you may obserue,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7861:55"/>
that <hi>Iohn</hi> was carefull to preuent two inconueniences: <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note> First, the false opinion which the people had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him, as if he had bin the Messias himselfe; and secondly, to preuent all suspition of compact or collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion betweene Iesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> (whom he afterward proclaimes to be the Messias) and himselfe. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this suspition both parties had beene more lyable, if they had beene aswell acquainted before our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours baptisme, as afterward they were. Not to speake of our Sauiours knowledge, who knew all things; for <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, hee had a true prenotion or distinct beliefe of these generals or <hi>indefinites.</hi> 1. That the time wherein the Messias was to bee manifested vnto <hi>Israel,</hi> was now approaching. 2. That the Messias was to repaire vnto the place where hee baptized, there to bee declared or manifested vnto Israel. 3. That the Messias after his manifestation, was to baptize others with the holy Ghost. These generals he beleeued and knew from the predictions of the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him by the internall reuelation of the Spirit, and the signes of the time immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But of these particulars following, he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant vntill the euent, and the signes immediately following did vnfold them. 1. The day and houre wherein the Messias was first to be manifested; when he first begun to baptize, he distinctly knew not. 2. The day and houre of the Messias comming vnto him being knowne, yet he knew not how to distinguish the Messias from other men by face or sight. 3. After he had knowne &amp; seene him face to face, yet he knew not whether he should baptize him with others or no: but rather presupposed it as a matter vnfitting, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7861:56"/>
the messenger, whose Commission onely was to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with water, should baptize his Lord and Master, whom he knew to be sent of purpose to baptize others with the holy Ghost. This last point is euident from Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 3. vers. 13, 14, 15. <hi>When Iesus came from Galilee to Iordane vnto Iohn, to be baptized of him; Iohn forbade him, saying, I haue neede to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of thee, and comest thou to me? And Iesus answering, said vnto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vs to fulfill all righteousnes. Then he suffered him.</hi>

                  <hi>Sonne of God.</hi> But whilest I am a twisting these two Euangelicall narrations together, you haue perhaps already espied or may hereafter espie a knot or riuell, where with your beliefe one time or another may bee entangled; specially, if the Iew, Atheist, or Libertine should draw it faster, or a weake Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue the handling of it. That you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know, whensoeuer occasion shall be offered, how to loose or vntwist the knot, giue mee leaue first to cast it. For as the great Philosopher telleth vs; No man knoweth rightly how to assoile or resolue a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, vnlesse he first know how to frame it. The right making of any obiection (as the same Philosopher tels vs) is more then halfe the solution of it. The doubt or knot which ariseth out of the two narrations of the <note place="margin">A seeming contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt S. <hi>Matthew</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Iohn</hi> fully clce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Euangelists, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> is framed thus: First, it is euident out of them both, as also out of the other two Euangelists, that the Holy Ghost did not descend vpon our Sauiour vntill <hi>Iohn</hi> had bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him. It is euident againe out of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> words fore-cited, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 33. That the descending of the Holy Ghost vpon our Sauiour, and his <hi>resting vpon him,</hi> was giuen by God himselfe vnto <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> for a signe, whereby to know or distinguish the Messias or him that was to <hi>baptize with the holy Ghost,</hi> from all other men. Now if <hi>Iohn</hi> knew him by face from all other men, before the Spirit did descend and rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, what needed this signe? And if he knew him not by face before the descending of the holy Ghost, what construction can we make of Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> words before recited, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. where he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7861:57"/>
saith, <hi>That when Iesus came to be baptized of him, Iohn replyed, I haue need to be baptized of thee, and commest thou to me?</hi> For to whom could the Baptist himselfe in good earnest say, <hi>I haue need to be baptized of thee,</hi> saue onely vnto him whom hee knew could baptize him <hi>with the holy Ghost and with fire?</hi> And if <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> knew Iesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> at his first comming to him, to be the man, which was to baptize with the holy Ghost, before he had seene the holy Ghost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending vpon him (as out of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, that he did so know him) How is it true which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith in the person of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, <hi>I knew him not?</hi> that is, in ordinary construction, as if he had said, I had not knowne him, but by the descending and resting of the holy Ghost vpon him.</p>
               <p n="50">50. The seeming contradiction betwixt these two Euangelists, hath occasioned some of the Ancients to conceite, that the Holy Ghost did twice descend vpon our Sauiour: once before his baptisme; (of which descension, <hi>Iohn</hi> onely or some few more were spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, and by this signe in priuate <hi>Iohn</hi> did know him, before hee came in publike to bee baptized of him,) and againe immediately after his baptisme. But a man cannot more strengthen or confirme a weake, crasie or vnsound obiection, than by giuing it a lame, vnsolid or vnsatisfactory answere. The one part of this distinction consisting meerely in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would serue as a foile, to giue some tincture or colour of truth vnto the obiected Contradiction, which if it be well examined and better looked into, consists onely in appearance. <hi>Iansenius</hi> seekes to salue this obiected contradiction in this manner: <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="51">51. <hi>Maldonat</hi> hauing framed the like answer in effect as <hi>Iansenius</hi> doth, seekes to illustrate it thus by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Albeit Iohn Baptist did no more know our Sauiour by face from other men, than Samuel did the sonnes of Iesse, one of which he was appointed to anoynt King in Sauls stead ouer Israel; yet when our Sauiour came to bee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, he might know him to be the Messias, by some such Diuine instinct or reuelation, as Samuel knew Dauid,</hi> whose face he had neuer seene before, to be the man whom God had appointed him to anoynt King ouer Israel. But of this (otherwise iudicious) Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in his expositions of Prophesies, or of the manner how Scriptures are said to be fulfilled, that may bee truely said, which the <hi>French</hi> Mathematician did of <hi>Cardanus</hi> his writings; [<note n="*" place="margin">Monath. in Arist.

For it is euident out of the Historie mentioned, 1. <hi>Sam. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. That although <hi>Samuel</hi> knew none of <hi>Iesse's</hi> sonnes by face, yet he had distinct reuelations from God, some negatiue and expresse, <hi>Looke not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature, because I haue refused him. vers.</hi> 7. Others againe, as expressely assertory. For when <hi>Dauid</hi> was brought before him, <hi>The Lord said, Arise, anoynt him: for this is hee. vers.</hi> 12. <hi>Samuel</hi> had no visible signe giuen from God, whereby to know the man, whom he was to anoynt, from his brethren;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7861:58"/>
but was meerely to rely vpon such reuelations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions <note place="margin">Mem. 2.

But God, as you heard before, had giuen to <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> an expresse visible signe, whereby to distinguish the Messias, or <hi>him</hi> that was to baptize with the Holy Ghost, from all other men. God did not promise him any such new reuelations or instructions, whereby to know him before his Baptisme, or in the act of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, as he expresly promised to <hi>Samuel.</hi> Nor doth the Euangelist eyther mention or intimate any such reuelations, as the History saith were giuen to <hi>Samuel,</hi> to haue beene giuen or made vnto <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> before the Holy Ghost did descend vpon our Sauiour. So that, such reuelations or instructions as <hi>Maldonat</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, were on <hi>Samuels</hi> part altogether necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee had no visible signe giuen him: but in this businesse of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> altogether superfluous. The exhibition or production of the visible signe which God had promised him, was the onely new reuelation which he was to rely vpon.</p>
               <p n="52">52. I will not trouble you with the variety of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions or expositions of seuerall <hi>Commentators,</hi> from none of which I haue receyued any full satisfaction my selfe. All of them haue omitted one poynt, which in euery controuersie ought in the first place to be enquired after. And it is this; <hi>Whether there be not a Meane betweene the opposite or controuerted opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> The opposite opinions in this argument are two: The one, That the holy Ghost did descend vpon our

Sauiour in <hi>Iohns</hi> presence, before he was baptized by <hi>Iohn:</hi> The other, That <hi>Iohn</hi> did know our Sauiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his baptisme, by some speciall immediate reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit. Now, it is not necessary that <hi>Iohn</hi> should know him by eyther of these two waies. There is an apparant <hi>meane</hi> or middle way betwixt them, by which <hi>Iohn</hi> might come to such knowledge as he had of our Sauiour, before the Holy Ghost did in the sight of the people descend vpon him. And this meane, wee may suppose to bee the opening or vnfolding of some Propheticall passage, whose meaning (before) <hi>Iohn</hi> had neyther occasion in particular to obserue, nor opportunity to discerne. Howbeit, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Scriptures may be called a reuelation, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and <hi>mediate,</hi> such as the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell may at this day haue by the helpe of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, by collation of Scripture with Scripture, or of historicall euents with Prophesies precedent: the signes of the time being in all ages the best Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, and as it were <hi>substitutes</hi> to the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie or Reuelation. Now, although the Euangelist neyther mention any speciall reuelation made vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> after God had giuen him a signe, whereby to know our Sauiour, nor intimate any probable ground for such coniectures: yet they (Saint <hi>Marke</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) relate such circumstances of our Sauiours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Iohn,</hi> as might well occasion him to call to minde, a peculiar passage concerning Christs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perhaps had not beene thought of, or whose meaning, although hee had thought of it, <hi>Iohn</hi> could not for the present haue vnderstood, without such

Comments or Expositions as the manner of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch. 2.</note> comming to Baptisme did make vpon it. Now, the testimonies of the Scripture long before written, especially the Propheticall testimonies or predictions of things to come, are no way superfluous, eyther where new reuelations (though made by God to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prophets <hi>viua voce)</hi> or visible signes are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or promised, but rather subordinate and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: that is, (to speake more plainely) as well all new reuelations made by the Spirit (whether <hi>viua voce,</hi> or otherwise,) as all visible signes or wonders, which God doth promise or worke, are to be examined and authorised by his Word already written, specially by the predictions of the Prophets. And all new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, or visible signes or wonders, which haue beene, are, or shall be, if they proceed from God or the spirit of Truth, are alwayes true Commentaries or expositions of some part or other of the written Word, and pledges withall of some greater Mystery to come; afterwards to bee fulfilled for their good, to whom such reuelations or signes are giuen and made.</p>

All this is euident from the Euangelists, especially from the Euangelist Saint <hi>Luke, chap.</hi> 3. For <hi>Iohn</hi> bestowed a distinct Sermon or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation vpon euery distinct sort or profession of men that came to bee baptized of him. Vnto the Pharises and Sadduces which came to his Baptisme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other multitudes of people, hee said; <hi>O gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruites worthy of Repentance, and begin not to say within your selues, Wee haue Abraham to our Father.

Now, after all these were baptized, (yet all these being still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with <hi>Iohn, that all flesh,</hi> as the Prophet fore-told, <hi>might see the glory,</hi> or, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>the Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God;)</hi> our Sauiour came to be baptized of <hi>Iohn.</hi> And inasmuch as <hi>Iohn</hi> before this time did neyther know him by face, or by name; there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he would require both his name, his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and place of dwelling, before he would admit him vnto Baptisme, vnlesse our Sauiour happely did in both preuent him.

And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest vpon him, the spirit of wisdome and vnderstanding, &amp;c.</hi> This prediction or Propheticall testimony is of the same ranke or kinde, that all or most of this Prophets predictions which concerne the mystery of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptizing our Sauiour, were before obserued to be; <hi>that is,</hi> a prediction not giuen in lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, plaine, Grammaticall termes, but in termes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall or emblematicall: such as was <hi>Iothams</hi> prediction of <hi>Abimelechs</hi> and the men of <hi>Sechems</hi> ruine, by the Parable of the Trees of the Forrest: or such as <hi>Isayes</hi> fore-picturing the destruction of Iudah and Ierusalem, by the Parable of the Vineyard, which was to be layed waste by its Lord and Owner; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in stead of Grapes, it brought forth wild grapes. The Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> in the later end of the tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the words immediately preceding to the late-cited Testimony had said, <hi>Behold, The Lord, the Lord of Hoasts shall lop the bough with terrour: and the high-ones of stature shall be hewne downe, and the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shall bee humbled. And hee shall cut downe the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of the Forrest with Iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mightie one. vers.</hi> 33, 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the fall of Lebanon, a Forrest famous amongst the Nations for tall &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cedars, hee fore-pictures the extirpation of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> Royall Race by <hi>Salomon</hi> and his Successours, or the pulling downe the mighty from their seates: By

In the later part of the Prophesie, (which is the beginning of the eleuenth Chapter) the Prophet fully expounds himselfe, That the intent or purpose of the Prophesie, was to instruct the people, that when the Off-spring of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and hope of <hi>Iudah</hi> should seeme in a manner vtterly cut off, (as it was to all mens thinking in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great,) yet then there should spring a Rod out of the stemme of <hi>Iesse,</hi> and a Branch out of his roote, which should rayse the House of <hi>Dauid</hi> (now ruined) vnto grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter height than euer it had. By this <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Branch,</hi> the Prophet vnderstands a man; for hee termes him the Rod or Branch of <hi>Iesse,</hi> (who was <hi>Dauids</hi> Father:) But a man, that should be better able to rule and feede the people of Israel than <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, the chiefe stemme of <hi>Iesse,</hi> or <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne, or any other King of Iudah had beene. The extraordinary gifts or qualifications, which the Prophet fore-telleth that the Spirit of the Lord, which was to rest vpon him, would bestow vpon this Rod of <hi>Iesse,</hi> are such as can appertaine to none, saue onely to the Messias him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>that is,</hi> to the Lords Anoynted, or him that was to be anoynted with the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="55">55. The greatest offence which the Iewes tooke at our Sauiour, was that hee came not forth of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> the City of <hi>Dauid,</hi> but from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a Towne in Galilee; that his education was so meane, and his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7861:62"/>
parentage so poore. Now, this offence, the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> (so they would haue vnderstood him) had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preuented, fore-telling that hee should grow vp as a Rod out of the stemme of <hi>Iesse,</hi> and as a Branch out of his roote. This did truely fore-picture, that hee should bee of meaner parentage than <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe had beene, as being to spring out of the decayed stem or root of <hi>Iesse.</hi> Againe, the very word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, <hi>[Netser]</hi> signifying a Rod, did picture out vnto vs, the very place wherein hee was to grow vp as a Rod, vntill hee came to be declared vnto Israel by the Spirit of God descending vpon him. For the Towne of <hi>Nazareth</hi> hath its very name from the word heere vsed by the Prophet <hi>Isaias, [Netser]</hi> and is as much in English, as the Towne of <hi>Rods</hi> or <hi>Grafts.</hi> Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Iohn</hi> did not know this Rod or Branch of <hi>Iesse,</hi> before hee came vnto him to be baptized, yet his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name, being IESVS, which is a Sauiour, and the name of the place whence hee came, <hi>Natzareth [a Towne of Rods,]</hi> could not but suggest thus much to <hi>Iohn;</hi> That seeing the holy Ghost, or Spirit of God was to descend vpon some one that came vnto his Baptisme, and to rest vpon him; there was none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the multitudes, that came vnto him, in whom this prediction or signe which God had giuen him, could be so fulfilled, as in this Iesus of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> and thus certainely expecting, that the Spirit of God would descend vpon him, he refused, as Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> telleth vs, to baptize him, saying; <hi>I haue need to be baptized of thee, &amp;c.</hi> Now, this very signe which God gaue to <hi>Iohn</hi> how to know him, was giuen before by the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> in the place fore-cited. For, in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7861:62"/>
that he is termed a Rod or Branch, on which the Spirit of the Lord should rest, it is imported, that the maner <note place="margin">Mem. 2 Branch. 2.</note> of his resting should be as a Bird or Fowle doth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a stemme or branch. So that all which God in the signe giuen to <hi>Iohn</hi> doth adde vnto the Prophesie, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct expression of the Bird or Fowle, in whose shape or bodily likenesse the Spirit was to descend and rest vpon him; and that was in the shape or bodily like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a Doue. So then <hi>Iohn</hi> before our Sauiours baptisme, had the Testimony of the Prophet, that the Spirit of the Lord would descend and rest vpon the man whom he then first knew onely by the name of Iesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that is, of Iesus the Rod or Branch of <hi>Iesse.</hi> After our Sauiours baptisme, he had this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony or assurance of the Prophet, and his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it (when our Sauiour first came vnto him) fully sealed and warranted by the euidence of his bodily senses, by the visible experiment of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, descending in the likenesse of a Doue, by the voyce which he heard from Heauen, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="56">56. That this Prophesie of <hi>Isaias</hi> hath speciall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the time of our Sauiours baptisme, and to the Kingdome of heauen, which <hi>Iohn</hi> proclaimed, and into which his baptisme by water was as the doore or entrance; the very ceremonie or solemnity of mens admission vnto it doe testifie: and so doe the effects and fruites of the Spirits descending and resting vpon the <hi>Rod or Branch</hi> of <hi>Iesse,</hi> which fruits and effects are in the same Chapter at large described, and are of two sorts. The first sort concernes the Rod or Branch of <hi>Iesse</hi> himselfe, and these are set foorth in the 11. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7861:63"/>
of <hi>Isaias, vers.</hi> 3, 4, 5. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>shall make him of quicke vnderstanding in the feare of the Lord, and he shall not iudge after the sight of his eyes, neither reproue after the hearing of his eares. But with righteousnes shall he iudge the poore, and reproue with equitie, for the meeke of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And righteousnesse shall be the girdle of his loynes, and faithfulnesse the gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his reines.</hi> All these are heroicall endowments or qualifications for gouerment of so great a Kingdome, as the Prophet foretold this Rod of <hi>Iesse</hi> or Branch of <hi>Dauid</hi> was to erect. And of these qualifications here mentioned, the best gifts which the Lord bestowed on <hi>Dauid,</hi> on <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Salomon,</hi> or vpon other Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> at their anoyntments or inaugurations, were but shadowes or prefigurations. Now, the <hi>descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> of the Spirit of God here fore-told by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and resting vpon our Sauiour, was his anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and solemne inauguration or designement to his Kingdome. Not that he was instantly to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingdome of glory, or take possession of his heauenly Inheritance, but for a time to expect such troubles and persecutions in the attainement of it, as his father <hi>Dauid</hi> had suffered betweene the time wherein <hi>Samuel</hi> had anoynted him King in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iesses</hi> house at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and the time wherein hee was publikely anoynted King, after <hi>Sauls</hi> death, in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron.</hi> That our Sauiours anoyntment or designement to be King and Lord ouer Israel, doth beare date from the time that he was baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordane,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> testifies, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 37, 38. <hi>That word you</hi>

                  <hi>from Galilee, after the baptisme which Iohn preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: how God anoynted Iesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the diuell; for God was with him.</hi> The voice which at his anointment was heard from heauen, did plainely and openly declare him to be that sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of whom alone it was truely fulfilled, which <hi>Dauid</hi> by his spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie had foretold, <hi>That God should be vnto him a Father, and he should be vnto him a Sonne.</hi> And vpon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration made at his baptisme, the diuell, vnto whom some scattered sound of it happely came, might col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that he was <hi>[Dei Filius.]</hi> The first memorable Act his Father Dauid (after <hi>Samuel</hi> had anointed him) did vndertake, was his conflict with <hi>Goliah:</hi> and the first Act this Rod of <hi>Iesse,</hi> after his anoyntment vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh, was his encounter with Satan in single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. The other part of the fruites or concomitances of this our Sauiours anoyntment by the holy Ghost, is described at large in the 11. Chapter of <hi>Isaias, vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Wolfe also shall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard also shall lye downe with the Kid: and the Calfe and the young Lyon, and the fatling together, and a little Child shall leade them. And the Cow and the Beare shall feede, their young ones shall lye downe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the Lion shall eate straw like the Oxe. And the sucking Child shall play on the hole of the Aspe, and the weaned Child shal put his hand on the Cockatrice den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountaine: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters couer the Sea.</hi> The exact fulfilling of this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7861:64"/>
Prophesie in its literall sense, that is, according to the strict propriety of natiue or vnborrowed signification of words, <hi>[credat Iudaeus,]</hi> let it bee expected by the vnbeleeuing Iew, whose too much credulity to the <hi>letter</hi> hath brought forth an absolute infidelity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mysteries of his saluation. But whilest he expects such a league and amity betwixt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures heere mentioned, as the words literally import, he plainely declares himselfe to be more cruell, more rancorous &amp; vntamed, than the most rauenous beast, or most venemous creature heere mentioned. For, neither the sweet inuitation of our Sauiour, nor all the good deeds which he wrought amongst this people whilest he liued on earth, nor the punishing hand of God, which hath bin alwayes heauy vpon them since his death, hath to this day wrought such a placable or reconcileable disposition toward vs Gentiles, or toward their owne brethren which trust in Christ, as they expect in the dayes of their Messias, should be wrought in the Wolfe towards the Lambe, or in the Aspe or Cockatrice towards the Child or sucking Infant. We may take this amongst others, as a sure Argument of our Interest in the Womans Seede, in that this generation of Vipers or Serpents (as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> termes them) haue exercised the venemous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of Serpents against all that haue professed the name of Christ since his death. But the greater their enmity is vnto the profession of Christianity, or the longer it hath continued, the more strange and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable will that reconciliation or agreement seeme, which the Euangelist records to haue falne out at the time of our Sauiours baptisme or anoyntment; not

only betweene the Iew and the Gentile, but between <note place="margin">Mem. 2.

could the Pharisee and Publican, the Sadduces and <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch. 2.</note> the Heathen Soldiers ioyntly apprehend, that might mooue them to like peace or consort during the time of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, or before hee was to baptize our Sauiour? The Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> to my apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the conclusion of his Prophesie, intimateth some great plague or curse ready to fall either vpon the whole world, or at least vpon the Land of <hi>Iewry;</hi> vnlesse it were preuented by such meanes as the floud might haue beene, or as the destruction of <hi>Niniueh</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Ionas</hi> was preuented; that is, by humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and true repentance. And this humiliation of the people, or turning to the Lord by true repentance, was to be wrought, as <hi>Malachy</hi> speaketh, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliah,</hi> that is, as you heard before, by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist. The Prophets words are these; <hi>Behold, I will send you Eliah the Prophet, before the comming of the great and dreadfull day of the Lord. And he shall turne the heart of the Fathers vnto the children, and the heart of the children vnto the Fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Malac.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6. The best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this place is made by the Angell Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>And many of the children of Israel shall he turne to the Lord their God. And hee shall goe before him in the Spirit and power of Elias, to turne the hearts of the Fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisedome of the Iust, to make ready a people prepared to the Lord.</hi> Vnlesse some competent multitude had beene thus prepared to entertaine the Kingdome of grace, or the Gospell, or Christ Iesus the King in their hearts, his first comming had beene as dreadfull to the whole Land, as the vnworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7861:66"/>
of his body and blood was to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. God in his wisedome (as some of the Fathers very well obserue) had so ordained, that the same Element by which the old world (besides <hi>Noahs</hi> Family) were destroyed, should bee consecrated as an especiall meanes for preseruation of the new world. The baptisme of water which <hi>Iohn</hi> administred, was as a renouation or ratification of the promise which God had made to <hi>Noah:</hi> a visible signe, that GOD had freed the earth or Land of Iewry from that curse which <hi>Malachy</hi> speaks of, and was withall a visible pledge or sacrament of a new blessing. Whatsoeuer the curse or anger was, which hanged at this time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the peoples head, the Doue which descended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Sauiour at his baptisme, did bring to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration a more expresse release from it, and a more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne pardon for all their sinnes, than <hi>Noahs</hi> Doue did bring of <hi>Noahs</hi> and his families deliuerance from the curse of waters, or from the danger of the Floud, when she came with an Oliue branch in her mouth. Now, inasmuch as <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme by water, was as the <hi>[medius terminus,]</hi> or as the way and passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and that holy Catholike Church, which our Sauiour Christ was now to erect, whereof <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, as you heard before, was the expre type; it is no maruell if that which was literally fulfilled or verefied in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> were fulfilled according to its emblematicall importance or mysticall sense, in the dayes of <hi>Iohn</hi> or at his baptisme. The congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity betweene <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and the holy Catholike Church, or new Ierusalem which was now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from heauen, doth herein partly consist.

And there came a voyce to him, Rise,</hi> Peter, <hi>kill, and eate. But</hi> Peter <hi>said, Not so, Lord, for I haue neuer eaten any thing that is common or vncleane.

That matters of fact, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall representations by vision or apparences, are as truely doctrinall, as words vttered and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood according to the literall sense; wee neede no further proofe, than Saint <hi>Peters</hi> application of this vision, <hi>vers.</hi> 28. <hi>And hee said vnto them,</hi> (vnto <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> and his Italian friends and attendants) <hi>Ye know how that it is an vnlawfull thing for a man that is a Iew, to keepe company or come vnto one of another Nation: but God hath shewed mee</hi> (not in expresse words, but by vision or representation emblematicall) <hi>that I should not call any man common or vncleane.</hi> Nor did <hi>Peter</hi> in expresse termes or conceit, deem any man vnclean.

at this time had sanctified vnto his people, in token <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note> that men or Nations before vncleane, were now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of sanctification. The mystery included in this vision, was fulfilled in the baptisme with the Holy Ghost, and was prefigured by the admission as well of Publicans &amp; Roman Souldiers, as of Pharises, Iewes, or Proselytes, vnto the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Now, S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> owne interpretation of this vision, will warrant our former Interpretation of the Prophet <hi>Isay, cap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. as also, of most other places in this Prophet, which, as you heard before, were to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, not according to the literall, plaine, and Grammaticall signification of the words, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">One and the same portion of <hi>Isaias</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, which had been only emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically or paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in such as came to <hi>Iohns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, was historical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, after his Baptisme, and in his Apostles after his glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to their poeticall or emblematicall importance. Howbeit, when we affirme that the aforesaid Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>Isay</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. was specially fulfilled, according to its poeticall, parabolicall, or emblematicall sense, we no way deny, that it might in part be verified or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified, according to the plaine, literall, or histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call signification of the words. Certainely it was so verified in our Sauiour, whilest hee remained, after his Baptisme, in the Wildernesse. <hi>And immediately</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Baptisme) <hi>the Spirit driueth him into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.

Wee doe not reade, that any wilde beast or noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some creature (of which the Wildernesse had plenty) did eyther annoy our Sauiour, or attempt any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against him whilest hee was with them: Wee doe not reade, that Satan did euer tempt Him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with a Lyon or a Beare, as his Father <hi>Dauid</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:7861:68"/>
had done, or to tread on Serpents or Scorpions, to see whether they would sting him or no; because he saw by experience, that this Iesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> had power ouer all these, and whatsoeuer other creature else that was at Satans command. Hee had seene that of the Psalmist, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 91. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. fulfilled in him: <hi>Thou shalt tread vpon the Lyon and Adder, the young Lyon and the Dragon thou shalt trample vnder feete:</hi> yet he hoped, our Sauiours confidence in the authoritie and power, which hee exercised ouer wilde beasts and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous creatures in the Wildernesse, might animate him to try another conclusion, which he thought had as faire and plausible premises in the Scriptures to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it: <hi>Then the Deuill taketh him vp into the Holy Citie, and setteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple; and saith vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: for it is written, Hee shall giue his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall be are thee vp, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone</hi>

The Angels of God in this case were to protect him: but to cast himselfe head-long from the Pinacles of the Temple, was no part of his way. The Prophet had fore-told no such miraculous protection of him or his followers. For him to haue tryed this

conclusion, had beene a tempting of God. This, and <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note> the like, were feates better beseeming <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or others of Satans Schollers. For this reason, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour after his resurrection, bequeatheth no such power or authority vnto his Disciples: vnto whom notwithstanding he communicated the former pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of treading vpon Serpents, of conuersing with wild beasts or venemous creatures in such manner, as the fore-cited place, <hi>Isay</hi> the 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 6 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the plaine, literall, and natiue signification of the words, importeth. <hi>I beheld Satan</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>as lightning fall from heauen.

Now, at the end of euery seuenth yeere of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths or rest, that is, after 49. yeeres ended, they were to haue the yeere of <hi>Iubile.</hi> The yeere wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> began to baptize and performe his ministery, was the seuenth Sabbaticall yeere, a yeere most obseruable by the Law; but this Law concerning the yeeres of Sabbaths or of rest, as the moderne Iewes themselues confesse, was but slenderly or not at all obserued by their forefathers after their returne from <hi>Babylon.</hi> And for this sinne, amongst others, they haue had for a long time no Land of their owne wherein to obserue it. The time of the yeere wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> begun to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon his office or ministery, as some <note n="*" place="margin">Functius Reusne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rns.</note> Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers rightly gather, was in the beginning of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> In the beginning of which Moneth, as you may reade, <hi>Leuitic.</hi> 23. they were to obserue the feasts of Trumpets, by which Ceremony the other solemne feasts in the same moneth, as the feast of the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the feast of Tabernacles were proclaimed. Whether the Iewes after their returne from Captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did obserue this solemnity, or neglect it, as they had done the yeeres of Sabbaths, I well know not, and much it skilleth not. It sufficeth vs to obserue, that the mystery fore-signified by the ceremony or solemnity which the Law commanded, was duely obserued and fulfilled by <hi>Iohn:</hi> for he in the beginning of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, began to lift vp his voice like a Trumpet in the wildernesse, as the Herauld or Ambassadour of that

Now, to awake them out of this slumber, the same God whom they sought, being depriued of this his Herauld or Cryer by <hi>Herods</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, proclaimed himselfe, as you may reade in the fore-cited place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 37. to be that God or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Life, whereto <hi>Iohn</hi> by his baptisme did direct them: <hi>In the last day, that great day of the Feast,</hi> (to wit, the Feast of Tabernacles, in which feast <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme was most famous) <hi>Iesus stood and cryed, saying, If any man thirst, let him come vnto me and drinke.</hi> Our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sauiour in this Proclamation, acteth but that very part, which he had penned for himselfe: Hee had dictated it to the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> as hee was the <hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Sonne</hi> of GOD; by whose spirit the whole body of Scriptures was written, to whom all the Prophets and Euangelists were but Scribes or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuenses.

Another speciall signe of the time, by which <hi>Iohns</hi> faith was confirmed, is from the Circumstance of the time and place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Sauiour was baptized by him.</p>
               <p n="62">62. I am not ignorant, that there hath beene an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tradition, <note place="margin">At what time of the yeere, or on what day our Sauiour was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> especially in the Westerne Church, that our Sauiour was baptized vpon the sixth of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> which wee call the <hi>Epiphany</hi> or the twelfth day. And the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not willing to dissent from the Romish Church, saue onely in matters of great consequence, or in points wherein that Church hath no shew of antiquity, retaineth in part the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy or Seruice which that Church had appointed for that day. So you may find the second Lesson v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually read in our Churches vpon that day, to bee the third Chapter of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, wherein the History of our Sauiours baptisme is most expresly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and at the end of the History concerning our Sauiours baptisme, the second Lesson appointed by our Church for that day, doth end. But in a part of the Liturgie to this day vsed in the Romish Church, to wit, in the Antheme appointed for that very day, it is in expresse termes auouched; <hi>[Hodie à Ioanne in Iordane Christus baptizari voluit;] This day our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our pleased to be baptized of Iohn in Iordane.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, <hi>Iansenius</hi> that reuerend Bishop of <hi>Gant,</hi> a most learned and ingenuous Interpreter of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7861:73"/>
soure Euangelists, albeit hee dyed a member of the then visible Romish Church wherein hee liued, did not thinke himselfe bound to beleeue either the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice or tradition of that Church, because in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was not warantable by Scripture, specially if they tooke the words before cited in the strict and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall sense. For beeing so taken, it contradicts the words of Saint <hi>Luke, chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>And Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi> (when he was baptized of <hi>Iohn) began to be about thirty yeeres of age:</hi> Or (as he reades) <hi>was almost thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres of age, when he began to enter vpon his function:</hi> which beares date from the day of his baptisme. Now if he had bin baptized vpon the sixt of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> or the Epiphany, he must needs haue beene either 13. dayes aboue 30. yeeres old, or but 13. dayes aboue 29. Some Romanists, acknowledging our Sauiour to haue bin baptized before hee was 30. yeeres of age com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, account his age from his conception, in respect whereof, hee was almost thirty, when hee was but some few dayes aboue 29. yeeres old, if wee account his age from his Natiuity. Others would haue him baptized in the 31. yeere of his age, accounting his <note place="margin">Naclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla Scripturae.</note> age from his Natiuity. For, suppose hee had beene baptized vpon the sixth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> after thirty yeers compleat, he might as truely be said to haue been then about thirtie yeeres, as if he had beene baptized some few dayes or weekes before he was thirtie. But the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when it signifies <hi>about</hi> this or that time, doth vsually signifie rather short then ouer. And for this reason <hi>Iansenius,</hi> although he poynt the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as the followers of this last opinion doe, yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much better of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his opinion, who was
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7861:73"/>
an ancient Writer, and a professed Collector of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">Mem. 2.

But some other Chronologers of reformed Churches, with more probability, referre the day of his baptisme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tenth of <hi>September,</hi> which was the feast of the Atonement. Vpon this day the Angell appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> whilest hee was burning Incense in the holy place, and foretold the birth and conception of <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="63">63. The consonancy of many types and signes of the time with this opinion, is very great and very pleasant. But if I should relate them all, you would happely say, they are but coniecturall, because not grounded vpon testimony of Scripture. Many of them I must confesse, are neither expressely foretold by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prophet, nor really fore-shaddowed or prefigured, for ought I knowe, by any reall euent or matter of fact, or by any solemnity commanded by the Law <note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the scape-Goat and other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities vsed in the Feast of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onement, mystically fulfilled in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vpon the day of his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> of <hi>Moses.</hi> Yet one euent there is which followed immediately vpon our Sauiours baptisme, so expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related by three Euangelists, that it doth necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue some prefiguration or fore-shadowing in the Law or bookes of <hi>Moses:</hi> for so euery remarkeable euent or action which concernes our Sauiour Christ was fore-shaddowed. The euent wherof now I speake, was his leading into the Wildernes by the Spirit to be tempted by the Diuell. So saith Saint <hi>Marke</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely (what the others intimate.) <hi>And immediately the Spirit driueth him into the Wildernesse. Marke</hi> 1. 12.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7861:74"/>
Now the end of his going or being led thither (though few Interpreters haue obserued it) was, to fulfill the mystery fore-signified by the Scape-goate, which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of Atonement, as we reade, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16. 21. <hi>was to be led by the hand of a fit man into the Wildernesse, after Aaron or his Successour the high-Priest had layde his hands vpon his head, and confessed ouer him all the Iniquities of Israel, and all the transgressions, and all their sinnes, putting them</hi> (as the Text saith,) <hi>vpon the head of the Goate. Now,</hi> as it is euident out of Scripture, that our Sauiour Christ was crucified at the time, that the Paschall Lambe was killed; to the end the World might take notice, that hee was the Lambe of GOD, whose sacrifice the Paschall Lambe did prefigure; so by a certaine Analogie of faith, wee may rightly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that our Sauiour was led into the Wildernesse by the Spirit, vpon the same day, that the scape-Goat was by the prescript of <hi>Moses</hi> Law to be led thither; to the end that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and such as were present, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and acknowledge, that the mystery fore-shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by the legall ceremony of the scape-Goate, was fulfilled in this Iesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom they had seene and known baptized of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Wherefore, in as much as it is euident out of Scripture, that the scape Goate was to bee led into the Wildernesse vpon the <hi>Feast-day of the Atonement,</hi> and inasmuch as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was led into the Wildernesse, immediately after he was baptized; the conclusion will directly follow, that our Sauiour was baptized vpon the Feast of the Atonement, which was the tenth of September. So that <hi>Iohn,</hi> by this account, was a quarter of a yeere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue thirty, and declining towards the wane, and our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7861:74"/>
Sauiour growing vp into his full age, beeing a quarter <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch. 2.</note> vnder thirty, when hee was baptized of <hi>Iohn.</hi> The end of our Sauiours going into the Wildernesse, was (as you heard before) to bee tempted of the Diuell; and amongst other meanes, to be tempted especially by fasting. This temptation doubtlesse did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him for his owne sake, but that hee might fully expiate the sinnes commited by the Israelites in the Wildernesse, from whose curse their posterity was not acquitted, vntill hee which was prefigured by the Scape-Goate, had really and bodily vndergone the burthen of it, as the Scape-Goate in shaddow or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony onely had done. One speciall end of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon this day into the Wildernesse, was, to carry thither the sinnes of all that came vnto <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme. For, as many as were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> confessed their sinnes. And if <hi>Iohn</hi> did not, no question but He, who was to accomplish as well that which was fore-shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by <hi>Aaron,</hi> as by the Scape-Goate, did put all the sinnes, which had beene confessed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> or to God in <hi>Iohns</hi> presence, vpon himselfe, as <hi>Aaron</hi> did put all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, and all their transgressions (beeing first confessed) vpon the head of the Goate, before hee sent him into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 21. Where wee are by the way to note, that this people did alwayes with their owne sinnes solemnely confesse the sinnes of their fore-fathers. The especiall sinnes which the Israelites had committed in the Wildernesse, were their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God, saying, <hi>Is the Lord amongst vs or no?</hi> and their rebellious murmuring against God, and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Moses,</hi> in their grieuance of hunger and thirst, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7861:75"/>
in their intemperate longings after their Aegyptian dyet. For this sinne they were stung with fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; the reliques or Off-springs of their first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents curse, whom the old Serpent had feduced and made subiect to annoyance by the venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And this sinne was remarkably and fully expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by our Sauiours fasting forty dayes and forty nights in the Wildernesse, and by his vanquishing the Tempter himselfe the olde Serpent in this temptation (as we say) at his owne weapon. For at this time hee escaped the malice of the Deuill; the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had no power ouer him. And this was prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Scape-Goate, which beeing led into the Wildernesse, was to be let goe by the man that led him.</p>
               <p n="64">64. Probable it is, that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> from his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance, how exactly our Sauiour had fulfilled the type of the Scape-Goate, did (vpon his returne from the Wildernesse) pre-collect or prognosticate, that hee should as exactly fulfill the type or mystery of the Paschall Lambe, and hence proclaimes him to be that Lambe of God which was to take away the sinnes of the World, more than three yeeres before our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Apostles or Disciples did know the meaning of this mystery, or the congruitie betweene the shaddow and the body. It is remarkeably said by our Apostle, <hi>That our Sauiour is the body whereof legall ceremonies were the shaddowes.</hi> But you must vnderstand a body so heterogeneall and compleat, that no one or few le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ceremonies could perfectly fore-shaddow it. But as the Ceremonies were many and almost infinite; so euery one did fore-shaddow some part or piece of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7861:75"/>
this compleat body; no remarkeable part of it, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 2.</note> 
                  <hi>is,</hi> no speciall euent or action which concerned our Sauiour Christ, but was fore-shaddowed by some or other legall ceremony. As his leading into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse vpon the day of the Atonement, was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaddowed by the Ceremony of the Scape-Goate; so his Baptisme vpon the same day, was as expresly fore-shaddowed or prefigured, as any euent concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, eyther was or could be, by the Legall Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, which <hi>Aaron,</hi> or his Successour the High-Priest, were to obserue vpon the same day, <hi>to wit,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Feast of the Atonement: <hi>And Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall put off the Linnen garments which hee put on, when hee went into the holy place, and shall leaue them there.

The reason why Iesus the Sonne of God would bee baptized at this place, rather then at any other, and the reason why the heauens did open ouer him being in this place baptized, was to shew, that Hee was the Iesus which was to conduct them into their rest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, into that Land, wherof the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was but the Mappe; that he was the man in whom Gods promise vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> performed in part by Iesus the sonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> was to be finally accomplished.

Now, as euery vegetable or sensitiue body liueth by its soule, so the reasonable soule of man liueth by faith. The first originall or seed of faith, is the Word of God. The onely nutriment of faith, or of the soule which seekes to liue by faith, is experiment or obseruation of euents, whether in our selues or without vs, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Word of God, from which faith had its first seeds or beginning.

Euery mans growth in faith is then most firme and solid, when it proceedeth from a perfect growth in those Scriptures from which it took first roote, and from whose experienced truth it was formerly nourished and increased.</p>

But immediately after <hi>Herod</hi> had impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iohn,</hi> our Sauiour left <hi>Iudea</hi> and went into <hi>Galilee;</hi> where, by Gods appointment, the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whose approach <hi>Iohn</hi> at his baptisme had fore-told, was to bee proclaimed and established. The matter of fact, to wit, his going into <hi>Galilee</hi> vpon <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment, is expressely related by Saint <hi>Iohn, cap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharises had heard, that Iesus made and baptized moe Disciples than Iohn, (though Iesus himselfe baptized not, but his Disciples) he left Iudaea, and departed againe into Galilee:</hi> not so much for feare of the Iewes, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish that, for which he was sent into the world.

Some touch of it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I shall giue you in the conclusion of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours answere to <hi>Iohn,</hi> as it concernes the first place of <hi>Isay,</hi> whereto he referreth him. That which I would now haue you to obserue out of the Euangelist Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> is this: First, that this Prophesie was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our Sauiours promulgation of the Gospell in those places. Secondly, albeit our Sauiour was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and inaugurated to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen at his baptisme; yet hee did not take actuall possession of his Kingdome, or giue Lawes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his subiects, he did not fully exercise his Regall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer Satan and the vncleane spirits his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, nor establish the Kingdome of Grace by signes or wonders, vntill the time of <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment. Thus much is euident from the words of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>From that time</hi> (to wit, from <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment) <hi>Iesus began to preach, &amp; to say, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the Kingdome of Heauen is at hand.</hi> From the same time he did choose his twelue Apostles, and

Branch 3.</note> to preach the Kingdome, to heale all manner of diseases, and to deliuer the people from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Satan. From the same time our Sauiour began to make that excellent Sermon vpon the Mount, whereof you may reade, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. which is the fundamentall Charter, by which the Kingdome of Heauen heere on earth is established. Now, albeit <hi>Iohn</hi> did worke no miracles himselfe, nor had seene our Sauiur worke any before his imprisonment; yet hee had ingaged his credit and reputation with the people, (who tooke him for no lesse than a Prophet,) that Iesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom he baptized in <hi>Iordane,</hi> should worke such miracles as <hi>Isaias</hi> the Prophet had foretold the <hi>Rod</hi> or Branch of <hi>Iesse</hi> should worke; and accomplish all, which the said Prophet had foretold should ensue vpon the voice crying in the wildernesse. That <hi>Iohn</hi> had thus far ingaged himselfe for winning reputation to his Lord and Master, is euident from the fruites or effects of this his ingagement, manifested in the people. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 39, 40, 41, 42. After our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>had escaped out of the hands of the Iewes, hee went away againe beyond Iordane, into the place where Iohn at first baptized, and there hee abode. And many resorted vnto him, and said; Iohn did no miracle, but all things that Iohn spake of this man, were true. And many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued on him there.</hi> Now, albeit <hi>Iohn,</hi> after hee had seene the holy Ghost descend vpon our Sauiour, did neuer doubt whether he was the promised Messias or no: yet what greater comfort or satisfaction could <hi>Iohn</hi> receiue being now imprisoned, than to haue an acquittance from his former Ingagement for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7861:80"/>
sealed by such visible and sensible euents as are heere related, and solemnly acknowledged and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by him for whom <hi>Iohn</hi> stood ingaged, who had fully discharged whatsoeuer <hi>Iohn</hi> had promised on his behalfe? That this answer of our Sauiour did really discharge <hi>Iohn</hi> of his former ingagement, and fully acquit him from all suspition of collusion or compact with <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom he baptized, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to be the Messias; might easily haue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the most malicious Iewe then liuing, that would but haue compared the miracles heere related, with the predictions of the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> laying both of them to heart, and weighing them with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the seuerall times. The testimonies are two. The first prediction of the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> whereto our Sauiour in this answere referreth <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all such as should seeke satisfaction from him, is, <hi>Isay</hi> 35. but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Strengthen yee the weake hands, and confirme the feeble knees.

than to prefixe denunciations of woe and misery to Prophesies of comfort: and to make the experienced accomplishment of woes fore-told, the infallible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouchers of insuing ioyes.

For it is commonly receyued, though without all ground, yea contrary to the ground of sacred History, that <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army was destroyed by the Angel, neere vnto Ierusalem. But could wee as cleerely gather where <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army was destroyed, as wee can cleerely proue that it was not destroyed about Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem: the fulfilling of this Prophesie would bee as perspicuous for the manner or circumstance, as it is remarkeable for substance. But the search of the place where <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army was destroyed, wee leaue to the Schooles. For the Prophesie it selfe <hi>[The Land of Zabulon, and the Land of Nepthaly, &amp;c.]</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not at all verified by any reall euent, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it was accomplished by our Sauiours transmigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Iudea into Galile, or whether it were ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some historicall euent in <hi>Hezekias</hi> his dayes, as by the manner of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> ouerthrow, certainely the Prophets speciall intent and purpose was to giue posterity notice, that as the Land of <hi>Zabulon,</hi> of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaly,</hi> the way of the Sea, &amp;c. were first captiuated by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7861:86"/>
the Assyrian, so they should be the first spectators of that great victory, which the Angel of God, the great Angell of the Couenant, was to haue ouer those pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkenesse, which the Assyrian tyranny did but fore-shaddow. And this was the reason why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour vpon <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment, leauing Iudea, went into Galilee, because his Soueraigntie ouer Satan was to be manifested, and the Kingdome of Heauen first proclaimed and established there. And thus much of the former testimony, <hi>Isay</hi> 35. whereto our Sauiour in this Answer referreth <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of the signes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the time, wherein the Prophesie was first conceyued, or of the times immediately ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="75">75.

Wherefore I must dissent as well from our English as from our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Translations, in the translation of the Hebrew in the Prophet, as I did before in the translation of the Greeke heere in the Euangelist. The vulgar Latine hauing rightly translated the Greeke heere in my

Text, <hi>[pauperes euangelizantur,]</hi> doth vary from it <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 3.</note> selfe and from the truth in the interpretation of the Prophet. For so hee renders it, as our English doth, <hi>[Misit me euangelizare pauperibus,] He sent me to preach vnto the poore:</hi> whereas if this translation had beene constant to it selfe, it should haue beene, <hi>[misit me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelizare,</hi> or <hi>euangelizatum pauperes,] hee hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ent mee to Euangelize the poore in spirit.</hi> And to Euangelize them, is as much as to imprint the Gospell or Kingdome of Grace in their hearts. And this interpretation of the Prophet may be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily inferred from the circumstances of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Text it selfe, by the same Arguments which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were vsed for interpreting the Euangelists. <hi>To preach the Gospell vnto the poore,</hi> is onely to make them a promise of the Kingdome of Grace; which cannot be the true or full meaning of the Prophet in this place: for this first clause, <hi>[misit me euangeliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum pauperes,]</hi> is the generall roote wherein all the Clauses following are contained, as branches. Now this <hi>Anoynted</hi> of the Lord here spoken of, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promise to binde vp the broken-hearted, but did bind them vp. He did not onely promise liberty to the Captiues, or the opening of the prisons to such as were shut vp; but did set both at liberty. As we say, Christs <hi>bene dicere</hi> is <hi>bene facere:</hi> so Christs Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of liberty to the Captiues in this place, was their actuall freedome or manumission.

                  <hi>He was sent to preach liberty to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and to proclaime the acceptable yeere of the Lord.</hi> These are expresse Characters of the yeere of Iubile: and the yeere of Iubile is by interpretation, as much as the <hi>yeere of ioy or reioycing;</hi> declared by the sound of Trumpets.

Now, this seast of Trumpets, wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> began to cry in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, was the later end of the seuenth Sabbaticall yeere. Our Sauiour, as you heard before was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized vpon the Feast of the Atonement, which was the beginning of the yeere of Iubile, wherein the Iubile was to be proclaimed with Trumpet. He was at the time of his baptisme, as you heard before out of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> about thirty yeeres of age: and an exquisite <note n="*" place="margin">Reusne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clantus.</note> Chronologer hath well calculated, that the day wherein he was baptized, was the beginning of the thirtieth yeere of Iubile, after this peoples entrance

or fiftieth yeere; and the manner how all these prefigurations were fulfilled by our Sauiour, at the time when he sent this answere vnto <hi>Iohn:</hi> you must consider, that no seruant throughout the Land of <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> whether an hyred seruant of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or a bond-man of the Nations, was euer in so great a bondage or hard seruitude vnto his master, as all the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea of <hi>Adam,</hi> were vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. This acceptable yeere of the Lord, in number the thirtieth Legall Iubile, being first proclaimed by <hi>Iohn,</hi> afterwards by a voice from heauen at our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours baptisme, and lastly by our Sauiour himselfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment, was the time appointed by God for the manumission or setting free of his people, and all mankinde from the bondage and seruitude to Satan. Nor did our Sauiour onely proclaime this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable yeere of the Lord, but did by deed and fact declare himselfe to be that Lord which had giuen the Law of Iubile vnto the Iewes, and was now come in person to put the true intent and full meaning of it in execution, which was to set free all such as did hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto his voice, and sought to be eased from their slauerie and thraldome. Of this present freedome or manumission, euen these bodily miraculous Cures heere mentioned in my Text, were vndoubted effects, and so many ocular or sensible demonstrations. All these defects or imperfections of body, as blindnesse, lamenesse, deafenesse, dumbnesse, crookednesse, and the like, were as the bonds and chaines of Satan. Thus much is euidently proued by our Sauiours Argument against the Ruler of the Synagogue, which was displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed because our Sauiour had healed a poore woman
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7861:90"/>
vpon the Sabbath day, whose body was bowed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note place="margin">Mem. 2. Branch 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou hypocrite,</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>doth not each one of you on the Sabbath day loose his Oxe or his Asse from the stall, and leade him away to watering?</hi> Luk. 13. vers. 15. <hi>And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo these eighteene yeeres, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?</hi> vers. 16. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> words are more generall; for he saith, <hi>He healed all that were oppressed of the diuell, Act.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 38. But the speciall document and the fullest assurance of this present freedome or manumission by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, was the often-mentioned Euangelization of the poore in spirit, that is, their participation of that Oyle of gladnesse, wherewith he was anoynted aboue his Fellowes or adherents. This includeth as well <hi>[termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ad quem,]</hi> as <hi>[terminum à quo;]</hi> that is, it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not onely a manumission or deliuerance from the seruitude of Satan, but withall an accomplishment or fulfilling of that, which was prefigured in the second priuiledge of the Legall Iubile: and this priuiledge was, that euery man might returne vnto his possession, or to the inheritance of his Fathers, although he had formerly pawned or mortgaged it. Now, Paradise, you know, was the possession which all of vs lost in our first Parents, &amp; from entering into it we were all excluded, so long as wee continued the seruants of sinne and Satan. And vnto this possession did the Womans Seed or second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Anoynted of the Lord, whereof the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> speakes, Chap. 61. actually restore the poore in spirit, that liued and conuersed with him. This restauration or returning to the possession or inheritance of their first parents,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7861:91"/>
was first proclaimed, and the possession it selfe in part first giuen or bequeathed to his Disciples, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn</hi> sent vnto our Sauiour this message, whereto my Text containes the answere. The Proclamation was our Sauiours Sermon vpon the Mount.</p>
               <p n="78">78. It is a point worth your obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour beginneth that Sermon, (which as wee said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was the fundamentall Charter of the Kingdome of God, or Euangelicall Law) from the beginning of the fore-cited 61.

He opened his mouth, saith the Euangelist, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. that is, after long silence and expectation, hee began to proclaime the acceptable yeere, <hi>Blessed are the poore in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdome of Heauen.</hi> Thus our Sauiour expressed the meaning of this Phrase in my Text, <hi>[pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the LORD in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> cannot so easily be gathered from the circumstances of the Euangelist: but as all Interpreters (I thinke) agree, this Answer was giuen within the compasse of that yeere wherein our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was baptized. Now, this was the last Legall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile which this people were to enioy, and the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Euangelicall Iubile, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here on earth vntill the Worlds end, to bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accomplished in the World to come. So that this great mystery of our eternall Rest and Ioy in heauen, had first a shaddow in the Law, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Legall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.</hi> Secondly, a Picture in the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> or in the History of <hi>Hezekias,</hi> and his miraculous deliuery from the Assynians. Thirdly, a liue body in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell or dayes of the Messias, euery-way answerable to the picture drawne by the Prophet. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this liue body, or Euangelicall Iubile, was from the day of our Sauiours Baptisme: and the birth of it, from the deliuery of our Sauiours Sermon vpon the Mount. Fourthly, the accomplishment, ful growth or perfection of this liue body, is to be expected one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the life to come, where our Ioy, our Rest and Peace, shall be for measure boundlesse, and for terme endlesse. Now, according to these seuerall degrees of shaddow, of picture, of life, and growth, one and the same Scripture, euen according to its natiue and literall sense, may be often verified and fulfilled.

            <p n="82">82. <hi>[Whosoeuer is not offended.]</hi> The word in the <note place="margin">What it is to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in Christ.</note> originall signifieth a stumbling-blocke, or some hard body against which another may so strike or dash, as it may hurt it selfe, or be hindred in its motion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse. The Latine <hi>[offendo,]</hi> whence our English is deriued (according to its prime and naturall significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) imports as much as the Greeke doth. For, it is a compound of the old Verbe <hi>[fendo,]</hi> now almost out of vse amongst the Latines, which signifieth as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7861:95"/>
much, as to touch or smite: whence the Latine <hi>[de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendere]</hi> is as much as to warde or beare off. This vse of the word <hi>[defend,]</hi> is common in our English. So we call him a Master of Defence, that can teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to warde off blowes or strokes, or other annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that by darting or hurling may be intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. And amongst Mariners, to send off, is as much as to preuent or hinder one ship from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and falling foule vpon another. And if we would follow the Latines as strictly in the proper vse of the word <hi>[offendere,]</hi> as wee doe in the vse of the single Verbe <hi>[fendo]</hi> or of its compound, <hi>[defendo,]</hi> wee should say, one ship offends another, when one ship falleth foule vpon another: For so a Latinist would expresse the English <hi>[Nauis in nauim offendit:]</hi> for, <hi>offendere,</hi> is as much as <hi>impingere,</hi> to hit or dash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. In this propriety, the Latine <hi>[offendere]</hi> is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 91. 12. <hi>They shall beare thee vp in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. [Ne offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das in lapidem, &amp;c.]</hi> Now, because to offend or dash against hard bodies, is displeasant and grieuous vnto sense; Euery thing is hence said to offend vs, that is displeasant and grieuous vnto vs, or that hindereth vs in the prosecution of our will, delights, or pleasures. Hence they are said in this secondary sense to bee <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi> in Christ, that were displeased with his actions, person, or doctrine. The issue or consequence of this mutuall offence taken by men at CHRIST, or by GOD at men, which contemne and spurne at his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, is excellently expressed by the Prophet <hi>Esay, chap.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14, 15. <hi>Sanctifie the LORD of Hoasts himselfe, and let him bee your feare, and let him be</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:7861:95"/>
               <hi>your dread. And he shall be for a Sanctuary to those that sanctifie his name, and dread his power; but for a stone of stumbling, &amp; for a rocke of offences to both the houses of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. And many among them shall stamble and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken;</hi> namely, as many of both the houses of Israel, as did not sanctifie his name, or dread his power. When he saith, hee shall bee for <hi>a stone of stumbling,</hi> this imports the issue and consequence, not the end why this stone was layed in Sion. For if the reuolting Iewes themselues, did not therefore stumble, that they might fall. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11. The end or reason why this stone was laid in Sion, was not that they might either stumble or fall; but many of them haue stumbled and falne, many of them haue bin broken and insnared; but they are broken and insnared, because they stumbled and tooke of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, where none was giuen: and all this the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did foretell to preuent a scandal or offence, which the weake in faith, or the Heathen, which had not heard of Christ, would haue taken, vnlesse the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table euent of the Iewes, which spurned and kicked at this stone, had bin distinctly foretold, and as it were painted out by the Prophet. The meaning is, as if he had said; I see you will kicke or spurne at this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone or foundation, which God hath promised to lay in Sion: and seeing you will not be fore-warned, take your pastime: yet know withall, that this your sporting with, or spurning of this stone, which your master-builders will reiect, as beeing too base and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightly in their eyes; will prooue but as the spurning of some wanton creature at the spring, or ginne, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7861:96"/>
they easily may remoue, but beeing remoued, it will <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> bring the snare or trappe vpon them, which they shall not be able to remoue or escape. Our Sauiour Christ in his humiliation was as the spring or ginne, at which the Iewes spurned: but is since growne into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stone, and shall become as the trappe, and fall to crush and bruise all such, as spurned at or contemned him in the dayes of his humility, or at this day make a scorne at such humility as he taught. The Prophets speeches in this and like places, wherein hee foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth what shall after happen in such a manner, as hee may seeme to inuite them vnto that which afterward they bring vpon themselues, is but like that in the Poet;</p>
            <p>Rode caper vitem; sed dum tu stabis adaras, In tua quod spargi cornua possit, erit.</p>
            <p>But the best Comment that is or can bee made vpon the Prophets words, is made by our Sauiour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>vers.</hi> 42, 43, 44. <hi>Did you neuer reade in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the stone which the builders reiected, the same is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the head of the corner? This is the Lords doing, and it is maruellous in our eyes. Therefore say I vnto you, the Kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and giuen to a Nation bringing forth the fruite thereof. And whosoeuer shall fall vpon this stone, shall be broken: but on whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it shall fall, it will grinde him to powder.</hi> These chiefe Priests and Pharises, to whom our Sauiour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this question, were the master-builders in Hierusalem; but were so farre from sanctifying the Lord of Hosts, and so farre from making him their feare, their dread, and Sanctuary, as the Prophet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised them; that they kicke and spurne at him in the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7861:96"/>
dayes of his humiliation, as vnfit to haue any place in <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> their visible Temple. But shortly after hee vttered this Parable, he grew into so high and great a place in the true Temple of God, that he hath groun'd the materiall Temple, and the whole Citie of Hierufalem it selfe to dust and powder by falling vpon them: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee did no otherwise fall vpon them, than by suffering his Fathers wrath and displeasure (which he had still kept off) to fall vpon them that did spurne or were thus deeply offended at him. The seuerall fates or finall issues of euery ones wayes, that haue heard of Christ or bin baptized in him, is fore-pictured in the state or issue of these Iewes, to whom hee was first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed.</p>
            <p n="83">83. Euery one is so much more happy, as hee is lesse apt to bee offended in him; they most vnhappy, that are most offended in him. To bee offended in Christ all they are said, and here intended, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inuited to come vnto him, or being on their way, are, vpon whatsoeuer occasions or temptations, led another way; or so stumble and fall in the way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by them, that they haue no heart to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but either directly retire, or stay at the place where they stumbled or fell. Whatsoeuer hindreth any man from comming to Christ, or from imbracing the Gospell, is an offence, not giuen, but taken. Though all bee offended in him that haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited <note place="margin">Three ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls of dislike or offence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ by the lewes.</note> and come not to him; yet the Iewes are more properly said to be offended in him, than the heathen, which had not sought after him. The offences which the Iewes tooke, were for the most part, either against his Countrey, or against his parentage, or against his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7861:97"/>
doctrine. This last offence, in respect of these dayes, is the most dangerous, and that wherein we moderne Christians may trespasse so much more hainously, than the Iewes did; as they did more grieuously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend than the Heathens, in beeing so deeply offended at their Messias, of whom they had heard, and after whom they had sought.</p>
            <p n="84">84. The most, and euen the best sort of the Iewes, were apt to take offence at our Sauiours supposed Countrey. Thus when <hi>Philip</hi> came and told <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 1. v. 45, 46.</note> 
               <hi>We haue found him of whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets did write, Iesus of Nazareth, the Sonne of Ioseph: Nathaniel said vnto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Nathaniel</hi> in speaking this, spake as for the present hee thought. This speech (it seemes) was <hi>Vox populi,</hi> in those dayes. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour had a more charitable opinion of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> than <hi>Nathaniel</hi> had of his Countrey or place of dwelling. For not withstanding this his hard conceit of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> our Sauiour commendeth him for a true Israelite, and one, in whom there was no guile. The common offence was quickly remooued out of so harmlesse &amp; humble a heart. Vpon a little conference with our Sauiour, he acknowledgeth him for that stone elect and precious, which God had promised to lay in Sion. <hi>Rabbi,</hi> saith hee, <hi>thou art the Sonne of God, the King of Israel. Nathaniel,</hi> though in part offended with the place of our Sauiours present habitation, was yet true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, in that he was not so farre offended with it, as to refuse at <hi>Philips</hi> inuitation to come and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any good thing could come out of it or no. His preiudicate opinion of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was lesse than <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:7861:97"/>
was of Iordane: his successe in hearkening to <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> 
               <hi>Philip</hi> and repayring to Iesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than <hi>Naaman's</hi> was in hearkening to the Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> and his washing in Iordane. So vsefull is that rule, which since hath bin commended vnto vs by our Apostle Saint <hi>Paul; Try all things, and retaine that which is best.</hi> But what is best we cannot know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tryall or comparison of particulars.</p>
            <p n="85">85. The same preiudice which <hi>Nathanael</hi> had of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the people, mentioned <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 40. had of <hi>Galile,</hi> the Countrey or Prouince, whereof <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> was a poore City or Towne: But their preiudice was much more deepely rooted, than <hi>Nathanaels</hi> was; their offence at our Sauiour, and the preiudice they had of <hi>Galile,</hi> was greater, and they by it more vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. After our Sauiour had made that Proclamation in the Feast of Tabernacles, whereof you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>If any man thirst, let him come vnto me and drink. He that beleeues in me, (as the Scripture hath said) out of his belly shall flow Riuers of liuing water.</hi> Ioh. 7. 37. <hi>Many of the people when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet: others said, This is the Christ: but some said, Shall Christ come out of Galile? hath not the Scripture said, that Christ commeth of the seede of Dauid, and out of the Towne of Bethleem, where Dauid was? So there was a diuision among the people because of him, and some of them would haue taken him.</hi> Thus you see how apt preiudicate opinion is to picke quarrels with the truth, and to pretend insoluble contradictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Scripture and Scripture, or betweene it and the Prophets opinions or Interpretations of it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which there is an admirable and apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7861:98"/>
to such as will with patience and vnpartially <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> conferre them. It is most true which this people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, that the Christ and Messias was to come out of Bethleem, the Citie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> but might hee not therefore come out of Galile? out of Nazareth? <hi>[Distinguant tempora, &amp; concordant Scripturae:]</hi> one Prophet foretels that the Ruler of Gods people should goe out of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> a place of plenty, a fruitfull soile, and by interpretation, the house of bread. This was meant of his birth and first comming into the world; and that Iesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> (which now came out of <hi>Galile)</hi> did first come into the world out of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> the Citie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> this people had too good proofe, so they would haue but looked backe to the time of their owne births or infancie, or haue examined the records or history of thirtie yeeres fore-passed. For what was it that moued <hi>Herod</hi> to slay all the Infants about <hi>Bethleem,</hi> but that hee hoped among them to haue slaine the expected Sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the hope of Israel? Another Prophet fore-telleth as distinctly &amp; plainly, that this same Son of <hi>Dauid</hi> shuld grow vp, as a <hi>tender plant out of a dry ground,</hi> and that many should be offended in him (as this people now was) for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason, than that he was not so beautifull or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as they expected their Messias should bee. <hi>Isay</hi> 53. <hi>v.</hi> 3. The same Prophet else-where specifieth the Townes name, wherein this <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> was to grow, as you heard before out of the eleuenth of <hi>Isay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="86">86. But these Scriptures were aenigmaticall or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure; and how should the people know their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without the interpretation of the present visible Church, <hi>that is,</hi> of the high-Priests, the Scribes, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7861:98"/>
Pharises? This was the plea of the visible Church in <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> those dayes, and this peoples reliance vpon their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church or chiefe Rulers of Ierusalem (after such a manner in part, as the Romanists now doe vpon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, vpon the Pope and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals) was the beginning or roote of the Iewes Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from Christ. That which the Romanist would perswade vs to bee the Rocke of our saluation, and rule of our faith in Christ, was to those Iewes the only rocke of offence; the line of desolation, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets call it, to Hierusalem. That very obiection which the people in the seuenth of <hi>Iohn</hi> did make, was taught them by the Scribes and Pharises, the then visible or representatiue Church. The preiudice which these great <hi>Rabbies</hi> had of Galile, &amp; the offence which they tooke at our Sauiour, was so deeply rooted in their hearts, that they tooke it as a proofe sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him for a false and counterfet Prophet, because hee auouched himselfe to bee a true Prophet, being, as they imagined, a Galilaean. For when <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had seuerely taxed their partiality, and vnwarrantable proceeding against him; <hi>Doth our Law iudge any man before it heare him, &amp; know what he doth? They answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and said vnto him, Art thou also of Galile? Search and looke: for out of Galile ariseth no Prophet. Ioh.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 51, 52. <hi>The truth,</hi> and because the truth, the true Church of God, was visible and conspicuous in <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> or at least in such as the high-priest, the Scribes and Pharises, the then visible Church, did excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and persecute as seducers, or men seduced by our Sauiour. The Scribes and Pharises were the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church in the selfe-same sense, as the Romanists
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7861:99"/>
now take it; yet limbes of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> true types and <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> shaddowes of these sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> with whom wee haue to deale, who after many warnings and euident conuictions of blasphemous intemperancy, are not yet ashamed to bring those arguments for the establishing the Authority of their present Church, which, if they had any truth in them, would iustifie the Scribes and Pharises, in condemning our Sauiour for a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, a seducer, or blasphemer; yea, would prooue <hi>Iudas</hi> to bee a better Martyr than any their Church can bragge of, for betraying him.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Certainely, the men of <hi>Nazareth</hi> were not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with our Sauiour, either for his Countrey in generall or particular, and yet most vnhappy men, in that they were vpon other occasions deeply offended with him, when hee came in loue to visit them, and proffered the glorious light of the Gospell vnto them. <hi>He came to Nazareth where he had bin brought vp, and as his custome was, hee went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood vp for to reade. And there was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto him the Booke of the Prophet Isaias; and when he had opened the booke, he found the place where it was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me, because he hath anoynted mee to preach the Gospell to the poore, he hath sent mee to heale the broken-hearted, to preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blinde, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yeere of the Lord. Luke</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did any Preacher in the World choose a fitter Text, or better suting with time and place, than this, which by diuine prouidence offered it selfe vnto our Sauiour at the first opening of the Booke; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

was as pithy, as the Text was plaine and <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> pregnant: <hi>And hee began to say vnto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares.

They were taken with a spice of the selfe-same disease, whereof our Romish-Catholique Dames are sicke euen vnto death; to whom any stinking weed or lothsome drugge, raked out of the sinke or puddle of tradition, so it bee brought by a Quack-saluer or Mountebanke from beyond the Seas, relisheth much better than the sweetest flowers that grow eyther in the Propheticall or Euangelicall <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary;</hi> better than the bread and water of Life it selfe, dayly proffered vnto them by the natiue and allowed Physicians of their soules; Men as able to instruct their forreine instructers in any good learning, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the glad tidings of the Gospell, as they are to instruct the rude and ignorant, in matters of treason and villany. Out of this inchanted humour, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched fansie, the Inhabitants of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> after they had heard our Sauiour for a while with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, began to say, <hi>Is not this Iosephs Sonne?</hi> Or, as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> relateth it, <hi>Whence hath this man this wisdome, and these mighty workes?

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of this offence, was our Sauiours refusall to worke such miracles amongst them, as they expected, albeit for this refusall hee brought them a ruled case, which should haue taught them patience and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but as they were affected, it filled their hearts with rage and cruelty. <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 4. vers. 23, 24, 25, 26. 27.</note>

            <p n="88">88. They are principally offended with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would not doe such miracles as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: and hee is therefore vnwilling to doe any miracles amongst them, because they were already of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in him. It is a remarkable censure which Saint <hi>Marke</hi> giueth of this their vntoward disposition: <hi>He could doe no mighty worke there, saue that hee layde his hands vpon a few sicke folke, and healed them. Marke</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6. Certainely those sicke folkes were not offended in him, otherwise hee had not healed them. <hi>Hee did not many miracles there,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Matthew, chap.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 58. The reason giuen by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> why hee did not, and by Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> why hee could not doe many mighty workes there, was one and the same, auouched in the same termes by both these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists, and it was his Auditors vnbeliefe, or that deepe offence which they had causelesly taken at him. But happely yee will say, The greater their vnbeliefe was, the more need they had of his mighty workes to make them beleeue: and what worke can we imagine so mighty, that Christ, who was truely God, could not really effect, so hee were willing? And willing, it seemeth hee was, to haue made his Countrey-men, and Neighbours of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> true beleeuers: hee read his Commission and Charter of foundation, for establishing the Kingdome of Heauen heere on earth, in their audience. And it is a truth vnquestionable, that CHRIST as now, so then was truely GOD,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7861:101"/>
and continued the same, blessed for euer: and vnto <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> God nothing is, nothing can be vnpossible. All this is most true in respect of his power; but yee must againe consider, that many things which are very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and very easie in respect of his power, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnpossible to bee done, because they imply a contradiction or contrariety to the eternall Rule or Law of his Goodnesse, Iustice, or Maiesty. Now, it is an expresse branch of his eternall law or equity, not to <hi>cast Pearles before Swine,</hi> not to saue such men by miracles or mighty hand, as contemne and spurne at the ordinary meanes of Saluation, or despise the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his bountie. The portion of Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned (so they had suffered him to haue gon forward with the exposition of it, or would haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to him with that respect and reuerence which was due vnto the Words of GOD,) was more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to beget faith in their hearts, than all the miracles that could haue beene wrought; for faith commeth by hearing, not by sight; and seeing this churlish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had swinish eares, and brutish appetites, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as man, could not (without manifest violation of his Fathers eternall Law, and of his own eternall Law, as hee was God) feede their eyes or other senses with such miraculous spectacles, as were ordained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert men. Euery vnruly or exorbitant desire is a rocke of offence; euery affection, how naturall or how ciuill soeuer, vnrectified, vnmastered, or vnsubdued, is as a crooked, rugged path, which must be made plaine and straight e're we come to Christ. This rectifying, this smoothing or leueling of our desires and affections, is that way of the Lord which <hi>Iohn</hi> was sent to prepare <note n="*" place="margin">To this purpose the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> chap. 40. vers. 3. by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, chap. 35. ver. 3.</note>.

Desire of knowledge in Arts or Sciences of wisdome, <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> or experience in affaires ciuill and politique, is a desire in it selfe commendable: yet, if the desire of the one, or the other be immoderate, it is as a hill or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that must be brought low, ere the way of the Lord (whether from him to vs, or from vs to him) can become passable. The desire of a signe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of faith, is not vnlawfull. <hi>Abraham</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one, and had it; and so did <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> and both herein commended. <hi>Ahaz</hi> had a signe offered, but would not take it, and is by the Prophet sharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. Yet the immoderate or vnseasonable desire of a signe, is a dangerous roote of offence. Both parts of this obseruation are from Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>The Iewes require a signe, and the Greekes seeke after wisdome, but wee preach Christ crucified, vnto the Iewes a stumbling-blocke, and vnto the Greekes foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse; but vnto them which are called, both Iewes and Greekes, Christ the power of God, and the wisdome of God. vers.</hi> 24. Whom doth hee meane by such as are called? All that are in any sort, or howsoeuer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? No, but such as are not meerely Grammaticall, but reall passiues; or, as others speake, such as are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called. In what termes soeuer wee expresse our selues, wee meane the same persons, and the same thing that our Sauiour here doth, <hi>that is,</hi> all they, and <note place="margin">The more speciall offences, which this age is as ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="89">89. The more speciall rootes of more dangerous offences, or more grieuous stumbling-blockes in the way to Christ, are <hi>Couetousnesse, Vaine-glory, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iealousie of reputation,</hi> or <hi>feare of disgrace. All these</hi>

               <hi>things</hi> (saith the Euangelist) <hi>heard the Pharises which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> 
               <hi>were couetous, and they mocked him. Luke</hi> 16. 14. <hi>How can you beleeue,</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>which receiue honour one of another, and seeke not the honour that commeth from God onely? Iohn</hi> 5. 44. <hi>vid. vers.</hi> 39, 40. <hi>Among the chiefe Rulers</hi> (saith the same Euangelist) <hi>many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued on him, but because of the Pharises, they did not confesse him, lest they should bee put out of the Synagogue: for they loued the prayse of men, more than the prayse of God. Iohn</hi> 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 42, 43. These rootes of offence are alike common to the Iewes, and vnto vs: Wee must take heed, that wee examine not our selues, by comparing our affections towards Christs person or office, with the affections of these Iewes towards his office or person. This were the readiest way to cast vs into a Pharisaicall slumber or dreame of our owne righteousness. The onely meanes for vs to know, whether we be more or lesse offended in Christ, than the fore-mentioned Iewes or Pharises were, is to compare our liues, conuersations, and practice, with our Sauiours doctrinall precepts, especially with those fundamentall ones, solemnely vttered by him in the Sermon vpon the Mount. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Amongst which, this is a principall and peremptory one; <hi>I say vnto you, that except your righteousnesse shall exceede the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of the Scribes and Pharises, yee shall in no case enter into the Kingdome of Heauen. vers.</hi> 20. Now, from entring into the Kingdome of heauen, which is the Kingdome of happinesse, nothing can barre vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse wee be offended in Christ, who is the way and doore vnto it. Is there any amongst vs, that seeketh as earnestly after the prayse of men, or after any honour
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7861:102"/>
that commeth not from GOD alone, as the Iewes <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> mentioned, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5? Is there any amongst vs as couetous, as the Pharises were, mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 16? If any such there be eyther in this, or any other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Congregation, be they many or few, all and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them are as farre from the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, altogether as much offended in Christ, as the fore-mentioned Rulers, Iewes, and Pharises were. Is there any amongst vs of disposition towards his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Neighbour, or towards any professing the name of Christ, as implacable or irreconcileable as the Scribes and Pharises were towards Publicans and sinners? Let such a man, if any such there be, know and remember, that whilest hee continueth in this mood, he is as much offended in Christ as they were: and if hee so continue, our Sauiour Christ will bee as much offended at him in the last Day, as at those that crucified him. Is any man as carefull for the things of this life as these Iewes were? Hee is as farre from the Kingdome of Heauen, and the happinesse here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as the Iewes; yea, as the Heathen were. It is our Sauiours inference, not mine; <hi>Take no thought, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What shall wee eate? or, What shall wee drinke? or, Wherewith shall wee bee cloathed? (For after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke) For your heauenly Father knoweth that yee haue need of all these things. Matth.</hi> 6. 31, 32. His Precept for our direction followeth; <hi>But seeke yee first the Kingdome of God, and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and all these things shall bee added vnto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of it selfe. vers.</hi> 33, 34. This is the perpetuall Law of the Euangelical Iubile, whose
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7861:103"/>
obseruance was prefigured in the legall obseruation of <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> the seuenth yeere of rest, or the yeere of Iubile: In both which yeeres, as you heard before, the Iewes were forbidden to sow or reape, commanded to rely vpon Gods extraordinary blessing in the sixth yeere, and to rest contented with such things, as should grow of their owne accord in the seuenth yeere of rest or yeere of Iubile. Not to sow at all, or not to reape in these two yeeres, was a temporary Law, meerely le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall or ceremoniall. The morall Law hereby prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, and perpetually to bee obserued by vs Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is, <hi>That wee buy so, as if wee possessed not,</hi> that in sowing or reaping, or in whatsoeuer other businesse concerning this life, <hi>wee vse the world, as if wee vsed it not:</hi> That our prime and chiefe care bee in seeking the Kingdome of God, or matters of the life to come: That euery present day, wee take more payne and care in imploring Gods blessings vpon our present and future labours, than in contriuing meanes, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of labours, in worldly coniecture, most auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for procuring our ends, or that good which wee seeke. This practice and method our Sauiour had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vs in that prayer which hee hath taught vs. First, wee pray that Gods name may bee sanctified; and that his Kingdome may come; that his will may be done in earth as in heauen: and in the next place, that he would giue vs bread this day, for to <hi>morrow,</hi> and the dayes <hi>following;</hi> that is, as the Apostle saith, <hi>to cast all our care on him, who careth for vs all.</hi> But what auayles it vs to know by how many wayes and meanes wee may bee offended in Christ, vnlesse wee know withall by what meanes possible these or the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7861:103"/>
like offences may be auoydable? It is true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> our Sauiour teacheth a compendious way or meanes for auoyding offences. As first in this very Chapter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 29. <hi>Learne of mee, for I am meeke, and lowly in heart: and yee shall finde rest vnto your soules.</hi> To the same end or purpose are all those places of Scripture addressed, which exhort vs to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, to deny our selues, to take vp our Crosse and follow Christ. Of these and other good rules to this purpose, you may reade at large, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.</p>
            <p n="90">90. But others happely will say, What auayleth it to propose these good rules vnto vs, vnlesse it bee in our power to practise them? Wee beleeue it as a dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or <hi>maxime</hi> of faith, that <hi>God giues grace vnto the humble, or vnto such as for sake all, and deny themselues;</hi> but what is this to vs, vnlesse wee may likewise be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that God will eyther giue vs grace, or some free-will, or naturall power to deny or humble our selues? Here indeed were the true and fruitfull issue of all these intricate controuersies, which in later yeres haue much troubled the peace of the Church, as well the Romish, as the Reformed. The controuersies I meane of Election and Reprobation, betweene the Lutherans and the Caluinists, betweene the Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and the Gomarists: as also, the controuersie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning concurrence of Grace and Free-will, prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with eager and bitter contention for these many yeeres, betweene the Iesuites and the Dominican Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But of this radicall controuersie, about Free-will, a poynt necessary to be knowne, and yet inwrapped with as many vnnecessary intricate disputes, and on all parts as ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stated and handled (for the most part)
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7861:104"/>
as any other question whatsoeuer; I shall haue fitter <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> occasion to speake at large, when I come to handle that argument concerning our seruitude to sin, which must be the entrance vnto our knowledge concerning Iesus Christ and him crucified: vnto both which, these discussions vpon this Text haue beene premised.</p>
            <p n="91">91. At this time I will onely acquaint you with that, which I haue elsewhere deliuered, as the true meane betweene the contrary opinions of the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans and the Caluinists, betweene the Iesuites &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, betwixt the Stoickes and the Pelagians, in the poynt of free-will, or power of man to worke or not to worke his owne saluation. The meane is, that albeit man hath no freedome of will or ability to doe that, which is good, or to dispose his heart for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receiuing of Grace: yet hee hath a true possibility or freedome of will to doe, or not to doe something required by God; which thing being done by man, God will dispose his heart, and make it fit for his grace. The same thing not being done or neglected, the neglecters heart shall euery day than other bee more indisposed, and more incapable of grace than heretofore. For illustration of this poynt, I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in two particulars, <hi>to wit,</hi> in <hi>Naaman</hi> the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and the Widdow of Sarepta, both Heathens and vnregenerate. <hi>Naaman</hi> had no power or Free-will to cleanse himselfe of his Leprosie, eyther in whole or in part; yet a true freedome of will to wash or not to wash in Iordan. Now, if he had sinally departed in such a sullen fit, as he begun to take at the Prophets aduice, and not at all haue washed himself in Iordan, he might haue returned home a fouler Leper than hee came.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7861:104"/>
So then the cure was altogether Gods worke, <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> had no finger in it; but to wash in Iordane was in part <hi>Naamans</hi> owne worke, and an exercise of that free-will, which God vpon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, doth take from no man. In like maner, it was in the poore widdowes choyce, to giue or not to giue <hi>Elias</hi> a cake of her small store of oyle and meale: but if she had refused to do as the Prophet aduised her, God had not multiplyed the oyle and meale in her cruse extraordinarily. So then in working this miracle God had no partner, it was meerely his doing: but in bestowing these almes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophet, the poore widdow in part did worke. This was an act or exercise of her free-will and louing kindnes, no fruit of sanctifying grace. In like maner, to humble or cast downe our selues before God, that we may be partakers of sanctifying grace, is in part our worke, and strictly requited at euery mans hand, that hopes to be partaker of this grace: but the lifting of vs vp, or our conuersion to God, is meerely, solely and totally Gods worke. In this worke wee are as meerely passiue, as <hi>Naaman</hi> was in the cure of his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie, or the poore widdowes oyle and meale in the miracle which God wrought in it: but so meerely passiue we are not in the former worke in humbling or casting our selues downe. <hi>Humble your selues therefore vnder the mighty hand of God, that hee may exalt you in due time.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. For if it were as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to cast our selues downe without Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace, as it is to lift our selues vp without it; the Apostles Precept, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 10. had beene to no better purpose, than if a man should say to a lame childe, falne into a deepe ditch, Come hither, my childe, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7861:105"/>
I will helpe thee vp. This were rather to mocke a <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> child in his misery, than to promise him any helpe or comfort. I hope there be none heere present, men or women, but thinke it very possible for them, so farre at least to cast themselues downe before God, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the pledges of Christs body and blood, as our Church commandeth, meekely kneeling vpon their knees.</p>
            <p n="92">92. But some, perhaps, though I hope not many, <note place="margin">That kneeling at the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is a gesture most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of faith.</note> are of opinion, that in this case they are not bound to doe what they can doe, but rather tyed not to kneele, though the Church command kneeling; because they haue no expresse warrant or rule of Scripture so to do: howeuer, they and all that professe themselues to be Christs seruants, haue an expresse command to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the pledges of his body and blood: and if any be so scrupulous, as not to receiue them in any other manner then is expresly commanded or warranted by the Scripture; the parties thus affected (for ought I see or know) must not receiue them at all, and so they shall euidently transgresse the expresse generall rule of Scripture, which commands all to receiue them. For in all cases of this nature, <hi>that is,</hi> in all cases wherein the thing it selfe or action is expressely commanded to be done, and the maner or circumstances of doing it not so expressely commanded; the authority of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours must rule our affections or opinions, for the maner or circumstance of doing what is commanded. Whosoeuer in this case heareth not his lawfull Pastor or Gouernour, heareth not Christ: Whosoeuer in this case despiseth the Canons and Constitutions of the Church wherein he liueth, despiseth Christ: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7861:105"/>
in this case wilfully offendeth against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> of the Church, is offended in Christ, and puts a stumbling-blocke in his owne way; yea, hee barres himselfe out of the Kingdome of Grace, expressely promised heere in my Text, to all that are not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Christ, and in more speciall sort really exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all that worthily receiue this blessed Sacrament of his body and blood. But happely it will be farther replyed, that albeit our Sauiour did not expressely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vs to receiue the Sacrament kneeling, yet he hath taught vs by his example to receiue it after another maner and gesture; and it is more conuenient to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example, than the ordinance of the Church. To this I answere, that our Sauiour did not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament, because he had no sinnes to bee remitted by it. His Apostles had, and did receiue it; but whether standing, sitting, or kneeling, it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. All that can be gathered out of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, is this, that as they were eating, our Sauiour <hi>tooke bread and blessed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: so he did the cup likewise.</hi> But whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the bread or the cup still sitting, after the same maner as they did at their meate, is not expressed, nor can hence be gathered: for so a man may truely say, that whilest we are at Seruice and prayers, we receiue the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion; yet it will not follow, that because all or most of vs sit in time of Seruice, wee therefore sit at the receiuing of the Communion. But bee it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Apostles ate the bread, and dranke the wine, after the selfe same manner that they ate the Passeouer, yet it would be very hard to expresse the particular manner of their eating the Passeouer. I am
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7861:106"/>
perswaded, that there is neuer a Ioyner in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> that could make vs seates and Tables of the same fashion, that the Tables and seates were of, at which our Sauiour and his Apostles did eate the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer: or in case we had such seates or Tables made to our hands, for ought I can imagine, wee must haue some famous Antiquary or Master of Ceremonies, to instruct vs how to sit or lye, or to dispose of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at them.</p>
            <p n="93">93. This onely is certaine, that our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did eate the Passeouer after the ordinary and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed manner of those times, and according to the Rites &amp; Ceremonies of the then visible Church. For which Rites and Ceremonies, in all particulars, the then visible Church had no expresse Rule or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, which they were perpetually bound to obserue, either giuen by <hi>Moses</hi> or the Prophets; they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many circumstances, which are not expressed in <hi>Moses.</hi> Now, if our Lord and Master, who had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to institute new Rites and Ceremonies, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding conforme himselfe to those Rites and Ceremonies of the visible Church of the Iewes: shall wee not heerein truely follow the true example of Christ, if we doe the like? On the contrary, shall we not shew our selues to be none of his Disciples, if wee vse or affect that liberty or singularity, which hee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor would vse, although there were no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the earth to command him to conformity? Lastly, it may be obiected, that many in the Primitiue Church, who knew the Apostles practice better than the visible Church now doth, did not receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Christs body and blood, after the same
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7861:106"/>
manner as now we doe. I am not ignorant of a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> which many of the <hi>busie-brained Masters</hi> labour to instill into their Auditors heads; though in other cases they can slight Antiquity at their pleasure, yet in this case they haue been curiously Criticall, to obserue out of the Fathers of the Greeke Church, that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Sacrament [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,] <hi>that is,</hi> bowing indeed, but not bowing their knees. All this we grant; for the Greeke Church at this day receiue the Sacrament standing on their feet, yet bowing their bodies, not their knees. What is the reason? To make a legge, (as we say) or to bow the knee, is a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euen in expressions of ciuill courtesie, ridiculous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. Howbeit they expresse their seuerall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their friends &amp; to their betters of what ranke soeuer, as distinctly and curiously by seuerall manners of bowing their heads and bodies, as wee can doe by making legges, bowing the knee, or kneeling vpon our knees. And herein they are highly to be commended, for reseruing a distinct kind of bending their bodies, in expressing their submission towards God or Christ in their Liturgie or receiuing the Sacrament. So then, <hi>[distingue loca, &amp; concordant consuetudines.]</hi> Though the Greekes receiue the Communion standing, and bowing their bodies, whereas we receiue it with ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded knees, without bowing of our bodies: yet heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we fully agree, that both we and they receiue it in the most decent and submisse manner, for gesture or deportment of our bodies, that we otherwise know or vse. They receiue it standing, and bowing the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of their bodies, because that is the best and most significant signe of subiection or submissiue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7861:107"/>
that is in vse amongst them: wee receiue it <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> kneeling, because this is the best and most significant signe of submissiue obedience, that is in vse or practice in these Westerne parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Did not some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs poyson their naturall and ciuill affections, with presumptuous conceits of extraordinary sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nature it selfe (to whom our Apostle in like case a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pealeth) would thorowly informe vs all, that wee stand bound to receiue so great a blessing, as in this Sacrament wee expect at the hands of our gracious. God, after the best and most submissiue maner of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gesture and deportment, that we know, or can frame our bodies vnto.</p>
            <p n="94">94. But if a man should aske, Whether the rite or custome obserued in the Greeke Church, or in our Church, be in it selfe the more decent or significant, or better befitting the vse or end of this Sacrament? I dare confidently affirme, that the ceremony or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture obserued and commanded by our Church, doth much better befit the vse and end of the Sacrament, than the rite or ceremony obserued by the Greeke Church doth; better than any other rite or manner can doe, though otherwise as decent and sitting, or more decent and fitting, in all other parts of Gods seruice. And my reason which I commend vnto your vnpartiall consideration, is this; that this Sacrament was not instituted in remembrance of the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, or to represent the Apostles maner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it, but in remembrance of our Sauiours death and passion. Whence I would request such as vrge our Sauiours example for a patterne of their behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or deportment at the Sacrament, to looke vpon
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7861:107"/>
our Sauiours bodily gesture or deportment in the heat <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> and extremity of his passion, wherein hee presented himselfe before his Father, in his agony and bloudy sweat in the Garden. Being in this agony, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> saith, he presented these supplications vnto his Father; <hi>Father, if thou be willing, remooue this cup from mee, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> But after what manner or gesture of body did his perplexed soule vtter these earnest supplications, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,] <hi>kneeling, or fixing his knees vpon the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="95">95. If I should haue spent the whole time alotted, onely in exhorting or preparing you to the fit &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuing of this Sacrament, I could not haue said more, or more to the purpose, than the contemplation of our Sauiour in this agony doth at first view present vnto all of vs, that will lay it to heart. And it is in a word this, that you would make his prayer, <hi>commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis commutandis,</hi> a patterne for your prayers; his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture in presenting his prayers to his Father, a patterne of your gesture or deportment, whilest you celebrate the memory of his passion, specially whilest you make application of the benefit of his passion to your selues, by receiuing the visible pledges of his body &amp; bloud; which I hope you doe not meane to receiue, without feruent prayer that God will passe ouer your sinnes, and not enter into iudgement with you. You need not, you may not interpose that condition in your prayer, which our Sauiour did in his, <hi>Father, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, let this cuppasse from mee.</hi> So great was his good-nesse towards vs, his louing kindnesse so tender, that he purchased vnto vs better certainty, and better assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that our prayers may be heard, than he had that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7861:108"/>
his owne prayers should bee heard in this particular. <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> Therfore it was not possible that this cup should passe from him, that it might be possible for it to passe from all, and euery one of vs. Pray we then, but let vs pray with <hi>bended knees,</hi> euery man for himselfe, and euery man for his fellow-Communicant: <q>Heauenly FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, seeing thou art willing so to haue it, let thy cup of thy wrath and displeasure passe from vs, and let thy cup of thy blessing be euer amongst vs: O cause not any of vs to drink of that bitter cup, which thy onely Sonne, our onely Sauiour, hath swallowed for vs. Expose vs not (good FATHER) to those bloudy and grieuous conflicts with the powers of Hell and darkenesse, which thy Sonne sustayned for vs. Oh lay no more vpon vs, than thou shalt giue vs strength and patience, through him, and for him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> vndergoe and vanquish. Make vs to triumph as Conquerours in this victory ouer Hell and Satan, ouer all the power of the enemy.</q> Thus praying whilest wee celebrate the memory of his agony and bloudy sweat with <hi>knees bended,</hi> as his in that agony were on the ground, and with hearts lifted vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where he now sits at the right hand of God; My life for yours, my soule for your soules, if herein yee offend eyther God the Father, or Christ his Sonne, the holy Spirit, or your owne consciences. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this blessed Sacrament without some mentall prayer, were to receiue it vnworthily. To pray whilest you receiue it, &amp; not to pray kneeling on your knees, as your custome is at other prayers, and as the Church your Mother, vpon this particular occasion of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in speciall inioyneth you, were to be offended in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7861:108"/>
Christ, more offended in him for the Church your <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> Mothers sake, than the Iewes were for <hi>Galile</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> his Country sake. Nor are you onely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in him, by refusing to bow your knees when you come vnto him; but you giue iust offence to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aduersary, to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aduiseth you, to giue no offence, much lesse to giue any aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth: for so you offend the pillar of truth, the Church of God. Now, God of his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy remoue all needlesse scruples out of the phansies of the weake, and all reall obstacles of offence out of the hearts of such as haue power to command their knees in this seruice.</p>
