            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, <hi>Sathan</hi> is ſubtile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades vs all goes well; there needes no sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this age; and that if any vſe it, the fals humor of their braines, rather then the tainted manners of theſe times, provokes it. Eſpecially this crime of cuſtomarie tartneſſe is like to be layd to my charge, who haue beene (as ſome thinke and I feele) too buſie in diſcouering falshood and error, and haue followed <hi>Truth too neere the heeles, to haue my teeth beaten out.</hi> But whilſt my tongue is left in my head; I will ſay with the <hi>Prophet</hi> Pſalme 37. <hi>If I forget thee, O Hieruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning: If I doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, let my tongue cleave to the roofe of my mouth, if I preferre not Hieruſalem aboue my chiefe ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must confeſſe I am the more earneſt against theſe common and crying iniquities, becauſe I my ſelfe was long ſubiected to them, and doe yet beare the ſcarres and cicatrices of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice both in mind, body, and fame. My mind, though not naked, yet, by the time I waſted idlely in their company, being disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of many neceſsaries, for which I doe often blush; my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though not altogether crazed, yet being older, weaker, and more ſubject to diſeaſes, and neerer the graue, then either my yeares or natiue constitution would haue carried me ſo early: My fame, though not tainted, yet being not ſo odoriferous, as 
<pb facs="tcp:17512:3"/>
becomes either my generall calling as a Christian, or particular as a Minister of Christ, <hi>a Holy and ſanctified veſſel of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>

               <hi>Theſe conſiderations makes me</hi> (being delivered from the bondage, though not from the body of that ſinne vvhich hath done me all this miſchiefe) <hi>more eager a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common and curſed corruptions of the time, and that for three reſpects.</hi>

            <p>Wee cry out of <hi>Popery,</hi> and there is cauſe; but <hi>Popery</hi> gets ground of vs whilſt wee want piety to withstand it; and keepe <note place="margin">Exo. 17. 12.</note>our owne ground conſtantly. <hi>Aaron and Hurr</hi> want care, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and courage, to <hi>hold vp their owne hands,</hi> much more to <hi>hold vp the hands of Moſes</hi> in the constant courſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice against the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> that Actuall, Magisteriall and Maiesticall kind of prayer.</p>
            <p>The corruption of manners hath broken downe our Walles, and let in that <hi>Troian Horſe</hi> laden with <hi>trumperies:</hi> And for my part I feare not <hi>what they bring in</hi> ſo much, as I doe the <hi>In-bringers.

            <p>Theſe being the greater number are the more dangerous: otherwiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:17512:3"/>
but for theſe, and but that wee know theſe will take part with the worſer <hi>part,</hi> wee would not feare the <hi>Romane Catholikes,</hi> ſince certainly the number of the true <hi>reformed Catholikes</hi> are in our <hi>Iſle</hi> the greater and ſtronger. But when I looke on theſe aſsiſtants I tremble.</p>
            <p>First, becauſe I know they will gladly entertayne that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is moſt <hi>glorious to the eye,</hi> promiſeth <hi>moſt world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages,</hi> and giues moſt <hi>ſatisfaction to corrupted nature,</hi> and conſists for the moſt part in <hi>externall rites.</hi> And if Turciſme should come next, they would preferre it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as <hi>Machiavell</hi> their maister doth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I feare lest God in Iudgement should ſuffer theſe <hi>thornes and nettles to pricke and ſting vs;</hi> becauſe whilst <note place="margin">Ioſ. 23. 13.</note>wee had time, occaſion, yea provocation, and meanes to weede vp theſe <hi>weedes,</hi> wee neglected our duties, and would not doe it, but keepe them as neceſſary <hi>fences to the garden of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe feares (if now it be not too late) I propound a remedy preached before, published now, <hi>that all may reade as they <note place="margin">Habacuck. 2. 2.</note> runne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was our <hi>Saviours</hi> charge to <hi>Peter, When thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, helpe to ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> That he denyed <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32. Mat. 26. 70</note>

               <hi>1. For the Iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Worthy and honorable Iudges, I intend not to take vpon me to inſtruct you as men ignorant of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though my warrant would carry it, and though my Maſter who hath inſtructed you thus farre, can yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you farther; and ſend <hi>Salomon</hi> to ſchoole to the <hi>Rauen,</hi> to the <hi>Piſmire,</hi> yea to the Lillies of the field, as being able to teach the wiſeſt man, by the weakeſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; onely I purpoſe to acquaint you with that which God hath taught me; to vvhich end I humbly beſeech you to ſuffer a vvord of exhortation: Your good words
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17512:14"/>
doe well, your good workes, and good examples doe better. <hi>Salomon the Preacher was King in Ieruſalem, Eccl. 1. 1.</hi> As therefore he gaue good charges like a Preacher, hee looked that his Officers should diſcharge and execute his Lawes and Canons like a King. <hi>Corpora coeleſtia calefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt, non in quantum calida, ſed in quantum ſunt velocis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; luminoſa.</hi> Shine therefore as you had wont in the eyes of all, as glorious examples of grace; and firſt ſee, examine, ſearch out truth and falshood, vice and vertue, right and wrong; for therein conſiſteth the glory of a <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 2.</note>Magiſtrate; the aduantage of place giues you meanes to do it, as the Sunne ſurvayes all things in his circuit. And then by ſwift motion, by ſwift execution, heate the coldneſſe of our Climate, ſtirre vp our zeale, ripen our late fruites, dry vp our drunken ſinne, whoſe inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes vs barren, vnfruitfull, and like water powred foorth, vveake to euery good worke. <hi>Oratio gloriae vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra.</hi> The people will ſpeake as they finde and feele; and either praiſe or diſgrace, followes good or euill deſert like a shadow. Therefore the shame of euill gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befals the Gouernours: <hi>For as the Iudge of the people is himſelfe,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Siracides, cap. 10. 2.) ſuch are his Officers: and what manner of man the Ruler of the Citie is, ſuch are all they that dwell therein.</hi> The people are the Magiſtrates <note place="margin">Ariſt. de Somn.</note>shadow, but much more his Officers. <hi>Cuius est poteſtas, eius eſt actus.</hi> Iudges therefore ought to beware, that not onely themſelues be innocent, but that their <hi>Fauourites,</hi> (O farre be that name from a Iudge, let Vertue and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice be onely his <hi>Fauourites</hi>) their Shadowes, their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers I meane, be cleane-hearted, and cleane-handed too; and euer remember, that the glory or dishonour not onely of themſelues, but of the whole State lies in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17512:14"/>
their hands; <hi>For Iustice exalteth a Nation, but ſinne is a shame to any people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I part from this party, I muſt ſpeake to the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Peace,</hi> who is an Appendix to this large Patent of Iuſtice, though ſomewhat abridged of late. I deſire him to receiue this plaine, but free and wholeſome admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Firſt, that he be carefull to binde his wife to the Peace, his children to the good behauiour, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle not with affaires of the Commonwealth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and vnſworne, leſt they make the husband, the father ashamed, as they haue done many husbands, and many fathers of late in this Land.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he ſuffer not a notorious tranſgreſſor of the Law in any kinde to be a Retayner of his, and to vvalke free from the cenſure of Iuſtice, vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and protection of his Liuerie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, ſince <hi>Proiectors</hi> haue eaſed him in his Office, and ſet vp Alehouſes (thoſe ſchooles of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule) vnder the authoritie of the broad Seale, and ſo left him little to do: that he vvould purſue carefully, what he hath begunne profitably, and binde out youths to Trades, and binde Tradeſmen to their vvorkes, that they may not (as now they doe) learne to trade to the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and from thence to the Gallowes; but by the vvay take in the Houſe of correction. And thus much of the firſt perſon, the Iudge.</p>
            <p>The ſecond perſon is the <hi>Plaintife;</hi> the third perſon is the <hi>Defendant:</hi> both theſe we vvill ioyne together vpon one yſſue for therefore they come hither.</p>
            <p>Here firſt, I wish that wranglers and malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, vvho ſeeke and hunt after occaſions of ſuite and contention, might not onely bee reſtrained, but by ſeuere
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17512:15"/>
cenſures made examples to warne others to beware of vncharitableneſſe. As <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed to God, <hi>Lord bee not mercifull to them that ſinne of malicious wickedneſſe;</hi> ſo do I to you, my Lords. Doubtleſſe whilſt <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes that God vvould not be mercifull to ſuch, hee intended to shew no mercie towards them himſelfe: for vvhere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is the purſuer of the quarrell, it is pitie but iuſtice with ſeueritie should meet with the purſuite.</p>
            <p>As for all others I aduiſe them, that (where they can) they should charitably compound their owne differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ſuffer themſelues (for their owne good) to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Iuſtices of peace, or their next diſcreeteſt neighbours, who are ready to doe for them without charge, what muſt be here done perhaps by Twelue leſſe ſufficient men after all their expences.</p>
            <p>But in vaine ſpeake I to them, (hot-headed fellowes as they are) I muſt therefore turne me to their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> by whom perhaps they will bee governed. Alas no, the Suit for the moſt part is betwixt him and them; hee by his example learnes them to wrangle, and onely in that they will be his followers. But if hee bee ſuch a man as rather attends vpon the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, then the practiſe of the Lawes of the Kingdom, (I meane in forbearing to commence actions) and ſo out of conſcience will rather ſuffer ſome wrong, then right himſelfe too haſtily by the Lawe, euill men will eſteeme him the leſſe, and giue him the leſſe; nay, they will giue him nothing, and care nothing for him. They ſay of ſuch, that they are <hi>God Almighties fooles,</hi> and they meane to make them their <hi>fooles</hi> too.

O! I beſeech you, ſince <hi>Iuſtice</hi> makes you ſo great, as you riſe to build the greateſt families of this Land, lay a lawfull foundation vpon good ground, that it may not totter aſſoone as you are dead, and rot before <note place="margin">Ioſuah. 7.</note>your bodyes be rotten.

It was once a queſtion indeed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17512:16"/>
amongſt the <hi>Phareſies,</hi> whether it were lawfull to doe good on the <hi>Sabaoth</hi> day or no: but I thought till now, that to do enil vpon any day, eſpecially vpon this day, had beene without queſtion vnlawfull. But if it be now queſtionable with any, learne to ouerrule it vvith a booke-caſe in the Scripture, the Law of God. And for <note place="margin">Leuit. 26. 34. 35.</note>practiſe in the Lawes of the Land, take the reuerend Iudges for a preſident, and be ſonnes vvorthy of ſuch fathers, vvho being moued by the vveake oratory of ſimple man, but the powerfull operation of Gods holy Spirit,) haue left an old corrupt cuſtome, ſubmitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the ſecond and third perſon, the <hi>Plaintife</hi> and <hi>Defendant,</hi> &amp; their learned Counſel at Law.</p>
            <p>The fourth perſon required neceſſarily in euery ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary judgement, is the vvitneſſe. And this is not only hee vvhich is brought in by <hi>Sub-paena</hi> in ſome ſpeciall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but euery Iury-Man, euery Officer, vvho ought to informe the Court of truth, &amp; to preſent ſuch crimes as are vvithin the compaſſe of their inquirie.</p>
            <p>Theſe vvould be looked after, my Lords; for theſe are the principall cauſe that juſtice is not executed: vvhilſt for feare or fauour, or ſome other ſiniſter reſpect, they conceale vvhat they knovv, or are packt and made afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand fit for the matter. And I haue heard ſome of the vviſeſt ſort ſay, that if your Honors vvould bee pleaſed to take an exact roule and accompt of ſuch preſentments as are brought and found before you this Aſſiſes, and revievv it againe at your returne the next Aſſiſes, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17512:17"/>
ſo continue it by a ſetled courſe, you should finde ſome <hi>Iacks</hi> faulty, and ſome cogges miſſing, vvhereby the wheele of luſtice is hindered in his circular courſe: yea doubtles, you should finde ſome ſaints names wiped out of the Calender, which you had ſet there perhaps in red letters.</p>
            <p>And now vvorthy Countrymen, I turne me to you; Conſider I beſeech you theſe three things aduiſedly: 1. Firſt the danger of lying, much more of ſwearing falſely, vvhilſt thereby you offend againſt foure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt againſt your owne conſcience, vvhich you wound; and though now you bee not ſenſible of the ſore, it will feſter, and you shall then feele it moſt when there vvilbe found no plaiſter to cure it. 2. Secondly, you offend againſt the innocent, whom you hurt and ouerthrow. 3. Thirdly, you offend againſt the Iudge whom you miſleade to do iniuſtice. 4. Fourthly, you offend againſt God, whom you contemne, taking his bleſſed Name in vaine, and he hath ſworne, and vvill performe it (for he cannot lye, much leſſe forſweare <note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note>himſelfe) that <hi>he will not hold you guiltleſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, conſider the danger of concealing ſinne: although you thinke it nothing, but a caſt of your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a curteſy, a fauour, that you may doe a friend in a corner vnſeene and vnshent: yet aſſure your ſelues vvhilſt you palliate ſinne, you take vpon you the ſin committed; and whatſoeuer after the party may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for lacke of cenſure or due punishment, it is your ſinne aſwell as his; though he bee the lawleſſe father, yet you muſt anſwere for the Baſtard.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly and laſtly, conſider the dignity of your
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17512:17"/>
imployment, and the honour or shame which ſucceeds it. What a dignitie is it to bee eyes and eares to theſe great Officers? nay, to bee (as it were) ioyned in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion vvith them to punish ſinne, to execute iuſtice? As therefore you thinke it a shame in any of them, vvhere you ſee, or doe but ſuſpect an vniuſt conniuence at ſinne: ſo call home your thoughts, and conſider, if among a few triuiall matters you will be found faultie, how they may be held excuſed, if amongſt a multitude of ſeuerall caſes their iudgements or affections be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled by ſome particular. And ſince all crimes in the Country are in your owne hands to preſent to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, blame your ſelues if you bee ouer-cumbred with offenders. Deſtroy idleneſſe, and deſtroy all other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for <hi>all vices like vermine breed in that burrow.</hi> But if you neglect this, being ſlouthfull and idle your ſelues, and euery one shifting off the worke from his owne shoulders, poſting it from one to another, (as men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſirous to pleaſure an euill neighbour, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite the Commonwealth) aſſure your ſelues, theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons shal be left to corrupt your children with their wicked conuerſations; and ſo in time not onely to deſtroy and waſte your priuate eſtates, but to indanger the whole eſtate of the Commonwealth; and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it with vice, as it is reported of a great Citie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by Conies, and the like Vermine, ſuffered to digge and harbour vnder the walles and houſes thereof. <hi>For Iuſtice exalteth a Nation, but ſinne is a shame to any people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the laſt perſon, the Witneſſe. But now leſt all the reſt that heare mee this day; should thinke the matter nothing concernes them, vvho are neither Iudges, nor Plaintifes, nor Defendants, nor witneſſes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17512:18"/>
I muſt before I conclude, ſay ſomething to all in generall.</p>
            <p>To all therefore in generall I giue theſe two obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: you haue heard how <hi>Iustice exalteth a Nation,</hi> and how <hi>ſinne is a shame to any people:</hi> I pray therefore collect your ſpirits, call home your thoughts, and make ſerious and diligent inquirie of theſe two particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, inquire and conſider whether this Nation of ours ſtands now in as honorable termes with other Nations in the eye of the world, as it had wont: if you finde it doth continue the wonted reputation, then iudge our Iuſtice remaines; but if you finde it begin to ſtinke in the noſthrils of forraine Nations, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude certainly, that our ſinne abounds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, begin at the other end, and conſider if there be any great ſinnes practiſed in the Land, and left vnpunished; ſuch as are blaſphemie, the prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, drunkenneſſe, murther, and the like; or ſome crying ſinnes committed with an high hand, as if they were vertues; ſuch as are Vſurie, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Bribery, Oppreſſion, and all manner of like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: Sigh, and pray, and weepe, and shew your ſelues no partners in the <hi>ſinne,</hi> but ſorrowfull for the <hi>shame</hi> that followeth. But if vpon examination you find this Nation cleere of thoſe crimes, or that <hi>iuſtice</hi> is duly executed vpon the committers of ſuch crimes, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude vs a glorious people. For <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> haue relation each to other, and ſo hath <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>Shame:</hi> if wee be <hi>iust</hi> we are <hi>glorious;</hi> if wee be <hi>glorious,</hi> we are <hi>iust:</hi> If we be <hi>ſinfull,</hi> we are <hi>shamefull;</hi> if we be <hi>shamefull,</hi> we are <hi>ſinfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pooreſt and ſimpleſt man that is may thus iudge
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17512:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of himſelfe, and ſo preuent the Iudge of all the world, that he be not iudged. Nay, thus in execution of iuſtice vpon himſelfe, he may helpe forward to aduance the glory of a State. But if (being no publike perſon) hee cannot by <hi>Iuſtice exalt a Nation,</hi> yet by abſtaining from ſinne, hee may bee one of the ten to preſerue a people from <hi>shame,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> had done Sodome, if there could haue <note place="margin">Geneſ. 18.</note>beene found nine more iuſt like himſelfe in that Citie. For euery inhabitant is either an <hi>Achan</hi> to shame the <note place="margin">Ioſuah. 7.</note>place in which he dwels with ſinne, and to draw a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall curſe vpon it, or elſe a <hi>Lot</hi> to ſaue it from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; like that poore man in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> mentioned by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.</note>who with his iuſtice and wiſedome deliuered the Citie from the extremitie it ſtood in. And therefore vvhatſoeuer thou art, be ſober in thy ſelfe, in thy appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, meate, drinke, deſires; bee iuſt to thy ſelfe, and to thy houshold: gouerne thy wife, chaſtiſe thy childe, cherish thy ſeruant. Looke then abroad, defraude not others for thine owne advantage; ſell not heauen for earth. Thinke when thou art weighing of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thou art weighing of thy ſoule; the ſcale of Iuſtice is in thy hand, and if thou addeſt to thy <hi>ſinne for gaine,</hi> thou addeſt to thy <hi>shame for loſſe.</hi> Thinke when thou art meaſuring thy Wares, thou art meaſuring thy Iuſtice, <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note>and ſo thy glory. It is in thy hand to make the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and latitude thereof as thou pleaſeſt: <hi>For as thou</hi>

               <hi>meaſurest, it shall be meaſured to thee againe.</hi> And therefore doe as thou wouldeſt be done to. <hi>Ab alio expectes, quod</hi>

               <hi>alteri feceris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You haue heard in the beginning of two marriages or coniunctions in this text of Scripture: the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> the ſecond betwixt <hi>Sinne and</hi>

               <hi>Shame;</hi> and how vve muſt not <hi>ſeuer what God hath ioyned together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where therefore we finde <hi>Vertue,</hi> let vs giue her the due reward, <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>reuerence,</hi> or <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But haue we done thus? haue wee beene thus iuſt? alas no: for then vvhen Offices either in the Church or Commonwealth vvere voyd, it would bee as hard a matter to finde iuſt &amp; vertuous men fit to ſupply them, as now it is hard for worthy men to finde imployment, except they buy it from the vnworthy.</p>
            <p>The ſecond marriage is betwixt <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>Shame:</hi> where therefore vve finde <hi>Sinne</hi> in vvhatſoeuer perſon, high or low, rich or poore, let vs ſend his wife <hi>Shame</hi> to beare him company; for better trouble one houſe then more.</p>
            <p>But haue we done thus? haue we bin thus iuſt to giue euery <hi>ſinne</hi> his proper <hi>shame?</hi> haue not, many husbands amongſt vs loſt their prerogatiues with <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their wiues to ouer-rule them without shame?

            <p>Laſtly, as we had before two <hi>marriages,</hi> and two <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſo wee haue in this text two <hi>oppoſitions;</hi> the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>ſinne,</hi> the ſecond, betwixt <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> as betwixt light and darkeneſſe, truth and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, white and blacke, God and Sathan, hell and heauen. It were a shame therefore to ioyne thoſe things together which God hath oppoſed in Nature. If <hi>Iuſtice</hi> therefore should make <hi>ſinne</hi> eyther a wife, or a childe, or a friend, or a ſeruant, or a fauorite and companion at

bed, or at board, or on the bench; this could not be done without a <hi>Diabolicall contract,</hi> a <hi>Sodomiticall mixture,</hi> a ſinne againſt Nature. Therefore let <hi>Iuſtice</hi> make <hi>ſinne</hi> a ſlaue, a drudge, a priſoner: for if he waxe familiar once, he will rule and reigne ouer thee, and thou shalt not be maſter at home, no not in thine owne houſe; nay, not in thine owne heart.</p>

               <head>A Prayer for the whole state of the Realme.</head>
               <p>O Lord, thou haſt made all things for thine owne glorie to manifeſt thy power, thy wiſdome, bewtie, love, juſtice and holines: and amongſt all theſe things, thou haſt made man after thine image, enduing him with originall power, wiſdome, beautie, love, juſtice, and holines. And that he might not only have, but exerciſe theſe vertues, thou madeſt this inferiour world for him, and didſt ſubiect a world of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to his rule and government; ſo that he ſeemed a God vpon earth, having ſo free, ſo large, ſo ample a comaund over his fellow Creatures. He was naked and not ashamed, for being framed by ſo perfect a workman, and formed after thy image, the image of perfection, he knew that there was nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, or without him, whereof he need be ashamed, but much whereof to glorie and reioyce. The more he ſaw and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated himſelfe, the more cauſe he ſaw there was to love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for being like thee, and to love thee for ſo making him. This Sathan ſaw with envie, and it was another hell for him to ſee it: and (hating thee and all things for thee) he ſeduced man with pride and ambition, cauſing him not to reſt ſatisfied with what thou hadſt given him, but to deſire all things which thou hadſt made only for thy felfe. And thus vainely and foolishly to neglect the rule of himſelfe and the inferiour Creatures in juſtice (contrarie to thy commaund) and to affect the tree of knowledge of good and evill which thou hadſt only forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him. By this meanes (O Lord) ſeeking more then he should, he loſt what he had; and labouring indirectly to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to thee, he defaced thine image and whatſoever was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him like vnto thee; So that his wiſdome became foolish ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie; his beautie, painted vglineſſe; his love, luſtfull vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe; his juſtice, extreame injurie and vnrighteouſnes; his holines either ydolatrie or prophaneſſe, and the whole man a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ghoſt, a golden Sepulchre. And now as before thou didſt caſt Sathan out of Heaven for pride (where no vncleane thing can ſtay or enter) ſo didſt thou eject man out of <hi>Paradice</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of other inheritance (for him and all his wretched
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17512:22"/>
poſteritie) then hell which he had deſerved and wee in him. But herein appeared thy exceeding and ſuperaboundant love, not only pardoning this ſinne of his and ours, but in ſending thy Sonne into the world to dye for vs, to ſatisfie thy juſtice, and to purchaſe for vs a neerer, and ſurer conjunction to thee, then that which wee had before, and loſt, even a conjunction betwixt thy love and our faith, which the gates of hell cannot prevaile againſt. And that Sathans envie might be more exaſperated (as a punishment vnto himſelfe, a glory vnto thee) that which he intended for our curſe thou haſt turned to our crowne, and wee are truly in a way to become like thee, yea to be vnited to thee: So that as if thou hadſt made all things for man, we have intereſt in all things, in thee and all; and thus are <hi>truly,</hi> what Sathan <hi>falſely</hi> told vs, wee should be, <hi>become as Gods knovving good and evill;</hi> the <hi>evill</hi> by preſent experience and fruition, the <hi>good</hi> in future hope and expectation. And that wee might not faint in this our wearie pilgrimage, thou haſt breathed thy <hi>Spirit</hi> into vs, and given him to be our comforter, who <hi>daily</hi> asſiſteth our prayers, our meditations, our devotions, teaching vs to call thee Father, and leading vs into every truth; <hi>daily</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting forvs our profeſt enemy Sathan, giving vs wiſdome to diſcover his treacherie, and diſcerne him for an adverſarie; <hi>daily</hi> renueth in vs thine image, conforming vs by degrees to the rules of thy lawe; making vs wiſe, and beautifull, and loving, and iuſt, and holy in part, by inſpiration, inſtruction, and affliction; by the humble and patient ſufferance of worldly wiſdome to beguile and flowte vs, of corporall beautie to contemne and deface vs, of carnall love to reiect and ſcorne vs, of politique juſtice to perſecute and martyr vs, of ſuperſtitious and ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous holineſſe to shun and abhorre vs, of devillish Atheiſme to deride and abuſe vs: whileſt wee know and reſt aſſured, that thou, who workeſt all things for the beſt for thine elect, thy poore diſtreſſed and diſperſed little flocke, beholdeſt all this, and laugheſt to ſcorne the foolish imaginations of mans hart, and in the meane time ſecureſt vs of thy love by infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and teacheſt vs in every eſtate to be contented: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thou who ordereſt all things according to thine owne
