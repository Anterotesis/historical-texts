         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>VCIVS Sergius Catiline, a noble man borne, hadde manye vertues, dusked and defaced with exceadynge greate vices. He was ingenious and bolde, hee hadde a good memorie, and was well lerned. To doo anye greate enterprise, hys counsayle was not to seeke, and to goo thoroughe therewythall, he wanted neyther tongue nor hande. He was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte man of warre: he coulde suffer and endure labour, watche, colde, thryste, and honger, far beyonde that any man wolde beleue. But at these his qualities men most merueiled: hee coulde wynne and obteyne the loue and friendshyp of euery man, and with seruiseable lowlines kepe and mainteyne the same: all that he hadde was at his friendes commaundement, and he denied to no man desiringe any thyng that he coulde geue. But excedynge greate vices surmounted these vertues: hys audacitie was incredible, hys vnshamefastnes very singuler, hys vnconstancie wonderfull, fierce of mynde, dishonest, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytefull, and lecherous: ne there was neuer man more vnfaythful or more cruell then he. Ne there was neuer man in this worlde, I thynke, that had his desires and inclinacions so contrarie, so diuers, and so repugnante to nature. In rapinge and catchinge he was auarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in rewardynge prodigall: he kepte company wyth manye lewde and dishonest persons: and yet feyned him selfe to esteme none but men moste vertuous and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. He hyghly hated all good men: and was most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myliar with men most noble. With men of sadnes he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:2049:6"/>
soberly, with pleasaunt felowes merilye, with olde men saddely, with youth youthely, with misdoers bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with lecherous lecherously. This man from his child hade led his lyfe in all vnlefull lewdenes: many thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after his luste and pleasure, and many thinges cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily, he dyd to the citizens of Rome and their alies: and many deedes of sacrilege and wickednes he committed bothe againste the goddes and men. For he takynge Syllas parte, slewe with his owne hande Q. Cecilius, M. Volumnius, and L. Tantasius, moste noble city<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Rome: bycause they were of the contrary parte. Also after that he had with beatynges all to haled and torne throughe the citie of Rome M. Marius Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus (the whiche was of the common people singularly beloued, and which had ben twise Pretor, and to whom for honour the people had erected images in eueri strete of Rome) he strake of the heade frome his shulders, the people lookinge vpon hym: and he with his owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bare the head not yet fullye deade, frome the lyttell towne, not farre frome Rome, called Ianiculum, vnto Sylla to the temple of Appollo. There be also, whyche saye that Catiline defyled hym selfe wyth slaughter of his owne brother: and afterwarde dredyng therfore to be punyshed, he besoughte Sylla that his brother that he had kylde, myght be intituled amonge the nombre of them that were condemned. He slewe also Catullus, his systers husbande, a ryght worshypfull knight of Rome. Catiline was had in suspicion of incest, committed with hys owne syster. Farthermore beyng Pretor in Affrica, he so vexed and afflicted the countrey, that the ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doures of Affrike (hee yet gouernynge the Prouince) made a greuous complaynte vpon hym in the Senate
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:2049:6"/>
house, and sharpe sentences were of the fathers gyuen agaynste hym in the senate house: for some Senatours wolde he shoulde haue ben delyuered to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, And as sone as he was returned from Affryca, the yonge man Pub. Clodius accused hym or extorcion and brybery. Cicero in Toga ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dida, and Lucretius in the orations that he worte agaynste Catiline, obiected agaynste hym, that he had maryed his owne doughter, the whiche he begate on a gentell woman, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he haunted very moche: And it was reported for so certayne, that he had committed fornicacyon with Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bia, Ciceros wyfes sister, and a nonne, that beinge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused therof, vnneth he escaped through fauour of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus. Finally Catiline caught with the loue of Aurely Orestilla, that had (as the fame wente) a faire and a beautifull face, slewe his owne wife. After that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Aurelia to his wyfe, but she not fearing his house that runne of bloude of his fyrste wife, but that she was adredde of his sonne in lawe a yonge man, therfore she sayde she durste, not marye with hym. But Catiline to the ende he mighte haue Aurelia, heaped myschyefe vppon mischyefe: for when he hadde poysoned hys sonne in lawe, he maried Aurelia. Nor Catiline defiled hym selfe noo more with the filthy loue of women, then he did of boyes. Thus Catiline beinge spotted with so manye wicked cursed, and shamefull dedes burned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye with an incredyble desyre to oppresse the common welthe. For he coueted honours, the imperial roumes, prouynces, triumphes, and thynges out of his reache: the whiche he had no hope to obteyne, so longe as the common weale was in quiete: but beinge troubled, he beleued veryly to haue them. Lastely trustynge in hys
<pb facs="tcp:2049:7"/>
great route of vnthriftes and hopelostes, he toke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle to enuade the common weale.</p>
                     <p>¶But for bycause L. Catiline conspired twise ageynst the common weale, ones when Lepidus and Vulcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us weere consuls, and ageyne when Cicero was consul it is requisite, before we come to the thynges that were done in the time of Ciceros consulshyp, somwhat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite of the former Conspiracy.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAN P. Antronius and P. Sylla were chosen to be consuls: (L. Tullus, M. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus beinge consuls) they were accused of ambition, and spoyled of honour and fame: Antronius (as he was a man, which in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>speritie was accustomed to dispise al men, and in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie to striue ageynste those that were good men) wold neyther gyue place to tyme, nor yet to Fortune her selfe, but thought in his mynde by force to recouer the consul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship, which he had forgone by iustice. Wherefore he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed his intente to L. Catiline, and L. Vargunteius, and Gn. Piso, an vnthriftye, riottous, and hasty yonge man, and very desyrous to disturbe the common weale. The whiche supposynge they coulde not easely brynge this thinge to passe, withoute the helpe of some greate man, they got to associate and helpe them L. Licinius Crassus, a man that florished in great fauour, rychesse, and honoure. Hym they made theyr chiefe capitayne in this matter? bycause he was not frendely but ennemye to Gn. Pompei, and sore agreued that he grewe so gret in the common weale. These men conspired aboute the
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:2049:7"/>
vij. daye of December, and purposed with a great nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre of bondmen and sworde players, gathered together the fyrste daye Ianuarye folowinge, to slee L. Cotta, and L. Torquatus the consuls, and to besiege the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice: and after they had murdered many of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures, Crassus shoulde inuade the dictatourshyppe: Catiline and Antronius, catchynge vp the ornamentes of consulshyp with the sergiantes, shulde descende into the felde: and the common weale ordered after theyr di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uise, Piso withe an armye shoulde be sente to conquere bothe Spaynes. But Crassus, when the daye of thys murther was come, repentinge hym selfe, wolde not be there. Wherfore the other conspiratoures were so disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, by reason of his absence, that they coulde not performe theyr enterprise. Some report otherwise, and they writen, that these noble men were not slaine, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that Catiline gaue token to the rebels, before they were redy. C. Caesar, and P. Sylla, moste noble cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were named to be in this conspiracie. And farther theye saye, it was so appoynted, Caesar shoulde haue ben maister of the horsemen. But Caesars vertue, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, and magnyficente mynde defendethe hym not to be in this conspiracie: And the moste noble oratour, Q. Hortentus defendethe Sylla.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L thoughe the fyrste conspyracye came shamefullye to passe, yet Catiline chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not his purpose, nor woulde desyste frome his wicked and cursed perswasyon to oppresse the common weale: But was more feruente and desyrous by reason that he supposed, some mishap letted, that the first conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy went not luckely forwarde: and againe bycause there were many citizens of Rome, whiche to lyue in lust and lykynge, were so farre endetted, that they coulde not come, oute withoute sellynge of theyr landes. But they loued so moche theyre possessions, that rather then they shulde be spoyled of them, Catiline wiste verye wel thei wolde venter to do what soeuer he desired them. Also the hope that he had, to obtayne the consulshep, kende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led moche his courage, and, namely, bycause he hoped to haue to be hys felowe in office C. Antonius his speci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all frende. Farthermore his decaye in substaunce, and his beastely, cruel, and importunate nature stered hym, which desired neyther rest nor yet warre: except it were amonge them selfe. There was also a greatter cause whiche stablyshed Catiline (a man of his owne corage bent to disturbe the common weale) in hys hardynes &amp; desyre: For after that L. Sylla had by conquest taken on hym to rule the common weale, puttinge out the old inhabitaunce of Fesules, appoynted his men of warre (to whome he had gyuen ryght greate prayes) to dwel there. These men of nedy persons beinge sodeynly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryched with other mennes goodes, beganne, to buylde
<pb n="iiij" facs="tcp:2049:8"/>
righte sumptous and statelye manour places and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to make costly feastes and great expences. And whyle they thus lyued after the maner and arraye of kynges, the greate abundaunce of goodes, that they by spillynge of bloude and slaughter of citizens had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together, were sone wasted and spente. For yll go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goodes are soone broughte to naughte.<note place="margin">Ill gotten goodes.</note> And after warde in that nedynes, the ryottous and sumptouse facion, that they vsed in abundaunde remaynyng styl, it is incredible to speake, howe greately they fel in det. And for this cause all theyr hole desire was to haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion, discorde, and warre amonge them selfes. And to the great settynge forwarde of theyr matter, Gn. Pyso a stoute stomaked and valyant yonge man, of whome we spake before, was in the hither Spayne wyth an ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mye. But he was endued and brought vp in condicion lyke Catiline, couetous a foo to reste and quietnes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to good men, a waster of his owne goodes, and a catcher of other mennes, a standarde bearer of sedicion and sterer to stryfe of chapemem. Fartherfore P. Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius Nucerius ruled then the prouynce of Maury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, whiche was a man beyonde al measure desirous of a newe alteracion in the common weale: those were Catilines greattest frendes. For lykenes of nature and maners hath great strength in knittyng fast frindshyp.<note place="margin">Likenes of maners</note> With these two Catiline had oft afore tyme a counsayl as concerninge to moue warre, and hoped now at thys tyme, that the conspyracye should be ryght greatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by theyr ayde and power, Into this deuellysshe desyre he was drawen with a certayne vehemency and fury bycause he sawe al thinges went as Gn. Pompei, and a fewe other wolde haue it. For whyle L. Tullus,
<pb facs="tcp:2049:9"/>
and M. Lepidus were consuls, it was longe debated in the Senate house, who shulde be chosen capitaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynste the kynge Mithridates: Catiline laboured all that he coulde with frendshippe, fauour, and ambition, to be capitayne of that warre: but all the Senatoures styfely withstode hym, and appoynted Gn. Pompey, to be in that hyghe roume, namely by the meanes of Cice<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ro, then beinge Pretor. Fierce Catiline touched wythe this rebuke, beinge ennemie to good men, and sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Senatoures, determyned hym selfe to disturbe the common weale. Callynge also to mynde, how many citizens he had slaine, the manyfolde cursed and wicked fornications, &amp; aduoutryes, and the infinite vengeable dedes, that he had commytted and doone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynste his countrey, the goddes and men, and thought euery houre eyther to be put in pryson or to be banished For the misdoers fere always to be punished.<note place="margin">Feare fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth misdoers.</note> And this semed to Catiline to make highly for his purpose, that there was none armye in Italye, and that euery place was ful of desperate, vnthrifty, and naughty persones. Wherfore Catiline surely trusted by so manye and soo great oportunities, easely to oppresse the comon weale, got vnto hym very many frendes and alies of al sortes of men.</p>

And loke whom he knewe folehardye, him moste gladlye wolde he reteyne into his frendeship. For he saide they that muste be called to be assocyate in a ciuyll warre, shulde in no wise be feareful and coward caytyues. Farthermore he intyced to hym manye noble yonge men, to some promysynge bodilye luste and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to some the deathe of theyr parentes, some he wan with money, some with fauoure, some withe bodelye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ye with the helpe of a myscheuous dede, if nede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: and as he sawe in them diuers inclinacions, so withe diuers reasons he allured them to be his frendes. Also he enterteyned certayne men of greate power and honestye by dissimulacion and cloked vertue. For (as we sayde) he was adourned with many noble qualities, the whiche I woulde to god he had turned and applyed to a better intent and purpose.</p>
                     <p>¶Thus whan Catiline had got together a huge mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ryottous hopelostes, and vnthriftye caytyues about the fyrste daye of Iune, L. Iulius Cesar, and C. Marius Fygulus beynge consuls, fyrste he beganne to proue euery mans courage aparte secretely, &amp; to declare what great aduauncementes they shulde haue by reason of the conspiracie, to some that were couetous he sayde, theyr tyme was come to haue inoughe: to some desirous thereof he behighte roume and auctorite: some he put in remembraunce of greate spoyle, pillage, and robberye. And so after he perceiued they were redye and prompt to the matter, all the moste noble, and moste valiante and hardye enterprisers, and them, with whom he was most
<pb facs="tcp:2049:10"/>
familiar and nerest alied, he assembled together into the house of M. Lecca. This house Catiline chose oute for hym, bycause it stode farre from the frequence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorte of people: for he demed an oute corner or a solyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place moste conueniente for hys purpose. So thither resorted to this assembly of the most noble linage of the Cornelians, P. Lentulus Sura, a manne lykelye to be consull, and was nephewe to that moste noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lentulus, which beinge armed, pursued Gracchus into the hyll Auentine. This Lentulus in feruente de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre of roume and auctorite was egall to Catiline: but touchynge the greate diligence, wit, and polyce vsed in warre, he was nothynge comparable to hym. Ne the lesse he was a man of goodlye personne, and righte elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente in wordes, and beinge induced by diuinacion, he beleued, that his name was predestinate to destroye the common weale. For he sayde, that by the bokes of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill, and answeres of the southesayers, there shoulde be three of that name Cornelius, that shulde be souerayne gouernours: and that he him selfe was the thyrde Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, to whome the empire and kingdome of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes ought of necessitie to come. For he sayde, that Sinna and Sylla had bene before him.</p>
                     <p>¶Miserable and wretched ar those men that put truste in suche southsaiers, to whome the punishement of Len<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tulus ought to be a good example, on how many rough rockes and perils they make men to runne</p>
                     <p>¶In this lentulus noughte remayned of the noble bloude of his ancestoures, ne nothing of theyr glorious and famous dedes: but all thynges contrary to theym, for in stede of theyre honestie, temperaunce, manlinesse, and prudence, he was indewed with fylthynesse, lechery
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:2049:10"/>
sluggishe slouthe and foolehardynesse. But yet he was twyse Senatour, and twise accused in iudgemente, and escaped.</p>
                     <p>¶Also thither came C. Cethegus, this man passed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline in lewde enterprises, and foolehardynesse, but in feates of warre, nobilitie, and strength of body, he was in maner egall to hym. For he beinge but a souldioure in the warres, dyd many greate and notable dedes, full oft his ennemy in armes he ouerthrewe: he was a right good horseman, and a perfect man of armes. And there was no businesse so weyghty, nor none so harde and dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficile, but that it semed to him lighte and easy: So grete so large, and so immoderate was his hart and courage. This man had afore time fore wounded the moste no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthye man Q. Metelius Pius. And had an other tyme, as it was saide, conspired agaynst the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale</p>
                     <p>¶Also of this band was P. Cimber Gabinius, a great man of birthe: but hee was dishoneste, cruell, a poller, proude, deceitfull, vnshamefaste, and gyuen to bodelye luste.</p>
                     <p>¶Also of this confideraci were L, Crassus Longinus and P. Antronius, bothe noble men, bothe eloquente, boothe hadde in great honour and estimacion, and both were consuls at diuers times: those two were lyke in carnall luste, in cruelnes, in shamefastenes, and their audacitie double: of the whiche the tone by force and violence thruste men out of theyr possessions, slewe and murthered, and robbed churches and chapels, the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commytted many abuoutries and fornications. It were to longe for me to diseriue euery mannes lyfe and maners, namely sythe I haste me to declare the thyngs
<pb facs="tcp:2049:11"/>
that are more necessary to be spoken.</p>
                     <p>¶ Soo there assembled together in this house, beside those that are afore rehersed, L. Vargunteius a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, P. Seruius Silla, Q. Curius, Q. Annius, P. &amp; M. Lecca, L. Calphurmus Bestia, M. Fuluius Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior, P. Satilius, P. Furius, Manlius Chilo, and P.

                     <p>¶ Also there were some, that woulde not come at thys assemble, but they were priuelye parteners to this mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuous dede, and secretly dyd ayde and helpe Catiline. Amonge the whiche some saide, that M. Crassus, and C. Cesar, had knowledge of this conspiracie, and were bothe helpers and furtherers of the same. They sayde, that Crassus was driuen thereto by reason that he was sore greued in his mynde to se G. Pompei hys ennemye to be of al men (for the noble dedes and conquestes that he had done, both by lande and sea) demed and estemed as chiefe and soueraigne of the citye: and for that cause Crassus trusted, if the conspiratours dydde vanquishe and ouercome, that he hym selfe myghte easelye bee the prince and soueraigne of all the worlde. They sayde Ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sar was driuen therto, by reason that through his great and large liberalitie, he owed aboue, DCCC.xxx. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes. Some saye that all these thynges were feyned and blowen abrode by their enemies: and shoulde in no wyse be beleued, that so noble men shoulde confederate them selues with Lentulus Catiline, and Cethegus, desperate caitiues. What certeine knowledge I haue of eyther of them, I wyl after in place conuenient declare.

I haue no word more greuous when I name this royal power: but surely theyr power is greatter than a kinges. What kingdome was there euer, that had mo kynges at one tyme, what kinge was there euer so mightie and soo stronge, the whiche had a

To these men all the whole world, kynges, princes, and straunge nacions haue ben alwaies tributours. And so they haue all the power, fauoure, ryches, worshyp, and honoure. To the satisfiynge of the whole couetousenes, surelye it semeth all the whole worlde is to lyttell and ouer straite.

There are but ouer many redy to recouer liberti, the market place is ful of those men, al the townes of Italye are ful, all Italie is reysed vp, men of al states and condicion, and finally men of euery age agree and consent all on this one thynge.

Mutius Oressinus the profectour of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wolde haue letted this decree to go forthe, to the sore and greuouse displeasure of the Senatoures: Cicero rose vp and ryghte sharpelye rebuked Q. Mutius: and vehementlye inuehed againste L. Catiline and C. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius, with manye and fauorable murmuracions of the hole senate therunto. And in that same oracion, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge vnto Catiline (the whiche a fewe dayes before,
<pb facs="tcp:2049:16"/>
was by preuaricacion and falsehod quite of pelye theft) he prophecied and saide: O thou wretche, that doste not perceiue that thou were not clerely quite and deliuered by that iudgemente, but reserued to suffer a sharper and more greuous punyshment. And at the very same tyme of eleccion, a rumoure was spredde abrode amonge the commons, that certaine citizens were confederate and agreed together, to oppresse the common weale, and to murther and slee the Senatours. The ground and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynner of this rumoure was Q. Curius, felowe and partener of all theire counsaylynges, the whiche kepte paramoure one Fuluia, not onely a ryghte noble but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a notable woman. This man beynge hollye geuen to bodelye pleasure, ydlenes, and vanities, to the intent he myghte throughe hope of the conspiracie allure her the better to loue and fauoure hym, he tolde to her all the counsayles of the conspiratoures.

So this Fuluia tolde vnto manye and diuers, all that euer she herde of Curius, withoute namynge anye of the conspiratoures. This thynge holpe and greatlye furthered Cicero to bee consull. For all that desyred to saue and defend the common weale from that myschief, incontinent went and stacke to Cicero as to a man that naturally was inclined to reste and peace, and that had the knoweledge of warfare, and experience in all other kynde of businesse. Thus than when it came to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection Cicero was chosen consul with suche sauour and affection of all the people, as fewe of the nobilitie had ben, but neuer no newe gentlemanne before him.

Catiline to reyse warre, and by that token, the same nyght folowinge, euery man shulde go about hys busynesse. These thynges thus ordeyned and done, Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiline saide, one thynge letted hym moche, that Cicero lyued: and that his mynde and wil was, before he tooke his iourneye to the armye, to oppresse hym: for with his wytte and counsell he wolde be a greate lette and hynde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raunce to them. Than C. Cornelius, and L. Vargun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teius, knightes of Rome desyred that they might haue the doinge therof, and promysed that they wolde go ere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye in the mornyng to salute hym, and so for good loue and amitie beinge let in, they wolde sle hym in his bed But the consull, hauynge knowledge of this thynge by Q. Curius, fortified and fenced his house with greate strengthe of men: and kepte his gates shutte agaynste theym that came to slee hym in the morninge. Some write that it was not L. Vargunteyus, but C. Cethe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gus with C. Cornelius, that vndertoke to slee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull. But it appereth in Saluste and Cicero, that they erre in thys, as they do in many other thynges</p>
                     <p>¶Whan the conspiratoures had orneyned, instituted, and prepared those thynges, the consulles myndes was troubled with wante great and greuous thoughts whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the wolde not suffer hym to take rest neyther night nor daye. Fyrst he was verye careful how he myghte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the common weale, whiche was at that tyme a great thing and right diffieile seinge he had to do with a man so valiante, so vehement, so cruel, so wylye and so watchfull aboute myschiefe. Secondly he was care<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful for the treason and snares, that were daylye so dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysed and layde for hym, that it semed they coulde by no meanes be eschewed for the secrete and hid hatreds<note place="margin">Hydde hatered.</note>

are more peryllous, than the manifest and open. For he that is an open ennemye, in takinge good hede may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely be eschewed, but the cloked ennemyes often tymes oppressen before it can be perceyued what it is. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seinge that al the conspiratours desyred much to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stroye the consul, and who they were, was verye harde to knowe, he must nedes mistruste some of his frendes. This also was an other cause whyche much moued the mynde of the righte worthy consull, that he coude with no diligence, with no defence, with noo meanes turne Catilines courage. Wherefore the consul beinge vered and troubled weth these so manie and so great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teis, and that at one selfe tyme determyned to dysclose the matter to the sanete, for so moche as those matters whiche he wolde declare and semed vnto some incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the greate heynousenes of the mischiefe, in the ofte and manye thynges openynge to the Senate, his wordes shulde be the better beleued.</p>

Than M.

<pb n="xxiiij" facs="tcp:2049:28"/>
that if al the conspiratours with Catiline wolde depart<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out of the citie, they might be easely subdued abrode: or if they taryed behynde, without Catiline, they shuld be but weake and feble. For Catiline alone in the city was dredefull. He serched out all thynges, he most diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided all thynges: he knewe howe to preuente, to begyle, to deceyue, to dissemble, to attempte, to sollicye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, to perswade, to mooue, to watche, to laboure, to trouble, for the while, and to wreste and bow hither and thyther.

a pernicious and a naughty cytizen more sharply, than a cruell ennemie.

Than thou Catline, wast that nighte in Leccas house, there thou dydst distribute and diuide the prouinces and shyres of Italye, thou dydst appoynte whither euery man shulde goo: thou chosest out those that thou woldeste leaue at Rome, and those that shoulde go withe the: thou dydste lymitte what partes of the citie shuld be set on fyre: and that thou woldeste than departe out of the citie, Thou saydst, that there was nowe none other let of thy iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neye, but that I lyued.

As longe as thou Catiline dydst lye in awaye for me ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be consull not wyth the publike aide of the citie, but with mine owne pryuate diligence I defended my selfe.

To what intente saidest, that to auoide suspicion thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest dwel wyth M. Lepidus? And when he wold not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue the, thou camste boldlye to me: and desiredst that thou myghteste bee kepte at home in myne house. And whan thou hadst of me also receyued this answere, that I coude in no wyse be in safegard with the in one house together, that am in greate peryll, because wee be bothe within one citye: thou camst to Q.

But howe farre out of pryson and bands shulde he seme to be, the whiche alredy iudgeth hymself worthy to be in warde? Then seynge it is soo Catiline, doutest thou (if thou canste not here remayne in quyete)

Nay, I wyll not referre it to them: for that is contrarye and ageinste my nature: but yet I wyll cause the to vnderstand, what they deme of the. Get the out of the cytie Catiline: deliuer the common weale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare: go into exile, if thou loke to hear this word spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What is the matter Catiline? Why dooeste thou tarye? what, doeste thou not marke the sylence of those? They suffer, they holde theyr peace. Why doeste thou looke for the auctoritie of them, speakynge, whan by keepinge of silence, thou knoweste their wyll and mynde? But if I shulde haue saide as muche to thys noble yonge manne P.

But as touching thee Catiline, whan they be in quiet, they approue, when the suffer, they decerne: whan they holde their peace, they crye aloude.

Oh that the goddes immortall wolde sende thee this mynde.

For thou Catiline arte not the man, whom eyther shame can euer withdrawe from fyl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy liuinge, or feare frome peryll, or reason frome furye &amp; madnes. Wherfore (as I haue oft saide) get the away And if thou wylt cause me (as thou sayest) thyne enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to be hated, get the strayght waye into exile.

At that tyme his wytte beynge kendled with a frowarde spirite, and as it were a viperous serpente, his fierce and cruel mynde, with an inflamed and venomed stomacke, was all to tossed. Thys man that nameth hym selfe the father of the countreye, that is wonte to saye that thys common weale was ornated wyth his noblenesse in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge,

Hee than gnashed his tethe together, and againste you all he was striken prittelye wyth a woodenes, and gan to whet hys anger: the whiche ye maye not thynke woll asswage in tyme to come, by opteyning of the consulshyppe, seeynge that he iudgeth, that not by your fauoures, but for hys moste greatest vertues hee worthely is aduaunced to so hyghe a dignitie. And soo uowe he dothe execute those hys former affections, nowe wyth those craftes he inten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth to trouble the citye: now with suche inuencions he woll reuenge hym selfe, and brynge the nobilitie in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che case, that they shall neuer obiecte agaynste hym hys newe gentlemanshyp. He shall do it moste honorable fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers, he shall do it, onlesse your mooste prudente wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes at lengthe prouide both for the healthe of vs all and for the common weale. For nowe oure citie by thys ryngeleader of myschiefe &amp; artificer of damnable dedes is so be spotted with a vengeable and pestilent blemysh, he so soweth abroade his detestable seede vpon our coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey, that if it once take roote, and grow to any forward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, thys publyke weale shall be cleane extincted, and thys moste floryshyng empire shall be vtterly broughte to naughte. For there is nothynge more perilous vnto cities, than whan the chiefe and principall citizens bee at stryfe amonge them selfe. For Discorde is greatteste fooe to floryshynge common weales. Discorde alone dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parpleth and turneth vp sette downe, thynges stronge and myghtye. Truely discorde hath brought this busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:2049:41"/>
into our citie, it hath cast vs into this calamitie: the whiche if it be not prouided for in tyme, I see that thys mooste floryshing common weale is in greate daunger, I see the weapons in youre handes, the oone of you to withstande the other, this man banyshed, and that man murdred. Wold to god that innocent Catiline mighte be the ende of all tribulacions, like as he is the beginning: there is no peryll that shulde greue me to take in hande for the common weale, I coulde be contente to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, to be banyshed, to suffer death for my countrey. But euerie man is not at all tymes of oone selfe mynd. An other shall be more vnpacient, the which had rather be auenged, then to suffer the iniuries of naughtye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Then the matter muste needes be tryed by cyuile warre, then shall our countrey stande in daunger to bee loste, and wyll shortelye fall into doubtefull chaunces, and sure destruccion of the cytie: than shall he greatelye reioyce and glorye, that he hathe opteined hys purpose: When he shall see this countreye glyster and shyne in bryghte armoure, and this citye set on fyre gyue lyghte: Than shall hee preyse his inuencions and driftes, and extoll his inuincible mynde, and thynke he hathe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlye reuenged hym selfe, and his fore fathers, for the contumelies and rebukes done to hym. For he is wonte sometyme to saye, that he is of the family and kinred of Tullius Hostilius kynge of the Volscians, speciall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to the people of Rome: the whiche thynge is the onelye knowen occasion, why vniuersallre the name of Romaines is hatefull vnto hym, and he shall alway ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>horre this common weale, by whose dominion the house and family of his ancestours is dymmed, and their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piere cleane subdued and ouerthrowen, whiche thynge,
<pb n="xxxvj" facs="tcp:2049:41"/>
howe great cares it carieth into mennes mindes, iudge ye your owne selues. This I may only esteme of Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, that as longe as that enuye of his fore fathers, and those olde enmities of vnpacient mynde, shall turmoile and vexe his braine, he wolle neuer cesse from hys vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and madnes. So greate is his vnmoderate luste and mynd to destroye this empiere. And euen now true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the hole worlde beyng in peace, so many kynges, peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, and straunge nacions subdued, all menne bothe by lande and see obeyinge vnto vs, and nowe that there is no superior enemie of the people of Rome, but doo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our great puisance and noble actes. And therfore he hath no hope to bringe this empiere to destruccion by outward hostilitie. All thinges are in sure quiete vnder vs, all men wyllinglye obey vnto vs. But for as muche as he greatly desireth to reuenge hym selfe and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours, and that his harde and cruell mynde wyll ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cesse from that opinion, he flyeth to those perturbaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, with the which priuate enmities fyrst with me, last<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly he intendeth to greue the hole common weale. And so first he accuseth Catline his ennemie, and manye other felowes with hym in his conspiracie, that they intend to inuade the common weale, ouer runne theyr countreye, deface the citie, to burne houses, temples, aultares, to rauyshe virgins, to murther and slee the auncient men, the peple, and the nobles, ne neuer stinte frome wrathe, ne spare the sworde, vntyll they haue vtterlye destroyed this moste beautifull cytie, the soueraine princesse ouer all the world. But I swere by the immortall goddes, I wot not to what ende this vayne estimacion of men wol come, that any mortall man shoulde beleue, that there were any so vtterlie an hopelost, or so ignorante of rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son,
<pb facs="tcp:2049:42"/>
that dothe not pereriue a certayne zeale and tender loue towarde his cuntreye planted in hym, the whyche alwaye throughe a certayne secrete and vehemente po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of nature, is powred in to mennes breastes. Than what Romaine mynde wolde desire to brynge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale to so great calamitie? For what moste cruell ennemye of the Romaines, yea the verye Capitayne of Carthage Anniball, coulde inuente and imagine great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the lyke hurtes to vs? Wolde I inuade the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, whiche haue for the common weale enterpri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed and susteyned so excedynge great perilles? Shuld I be so bolde, to deface the Senate and citie, whiche haue adorned my lynage with so many most large benefites? Shulde I burne the temples of Rome, the which shew forthe so manye grauen images and tables of mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestoures? Shuld I murder the noble men of bloud or Senatoures, that am nowe in honoure and dignitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them? Shuld I wearyng the honorable robe de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>file the citie with other mischeuous dedes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which with all diligence haue withstand, that other shoulde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file it? What hope? what mynde? what occasion shoulde driue me to do suche a deede? Shoulde the luste and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of dominion and rule, whereof a lytle whyle ere Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero reasoned? haue I not quietely opteyned the dignite aboue all? haue not I as good hoope lefte me to excuse other dignities, as it is lawful for any mortal man to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire? for I am both of the bloud of noble Senatours, and haue opteined the dignitie of a Senatour, and here after, I may be consul or dictatour. The whiche digni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties are suche and so greate, that not onlye in this moste noble citie, but also they far excel the empiers and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities of all people, of all nacions, that are in all the
<pb n="xxxvij" facs="tcp:2049:42"/>
worlde. What nedeth it then to seke that thinge in harde warre, whiche willingelye in peace is prepared for me? But peraduenture as Cicero sayde, enuie styrred me, great dette, pouertie, immoderate boldenesse to beare a rule. But this shuld be estemed of a man that is wylful rashe, and brainesicke, or of any other, the which in hope to wynne and gette goodes, maye vnwyselye make soo great a sedicion amonge the people of Rome: and not of a man of the noblest bloud borne, and in a citie aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge in welthe. For shuld he that is honestly furnished with riches, doubte that he shulde at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to let passe other thinges, thou Cicero, arte an example vnto me, whyche in a maner the other daye entredst into this citye, bare &amp; nedy of al thynges, after thou gottest thee once in office, thou gatheredst sodeinly together so great a heap of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that all the townes belonginge to Rome as it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med were scasely sufficient for thy factoures. Wherfore thou doste but folyshely, to laye couetousenes, pouertie, and greate det vnto my charge. All whiche thynges I coulde by a more sure maye appease, then to disturbe the common weale, to take the vncerteine for certeyne, for a lytle commoditie to enterprise exceadynge greate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryls. Neither I (as touchinge suche thynges as I am accused of) wolde for any priuate debate haue goone in hande with so horrible a dede. There is no man in thys common weale, that I reken to be myne ennemie, onlye Cicero is agreued with me, because I coulde not cloke
<pb facs="tcp:2049:43"/>
his vices, whyche he dyd secretlye: whose folyshe and trifling toyes if I sholde haue exchewed and put from me, I had many wayes to reuenge my selfe, wythoute publike peryll. Nor I neded no refuge to the hurt of the common weale, seynge there was neither drede nor ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy to withstande or let me, for if he were rydde oute of this lyfe, there shulde remaine no man that wold not onely reuenge hym, but also mourne at his funerall. But god forbydde, that I shulde dishoneste my selfe for hys fole hardynes. For it is no laude for noble men to be reuenged on abiecte persons, yet perchance if I wold haue desired it, it shuld not be imputed worthy citizens, but that I (if I had gone about it at that tyme) myghte haue had muche more oportunitie, than he shulde haue had. Surely if I fortified myne house wyth strength of men of armes, broughte in my companions, and made good watche, for I wyll not deny any of these thynges, I did it most prudent fathers not to do any man wrong but to resyste the violence of the consull. I dradde hys wytte, I knowe his eloquence, I was not ignoraunt of his malice, I vnderstode he had instructed this conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. And so I was in feare, lefte that by his eloquence ye shulde sodeinly disdaine me in your mindes, and that ye (the daungers once declared) cleane ageinste my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, wolde greuouselye punyshe me. For if I had bene once deliuered in to his handes, in vaine afterwarde shoulde I haue founde place for my defence. And so I haue with greate laboure prolonged my lyfe vnto this daie. And in all this great trouble, by meanes of thy per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swasion, I haue scaselye escaped, that I was not of all men condemned as gyltie. But nowe Cicero, when thou hadst lesse nede, otherwise tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hopedst, I am come
<pb n="xxxviij" facs="tcp:2049:43"/>
into the Senate: and as muche as seemed to me suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I haue opened a fewe of thy leaste fautes: the why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by that tyme they be knowen, thou woldeste rather they shulde be forgotten, then that so great crimes shuld come to lyghte and be knowen. I was nothing afraied of thy mischeuous dedes, nor thine oracion at that time, nor thy mocions coniected willingly againste me, made me not afraied. For what feare in so great assemblye of Senatours, in so greate a companye of noble cityzens, could trouble any innocent mynd? Therfore I haue the daye, whiche I most speciallye desired, whiche assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou dydst least loke for. I haue a Senate which can vnderstand myne innocencie, before whom thy damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offences shall be opened. I haue therfore with good peryll prouided against my peryls, if at any tyme wyth strength of men of armes I defended thy fury, if at any season without drede I stode styffe in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, while by all meanes thou dydst perswade me to flee, I contrarie wyse mynded to tarye. But o good lorde wher be wee? Who seeth not a mighty false accusacion? what other thing dyd all thy oracion meane, but that I shuld flee? But if (as thou saieste) all my deedes be well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, if mine imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be more clerer then the lyght: why doest thou nowe perswade me to flee? Here I am, hauinge no power or defence of myne owne aboute me. The Senate is presente, whyche wyll prohibite and let the from harme, Shewe forth these mischeuous dedes: open plainely the sedicion, do punyshemente. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semeth the not to be mercifull in so great perils. Delay, and to be without helpe, maye be hurtful: If thou haue the principall of the conspiracie, if the capitaine of the ennimies be in thy handes, why doest thou tarye? Why
<pb facs="tcp:2049:44"/>
doste thou couet to caste hym oute? For it is more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that the armie wante a capitaine: for so they shall be the more slacke to make warre. But I see (as it is wonte to chance) in the myddes of euyls, thou for feare of punyshement, beginnest to waxe colde, for thou seeste the myschaunce that thou preparest either for me, or for the common weale, shall lyghte vppon thy selfe. Thys thynge nowe to thy greate daunger is farre otherwyse handled than thou thoughtest. Doubtest not nowe, that I woll obiecte againste the thy goodes? Dyddest thou thynke, that I wolde come into the Senate? Therefore when I came, thou forthwith were sore afraied. Thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thou nowe to make me afraied wyth thy threatnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? Knoweste thou not howe free, and howe bolde the stomake of an innocente is? Wylte thou Cicero that I flee? Surelye I wyll not flee, but abyde and ouercome thy proude bragges? I muste nedes reproue thy mische<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous deedes and inuencions. Let thy witnesses come in to this place, of whom thou saiest thou hast so great plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, that nothynge of my deedes can be couered or hydde from thee. Whom bringest thou forth? Q. Curius? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man of a good opinion, and of an honest lyfe: or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che one as hath nobly with his leud and naughty dedes dishonested this order, and therefore was abiected. Or wylte thou brynge forth Fuluia his mate in bodely lust, whiche was neuer priuye to no murder, nor is not the nurce chylde of aduoutrye and fornicacion, nor of none other vnlaufull copulacion: or elles she hathe so lyued, that as an example of abhominable vice, she her selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone canne excell all the craftes and deceites of hoores. These are the moste noble men, that suspect the trouble and vnquietnes of the citie, and that are broughte in as

witnesses ageinste me. But I swere by the goddes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, that nowe thou Cicero, doest shewe by thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that thou doest very shamefullye abuse thy farye? For if thy mynde was to ryd me oute of the waye, thou shuldest not haue sought witnesse of them that are open conspiratoures. Thou oughtest to haue chosen theym, whose lyfe is more vnknowen, and their robberies a lytle more secrete. Many menne for that money, wolde more profitably haue plyed to thyne ambicion. For no good citizen ought to be a frayed of their yll and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wordes. They maye easely be reproued, seyng that their fortune, theire fidelitie and deedes are sufficiente, whiche if they wolde fauoure me, I wolde rather they shulde be myne iniurious aduersaries, lest their familia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie shulde bringe my lyfe lykewise in a contempt. And so nowe moste honorable fathers, al the dedes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacions of the consull I haue opened plainelye vnto you: nowe also mine innocency maye appeare vnto you. Ye see what thinge caused that he wolde destroye Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and disturbe the common weale. He is styrred and striueth with me for priuate enmities. For castinge in the tethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his newe gentlemanshyp, hee hateth all the nobilitie after the maner of his fore fathers. For he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth this countrey, and therefore he goeth aboute to make sedicion, to sowe discorde, his vnpaciente stomake wyll neuer be in quiete, till he brynge vs to destruccion. Fyrste he accuseth me, beyng borne of the noble bloude of Rome, and a Senatour, to be a murderer: where as the noble actes and dedes, hygh dominions, offices and dygnities, and greate and large benefites doone to thys common weale by myne auncestours, do mooste hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably glyster and shyne.

me, the whiche in this mooste plentifull citie coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee an hynderaunce to theym that are in lowe and meane offices. He obiecteth enmities againste me, the whiche seme vnto me, not to be sufficient, to disturbe the common weale. Ye see what witnesses he bringeth forth the whiche are suche, that they exceede the wittes of all mischeuous caytiues. Whyche attemptates, after hee sawe came not to passe, as he hoped they wold, nor hath no greate truste in the senate, he is forthwith ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen with feare. He commaundeth me to flee, whan if I had ben fautie, to reuenge soo heynous an offence, the greatest punyshemente that is, coulde not be sufficiente. Than if you most honorable fathers see myne innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, if ye perceiue his fierce cruell mynde, if ye ponder the peryls of the common weale, than at the laste looke vp, take pitie, and saue from ruine the empire of Rome. Ye haue euen amonge you a slipper serpente, ye haue in this order included, the calamlitie of the common weale whiche is ryghte watchefull, to brynge to confusion the peple of Rome. You haue aduanced hym to most hyghe honour. Beware, leste at length that parte of pestilence, by to muche libertie, infecte all the bodye, and as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious disease growe vp amonge you. Go to quickelie, auoyde this stinkynge pompe of vengeaunce and mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, depose this man frome his consulshyp, leste that his foule shamefull dedes defyle this moste hyghe and honorable dignitie: caste him out of this common weale leste that here after he shulde be seene within the walles of this our moste noble citie, by hym broughte to greate ruyne and decaye.

                     <p>BVT when it was surelye knowen at Rome, that Catiline was admitted capitayne ouer the armye, and intended to make warre vpon his countrey, there was an acte of parliament made, in the whiche Catiline and Manlius were iudged to be vtter enemies to the common welthe. And to all other there was a daye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted (sauynge to those that were alredy condemned) that it shuld be lawful for them to departe from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my vnpunyshed. And if any man after that tyme shulde go vnto Catiline, the senate to take hym as a traytoure againste the common weale, and agaynste all mennes safegarde and profite. The senate also decreed, that the consuls shulde muster, and that C. Antonius with suche ayde as he myght gather, shulde pursue Catiline bothe by lande and sea, and Cicero to defende the citye frome al deceites and mischaunces. Neuerthelesse the mindes of desperate persons were nothynge refrained by these sharpe decrees. For there was none out of soo greate a company of conspiratours that departed from Catiline excepte it were eyther to spye, or to doo some myschiefe: but contrary wyse there were many that drewe to hym,
<pb facs="tcp:2049:49"/>
bothe out of the countrey, and out of the citye. But of all those that drewe to hym, he refused bonde seruantes, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an innumerable multitude fled to hym, he estemed it a thinge vnsemely, that runnagates shulde haue to do in citizens matters: and thynkinge this also, whiche in dede shoulde haue come to passe, (if his companions at Rome had performed their enterprise) that huge routes of snaphances and hope lostes, from all partes of Italy wolde resorte to hym. For not onlye they that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate in the conspiracye, coueted that Catiline shulde victoriousely ouercome, but also whosoeuer were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indetted, who soo euer had solde awaye their landes, who so euer were in tyme paste condemned or atteinted: Many also by troublynge of the common weale, looked to be aduaunced to honours and moost hyghe ronmes, many desired warre by reason that of such ruffeling and dissencions, they opteyned power. Farthermore in a greate city are alwayes many naughty yll doers, hope lostes, malaperte, troublous, sedicious and nedye fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which with a becke are redy to disturbe the quiet and rest of a citie. But most specially the delycate youth, and lytle bearded yonge men, or Catilines flocke wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beardes, whiche smellynge all of muske, their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res featelye comed, wearinge veyles and not gownes, allowed Catilines counsayles. And of these, manye got them to catilines armye. And of that number was one Fuluius, the sonne of Aulus a Snatour, the whyche if he coulde haue exchewed Catilines company and amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he had nothyng gone oute of kynde from his forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He was excellently lerned in greke and latine: he had a ioly quicke wytte, he was a goodly yonge manne and a towarde. But he with Catilines company and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
<pb n="xliiij" facs="tcp:2049:49"/>
made vnlyke to hym selfe, in a folyshe brayde, fled vnto Catilines campe: Whom his harde father retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge hym backe againe frome hys iourney, whanne he hadde with spytefull rebukes rated, hee afterwarde commaunded hym to be slayne. Also there was an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that P. Clodius, the sonne of Appius, departed out of the citie, to thentente to go to Catiline. After that chaunging his purpose, he returned to the citie, and so Cicero obiecteth againste hym in manye places, that he was companion of the conspiracie, the whiche cryme although it were<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obiected of an enemye, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue it to be true, for the lyfe and maners of Clodius ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proue that he boldely enterprised all thinges. Also there were some that saide that C. Antonius the consull was one that conspired with Catiline, whoose opinion was approued by this one argumente, that Antonius neuer endeuoured hym selfe to auoide that suspicion of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie wyth Catiline, which men than had of hym, ney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther by denyinge, nor yet by dissimulacion.

Notwithstanding ther is a certeine author that saith that they had chosen oute an hundred men, which shulde set fire on an hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of the citie: and certeine were appointed to defende and stoppe the wayes to the cundites, and to sley al such as endeuored them selues to quenche the fire.

Pompeius, which at that season ledde a myghty great hoste in Asia: and it was nowe reported for a surety, that he had accomplyshed many very great warres, and wold shortly returne into Italie.

The other citizens shulde be numbred by the bande of yongemen, led by Gabinius. And amonge theym also was lymitted who shuld take and defende the Capitoll, who the market place, who the portes, and who the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the citie. Moreouer they ordeyned (it that is wont to chaunce in the conqueste of the citye of ennemies) to spoyle the citye, to burne the temples, to rauyshe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste wyues, noble mens children, virgins, and nunnes, and fyll all places with lamentacion, deade bodies, and bloude. And whan the citye were all set on fyre, robrie, and slaughter, Catiline shuld be redy with his armye to take suche as wolde fle, and ioyne hym selfe wyth these capitaines that were in the citye. Here I marueyle, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge Cicero saieth these thynges were thus appointed, wherfore Salust shuld declare them to be other wise de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uised amonge the conspiratours.

This suspition honorable fathers, taketh no holde on this pure honest mynde, on this lyfe, on this man. They were sauage beastes, wylde and cruell, in the shape of men, that went aboute to destroye those thynges. And what ment it? whan Traquinius named Antronius, Vargunteius,

Lecca, Seruius, Sylla, Cornelius, and manye other, that ye all attentiuely gaue eare? For those, if no manne wolde accuse them, yet their condicions and lyfe woulde conuince theym.

This thing also, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable fathers shuld of you be foresene, leste the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable deede of P Lentulus, and the other conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, shuld more inforce you to reueng, than besemeth your dygnyty, or rather incline to your wrathe, than to your honorable fame.

But some thinge honorable fathers may better be suffered in some men than in other some. If the priuate persons, that lyue obscurely vnknowen, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit through anger any dishoneste dede: Fewe knowe it. Their fame &amp; fortune are egal. The greate rulars and hygh gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, all men knowe their actes. So in hyghest fely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, is least libertye to do a mysse. It besemeth suche menne not to be spitefull, not to beare hatred, but in no wyse to be angry. The affection which in other is called anger in the hygh rulars is named Pride and crueltie. Surely, honorable fathers, I deme all turmentes lasse than their detestable dedes. But many men reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring the last punishementes, and forgettinge the mischeuous dede of the transgressours, they reason of the peyne, whether it be more cruell than it shulde be. I surely knowe, that what so euer the honorable and moste va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man. D. Syllanus hathe sayde, he spake it for the great affection that he beareth to the common weale. Neyther hath he in so weyghty a cause, said any thynge for fauour, nor yet for hatred, I know his maners and sobrenes to be suche. Truly his sentence to me semeth not cruel (for what cruelty can be done to suche menne, but yet not all thynge agreable to the common weale. For certeynely either dreade or iniury hath constreyned you Syllanus, chosen consull for the yere to come, to adiudge the conspiratours to suffer a new kynde of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement. As touchyng feare, to reason therof it were but in vayne, namely sith the great dyligence of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consul hathe soo strongly warded and defended the cyty with men of armes. As concernynge their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I may speke as the truthe is, that death to those that be in heuynes and misery is not a tourmente, but
<pb facs="tcp:2049:63"/>
rather a quyet and rest from all wofull wretchednes. For death fynishethe all griefes and euyls that mortall creatures endure. But I pray you Syllane, why dyd you not adde, that they shulde be fyrst beaten? was it bycause the lawe Portia, or some other lawes do prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it? Lykewyse the lawes forbyd that citezins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned shulde be put to death, but they commaunde to banishe them. Left ye that vnspoken, bycause it is more greuous to be beaten, than to be put to deathe? And yet what punyshemente is to cruell or greuous to men conuicte of soo greate and detestable a deede? But if you spake not of beatynge, bycause it is easier? howe inconuenient is it to feare the lawe in the lesse busines, and to neglecte it in the greater? For who shall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that that is decreed ageynst traitours to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale? Tyme, day, fortune, after whose luste na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ruled. To them what soo euer euyll hapneth, chanceth accordyng to their deseruinges. But consider honorable fathers, what lawes ye ordeyne for other. All euyl examples take their beginning of good thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges for after imperial gouernaunce instituted by good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handling of those that were euyl: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was transferred from the worthy and mete, to the vnworthy &amp; vnmet persones.

But after, this licence increasinge by littell and littel, they slewe for their pleasure as well good men as bad, and put the other in feare, and so the citie beynge oppressed with bondage and thraldome,
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:2049:63"/>

                     <p>¶We remembre, Sylla hauynge the vpper hande, commaunded Dasippus and suche other hope lostes, that were growen riche, to the great hurte of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weeale, to be put to dethe.

So that they, whiche reioysed at the death of Damasippus, were sone after brought to the same end. Neyther was there any ende of slaughter vntyll that Sylla had aboundantly satisfied hys souldiors wyth ryches. But I neither feare this thing in M. Tullius, nor at this tyme, but in a greate cytie, many and diuerse are the wittes. An other tyme, an other beynge consul, and hauinge an army at his commaundemente, some thynge false may be beleued to be trewe: whan suche a consull after this example, by decree of the senate, shall drawe out his sworde, who shall make hym put it vp? or who shall moderate hym? Our auncestours, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fathers, wanted at any tyme neyther councell, nor boldnes, neyther pryde letted theym to folowe the lawes and maners of other nacions, yf they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable. Armur and weapons of warre, they toke of the Sainnites, many ornamentes belongynge to the great offycers and rulars, they receyued of the Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayns.

thyng amonge their frendes or foes, the same with great dilygence they vsed at home. They wolde rather folow, than enuy those that were good. But oure auncestours folowyng the maners of the Greekes, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their citizins with beatynges, and put to deathe suche as were condemned. After the publike weale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and that partakenge amonge the people began to grow, by reason of the multitude: the innocentes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be circumuented, and other such lyke mischifes to be practised, than the lawe Portia and other lawes were ordeined, by the which exyle was granted to them that were condemned. Therfore I thynke this cause, mooste honorable fathers, to be very great, wherby we shall not nede to take any new councell. Verily, there was more vertu and wysedome in them that of so small ryches brought this impire to soo greate welth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume, than in vs, whiche can scasely maynteyne and kepe thinges well wonne.

But the frendes and kinsefolke of the consul were most specially moued wyth thys oracion. They consideringe what greate enuye and hatered of the commune people myght here after aryse against Cicero, if the senat brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge the lawe Portia, shulde without the consente of the people, put noble citezins to deathe, they all agreed to the sentence of Caesar, and prayed the consul that he wolde loke to his owne saluegard and profit, neyther colde they in the meane whyle absteyne from teares. Caesar, by his oration drawynge soo many to hym, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom was also Qu. Cicero, had obteyned his purpose, if the oration of the most prudent consul, and Cato, had not encouraged the senatours myndes, that began to quayle. The consul was of nature mylde and mercifull, but except he shuld than haue shewed sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he sawe the weale publyke lyke to be brought in to greate daunger. For if they shewed them selfe more softe and gentle, they deemed that the conspiratours shoulde be the bolder and more encouraged, and in the meane tyme, some commocion myght ryse in the citye. But if they shewed them selues very vehemente againste those that were taken, he foresawe that all the puissaunce, all the hoope, all the ryches of the conspiratours, these pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rylles
<pb facs="tcp:2049:65"/>
of the citye beinge put awaye, shulde sodeinelye quaile. And thoughe he vnderstode, that thys thynge could not be brought to passe wythoute great daungeir of his owne lyfe, yet so derely loued he the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale that he more estemed the welth publyke, than his owne lyfe. Than whan he sawe the senate inclinynge to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars sentence, coueting to slaye them beginnynge to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, rose vp and sayd as hereafter foloweth.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>SE, honorable fathers, all youre vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages and eyes tourned towarde mee, I see you not onelye for youre owne peryl, and for the publyke weale, but also (if that weere put awaye) verye heauye and thoughteful for the daungeire that I am in. Your good wyll towarde me, is to me in aduersitie ioyful, and in sorowe acceptable: But I beseche you for the goddes sakes immortall, set asyde that good wyll, and forgettynge my sauegarde, thinke vpon your selfe, and your chyldren. If this condicion of consulshyppe be geuen me, that I shulde suffer all bytter aduersities, all sorowes and tormentes, I wyll beare them not onelye stoutely, but also wyllynglie: so that by my trauailes to you and the people of Rome, honorable fathers, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and prosperitie maye be procured. I am that consul honorable senatoures, for whose sake neyther the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of iudgement, wherin al equity is conteined: nor the fielde, consecrate for chosynge of highe officers: nor this courte of senatours, the speciall ayde of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions: nor my house, the common refuge of all men: nor
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:2049:65"/>
my bedde ordeined for reste, nor finallye this honorable place, this seate appointed for the mooste hyghe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, was neuer voyde from peryll of deathe, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytes. Many thinges haue I kepte secrete, many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue I endured, many thynges haue I graunted, many thynges to my greate sorowe, beinge in dreede for you, haue I holpe. Nowe if the goddes immortall wyll this to be the ende of my consulshyppe, that I shulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer you honorable fathers, and the citizens of Rome frome miserable slaughter, your wyues and chyldrene and the vyrginnes Vestalles, from vtter vexacion, the temples and holy places, this our moste goodlye coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from moste cruell bournynge, al Italy from warre and destruccion, what soo euer fortune is appointed to me onely, I wyll aduenture it. For if P. Lentulus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the southesayers, thoughte that hys name was predestinate to destroie the publyke weale, why shoulde not I reioyse that my consulshyppe is ordeyned for the conseruacion of the same common weale? Wherefore honorable fathers, prouide for your selues, see too the sauegarde of youre countrey, saue your selues, your wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, youre children, and youre goodes, and defende the name and wealthe of the people of Roome: take ye noo care nor thought for me. For firste my speciall truste is, that all the goddes whiche preserue this citye, wyll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde me, accordinge to my deseruinges. Secondelye if any thynge chaunce, I wyll with an vpryghte mynde and a good courage, dye. For vnto a valiaunte manne deathe is not shamefull, nor vnto a Consull, it commeth not to sone, ne vnto a wyse man it is not wretched. And yet haue I not so yron a stomacke, but that I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wyth the sorow of my most dere and louing brother
<pb facs="tcp:2049:66"/>
here present, and with the teares of all those, whiche ye se inuiron me about: also my wyfe that is halfe deade, oftentimes reuoketh my minde homewardes, and my doughter well nere deade for feare, and my litell sonne, the whiche seemeth to me, dothe imbrace the common weale, as a pledge of my consulshyppe, nor my sonne in lawe, that standeth here awaytinge the ende of this day all these thynges doo moue me, but yet in suchewyse, that all shuld be in sauetie with vs, yea rather I wold some vyolence shoulde oppresse me, than they, and we with the common weale shoulde perysshe togyther. Wherfore honourable fathers, stycke to the sauegarde of the common weale, prouyde surelye for all stormes that maye falle. Withoute ye take good hede, not T. Gracchus, whiche wolde ones agayne be made prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the comminaltie, nor C. Gracchus, that went about to reuyue the lawes Agrarie, nor L. Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, which slew C. Memmius, is brought to any ieo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pardy, or to your sharpe iudgemente: but they are in holde, that taryed styll in Rome, to bourne the citie, to mourder you al, and so to receyue in Catilin. We haue theyr letters, theyr seales, theyr owne hand writynges and fynally eche of theyr own confessions. The frenche ambassatours are sollicited, the slaues and seruauntes are styrred vp, Catilyne is sent for. This councel haue they taken, that all beyng slayne, no man shuld be left, to bewayle the name of the common weale, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the calamitie of so great an empire. All these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the detectours haue declared, the accused haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. You haue iudged it by manye tokens soo to bee: Fyrst in that ye haue geuen me hygh thankes in special wordes, and haue affirmed, that by mine industrie and
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:2049:66"/>
diligence, the conspiracy of these hope lostes, is openly knowen: further in that ye haue compellyd Lentulus to yelde vp his office of Pretorshyp. And in that ye haue gyuen sentence, that he and the other shoulde be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted to ward, and specially that ye haue decreed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to be made in my name, whiche honour was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer done to any man in tyme of peace before me. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that ye rewarded yesterday so magnyficently the frenche ambassatours and T. Vulturtius. All whiche thynges are of suche forte, that they whiche by name ar put in holde, wythout doubt seme of you to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But I determyned to referre holly vnto you hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fathers, bothe what you wyll iudge of the dede, &amp; what you wyll determyne touchynge the punyshment. I wyll shewe you before, what pertayneth to the consul.</p>
                     <p>¶ I behelde not longe sence, great furye waltrynge in the weale publyke, and some new myschefes a brewing. But I neuer thought this so great and so mortall a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy to be enterprised of the citesens. Now, what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, whither soo euer youre myndes and sentences inclyne, it muste be determyned er nyght. You see vnto howe greate a daunger we be brought, wherunto yf ye thynke, a fewe are confederate, you are farre wyde. This myschiefe is sprawled abrode further than you thynke: For it hath not onely ouerflowen Italy, but is also runne ouer the mountayns Alpes, preuily crepyng forth, hath now inuaded many prouinces. This thynge in no wyse can be oppressed by sustaynyng and prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng therof. What so euer way it pleaseth you to take, you must spedily determyne ther vppon. I se there are two sundrye sentences, one of Syllanus, whose iuge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment was, that they, whiche were bent on this greate
<pb facs="tcp:2049:67"/>
mischiefe shulde be put to deth. The other of C. Cesar the whiche dysalowyng the punyshment of deth, wolde they shuld suffer all greuous peyne, and tourmente. Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, accordyng to his dignitie, and weyght of the cause, with greate grauitie handlyd the matter. The one thought, that they whiche indeuoured theym selfe, to slee vs all, and the people of Rome, whiche wolde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye the empyre, that wolde extincte the name of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, were not worthye to lyue the mynute of an howre. And that kynd of punyshmente oftentymes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vppon suche naughtie citesens in this common weale, remaneth or recorde. The other vnderstandethe that dethe is not ordeyned of the goddis immortall, as a punishmente, but as necessitie of nature, or els a reste from trauayle and myseries. Therfore wise men neuer grutched agaynst it, yea oftentymes they wyth a hardy courage, and wyllyngly desyred death. And to lye in y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons perpetually in pryson, is a syngular punyshmente inuented for heynous offences. He wyllethe, that they shulde be seuered into sundry townes, whiche thinge if he wolde haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, standeth but lytel with equi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, if he wolde desyre it, it semeth a harde thynge to be done: yet if it please you, let it be so decreed. For I wyll take it vpon me, and I trust to fynde theym, that wyll not thynke it to be agaynst theyr dignitie and honoure, to do that ye shall ordeyne for the wealthe of vs all. He chargeth the townsmen with a greate penaltie, if any of them breake prison, and wold they shuld be surely kepte and hath appoynted peynes mete for suche greuous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and that there shall no man labour, neyther by the senate, nor by the people, to mitigate the punysshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that they are condempned to suffre. Also he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="lxiij" facs="tcp:2049:67"/>
away the hope, whiche only is wonte to be a mans comfort in misery: and moreouer he wylleth theyr goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to be confiscate. The lyfe onely he leaueth to those wycked offendours, whiche if he wolde haue taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: with one griefe he shulde haue dispatched theym of many tribulations of mynde and bodye, and of all peynes of transgressions. And bycause the yl doers in theyr lyfe shulde stande in some dreede, our forefathers sayd, that suche peynes as be in hell were ordeyned for wycked lyuers, meanynge therby, that yf the feare of suche infernall peynes were taken away, men wolde no whyt be arfayde of deathe.</p>
                     <p>¶Nowe honorable fathers, I see howe thys thynge toucheth me, yf you shulde folowe Ceasars mynde, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he leaueth to the way of the common weale, that is acceptable to the people, peraduenture I shall not nede greatly to feare the furius rage of the people, he being the author of this sentence, but if you will folowe the other sentence, I doubte whether it shall turne me to more busines yea or nay. But yet the profyte of the common weale wayeth more with me, than all myne owne perylles. We haue also Ceasars mynde and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence (accordyng to his honourable estate, and as it be semeth a man desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of so noble a linage) as a pledge of his contynuall good wyll to the common weale. And we vnderstande, what dyfference is betwene the myld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of oratours, and hym that truly loueth the people, and tendreth theyr welth. I se that some of them, which wolde be sene to fauor the people, be absente, bycause they wyll not gyue sentence of deathe agaynste the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Rome. This man not thre dayes past, commyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towarde Cethegus, and P. Lentulus citesens of
<pb facs="tcp:2049:68"/>
Rome, and decreed vnto me porcession, and yesterday he gaue great rewardes to the detectours of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy. Nowe there is noo manne that doubteth, what his mynde and iudgemente is concerninge all this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synes, whiche committed the offendours to warde, that so greatly thanked the Questor, and decreed the detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to be so highly rewarded. But C. Cesar vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the lawe Sempronia to be constituted and made for the citesens of Rome: but he that is an enemye to the common welthe, can in noo wyse be a citisyn, and farther the selfe maker of the lawe Sempronie, was by commaundement of the people greuously punyshed. He also demeth Lentulus to be lyberall and not prody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall: and that he, that so sharply, so cruelly imagened, by that meanes he myght destroye his common weale, and confounde this citie, maye be called a fouourer of the people. And so this moste mylde and courteys man doubteth not to commande, that Lentulus shulde lyue perpetually fettred in darke prison. Also he hathe esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyshed, that no man hereafter booste hym selfe, that he mytigated his peyne, &amp; that no man, offending ageinste the comon weale, be rekned a fauourer of the people. He wylleth furthermore, theyr goodes shulde be confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that beside all theyr tormentes of mynde and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they woulde be oppressed wyth nede and pouertye. Wherfore whether ye wyll determin this, ye must cause the people to here me with loue and fauoure: Or if ye wyll rather folowe the sentence of Sillanus, ye shall easylie defende bothe you and me from blame of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And yet honorable fathers, what crueltie can there be, in punyshyng so greate and so cruell a dede? Truely I speake according to my mynde: for so mote I wyth
<pb n="lxiiij" facs="tcp:2049:68"/>
you enioye the common weale, as I, that in this cause am ryght vehemente, am not moued with anye crueltye of minde. For who is more milder than I? but yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certayne singuler humanitie and mercie. For why me thinketh that I see this citie, the lanterne of the hole worlde, and the fortres of defence for all nacions, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinely burninge fall in desolacion. I see in my minde oure countreye cleane destroied, and the miserable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of cityzens lye vnburied. The furious loke of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegus frantike madde in the slaughter of you, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer oute of my syghte. Whan I call to remembraunce Lentulus, reigninge lyke a kynge, lyke as he confessed to haue seene him selfe by predestinacion: Gabinius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in a purple weede: and Catiline come with his armie: O howe I than abhorre to see the lamentacion of the honeste wiues, the flyghte of yonge maides and childrene, and the trouble of the virginnes Vestalles. And because these thinges seme to me vehementely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and to be pitied: therfore I shew my selfe sharp and vehemente againste those, that wolde haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them. I aske you, whether that householder which dothe moste sharpely and greuouselye punishe his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte that sleyeth his childrene, kylleth his wife, and burneth his house, is to bee counted milde and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or els fierce and cruell? I iudge him importunate and of an yron courage, that wolde not asswage his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe with the turmenting of suche a seruaunt: In like maner we shall be rekened mercifull, if wee shewe oure selues moste sharpe and vehemente againste those that wolde murder vs, oure wiues, our children, that with all their indeuour go aboute to destroye euerie mannes house, and this vniuersall common weale, whyche haue
<pb facs="tcp:2049:69"/>
doone their beste to haue stablyshed the nacion of Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinois in the steppes of thys citye, and in the asshes of thys empiere, distroied wyth fire: but if wee wyll be seene to be remisse and negligente, we shal be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed of crueltie, for sufferynge our countrey and cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens to be distroyed. Excepte any man wyll thynke L? Caesar that noble and valyant man, and that mooste derely loueth this common weale, was the other day very cruel, what he sayd, that his sisters husband, that most honorable lady, beinge present, and heryng hym, was worthy to dye. Whan he sayd, Flaccus was slayn by the consuls co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: and his sonne, not .xiiii. yere of age, bounde and cast into pryson to be slayne Was any of theyr dedes lyke this? What counsayle toke they to destroy the common weale? Largesse was than vsed in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, to come to honour, and some contencion and part takynge. And euen at that tyme this Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tulus grandfather, that most noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing armed, pursued Gracchꝰ, &amp; was tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, to the ende the hygh dignitie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale shulde nothyng be blemyshed. This Lentulus hath styrred vp the Frenchemen to tourne vpset downe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale: he hath reysed slaues and bondemen, he hath callyd forthe Catiline, he hath allotted vs to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegus, the other cityzens to bee slayne by Gabinius, the citye to be burned by Cassius, all Italy to be wasted and spoyled by Catilyne. I deeme, you dreede leste that in this so cruell and cursed a deede, ye shulde be seene to determine any thinge ouer sharpe and rigorous: Whan it is muche more to be feared, leste by negligence of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshement, we shall seme rather cruell to our countrey, than by sharpenes of punyshemente ouer vehemente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:2049:69"/>
our moste cruell ennemies.</p>
                     <p>¶ But honorable fathers, I can nat dissemble, that I haue herd spoken. For wordes ar blowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abrode, whiche are come to my hearyng, of them, that seme to feare, leste I shal not be stronge inough to execute those thinges, that ye shall this day determyne to be done. All thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges prudent fathers, ar foresene, prepared, and in a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynesse by my no lyttell care and dilygence, but moche more by the good courage that the commynaltie hathe to maynteyne and defende this most highe empire, and theyr owne goodes. They be all, of euery state and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and of euery age, bent here vppon. The market place is full, soo be all the wayes and passages to this place and temple. This cause, sith the buyldinge of the citie, is founde to be alone, in the whiche al agree on one selfe thinge: excepte those whiche, seynge they muste nedes ende theyr wretched life, they had rather dy with all other, than peryshe alone. Those men I except, and gladly seuer them from vs. Nor I accompt not theym amonge the numbre of honest citesins, but from hense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to be taken for our mooste cruell ennemies. But good lorde, with howe greate multitude, with what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and affection, with what wood harte and courage do all other consent and agree to the dignite and welthe of vs all? Wherto shoulde I here reherse the gentyll men of Rome, whiche so gyueth place to you in degree and consultation, that they wylle contende wyth vs in loue of the common weale? the whiche this daye and this cause hathe retired from longe dissentyon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, had with this order, and knytte you faste frendes togyther: whiche knote of frendshype confyrmed in my consuls shyppe, if we contynually kepe in the common
<pb facs="tcp:2049:70"/>
weale, I assure you after this no ciuile harme amonge our selfe, shall endomage the common weale on noo syde. Wyth lyke fauour to defende the common weale, I see the treasourers, (men woste hardy and valyante) assemble theym selues togyther. Also all the notaries and scrybes, whiche in great numbre chaunce this daye hath broughte to the treasoure house, I perceyue they, lokynge to what ende this busines wyll come, ar fully bent on the common welth. Here is also the holle mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the meane sorte of freemen. For who is he, to whome those temples, the aspecte of this citie, the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of libertie, and fynally this lyghte, and this oure natiue countrey, is not dere, swete, and pleasante. It is a ioyfull thynge honorable fathers, to see the fauoure and affection of the lybertines, whiche chauncynge to enioye the franches of this citie, accompte it to be theyr owne countree: whiche cytie some that be here borne, and comme of noble lynage, iudge not theyr countrey, but take it as a towne of theyr enemyes. But whereto shall I recyte vnto you those men and degrees, whome theyr owne priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, the common profite, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and lybertie, of all thinges the moste swetest, hath a waked and styred to defende the welthe of theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey? There is no slaue, whose seruile condition is anye thynge tollerable, whiche dothe not vtterly abhore the saucy and malapert boldnes of our citisens, that wolde not haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bridled, that doth not, as moche as he dare and as muche as he can, applye his good wylle for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale? Wherfore if haplye any of you be moued with this, that a rumoure is blowen abrode, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ruffyan, longing to Lentulus runneth about fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shope to shope, hopynge with mede to stere and reyse vp
<pb n="lxvj" facs="tcp:2049:70"/>
routes of such as be nedy and ignoraunt what thinges meane: Surely this was begunne and attempted: but yet there was none founde so poore nor so wretched but that wylleth and desyreth, that his shoppe and place, where he getteth his lyuinge, his chambre for his bed, and the quiet course of his lyfe, myght be in safegarde. And the moste parte of those, that lyue by theyr handye crafte, yea I shulde say, this vniuersall kynde of people, do loue to lyue in quiete and reste. For all theyr instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, theyr workes and wynninges are maynteyned by concurse and resorte of the people, &amp; nourisshed wyth peace and concorde, whose gaynes and wynnynges, yf by shuttynge in of theyr shoppes, is wonte to be my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed, what shall they gette, whan they be bourned. These thynges beynge thus, honourable fathers, you canne lacke noo helpe to defende the common weale: Take ye good hede, that ye fayle not the common welth you haue the Consull, escaped frome manye perylles and disceytes, and frome the very poynte of deathe, not onely for his owne lyfe, but for youre welthe reserued: all states and degrees with one mynde, one wylle, one fauour, oone force, wyth oone voyce, contente to saue and defende the commune weale. Thys oure coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey besette aboute wyth fyre brondes and weapons of this wyicked conspyracye, mekelye holdeth vp her han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to you. To you she commendeth the lyfe of all her cytesyns, the castell and Capytoll, the aulteres and y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, the perpetualle bournynge fyre of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Vesta, the Temples and Chapelles of the goddis, the walles and buyldynges of the Cytie.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, you muste this daye gyue a Iugemente, concerning your owne lyfe, your wyues and childerns
<pb facs="tcp:2049:71"/>
lyues, and that toucheth all youre goodes, possessions and howses.

They seeme to me to haue reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what peynes they shulde suffer, that haue prepared to make warre against theyr countrey, theyr parentes, the aulter and oratories.

Other mysdedes may be punished after they be done: but yf it be not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked well to, that this euel dede be not done, it wyll be to late to execute iustyce. The cyte being got, the subdued can nothinge doo.

yf ye wyll retayne stylle these, suche as they be, delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that you so derely loue, yf ye woll haue tyme and space to vse your pleasures: at the laste awake, and enbrace the common weale. For nowe the reasonyng is not of our tributes, nor of the wronges doone to oure confederates. Our lybertie and lyfe is in daunger. I haue very often honorable fathers, spoken many thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amonge you here, I haue ofte complayned of the excesse and auarice of oure citesins: And for that cause I haue many men agaynste me. For I that neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue my selfe any offence, coulde not lyghtely forgyue other mens mysdedes. And though ye lyttell regarded my wordes, yet was the weale publyke in good case, for the welthynes thereof supported your neglygence. But nowe it is not in debatynge, after what maners, good or badde we shulde lyue, or how great or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificient the Romayne empire shulde be: but whether these thynges, howe so euer they be shalbe ours alone, or enioyed together with vs of our enemies. Wyll anye man in this matter ones name myldenesse, and mercy? Surely we haue of late loste the true names of thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For to gyue awaye othermens goodes is callyd Liberalyte. Boldenesse to do yuell dedes is called For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, therfore the weale publyke is at the last cast. Let them for me, seing the maner and fascion is so, be lybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of other mens goodes, let them be mercyfull to stea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers of the common treasure: so that they gyue not to them our bloude, and sparynge a fewe lewde &amp; naught, they vndo all that be good and honest. C. Cesar while eare reasoned well and substancially before you of lyfe and deathe, supposynge I beleue, that those thynges be false, whiche are reported of hel, that the yuell doers

are sondred a way from the good, dwellynge in places obscure, vile, stynkyng, vncleane, &amp; fearefull. And so he iudged, that theyr goodes shuld be forfayted, and they them selues to be kept in warde in dyuers townes, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring twis, leste if they were styll in Rome, they shoulde by stronge hande bee set againe at lybertie, eyther by the fauorers of the conspiracie, or elles by the multitude of hopelostes hired ther vnto: As though naughty and vngracious persons were only in Rome, &amp; not through out all Italy: or as though braynsicke boldnes coude not more preuaile ther, where as is lesse power to make de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore this counsayle is surely of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, if he stande in drede of them: but if he alone in so great feare to all men, is not afrayde: so moche the more it behoueth me to be fearefull bothe for my selfe and you. Therfore whan ye gyue iudgement agaynste P. Lentulus and other that be taken: Know for a sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that ye gyue iudgement agaynst Catiline, his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and all the conspiratours. And the more diligence ye vse in this matter, the lesse courage shall they haue. If they may perceyue, that you wax faynt harted: they all full fierce wyll soone be here. Thynke not, that our forefathers haue of a very lyttel, made a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale by feates of armes: if it so were, we shuld haue it farre more goodly. For our abundance of confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate frendes, citesyns, armour, and horses, is greatter than euer our auncetours had. But there were other thynges that made them mighty, whiche we want: At home they were studyous and dilygente, in theyr dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge with strangers, iuste and trewe, in consultation theyr myndes were free from all affections, they negle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cted not theyr duetie, nor inclyned to bodilye luste. In

stede of these vertues we haue prodigall expence and couetousnes, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minaltie poore, and many priuatly ryche and welthy: We preyse ryches, and folowe sleuth and ydelnesse. There is no difference betwene the good men and the badde: Ambition hath al the rewardes of vertue. And no meruell, syth eche of you seketh for his owne priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modite: syth ye at home giue your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes to volupties and pleasures, and here in the senate study howe to wynne money and frendshyp. Wherby the weale publyke, voyde, exhauste, and deserte, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded. But I let passe these matters. Noble cytesins haue conspired to burne theyr countrey, they haue sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the Frenchemen, moste greuous ennemyes to Romaynes, vnto warre. The capitayn Catilyne with his army is in our neckes. Ye make delaye, yea in soo weyghty a busynes, and stand in doubt, what ye shuld do with our enmies taken within the walles. I thynke good, ye take pitie on them, they beinge yongemenne through ambition haue done amisse, gyue them leaue, yea beinge armed, to departe away. I feare, leste this mildenes and mercy, if they begyn to arme them, wyll turne vs to great misery. It is eth to know, how sharp and greuous a conspiracy is, but ye feare it not, yes y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wys do you, and that very soore, but throughe negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence &amp; faynt courage ye dryue forth the tyme, one lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng what an other wyl do, as it were trustynge to the goodis immortal, which ful oft haue saued this weale publike, in most greatest peryls. The aide and helpe of the goddis is not gotten with vowes and womanlye prayers: but by watchfull diligence, well doing &amp; good counsailynge, all thinges done prospere. Whan a man gyueth hym self to sluggishnes and discourage, he shal
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:2049:77"/>
call vpon the goddis in vaine: for they be displeased and greued with suche one. In olde tyme in the warres of France, A.

And whan Metellus wold haue recited the lawe wythout writinge (for he coulde it by hart) Thermus laying his hand vpon his mouthe wolde not suffer hym to speke. Metellus takynge this greuously, and a token beinge giuen, his swordes made a greate shoute, and beganne to make an assaute: With this sodayne fraye, all the multitude of people greately complayninge, voyded oute of the markete place.

Of all whiche this was the most speciall cause, for that he sawe before hym his ennemye Metellus, with thre legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, redy to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter wyth hym: and Antonius at his backe with a greate hoste, whiche dyd pursue hym in his flyghte: one euerye syde were the mountayns, whiche dyd let, that he coulde not saue hym selfe by flyght, and therfore he thought it was no may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry for his enmies: stoppyng the wayes, that no vytay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les shulde come to him: to opteine the vyctorye without any stroke strikinge, if he shuld abide tyll the two hostis

For many fledde frome him, whan tydinges came, that the matter wente yll on theyr syde at Rome: and many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge to come to him, retourned backe home ageyne. And also bycause the numbre of his enemies daylye encreased. Also the nede of corne soore greued hym, for the ways beinge stopt, with great peine any vitailes coulde be brought to him. Than Catilyne, all these thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges considered &amp; seinge he had no hoope (eyther to scape by flight, or that anye succours shulde come to him) but onely in battayle, determined to assaye fortune, and to proue the vttermoste ayde. Wherefore assemblynge his counsaile togyther, and callinge to the same counsayle souldiours of all sortes and degrees, he made to them an oration, the which though it be found in Salust, yet bicause it can not be so properly Salustis as Catilins, I haue therfore vnderwriten here the copie therof. For Iustinus writeth, that Pompeius Trogus, the greate writer of hystories, reproueth Liuius and Saluste, by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause that they in many places of theyr bookes, putte o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens orations for theyr owne.

But nowe trewely, that that shulde be repelled by deathe, we maye eschewe withoute she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of any of our bloudde. Whiche thynge that ye maye the better vnderstande, I wylle declare to you, of what sortes of people, this noble army of Catilins is gatheryd togyther. I here saye they be conflate or gathered togyther of three kyndes of men. The fyrste kynde is of those that Sylla sente to inhabyte the
<pb facs="tcp:2049:90"/>
towne of Fesules. These menne, bycause they haue wasted awaye theyr owne goodes, looke that Caty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyne shoulde gyue theym newe tables, and prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ryche menne. For they haue not forgotte, howe sodeynely in Syllas tyme of poore menne, they were made ryche. And not with standynge I here saye they be good bolde menne, yet I thynke theym in no wyse to be doubted, for eyther that theyr olde strengthe is by ydelnesse or bodyly pleasure cleane quayled, or yf it remayne and contynue, they bothe in manlynesse and numbre are vnable to matche with you. The seconde kynde is of those cytesyns (yf they may be callyd cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens and not rather beastes) whych whyle they gaped for our goodes, wasted a way theyr owne. These men, ouer whelmed with wyne, glutted with meate, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with aduoutry, loke to be Consulles, Pretours, or Trybunes. Amonge this sort are they, with whych Catiline being propt vp, walked stately vp and downe at Rome, wiche he wolde neuer suffre to go from hym the whyche neuer exercysed theyr youthe in rydynge, shotyng, or other good feates of armes, in watchyng, in endurynge warrelyke labour: but for those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they lerned to loue and to be loued, to dance, syng, to make bankettes, and to play at dice. Wherfore they are nothynge to be cared for: for they shal rather curse and wysshe vs yuell, than be able, by feate of armes to greue vs. The thyrde kynde is dyuers, myngled to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyther of many sortes of people. For in this route are all dycers, aduouterers, swordplayers, shepards, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, parentsleers, finally all vngratious knaues, and moste pestilent of all Italy. I iuge veryly all those to be gathered here togither, that now this day they may
<pb n="lxxxij" facs="tcp:2049:90"/>
for theyr myschieuous dedes receyue punyshemente, dewe vnto theym many yeares agone. And of all this greatte route, scarse the fourthe parte is well harney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed. All othere gaue no targettes, helmettes, morys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pykes, nor harneys: But for these thynges they haue hedginge bylles, iauelyns, or pyked stakes. Oh bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle verye moche to be feared, whan menne vnarmed, shall fyght wyth armed men, foolyshe loutes with men moste polytyke, drounkarddes with sobre men, lyther luskes, with men moste stronge and hardy, sluggysshe slepers with men vigilaunt and watchefull: Whanne fynally iniquitie, myschiefe, lechery, nedynesse, cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyse, foolehardynesse, all vyces shall contende wyth equytie, goodnesse: temperaunce, strengthe, prudence, and with all other vertues. Also we muste nedes truste, that in this battayle, the verye goddis immortall woll fauourable prospere vs. Wherefore, excepte we wolle nedes be slaues, the vyctorie is surelye ours. Whyche thynges beinge thus good souldyours. I admonyshe you for the common whealthes sake (than whiche no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge ought to be derer vnto anye manne) I exhorte you for my greate dylygence, whiche ye knowe I haue practysed in warre faare, and I beseeche youe for the greatnesse of the perylle that wee stande in, thynke that all the ayde and succoure of the commone wealle, all the state of the Cytye, the wealthe and lybertie of all the Citisens, is layde and faste fyxed to youre swor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des poynted in this one battayle.

But in this opinion to iuge indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: let man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande that the mynde is ordayned, guyder, ruler and captayne of mannes lyfe: whiche mynde: whan it valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly intendeth to attayne, to worshyp and dignitie, by way of vertue: it nedeth nat to force of fortune, nor to care for her vncertayne giftes: but to dyspise her as nat able to gyue to any man honesty, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or other good and vertuous exercises: nor able to depriue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agayne of the same gyftes: after he hath obtayned the same. But on the other parte if this minde of man, taken and blynded with froward pleasurs be subdued vnto slouth and bodyly lustes: after it hathe exercised and occupyed such ieoperdous pleasure by a lytel seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and after that by cowardous slouth, bothe the strength, the tyme and

she wyte are vanysshed away and decayed: than anone the infirmitie and febilnes of nature is accused and put in blame. And thus all suche slouthfull doers transpose and lay awaye the faute whiche in them selfe is culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vnto the difficulte of such besinesse, as they haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by negligence. But if it were so: that men had as greate cure and affection of thinges good and profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they haue desyre &amp; pleasure in sekynge and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge thinges contrary vnto them, and nothynge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, ye: and also muche perylous and hurtfull: than shulde nat they be more ruled by the chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of fortune than they shuld rule the sayd chaunces. And thus shuld they attayne and procede vnto so greate excellence: that where they be mortal of nature they shuld be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall by glory and renowmed fame. For in lykewyse as man is composed and made of .ii. thynges (that is to say of the body and soule) ryght so all thynges, all besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and exercises, to mankynde belongyng, foloweth some the nature of the bodye: to decay brefely and to be mortall: as it is, which thing forther to proue by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we daly se that the goodly beauty of the visage and shape of mankynde, great abondaunce of ryches, &amp; also the strength of the body, wyth all other suche thynges and semblable, decayeth and vanyssheth awaye wythin shorte tyme. But contrarely the excellente and worthy actes: belonging to mans wyt: be immortall and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng: as the soule is immortall. And finally in lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse as the begynning of the gyftes corporall or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and of the gyftes of fortune is caduke, vayne, and vncertayne: ryght so is the ende of the same mutable &amp; transitory. And all thynges whiche be borne and sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng: agayne decayeth and approcheth to deth: &amp; whan
<pb facs="tcp:2049:96"/>
these same be growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and increased to the high of theyr perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: agayne they begyne to decay and consume by age and debilite. But the mynde and soule beynge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupte, eternal and gouernoure of mankynde, ruleth and weldeth al thynges: but it selfe can nat be violently ruled nor compelled by any thynge erthly, consyderyng the frewyll, whiche it optayneth of his creatour. For whiche consyderation the frowarde iniquite of them is more to be maruayled: which subdued to the ioyes and pleasures of the body, passe forthe the time of theyr lyfe in carnall lustes and ydelnes. But towchyng theyr wyt (whiche is the best gyfte and grettest treasure grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to mankynde) that suffre they to slomber and to slepe wythout exercise, in slouthe and ydelnes: whose dulnes surely is somoch more to be blamed: namely sith so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; diuers noble exercises &amp; occupacions of the mynd be: by whom most clere nobles and fame vndefiled may be optayned. But of suche diuers exercises concernyng the mynd some are better refused: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> procured in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous tymes &amp; inquiet. And namely in this tyme tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and season vnquiet: great offyces, lordeshyppes, rowmes to commaunde and rule, and brefely to speke. All maner cure concerning the administracion of thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges appartenyninge to the commen wele: semeth vnto me nat at all to be coueted or desyred of any wyse man. For neyther is honour giuen vnto vertue, as condigne rewarde and worthy therto belongynge nother such as haue gotten iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and honoure, by fraude and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laufull meanes (in lyke case) can nat be moore sure nor more honest, by meane of such honour so vnryghtwys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtayned.

Than how moch more ought the clere description of hystores to kyndell vnto boldnes &amp; vertu the myndes of noble men by redyng of the same. But moche contrary, yf we aduert the worlde as it is nowe amonge all men whiche lyue, and conforme them selfe to the maners vsed nowe adayes, where shall we fynde one: but that wyll striue and contende wyth theyr fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers to ouercome them, other in couetise and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ryches, or els in prodigalite and wastfull expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and nat in honest and laudable lyfe, good excercises and diligence? And moreouer genty line<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fyrst hed whiche were wont to preuente auncient noble men and ascende vnto vertue and nobles, by vertuous maners: suche laboure nowe to lordeshyp, honour and authorite by fraude and falshode: rather then by very vertue or good meanes and laudable. After such maner as if the offyce of a hye Juge, of a Tresourer, a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sull, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uost, and all suche other great offices, were noble &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente of them selfe.

This kynge departyng lefte behynd hym thre sonnes, whose names were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipsa, Manastaball, and Galussa, of whome Micipsa suceded his father, and alone obtayned the kyngedome
<pb facs="tcp:2049:100"/>
after that the other two brethern Manastabal and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lussa, were departed frome this lyfe by sickenesse. This Micipsa had two sonnes named Adherball &amp; Hiemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall. But Manastaball his brother which departed (as sayd is) left behynd him one sonne nat lauflly borne, but a bastarde, begoten of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubine: wherfore departing he lefte hym orbate withoute lande or lyuelode. This consyderinge Micipsa suffered hym nat to faute nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye: but forasmoche as he was his brothers sonne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued hym into his court, &amp; hym cherished in lyke wise as he dyd his owne sonnes, Adherbal &amp; Hiemsal. This Iugurth after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was a lytel growen vp to age: was myghty in strength comely, and fayre of face: but moost of all, excellente of wyt &amp; wysedome. Nor he gaue nat hym selfe to be corrupte with lust nor incraftye slouthe: but as is the custome &amp; maner of the people of Numidi hymselfe he exercised, somtyme in rydyng, somtime in ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>styng the dart &amp; iustyng, &amp; somtyme in ronnyng &amp; wrest<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lynge with his companyons of lyke age. And nat with standyng, that in laud and prayse he passed al his peres yet none enuied hym but he was derely beloued, chery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, &amp; lauded of al men. Moreouer he passed moche of his tyme in huntynge of wyld bestes which in that land habounded: he was the firste, or one amonge the firste which durst assaile and stryke the lyon, and other cruell and wylde bestes: he dyde moche: &amp; lytel sayd or bosted of hymselfe. For suche demeanour his vncle Micipsa at first begynnynge was gladde and ioyefull: supposynge that in tyme to come the manly behauour &amp; strength of Iugurth shuld be glory &amp; honour to al his kyngdome But afterwarde in processe of tyme whan he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sydred &amp;

vnderstode his lyfe approchinge fast to ende, hys natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sonnes yonge, and vnexperte. And this yonge man Iugurth in honour and fauour dayly encreasing more and more he reueyled many thynges in minde greatly moued with such solicitude and busenesse. Forthermore he consydred that, all men of kynde be naturally incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to desyre to rule, and commaunde by lordeshyppe, rather than to be ruled and subiecte. And howe man is proue and hedlyng inclined to fulfyll the desyers of his mynde dredynge no daungers: nor suspectynge no peryl while he is excecate by ambicion and desyre of lordship. Moreouer aduisyng the oportunite of his owne age, &amp; of the age of his chyldren whiche for youth were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to resyst any power or violence: which oportunite is wonte to be not small confort, audacite and courage, not onelye to bolde hertes, but also to meane men and cowardes, intendyng to conspyre agaynst theyr princes in hope of praye and promocions. Suche consyderacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons feared sore the mynde of Micipsa, besyde these, hys drede and doloure was augmented, whan he behelde the fauoure and hertes of all his subiectes of the lande of Numidy vtterly inclyned to Iugurth: wherefore to put to death the same Iugurth by anye gyle (as hys purpose was to to) he dreade moost of all: dowtynge leste thereof myght succede bytwene hym and hys sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes some insurrexion or battayle. Micipsa com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pased on euery syde wyth these dyfficultyes, was soore troubled in mind. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he saw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nother by stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth nor gyle he might destroy a man so well beloued of the commens (as was Iugurth) at last he deuised an other waye to ryde hym, and that without daunger or suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
<pb facs="tcp:2049:101"/>
wherfore wherfore Micipsa aduertynge that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth was redy of hande to strike, auenterous &amp; moche desyrous of honour and laude of chiualry, he concluded with himselfe to obiect hym to daunger &amp; peryl of war, and by that meane to assay the fortune of batayle.</p>
                     <p>¶Now at the same seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romains warred against a cite of Hispayne named Numaunce, vnto which war diuers kinges to the commens associate sent vnto them succours agaynst the same cite. Among whom Micip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa also sent a fayre companye of horsmen and fotemen, ouer whome he made Iugurth captaine, and sent hym forth wyth them into Hispayne, trustynge that there he lyghtlye shulde be ouerthrowen and slayne in batayle, other in shewynge his manhod and strength, or els by fyersnes and crueltye of his enemyes. But this thynge fortuned moche contrary to his opinion. For Iugurth was of mynde and courage valiaunt and bolde, and of wytte quicke and redye, so that after he had parceyued the disposision, behauour and maners of Publius Sci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pio, at that tyme captayne of the Romains, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had consydred also the maners of his ennemyes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued hymselfe in such wise with moch labour, besines and cure, in obeynge his captayne with so good maner and often tymes countryng his enemies without dred of perill. In somoch that within shorte tyme he came to so great fame and worshyppe, that vnto the Romayns he was marueylous dere and well beloued, and of the Numantines dreade as deth: and certaynly, among the chefyst he was worthy and valiaunte in batayle: and also good of counsell, of wysedome pregnaunt and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect. Whiche two thinges be muche harde to be in one man both togyder, for wysedome is often wonte to
<pb n="iiij" facs="tcp:2049:101"/>
make men aferde and to drede many peryls because of prouidence. But boldnes and audacite causeth men to be rasshe and folehardy, bycause of stout courage. But his wysedome directed his strength, and his strengthe was obediente to wysdome. Wherfore Scipio the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dyd almost euery ieopardous and whyghty thing by hande and counsell of Iugurth, hym countynge a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong his chefe frendes and daily cherysshed him more and more, and no marueyle, for there was no counsell, nor interprise begone of Iugurth frustrate or in vayne but all came to good effect. Besyde these gyftes aboue sayd he was curtes of mynde, lyberal, and of wyt right discreate and prudent: by which giftes he adioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym many of the Romayns in familier frendshype. At that same season in the army of Rome were ryghte many newe, and also auncient gentylmen, whiche sette more by riches than goodnes or honeste. At home in Rome were they sowers of dyscord and debatful, great in fame among the frendes of the Romains. But more famous by worshyppe and rowme, than by honest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersacion. These kyndled the mynde of Iugurth nat a lytell-promising often tymes and sayenge to set his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage on fyre, that if the kyng Micipsa discessed the time shulde come that Iugurth alone shulde enioye the hole kyngdome of Numidy wythout any partiner. For in hym (they sayde) was greate vertue, greate manhode, strength, and audacite wyth wisedome, able to gouerne suche a kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and nothing was so iniust and false but that might be iustified at Rome for gold, and all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were there to be sold by couetyse of noble men.</p>

But after the kynges funerall exequies were magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ended as appertayned to his state royal.

shulde haue the place of moost honoure amonge them, whiche were naturall sonnes of a kinge, and also lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully borne: and so in contempte of Iugurth he set him selfe downe on the ryght hande his brother Adherball: to thintent that Iugurth shulde not syt in the myddes, bytwene them: whiche rowme the Numidiens count of most honour. And afterwarde howe be it his brother Adherball requyred him ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue place to Iugurth bycause of his age: yet vnnethes coude he with moche paine induce hym therto, but at last fatygate by reques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of his brother &amp; of other noble men of the realme, he chaunged his place and set hym vpon the other side with countenance declarynge his mynde not contented. And thus at last satte Iugurth for his age in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bitwene them bothe, as in place of moost honoure. Whan the thre prynces were thus sette and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned of many thinges concernynge the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the kyngdome, amonge many and dyuers other thinges Iugurth sayde, that all the statutes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces which the kynge Micipsa had made fyue ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res before his deth, ought of congruence to be adnulled as of none effecte. For in that season (as sayde he) hys witte what for age, what for syckenesse was feble, dull and of small valoure.

Whan Hiempsall herde Iugurth thus speke he answered sayenge that it pleased him right well that it shuld so be done.

And also to certifie youre excellence moore playnlye of myne vnnaturall and vnkynde kynseman Jugurth: and of his cruelte.

Micipsa had adopted him for his sonne: and made him inheritour of his kyngdome, partner w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sonnes: and for asmuch as he had demeaned him selfe ryght wel &amp; worthely, in executynge of many hygh &amp; glorious interprises: somuch the lesse coude he suffre iniury done vnto hym vnreuenged. As touchyng Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbal Iugurth alleged for hymselfe that this Adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball by gyle and treason lay in wayt to flee hym: whiche thynge perceyued: he made resystence agaynst the same to the best of his power, as any man was bounde to do for sauegard of his owne lyfe. And if the Romayns wolde prohybit and deny that vnto hym, which Iustice permytted to euery man (that is, with violence to resyst and repell violence) than shulde they neyther do wel nor ryghtwysely in that behalfe. Whan Iugurth had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the embassadours after this maner: than said he for conclusion that shortly after he wold send embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to certify the Senatours of all other thynges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng this busynes: and on this poynt Iugurth &amp; the embassadours departed in sonder.

stakes and pales sticked on the hygheste parte of the same trenches wyth sharpe pykes at the vpper endes. This dyd Iugurth for manye consideracions: firste to thintent that the inhabitantes shuld not breke forthe of of the towne sodenly at any syde vpon any parte of hys souldiours which besieged them. Secondly to thintent that on no part any vitailes shuld be brought in to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thirdlye that the men of war within the towne shulde not thruste forthe withoute the towne the multitude of poore commons in tyme of famine and scarsitie of vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles. And fourthlye, that no succours shoulde enter in to them to rescue the towne, nor to supplye theyr gary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Whan thys trenche was made and fynyshed, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth moreouer made stronge bulwarkes and towres of tymber withoute the towne, and strengthed the same wyth a garrison of wyghte and bolde menne of armes. Besyde all these ordinaunces he lefte nothyng vnassay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neyther spared he to attempt any thyng by strength, or by treason and gyle. Somtyme he proued the watch men and defenders of the walles wyth gyftes exciting them to betraye the towne. Whan his rewardes auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led naughte, than he threatened them wyth fyerce and sharpe woordes, hee inhaunced by exhortacions the myndes and courages of hys owne menne to manly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and audacitye.

On the one syde he pereciued his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy Iugurth violente agaynste him, and no trust of comfort or socours. On the other syde he consydred wel that for penury and wante of soudiours and other thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges necessary he was not able nother to fyght with hys ennemie, nor to dryue forth or prolong the batayle: and for faute of vytaile he myght not long defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne. These thinges with many mo well reuoulued in mind: he chose for the two whiche were most diligent and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of that company which had fled with hym into Cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tha. To them he wofully bewailed his misfortune: and made so large promisses of rewardes vnto them: that at last he induced them to go forthe of the towne by night priuely, and if they might escape theyr ennemies, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorte to the nexte hauen towne: and from thens to haste them to Rome with letters whiche he had deuised and written to be delyuered to the senatours.

Nowe it was so that long before this tyme a noble man of Rome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Sempronius whyle he was in authorite made a statute and lawe that if it fortuned at any tyme: that the Romayns stode in doute and feare leste any warre or

batayle myght come vpon them sodenly, newe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>suls than shulde be chosen and assigned for the nexte yere to come, and send into suche prouynces where the batayle or warre was feared. These consuls were thus chosen before the yere of the olde consuls was fully expyred to thintent that in meane tyme they myght haue more tyme and leyser to make conuenient prouision for the warre: And this act so decreed was called the lawe of Sempronius, bicause he first inacted the same. By this lawe of Sempronius: the two prouinces of Numidy and Italy were decreed to the two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>suls for the yere to come. The prouince of Italy to be defended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued: &amp; the prouince of Numidy to be recouerd (Scipi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>o Nasica) (and Calphurnius Bestia) were proclamed Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>suls for the next yere commyng. The lande of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midy came by lot to Calphurnius that he shulde do his dilgence to recouer the same, and the countrey of Italy fell to Scipio to defende the same. After this an army was assembled to be sende into Affirke, and so forth to Numidy: wages, and vitayles for the soudyours with o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther thynges nedefull to war, were decreed of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours, and: prouyded of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sull Calphurnius. But whan Iugurth herd tidyng from his frendes at Rome of this ordynaunce, and perceyued that the mater went forward, other wyse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he trusted it shulde haue done. For his mynd was fixed that al thing right and wrong myght be bought and solde at Rome: nowe went he in hand agayn with his olde craftes, and sende his sonne with other two of his moost familyer and trusty frends embassadours vnto the Senatours. And lyke as he had commaunded these embassadours whome he had sende to Rome after he had murdred Hiempsall: ryght
<pb n="xxviij" facs="tcp:2049:124"/>
so he commaunded these that they shuld go in hande to stop euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes mouth with money. For in his great treasour and in couetyse of the rulers of Rome was al his confidence. O cursed hunger of gold most execrable thou driuest blynd myndes to yls innumerable. Whan these embassadours of Iugurth wer come nere Rome: the consull Calphurnius demaunded aduise and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Senatours whyther it pleased them that the sayd embassadours shuld be receyued within the wales of Rome or not. But the Senatours decreed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> except they came to yelde bothe Iugurth and kyngdome of Numidy vnto the Romains: vpon a great payne they shulde depart out of the countrey of Italy within x. dayes next after. Calphurnius commaunded this or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinance and decree of the Senatours to be brone and declared to the Numidya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by one named Decius. And so thembassadours departed home agayne without any thynge done, wherefore they came. In the meane time Calphurnius prepared his armye: &amp; chose to him noble men, debateful, and hauyng mani clyentes and serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes retayned with them. This dyd he, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that if he dyd any thyng amysse in his viage: he myght trust to be supported by theyr authorite. Among whome was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Scaurus: of whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions &amp; behauour I haue spoken before. But in this consull Calphurnius, weere mani good propertis and vertuous condicions, bothe of mynde and body: but the cursed vice of couetyse which was in hym: blynded and ouer came all those vertues: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not in execucion: he might wel indure la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour, his wit was quick &amp; pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he was puident and ware inough.

<pb facs="tcp:2049:125"/>
But to our purpose, this Calphurniꝰ wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had elect and assembled such compani as him thought competent for an army, he deuyded all his hoost into legyous, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taynyng in euery legion .vi.M.vi.C.lx. &amp; sir men. And so sende forth his men by legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey of Italy to a towne called Regium, which towne is in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches betwene Italy and Cycil: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this towne of Regiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wer conuayed into Cycile, and so into Affrike, and there they mustred and wer set in aray, and so proceded by lande tyll they attayned vnto Numidie. Anone Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnius prepared vitailes and all maner ordinaunces requisite, and proceded forwarde, assaylyng fierselye the land of Numidy, as a hardy captayne, pretendyng great valyantise at the first brunt. Many men toke he prisoners, &amp; a fewe townes he subdued vnto him suche as resysted his power he brent them, to the grounde to increase fere to theyr neighbours. Iugurth aduertyng this sharpnes of Calphurnius send embassadours to hym with great plenty of gold to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt his mynde, and shewed vnto hym y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hardnes and difficulte of the warre which he had begon. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Calphurnius felt the wyght &amp; valour of the glystryng gold, his corrupt &amp; vnstable mynde by contagion of couetyse, anone was peruerted to receyue the money, and induced to fauour and assist the part of Iugurth. But Scaurus (of whome I haue spoken before) was receyued vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for partiner and felowe of al theyr counsels &amp; busynesses. And howbeit at begynnyng this same Scaurus strongly resisted the party of Iugurth: what tyme many other of his sect were corrupt and accloyed with bribes long before this neuertheles now at last his mynde was abstract lyke other mo from the defence of goodnes and honesty vnto
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:2049:125"/>
his olde vice of insaciable &amp; execrable couetyse by mean of haboundaunce of golde and greate rewardes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth. But at firste begynnyng, this Iugurth redemed of Calphurnius, but onely delayinge and deferrynge of of the warre: trustynge that in the meane tyme he shuld bringe aboute somwhat of his purpose at Rome, other by pryce, prayer, or fauour. But now after he had wone Scaurus to be partener of hys busynesse, and fauorer of hys cause also wyth Calphurnius: he was broughte in to a verye greate truste fullye to recouer his peace at Roome: and concluded whyle both Calphurnius and Scaurus weere presente together, to take aduisemente and treate presently with them of all apoyntmente and thinges necessary to be done for performing of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Howe be it he trusted not Calphurnius so muche that he wold come to his army, except some hostages of the Romaines were lefte within some stronge towne of his, and in warde of his people wherby he myght truste without damage safely to be remitted againe to his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Calphurnius to auoide this dout of Iugurth, and to put hym in more assurance, send the treasourer of the Romaine armie named Sertius, vnto one of the chiefe townes belongyng to Iugurth called Vacca, fayninge among the army that he sente the treasourer thither for prouision of wheat and other vytayles necessary to hys hooste. And the same commaundemente to prouyd vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles the captaine Calphurnius gaue to his tresourer openly in commen audience: to the intent that no manne shulde suspecte his false purpose: saying to his tresourer that he neded not to be in doute of Iugurth, for asmuch as truce was taken betwene both parties tyll a certeine daye prefyxed. The tresourer Sextius went to the sayd
<pb facs="tcp:2049:126"/>
cyte of Vacca at commaundement of Calphurnius his captayne. Wherfore anone after Iugurth (lyke as he apointed before) came to the army of Calphurnius, and there in presence of the rulers and counsell of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, spake lytell of his purgacion, concernyng the displeasure, enuy, and hatredde, which the senate and commens of Rome had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against him for his dedes sayeng that he had nought done but prouoked of his ennemies, and for his owne defence: with violence to resyst violence. Howe beit he sayd that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to yelde and submit hym selfe vnto the Romayns cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and mercy. Somuch spoke he openly before al the chefe counsel of the army. But al the remenaunt he concluded &amp; dyd secretly with Calphurnius &amp; Scaurus at more leasure, and thus ended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of this day. On the next day after insuynge the captayne and the counsel of the army, and also Iugurth assembled to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyder agayn to common of the same mater concernyng peace to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to Iugurth. Now it was so that at Rome was decreed an ordinaunce long before this time named among the Romayns the Satyre lawe, which lawe commaunded that the captayne of euerye armye shulde aske aduyse of all wyse counsell of his hoost wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went about any wheyghty mater concernynge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men wele. Wherfore Calphurnius thought so to order hymselfe that he shulde not be counted a brekar of this lawe: And desyred counsell and aduise of all the noble and wyse men of his hoost. This dyd he to thynte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that if the peace graunted to Iugurth shulde be afterward dysalowed at Rome (as it was) he myght auoyde the faute from hym selfe into the common counsell. But at conclusion, whan Calphurnius acordyng to the sayd
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:2049:126"/>
lawe had required aduise of the common counsel, euery man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sented that peace shulde be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to Iugurth vpon condicion and conuenaunt that he shulde delyuer vnto the Romayns thirtie Elyphantes with moche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther catel and many horses with a great some of golde. To which ordinaunce Iugurth acorded and soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deliuered the same Eliphantes, catell, and horses &amp; golde vnto the tresourer of the Romayne hoost. Thys done the consull Calphurnius departed to Rome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre the senatours and other rulers to confirme thys peace and concorde whiche they had made w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iugurth.

Well forsothe I graunt that it be reputed for treason and vsurpacion of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to defende the lawes and the right of the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Neuerthelesse they counted but a small thynge to escape vnpunyshed for these so great offences. Wherfore nowe are they become so bolde, so fiers, and proude: by youre sufferance that at last they haue betra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yed and put in handes of youre ennemyes, your lawes, your dignite, youre magestye, wyth all other thinges bothe humayne and diuine to your libertie belongyng. So that in pardoninge of these inhumayne and cruell offences of Iugurth they haue polluted and betrayed the lawes bothe of god and man. And howe be it that suche is theyr demeanour it nothynge repenteth them: nor they be nought asshamede therof.

Haue ye not dayly experience seynge that symple bondmen bought &amp; solde for money wyl not suffer nor endure the vniust commaundementes of theyr lordes or maisters.

But anye of you maye than requyre of me what is youre mynde what wyll ye that we doo.

<pb facs="tcp:2049:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
honour of the common wele vnto your enemy Iugurth without aduyse of the Senatours or of the commenty: but this my counsel is not to punyssh them violenly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your power in batayle, for certes that were more dys<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>honoure vnto you to do, than to them to suffre the same. Not withstandynge that they be worthy so to be delt withall But this thyng mai be best done bi inquysition examinacion and confession of Iugurth hymselfe, and by his accusacion of these treatours, whiche Iugurth surely wyll be obedient to come hyther to Rome at your commaundement if it be true that he hath yelded hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But if he dyspise your commaundementes than may ye wel thinke and consider what peace or yeldinge he hath made by the which yeldyng he is vnpunyshed and pardoned of his detestable and shamefull dedes and these estates laded with richesse and treasure. But our cite and welthe of the commenty is come to losse, dammage, and vtter shame &amp; disworshyp. Thus muste ye do, suche examinacions muste ye make without ye thynke that these great men haue not yet sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe and power in theyr handes or els without ye shewe outward that ye were better pleased and content with that season whan kyngdomes, prouinces, iustices lawes, iugementes, batayle, peace finally euery thyng both diuine &amp; humaine were in handes of a few estates. Than ye be now pleased with the season and tyme that now is whan your lybertie is gyuen to you which ye are able to mayntayne if ye so be disposed. But in that season passed, howe beit ye were vnouercome of your ennemies, maisters, and emperours, ouer the most part of the worlde: yet had ye ynough to do to defende your own lyfe from the cruelty of these few mighty men. For
<pb n="xxxiiij" facs="tcp:2049:130"/>
of you al who was so bolde to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their subieccion and bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage. Wherfore if ye entend to endure and suffre the destruction of your libertie as ye begyn than truely the tyme which is to come shalbe much more cruell to you than the tyme passed. But as for me not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng that I vnderstand the great offence and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable of this wycked Iugurth is suffred vnpunyshed: yet wolde I suffre paciently that ye shulde forgyue and pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked doers of this dede as men most vngra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious bycause they be citezins. If it wer not so, that such mercy and forgyuenes shulde tourne to our dystruction and ruyne of our empire. For ye may se how great opor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tunite &amp; sufferance they haue in somoch that they counte but a smal thyng to do vnhappely without punishment. Wherfore they now dayly encrease theyr cruelty against you, if ye do not herafter take from them the power and authorite therof. And specially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynual busynes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end shal remayne vnto you whan ye se playnly that outher ye must be seruauntes or bondemen: or els ye must retaygne and defende your libertie by strength of your handes. For what hope or trust is there of faithful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes or of concord bytwene you and them? None surely. For their mynde is vtterly set to be lordes ouer you: and ye on the other parte wyl nedes be fre and at libertie. They be extremely inclined and disposed to do wrong and iniury vnto you. And ye labour to withstande them vtterly. And brefely to speke they take the frendes and felowes of our empire for ennemies. But our mortall ennemies they take for theyr felowes and frendes. But ye wolde withstand this cursed and vnkynd behauour. Wherfore can ye suppose that peace, loue, or friendshyp can be among people so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary of myndes &amp; disposicion
<pb facs="tcp:2049:131"/>
For these consyderacions I warne and exhorte you that ye suffre not so greate myschefe to escape vnpuny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. This offence is nothynge lyke to the robbyng of the common treasure, nor to the spoylinge of money by extorcion from the felowes and frendes of oure em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Whiche dedes (how be it they be greuous and in maner intollerable) neuertheles by custome and vse of the same thei are repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the authorite of the senate is betrayed to our most cruell and fiers ennemy Iugurth, youre em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is falsly betraied to other mennes handes and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session. The commen wele hathe bene put to sale to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth by the senatours bothe at home in our citye, and also in oure army by Calphurnius the consull: In so moche that if examinacion be not made hereof: and if they be not punished whiche be culpable and fautie her in. What thynge shall remayne vnto vs but that we must passe our lyfe vnder obedience and bondage of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which thus haue done, and vs shall they kepe in subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as yf they were kynges?

Nor certes worthi citezins I do not thus exhort you to coueyte rather that youre citezins shulde do yll than well. But I speke to thintente, that ye shulde not so fauour and: forbere a fewe iniust and yll disposed me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the vtter distruction of all good men shulde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of suche indiscrete fauoure. And also name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in a cytie or a commen weale it is muche better
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:2049:131"/>
and more tollerable to forgette the reward of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, than the punishement of yll dedes. For a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seynge his goodnes not rewarded nor set by, he dothe but onely withdrawe his owne kyndnes: but an yl man not punished, is the more bolde and cursed: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer if suche as be misdoers be punished: at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last theyr nombre shalbe abated and decresed, and if there be few vniust men, the lesse wronge is done.

Thus dyd Memmius exhort them as he which more regarded &amp; set more by the conseruacion of the dignite of Rome, than by the parfourminge and satisfyeng the wrath and ire of the rude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mens. But whan sylence was made among all the assemble: anone Iugurth was brought forth before them al.

And howe beit (sayd Memmius) that the Romaynes knewe well his sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porters yet they wolde moste of all that Iugurth shuld openly discouer and accuse them himselfe.

Rome whiche had supported him. And also he shuld be dystruction and vndoinge of himselfe, and of his riches also. On this pointe Memmins ceased his wordes and helde hym styll.

But whan he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to haue spoken Caius Bebius whome he had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with treasure (as I haue made mencion before) commaunded hym to holde his peace.

This dyscencion &amp; debate letted the election of the newe consuls al that yere. Aulus whom Albinus had left with the army in Numidy as his lyefetenant herd of this prolongyng of the tyme and was brought in great hope to wynne great honour or treasour. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in the colde moneth of Ianuary he called the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours forth of theyr tentes to execute the batayle with Iugurth without more delaye.

At Rome was one named Caius Manlius elect and lymitted protectoure of the commen people whiche anone after he was set in authorite: assembled the commens: and desyred and counsayled them that inquisicion might be made of all such whose supportaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and counsel Jugurth had dyspised and set at nought the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces decreed of the Senatours.

And also agaynst them whiche had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued any money or other rewarde of Iugurth whyle they were embassadours or captains of armies ageynst him: send forth by the Romayns. And finally the same inquisicion also was extended against all such as had made any pactions, apointmentes, or promises of peace or of warre with enemyes of thempire without general consent of the Senatours or commens.</p>

The princes of these nacions and suche other like gaue counsell to the senatours whiche were not fauty in the premisses, and also to the commenty: that in such a trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blous, besy, and peryllous season no suche examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shulde be made nor procede forwarde to effect: for drede of many inconueniences whiche of the same myght rise bytwene the noble men and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mens.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens were to haue the same inquisicion to procede, and to be brought to effect: and that rather for hatred which they had agaynst the noble men (against whom the said inquisicion was ordayned) than for any good wyll or fauour, whiche they had to the commen wele. So great pleasure &amp; desire of variance was among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For before the dystruction of Carthage, the Senatours and commenty of Rome treated and gouerned the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wele bytwene them peasably in loue and concorde. So that among the citezins was no stryfe nor debate, for laud, excellence, for diginte, nor for great dominion. The drede whiche they had of their enemis made them ware and kepte them in good maners causyng them to gouerne their citye with good and vertues institutes, without variance, without robbery, without oppression, without slaughter nor other lyke cruell tyrannies. But whan Carthage was ouercome anone was expulsed fere from theyr myndes: and voluptuosite, wantonnes, and pride (which ar greatly loued in welth and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye) anone entred their myndes: so that they desyred peace whan they had warre. But whan the warre was ended: and that they had peace and ydlenes after theyr owne desyre: theyr peace and rest was more sharp, more bytter, more intollerable, and more perillous to them than the war was before. For the estates bgan to tourn theyr dignite and worshyp, into immoderate affection of great lordshyppe and dominacion. And the commen people began to tourne theyr libertie into lust and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Euery man prouyded and drewe to hymselfe rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynge and reauynge without measure, from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men wele. Thus was the commentie abstract and deuyded from the lordes. So was the citye deuyded into .ii. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men weale which was in the myddes by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene them on euery side was pylled, robbed, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wasted of them both: on both sides. But the power of the noble men and of theyr party was more mighty tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of the commens. For all the estates were all togyder assembled, conioyned, and vnyed. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:2049:141"/>
were dispersed and spred abroade into diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces and companies gettyng their liuynge with laboure of their handes and sweat of their bodyes. So euerye thinge was gouerned in peace and in warre at the plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure and aduise of a fewe priuate noble men. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men treasure, the prouinces, mastershyps, offices, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, worship, triumphes, &amp; al other things longing to honour or auantage, wer only in the handes and posses<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion of the same few noble men. But the symple co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men people was weried and opressed with pouertye, bataile, and warfare. Euer in ieopardie, and neuer in auantage nor lucre. For the capitaynes with a fewe other noble men pulled suche prayes as were taken in batayle only to their singuler auantage and behofe. But in the mean season the parentes and smal children of the souldiours wer driuen from their dwelling places and possessions by the saide noble men, eche one of them by that lord vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to whom they dwelled nereste. And so the myghte and power of suche noble men conioyned with immoderate couetise assayled, defyled, wasted, and destroyed euerye thynge without good maner, without measure or mode<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racion: hauing no respect nor consideracion of any thing belonging to goodnes or vertue, tyl they had so farforth proceded that at conclusion they were destroyed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen by their owne obstinate pryde and tyranni. But at laste as soone as euer some of the estates were founde which remembring and considering them selfe: sette more by true and laudable glorye, than by vniuste power &amp; dignitie.

<pb facs="tcp:2049:142"/>
of such noble men: by meanes wherof discord and deuysion began to ryse in the cite, as it were drye dust of the grounde raysed in a great and tempesteous wynde. For after that Tiberius Gracchus, and Caius Gracchus (whose progenitours much encreased the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men weale in many batayls, but namely in the batayle of Carthage) began to restore the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie into theyr olde libertie, and to detect the cruel mysdedes of the few iniurious estates. Than al the lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federate: and af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter maner chafede with yre assembled theyr felowes, as Latynians and some knyghtes of Rome, which in hope of promocion left the commens party and helde with the nobel men. All these with suche as were to them lenyng of other nacions began to withstand the accuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menty: and first of al they slew Tiberius Graccus: And after that within a fewe yeres the slewe the other brother named Caius Graccus, while he was protector of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menty, bicause that he according to law &amp; right deuided among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mente such landes as they had won in batayle of theyr ennemies. And at the same season the estates put to deth also a lorde named Marcus Flaccus, bycause he defended the commens liberte agaynst theyr extorcion. But touchyng the two bretherin Tiberius, and Caius Graccus: sothly their myndes were greatly immoderate and vnmeasurable in theyr desyre to ouercome thestates. Neuerthelesse it had be muche better to thestates to haue suffred them in theyr ryghtwyse tytell, and somewhat to haue inclyned to theyr myndes than to haue ouercome them so iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, how best that they were ouer hasty and busy. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thestates had the victory of them after their desyre and pleasure than put they to death the commenty with

out nombre, and many they exiled and droue out of the cite. In somuch that from thens forth they rather encre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed theyr crueltie and feare to the commens, than their owne honoure or power.

The countrey of Numidi fell and happened to Metellus. This Metellus was a fierse man and a noble and a worthy warriour. And how be it he fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the party of the noble men and, was contrary to the party of the commens: neuertheles he was of fame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defyled

But bycause he mistrusted the olde army whiche was in Numidy with Albinus and Aulus, and had no confydence in the myndes of these soudyours corrupted with ydelnes and many other vices: therfore he elected &amp; assembled newe soudyours.

maners: and specially for that his minde was vnouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ryches or couetise that he shulde do more ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour to the empire then his predecessors had in the war of Numidie. For before his departing the welth of Nu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>midie (by couetyse of the officers of Roome) was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: but the welth of the Romaines wasted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minyshed. Whan Metellus was come to Affrike, the army was deliuered to hym by Albinus: which armye was vncraftie, sluggishe and feble, neyther able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure peryl nor labour: of tonge more readye, fierce and hardy, then of hande: which was wont to pyll from fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and frindes of the empire. But it self indured by cowardise to be robbed and spoyled of ennemies of the empire, as a laweles and disordred company of men vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gouerned and without authoritie or maners. Wherfore Metellus the newe capitaine had muche more thought and busynes, for such corrupt and vicious maners of a companye so farre oute of order, than he hadde helpe or good hope of conforte in the multitude of them. Thus howe be it he sawe the tyme of eleccion of newe consuls drawe nere, and also though he vnderstode that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maynes dayely looked after some ende of the warre. These causes not withstanding yet he concluded, not to begyn warre, tyll he had exercised and vsed the souldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours with busines and labour after the instruccion and custume of olde captaines vsed before his tyme. For why, Albinus was so astonyed wyth the aduersitie and myschaunce of hys brother Aulus, and for the murther of his host: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after he purposed not to departe out of the Romains prouince which was in Affrike he kept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diors alway idle in their tentes as long as somer lasted

and as long as he was in authoritie, in so muche that they chaunged no place except the corrupt sauour of the place, or els necessitie of vytaile constrained them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue. Nor according to the custome and maner of war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riours among them was no watche: but euerye manne came and went at his owne plesure, and absented them selfe from their standerds whan it lyked them. The sco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lions and pages wandred daye and nyghte mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the horsemen and chief of the soldiours without any order. And many other as rouers dispersed abrode destroyed the countrey, fyghtyng against the small vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and not against cities nor townes. They caried a waye from the said vyllages praies of catell, and led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them also the inhabitantes as prisoners with other praies, striuing together who myght haue moste and than after chaunged the sayde robries with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants for delicious and stronge wynes caried from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther straunge cuntreis, where better wyne grewe than in that cuntrey, and for other suche delicious thynges. They solde away the whete and other vitayles whiche was deliuerd of their captaines among them in comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and dayly they bought theire bread. And finally what so euer shame or rebuke longyng to couetise or lechery could eyther be saide, done, or imagined of any man, all was vsed in that hoste. And amonge some, more shame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full dedes than ought to be named. But Metellus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued him selfe as a mighty and wyse man, not lesse in this difficultie and hardnes, than if it had bene in a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile foughten agaynst his enemies, as he which in the middes of so great couetise, voluptuositie, and crueltye, was singulerly induced with temperance: and he vsed meruelouse good maner in coartyng the same faultes.
<pb n="xlviij" facs="tcp:2049:144"/>
Wherfore at the fyrst beginning he withdrewe &amp; auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the army at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ordinance the occasions which stired the soudiours to such slouth, cowardise, and voluptuositie. For he commaunded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great paine that no person shuld be so hardye to sell among the souldiours nother bread nor other vitaile al redy dressed saue the common prouision: that the pages, waterlaggers &amp; scolions shuld not come nere the army nor folowe the same. That none of the commen &amp; sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple souldiors shuld kepe or maintaine seruant nor beast in their tentes nor vyage, while they moued fro place to place. These inconueniences firste of all he redressed &amp; reformed. After these amended, al other fautes he mesu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red bi his wisedome, craft, and pollicie: reforming them by litle and litle. This done (to haue his souldiors occu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pied) he moued daylye from place to place: and that not in waies commen &amp; vsed, but by hard and vnoccupyed waies. He caused them dayly to cast dyches &amp; trenches about the armie, to the intente that they shuld not waxe slouthful nor vicious, by ouermuch reste and ydlenesse. He ordeined ouermuche watch among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery night, and he hym selfe accompanied with his vndercaptains and head officers often serched if the watches were tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly kept co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passing about the army on euery side. While they remoued &amp; chaunged places, sometyme he was in the forward and among the firste, sometime in the rere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward or hinder part, and anone in the middes, ouerse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng their order to the intente that none shuld passe oute of order, aray &amp; place to them assigned.

But when he had made this apointment secretly with the ambassadours deuided in sonder one by one, than openlye that euerye man myght here, he shewed to them all together as his pleasure was that they shoulde certifie theyr kinge Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth concernynge theyr ambassade.</p>
                     <p>¶After this within fewe dayes when he sawe his host moste ready, and contrary to Iugurth he remoued his tentes, and so addressed hym with his armye readye in araye, and wente forwarde into Numidye, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye to any similitude of warre the vyllages and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages were full of menne, the fieldes ful of beastes and tyllmen, and euerye where as muche plentye of people yonge and olde, namelye rude people and tyllers of the grounde, whyche hadde styll fledde before the armye in fore tyme for feare: but at laste when they sawe no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence nor socoure, the kynges liefetenauntes and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lefte theyr townes, villages, and lodges, and went foorthe to meete Metellus wyth all humilitie, honour, and seruice submittynge them selfe to hym, and readye to gyue to him wheat and other corne such as they had. And to cary vitailes after his hooste to ease the souldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to do and parfourme all other thynges what euer they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. But for all this, Metellus was not lesse diligent nor circumspect in ordering of his host
<pb facs="tcp:2049:146"/>
but proceded forward togyder with his army in aray redy in armour, &amp; defended as if theyr enemies had ben nere at hand serchyng the cuntrey abrode on euery syde by his espyes doutynge treason and thynking that all these tokens of subiection were but for a face or cloke to couer the treason and gile of Iugurth. And so by suche dysceyt to wayt a tyme to execute his treason. Wherfore Metellus thus mysdemynge kept himselfe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of the hoost with an elect and chosen company of archers, slyngers, and other lyke soudyours apoynted in lyght harnes. His vnder captayne Caius Marius had rule and charge of the rereward among the horsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and on bothe the wynges of his hoost he ordayned hors<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men and other soudyours for supplement, subsidy, and socours of the forwarde yf nede shulde requyre, and among them to expell their ennemies on what syde so euer they shuld come, wer mengled bowmen and other lyght harnenised fotemen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dartes, pikes, and iauelins to trouble the horsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theyr enemies. For in Iugurth was so muche gile so great experience and knowledge of the countrey, and also so great practyse of chyualrie: that a man coude not well know whether he were more to be douted or more greuous in peace or in ware or whyle he was absent or present.</p>
                     <p>¶ Not farre from that way whiche Metellus helde with his army was a towne of the Numidians muche acustomed and frequented of marchantes of Italy and other strange cuntreis: and the princypal market towne of al the kingdom of Numidi. This towne was named Vacca, Metellus drewe him and his army thyder, and set garnyson into the same towne. This dyd he to proue the inhabytantes: for if they had kept forth the garnison
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:2049:146"/>
than shulde they euydently haue declared themselfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Romayns. And also he ledde a garnyson thyder to thintent to haue taken the towne by force of armes, yf the inhabytauntes wolde not haue admytted the same garnyson. Also he commaunded vytayls, and all other thinges necessary or expedyent to warre for to be brought thyder thinkinge (as the case required) that the concours of marchantes resortyng thyther, and his good prouision of vytayls shulde be great defence and conseruacyon for him &amp; his army bothe in warre and in peace. But whan the citezins sawe such purneyance as he made of vitels considring that he shulde not hurt nor disprouyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whyle he had vttail ynough of his owne prouyson: anon they opened the gates and suffred hym to entre withall his garnyson and retynue. But in the mean tyme Iugurth agayne sende his embassadours to Metellus more diligentlie and instantly than he had done before, mekely beseching &amp; requyring him of peace And yeldynge to him euerye thinge, onely reserued his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren. Metellus sende these embassadours home againe attysed to the prody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their master Iugurth as he had done to the other embassadours which were sent before. But concernyng the peace which they desyred in their maisters name: neyther he graunted nor vtterly denyed it. And in this prolongyng of tyme he loked alway after parfourming of the promesse of the other embassadours, which before had graunted to the betrayeng of Iugurth. But whan Iugurth consydred and pondered togyder the wordes and dedes of Metellus, &amp; whan he parceyued in mynde himselfe assayled with his owne craftes of subtylte: and that Metellus vsed suche craftes againste him, as he
<pb facs="tcp:2049:147"/>
himselfe had vsed agaynst other: than was his mynde greued most of all. For Metellus fayned peace, but in very dede he shewed sharpe warre. Iugurth thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidred also: that his greattest towne named Vacca, was alienate and lost from him: his ennemies by longe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce and exercise knew the coostes of his countrey of Numidy. The myndes of his lordes and commens were prouoked and moued agaynst him. Whan he aduy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed these dyfficulties with other mo contray to hym he concluded and fullye determined at laste to resyste and withstand Metellus in batayl, with strength and force of armes and no farther to meke nor submitte himselfe by peticion.</p>

                     <p>¶ In that parte of Numidi whiche before in deuision of the kingdom was assigned in possessyon to Adherbal was a flodde named Muthull, rennyng from the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyonall parte of the countrey. A certaine hyll and longe was nere to this water, so that at any place the hil was about .xx. myle from the streme and of equall dystance

in length. The grounde of this hil was of suche nature that euer it was barayne, wherfore it was not apte to mennes habitacion but deserte.

The playne bytwene the hils and the water was desert and vnhabitable for lacke of water: saue such places of the playne as were nere to the flodde of Muthul which parte was growen with smal trees, and occupyed with men and beastes.

sayinge fathermore that they shuld fight but with suche as they before had ouercome and subdued. And how be it they had chaunged theyr capytayne: the cowardise of their hertes was not chaunged: Also he rehersed and declared to them that he had made all prouision for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche a captayne might or ought to make for his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He declared howe he had taken for them the vpper place: that they were crafty in batayle and many in nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre: and shulde fyght with a fewe vncrafty cowardes. Wherfore he desyred &amp; exhorted them whan tyme shuld come that than they wolde be redy to assayle the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns manly at sounde of the trumpettes, for that one same day sayd he shuld other establishe al theyr labours victories, and besynesses: or els it shulde be the heed and beginning of their most great mischief, and distruccion.

than bataile, but in beholding more intentifely toward the top of the small hyl afore hym, he espyed among the yonge trees both horses and men which were not fully hyd, because of the lowenes of the trees: yet was he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeine what it might be. For what by secretnes of the place, and what by gyle of Iugurth, theire baners and the most parte of the souldiours were obscured and hyd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyinge downe vpon the ground. But anone after when he perceiued this gyle and treason: by litle and lytle, he set his army in araye proceding forward styl as he dyd before, fayninge hym selfe ignorant of the treason. But he chaunged the order of his souldiours, &amp; on the right winge which was next to the Numidiens his enemies, he ordeyned as it were a forward enforced with a thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold subsidie or socour, that is to saye with thre bendes of proued souldiours to rescue &amp; help them whan nede shulde be. The archers, such as with slynges shuld cast against their enemies plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mets of lead and yron, and al other which were of lyght harnes: all these he deuided amomge the standerdes of other souldiours as the case required: where as after the right ordinaunce of batail, such souldiours by them selfe deuided shulde begin the batayle: but in this bataile the situacion of the place not so required. All the hole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of his horsemen he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the extremities and corners of the fore front of the batayle. This done as the breuitie of the tyme suffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, he made a shorte exhortacion vnto his souldiours, and so proceded forth with his hoost set in a raye in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner beforesaid. But because Iugurth was on the small hyll before hym, and by that meane on the hyer ground he thoughte to remedye that incommoditie, and ledde forth his hooste on the side halfe, not toward Iugurth,

but alonge on the hill to warde the flodde Muthul, into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> playne which was betwene the hyll and the flod. But whan he sawe the Numidiens quyet and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from the hyll whiche they had taken, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidred the hete and feruentnes of the somer season. And lest his army might perishe for lacke or scarcite of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: he sent before one of his capitayns named Rutilius with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of lyght harnessed souldyours &amp; parte of his horsmen vnto the flodde named Muthul for to take vp a place wherin they might set their tentes in tyme of nede: thinking that his ennemies wyllyng to continue longe in that place by often assautes and scyrmishes shuld disturbe the Romayns whyle they resorted to the water. And for asmuche as the Numidiens trusted not much in their strength and armoure. He thought that they purposed and intended to trouble his soldyours with werynes and thirst. Whan Rutilius was gone to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde the water, Metellus descended procedyng forth withal by lytel and lytel as the mater and place requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: he commaunded one named Marius, with his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany to kepe in the rerewarde.

take socour of the same hyll, he shuld be prohibyted and dryuen bacwarde agayne into the handes of Iugurth. This done: sodenly he dyd the trumpetes to be blowne and anone withall, inuaded and set vpon the company of Metellus on euery syde. The Numidyens assayled and bete downe the Romayns, some on the rerewarde and other some dyd their deuoyre to breke the aray on both sydes: both on the ryght and lyft wyng, withall their myght assaylyng the Romanys, and auauncing them selfe on euery syde to breake their araye and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce: &amp; after theyr power to trouble, disturb, &amp; deuide them. The Romayns whyche were moste stable and bolde of mynde in metynge their enemies were abused and deceyued wyth the vncertaine bataile. For their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce and araye was set and strengthed only but on one syde. But their ennemies assayled them on euerye syde: so that somtyme they were striken and wounded of their ennemies from farre of, but by no meanes coulde they strike their enemies againe, nor ioyne wyth them. For Iugurth had taught his Numidia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s on horseback before the bataile, that whan they shuld begyn to assaile the Romains: they shuld not kepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe together, nor nere, but as much dispersed as they coulde, &amp; in diuers places: one company here, and an other ther. And wher the souldiors of Iugurth could not auoyd nor repel the Romains whiche assayled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they were mo in nombre: therfore they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed and trapped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behinde or on the sides beaten of &amp; disioyned from their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. And wher it fortuned any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flee, the Numy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians had more auantage then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romains. For where they fled into the fieldes, they assailed the Romains on the backe halfe or els on both sides in diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies.
<pb facs="tcp:2049:150"/>
But where they sawe it was more auayle and expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to fle agayne to the hyl where they set first their ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. They had also auantage therby for their horses wer acustomed to mountaynes and combred wayes, wherfore they mounted with lesse difficultie, but in con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary wise the Romayns for the sharpnes of the hylles and lacke of vse could not folowe them in their asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding without much difficulte, payne, and paryll. But not withstandyng that Iugurth and his men had the most auantage of the countrey and grounde, yet the batayle on both sides was variable, vngoodly, vncertein &amp; mise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable to behold: for the best men sonest were slayne &amp; in most ieopardy. For the corage &amp; valyant mindes &amp; bold hertes of the Romains: was worth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gyle &amp; treson of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iugurthyns: &amp; so on both sydes he which was bol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dest &amp; most auaunced himselfe was sonest ouerthrowen Some which were deuyded from their owne company and in hande of their ennemies, gaue place to them and yelded themselfe. And agayne some folowed and chased their ennemies fleyng: where they myght make their party good: there resysted eyther partie manly. None of bothe parties kept vnder their standerdes: nor folowed not the order of batayle: nor kept none order nor array, but euery man resysted &amp; defended hymselfe ther where most ieopardy &amp; paril was laied to him: and endeuored himselfe to withstande vyolence of his ennemis with hye valyantise. And so the armour defensyfe, dartes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> horse, Romayns, Numidians, soudyours, and pages were all confounded and mengled together: withoute order or ordinaunce obserued. Nothyng was done with dyscression of the soudyours nor with counsell of the captayns: vnauysed fortune and chaunce gouerned all
<pb n="liiij" facs="tcp:2049:150"/>
the bysynesse of that day: so vnstable was the batayle. All was committed to rule of fortune, and thus passed forth muche, of the day in great murder and slaughter yet styl was the end of the batayle vncertayne and none knewe whyther partye shulde haue the victorye. At last bothe parties with labour and heat began to languyshe and become wery. Metellus vnderstandynge that the Numidians lesse resysted in fyghtyng than they dyd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore assembled and gathered togyder agayne his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours by lytell and lytell, and without tary restored the aray and set them agayne in order. And .iiii. cohorts taken forthe of the legyons he set agaynste the fotemen of his ennemies. But before Metellus had thus assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his company: a great parte of them oppressed with woundes and werynesse, withdrew themselfe to the hyl before named and to the hyer places from the batayle ther to refreshe and rest themself. But whan Metellus (as sayd is) had reasembled them againe: he began in fewe wordes to pray and exhort them in such maner.</p>
                     <p>¶ O worthy and trusty souldyours and companyons dyscourage not your selfe in this batayle, nor lette not your olde noblenesse nowe fayle you? suffre not your ennemies wont to put their trust in flyght, now to ouer come you by your ferefull myndes.

Wherfore dere frendes remembre your olde worshyp. and suffre not the hole empire of Rome to suffre disworshyp by your temerous and cowarde myndes. Remembre it
<pb facs="tcp:2049:151"/>
worthyer to dye in batayl lyke men than to fle, and than to be taken and murdred lyke bestes, or to dye in prison. With these wordes and such lyke Metellus reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted the hertes of his soudyours. But in meane tyme Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth for his part was not ydle, quiet nor lesse prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but compassed and went about his men conforting and exhortyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also and praysng their dedes. He renued the batayle also for his part: and among the myddes of elect soudyours he fought and proued thextremite of euery thynge: &amp; assaid al meanes wherby any auantage might be wonne conforting and socouringe men with wordes, dedes, and exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. He boldly fought and assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led suche of the Romayns as were in fear of dout: and suche as he knew and proued bolde and stedfast, he kept them of with arowes, iauelyns, and dartes that they coude not approche to their felowes to auaunce them nor to be socoured of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus two worthy men noble &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t captains fought &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tended togeder bytwene themselfe. They themselfe lyke in strength, courage, wysdome, and policy: but of things longing to chiualry vnlike of prouision. For Metellus had strength of soudiours sufficiently: but the auantage of the countrey and place was muche contrary to him. But Iugurth had euery thing necessary &amp; expedient, saue company of men of armes whiche he wanted.</p>
                     <p>¶ At last the Romayns wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vnderstode that ther was no sure place wherto they might fle: and also that they coude finde no meanes to fight with their enemies indifferently hande to hande. And that the night was come vpon them: at laste they ascended vpon the toppe of an hill which was ouer against them like as Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus their captayne commaunded them to do. For the

Numidians had lost that place and were fled and spred abrode dispersed, but fewe of them were slayne: for they were swyfte, and the countrey was not well knowen to the Romaines to pursue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherby many of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians were defended: and so by flyght escaped.

<pb facs="tcp:2049:152"/>
he feared lest Rutilius (if he vnderstode therof) wolde leue his place by the flodde: and retourne to the batayle to socour his felowes which were in ieopardy. In this consideracion Bomilchar: where as before he had orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his army nere togyder by craft and that bycause he mystrusted the courage of his men: and in their boldnes had no great confidence. Therfore nowe agayne he deuyded them abrode muche larger than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and so proceded towarde the tentes of Rutilius to thintent to lette hym and his company on euery syde, if they prepared towarde rescous of Metellus. Rutilyus and his company suspectynge no peryll sodaynlie of vnware aduysed great vyolence of smoke and duste styred vp &amp; raysed by mouyng of the ground: but what it mighte be they coulde not parceiue by any meane by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause of the thicknesse of yonge trees that grewe on all the ground bytwen them which letted their sight. First of al they thought it had proceded of drines of grounde by mouyng of the winde. But afterwarde whan they sawe the same smoke and dust continue styll after one maner: &amp; that the same approched alwaye nerer &amp; nerer likewise as the company of their ennemies moued and drewe toward them. Than they parceyued and knewe the mater as it was: and in al hast euery man toke to him his harnesse: and stode redy before the defence of their tentes as their captaine Rutilius had ordred and commaunded them euery man redy at defence and in aray. After whan their enemies approched nerer with an horryble noise and cry, they ranne togidre on bothe parties. The Numidiens did but onely continue the skirmishe abidinge and loking after their eliphantes in helpe of whom was al their trust. But whan they sawe
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:2049:152"/>
that their eliphantes wer stopped and lette with thycke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse of the bowes of the trees: and so taried and kept from their socours by the compassing of the Romayns so that in them was no trust of socours. Than all they toke them to flight with all their power. But many of them (leuing their armour behinde them) escaped with out wounde by helpe of the hylls which were about the place: which they coude better and quicklier ascend than the Romains. And also by socour of the darknes of the night (which than was at hande) many of them escaped hole and sounde and saued themselfe. Foure of the ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes were taken and all the remenaunt (fourty in nombre) were slain. Whan this was done: the company of Rutilius, notwithstandinge that they were fatigate and weried with great iourneis before, and also with muche labour in ordering of their tentes: and with the sayd bataile or skyrmyshe: neuertheles whan they sawe that Metellus their chiefe captaine taried longer than they thought he wolde haue done, if all thyng had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened well wyth hym, they ordred them selfe redy &amp; dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygently went backeward againe to mete hym. For the falsehode and gyle of Iugurth and of the Numidians caused them to be busye, diligent, and circumspect in eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie thyng for sauegard of their lyues, and suffered them to do nothing slowely nor with delaying. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were in their iourney in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> darkenes of the night the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies on bothe parties were not far in sunder the one from the other: &amp; bothe parties approched together not knowing eche other as if they had ben ennemies. The one against the other makyng noyse and clamour eche one increasing feare to other as warriours are wont to do at beginning of batail. In somuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a miserable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

and murdre had almost ben co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted bytwen them by their imprudent negligence, if the espyes and horsmen which were sent bytwene them on bothe sydes had not with more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; wyselyer espied the treuth of the mater. But whan the parties knewe eche other, their sadnes and feare tourned to great ioye and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The souldyours ioifully anone met together one saluting and welcoming other. One shewed to other their actes done on bothe parties: and ioyous they were to here on both sides euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending and exalting their own dedes, and also the dedes of other vnto heuen with mirthe and gladnesse. And that aswell suche as were worthy men as vnworthy cowardis ascribed to themselfe worthynesse. And certes in suche businesse it often happeneth, that on that side whiche hath victorie: such as be but cowards, rude and vncrafty, exalteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enioyeth, and may bost themself on other mennes dedes and worthynesse. But in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wyse on that partie whiche is ouercom though many be good warryours, noble and worthy men: yet ar they reputed for cowards without policye, bycause of other mens cowardyse and aduersite of fortune. Thus farethe it in skirmisshes of bataile. But whan Metellus and Rutilius (as I haue said before) wer met together &amp; rehersed their actes one to other Metellus hasted him with all his army to the flodde of Muthull, and taried in the places and tentes which Rutilius had prepared and soiourned there the space of foure daies. In this season he was besy in refreshing and healing his souldyours whiche were wounded, suche as manly had behaued themselfe in the bataile he worthely rewarded them, he called them togyder al into one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany &amp; greatly lauded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

Whether he kepte hym with a smal company, or whether he hadde an army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assembled for a newe batayle, and how he behaued him selfe, and where about he went sythe he was ouercome. But Iugurth had conuaied him selfe into suche places as were ful of dyches, valeis, hylles, trees, bushes, and dales defended of nature. And there had he assembled a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayne a newe armie of men mo in numbre than he had before. But they were but vncrafty, inexpert, and dul to bataile: and could better tyll the ground and kepe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, then exercise the dedes of chiualrie. For therto had they neuer ben vsed before: but in the other seruyle oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupacions and businesses had they ben occupied al their lyfe tyme without intermixtion of other occupacion. It fortuned that Iugurth had non other souldiors but suche rurall people aboute hym at thys tyme, namelye for this cause. For whan he fled from the bataile fough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten before with Metellus, none of all his souldiors fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hym, except the horsemen of his gard. For al the other souldiors departed where it lyked them best. Nor this is not counted nor reputed for any fault or rebuke among the Numidian souldiours.

And whan Metellus sawe that Iugurth renewed the warre againe, and prepared a new bataile: which could not be done but at the pleasure of Iugurthe, bicause he had taken suche a place to abyde in that no man coulde conueniently contende with hym for difficultie thereof.

This determined: Metellus with his hole host and ordinaunce went forth into the moste ryche and plentefull places of all Numidye, and there wasted and destroied the fieldes and contrey on euerye side.

This besinesse troubled the mind of Iugurth muche more than the bataile that was foughten before to his great damage and disconfort of his men. For he lost more people by this way than by any other meane before. Thus Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth whiche before put all his hope and trust in his flyght: was nowe of necessite compelled to folowe and pursue his ennemies: and he whiche could not defende his owne places whiche styll remianed in his possession was constrained nowe to warre in those coostes, which Metellus had wonne of him to recouer them if fortune wolde suffre him.

The Romaines immediately assayled the towne on euery side with horrible noyse &amp; clamour. The Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians therof were not a dradde at all, but stode styll and kept them selfe in silence as if they had not ben dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased nor prouoked to batayle: howe be it they kepte the walles euery man on the part to hym assigned, and all were ready to resyste and to assayle the Romaynes. Anone the batayle was begon. The Romaines exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and occupied them selfe euery man with such wepin as he coulde beste handle, and was most expert in: some with slinges threw plummets of lead, and some stones from a farre into the citie, and at them which defended the walles: some assayled the towne nerer inuading the same, and couetyng to haue entrey and vnderminynge the walles: some boldely scaled the walles, desiringe to come so nere that they myght fyght hande to hand. On the other side thinhabitantes of the towne and garny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son resisted manly. Some rowled downe and ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great and waighty stones on such as were nerest to them and that vndermined the walles. Some pytched downe vpon them dartes, iauelins, pykes, firebrandes and also greate burnyng polles, faggots, and blockes ouercouered with pytche and brimstone ardentlye fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng. Some boldely ouerturned the scalyng ladders, and slewe and ouerthrewe suche as scaled the walles. But some other whiche were farther from the towne, &amp; for prease coulde not approche nere to the walles in the meane season were nother fearefull nor ydle. For there was no maner instrumente of batayle which coulde be throwen wyth hand, or with any other engine of batail

but that they threwe it into the towne, wherewith they wounded and slewe many of the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and of the defenders of the walles. The dartes &amp; crossebowes on both parties were not vnoccupied. Artyllery nor go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes had thei none.

But in the meane season Iugurth perceyued many of the ke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pers of the tentes fallen into dyches that were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the same for defence: so that for haste to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye they hurte them selfe more then he dyd.

Bomilchar alleged also to him that he had proued the strength of his souldyors and fauour of fortune sufficiently ynough, wherfore it were better for him to se some remedy and prouision for all these ylles and other mo, and to be ware lest whyle he prolonged the tyme douted: the people of the contrey shuld prouide for themselfe without his aduise or counsell. With these wordes and other lyke Bomilchar induced the kynges mynde to make some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posicion, or els to yeld him selfe and al other thinges to mercy &amp; grace of the Romains. Anone embassadours were send to Metellus to certify him that Iugurth was redy to do what euer he wolde desyre or commaunde him: and that he wolde commyt and yelde both himselfe and his kingdome to the fayth and grace of Metellus: and of the Romayns without any pactyon, conuenaunt, or exception: sauing onely as it pleased them to deale with him. Metellus heryng of this mynd of Iugurth was very glad: &amp; commaunded all the most wyse, noble, and worthy men of his army
<pb facs="tcp:2049:164"/>
a none to be called together vnto him from their wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring places. Whan they were come tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toke he counsel of them and of other such as he knewe wysest and most discrete touchynge the embassade of Iugurth. Anone it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded &amp; decreed among the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel and declared to the embassadours (acordinge to the olde custome of Rome) that they shuld commaunde Iugurth to sende to Metellus and the Romains two hundred thousande pound weyght of syluer: al his elypha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes which he ocu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyed in war: &amp; a certayne quantite of armour &amp; a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of his chife horses. Al these things were fulfilled &amp; done of Iugurth without any tary or delay. Wherfore anone after Metellus commaunded agayne that al they whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che had betrayed his host, forsaken hym and fled to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth shuld be bounden and so brought to him againe. The most part of them wer brought as he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded but a fewe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they herde first of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posicion (fering the same mater) fled vnto Bocchus kynge of the Moryens.</p>
                     <p>¶ Whan Iugurthe after this maner was bereft of his armour of his horse, of his men, &amp; also of his treasour. Anone after he was called by Metellus to come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towne called Tysidium there to here what farthermore shuld be commaunded to him: and to yelde hymselfe to thempire of Rome acordynge to his embassade. But he began than to change and to tourne his mynde agayne dredyng for the knoleging of his cruell dedes that he shulde neuer escape condigne punyshement if he were ones in the Romains handes. Thus he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued many dayes in douting what was best to be done Somtyme he volued in mynd rather to subdue hymselfe to any dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficultie &amp; to byde all paines than to begyne war agayn:
<pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:2049:164"/>
considerynge the aduerse and vnhappy fortune whyche he hadde before. Sometyme agayne he called to mynd howe greuous a fall it shoulde be to descende frome a kyngedome into subieccion and bondage. But at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion whan in vaine and to none effecte he hadde loste suche greate ordinaunce and helpe of warre as he had lately deliuered to Metellus, as a volage brained man he fullye determined agayne to begynne and continue the warre wyth Metellus, rather then to yelde hym selfe to deathe or captiuitie.</p>
                     <p>¶But duringe this season at Rome was a counsell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Senatours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning thassignement of rule &amp; gouernauce of the prouinces belonging to the empire in which counsel it was decreed that the contrey &amp; war of Numidy shuld be committed to Metellus by proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion of hys authoritie for another yere more.</p>

A costome da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble was amonge the people at those dayes, whan they slew any beast in sacrifice, to loke within the intranes &amp; bowels of the same beast so sacrifised: where was shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed vnto them diuers tokens whither they shoulde haue
<pb facs="tcp:2049:165"/>
any hope to bringe that mater to effect: for which they sacrifised or els not. And often times the wicked spirites to cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perseuer in their ydolatry: &amp; to gyue crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to that blind errour shewed many toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to them in such maner sacrifice: which toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they often found true. But now to my purpose. The preest of the ydolles whiche sacrifysed for Marius shewed great and marueylous toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto him: wherby he might greatly trust to come to his intent and purpose, byddyng him prosecute that thing on whiche he had sette his mynde: and haue sure confidence in his goddes. Sayng that if he wold proue the extremite of fortune dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly and often: than dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse euery thing prosperously shuld happen to him. But Maryus afore that tyme a longe season wonderouslye desyred in his minde the dignite of the consull. And to say trueth he wanted nothing which longed to him whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che shulde haue suche a dignite saue onely antiquite of his progeny &amp; auncient noblenes of birth. For thoughe he were but a gentyl man of the first heed: neuertheles his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions were worthy and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. In him was great experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of wisdome, much probite, honestie, and sadnesse. He had greate polycy and conning in chyualry: in batayle his mynde was excellent and bolde. But in peace it was lowe and moderate. He ouercame couetise and sensualite of his body. He desyred nor coueyted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing erthly saue glorie, lande, and worshyp. This Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius was borne and brought vp by all his chyldhode in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Champayne beionde Fraunce in a towne named Arpine. But assone as he was encreased, so that he might bere harnesse and bide the herdnes of warfare he concluded to lyue on the wages of chyualrie. And in that study he exarcysed hymselfe: and not in eloquence
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:2049:165"/>
of greke langage or in other study or science: nor yet in the superfluous aparayle nor carnall lustes of citezins vnto whiche he neuer subdued his body. And thus was he indued with good maners: and excercysed amonge honest ocupacions and so continued that his hole and vndefyled wytte shortly encreased and exalted himselfe growyng to honour &amp; vertu. First whan this Marius desyred of the commenty of Rome to haue an office: that is to say, to be ordained protectour of the souldyours: many of the citezins knewe not his persone: bycause he was alway from the citie in warre and batayle: but his actes made his name wel knowen. Wherfore after that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentye vnderstode that he was Marius of whose nobles al Italy much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned and talked: anone they graunted his peticion, and proclaimed hym protectour of the souldyours ouer all the prouinces and tribes of Italy. In that maistership and office he behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so well and wisely that after that he obtained an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther office of more worship and authorite: and after that againe an other of hyer dignite. And shortly to speke: in euery office and dignite he so behaued himselfe that eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry man thought &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him worthyer of more dignite and honour than he had. How beit for al these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions as honorable as he was: he durst neuer before desyre thoffice of consull of Rome tyll this tyme whan he had suche comfort by his sacrifice. But whan he was thus warned and put in hope and confort, euer after he was hedlyng enclined to ambicion &amp; couetise of that dignite.</p>
                     <p>¶ At this season the commenty of Rome had all other offices amonge them or at their gyfte and dystribucion But the estates and noble men kept among them and in their handes the consulship yerely one succedyng o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:2049:166"/>
by election. So that of the commenty was none so noble nor excellent of dedes, but that was reputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that dignite, and as who saithe vyle and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted. But whan Marius sawe and consydred that the wordes and counsel of the enchauntour and preest whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he helde his sacrifice pretended to the same poynte and conclusion as the desyre of his mynde moued him longe before. Anone he came to his captiaine Metellus besechyng hym to be dyscharged of the batayle tyll he mighte go to Rome to thintente to desyre the consulship of the Senatours. But how beit that in his Metellus was vertu, glorye, worship, and al other things longing to a good man plentifully ynough. Neuerthelesse of his courage and mynde was he so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>what proude, despisinge and dysdaynyng other: which were not come of so hye lynage as he was. But speciallye he was statelye and proude of minde: which is a commen vyce and mischefe amonge estates and gentylmen. Wherfore Metellus hering this interprise of Marius, first of al was moued with the nouelty of his peticion. For at that tyme were none wonte to speke for that dignite, but if they were come of a noble stocke. And so was not Marius. And thus Metellus marueyled much at his enterpryse: and who might counsel him therto: warninge him as vnder colour of amyte and frendshyppe, not to presume vpon so contrary and vnlikely a thyng: nor to exalt his mynd so hy aboue fortune co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for his state and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion Sayng also to hym that euery thing was not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyted or desired of euery man. And that it became him wel by reason to be contented, pleased and satisfied with that honoure which he had and that was his owne, and not to desyre thyngs vnmete for his degre. And finally
<pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:2049:166"/>
he exhorted and counselled hym to beware to desyre the thynge of the Romayns whyche lawfullye myghte be denyed vnto hym, considerynge and hauyng regarde to hys lynage and auncestrie.</p>
                     <p>¶After Metellus had counseiled Marius wyth these wordes and other lyke, and that he could not turne nor apease hys mynde, he answered hym at last, that assone as he could conuenyently (not lettynge the busynesse of of the commen weale) he wold graunt his desyre and pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticion. But after this when Marius desired the same discharge importunely and often: he made hym answer saying that he shuld not make so gret hast to Rome for that purpose, for he shulde come tymely ynoughe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that dignitie acompanied with the sonne of the same Metellus, which sonne shuld also go to Rome in tyme to come to demaunde of the Senatours the same dignitie wyth Marius. This sonne of Metellus was at that tyme in the armye of hys father, continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising the feates of warre, notwythstandinge that he was but twenty yeres of age. Thys answer of Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus stirred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marius against him with greuous yre and wrath, what for the honour which he desired, and what for the lycence to departe, whyche he could not obtayne of hym by no prayer nor requeste at hys pleasure. In so muche that he enraged agaynste Metellus moued by desyre of that office, and prouoked by yre, whyche two vyces ambicion and yre, counselled and impelled thys Marius to muche euyll agaynste the sayde Metellus, sparyng neyther worde nor deede whiche myght enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or hynder hym, hys honour and name. And that myght helpe or auaunce hym selfe by ambicion to come to the dygnitie whyche he desyred.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:2049:167"/>He gouerned the souldiours which passed forth the win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter vnder his gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not as he ought to do, but suffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red them to haue their pleasure to the intente thereby to optaine their fauoure and good wyll in his enterpryse. Also he spake often in blaming Metellus, and proudly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending and exalting him selfe to the marchantes of Rome: of whom was great resorte and concours to the sayd citye of Vtica where Marius soiourned. And ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes he boasted saying to them, that if the one halfe of the armye were graunted and committed to hym with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fewe dayes he woulde so behaue hym selfe that he wolde haue Iugurthe in bondes and subieccion. Fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore he sayde to them in auauncinge him selfe that Metellus prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the bataile for the nonce, for a craft because he was a man pompous and desirous of glory and worshyp, vtterly reioysing in authoritie and geuen to pryde and affeccion of dygnitie: and because he knew well that whyle the batayle continued he shulde be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in maner as a kyng, therfore he dyd hys deuoyre the more to prolonge the warre to the ende that in the meane tyme he myghte exalte and magnifie hym selfe. The wordes of Marius semed to the sayd marchantes certayne and trewe, and also as they thoughte (by suche informacion) moste expediente to the common weale that some newe captayne were chosen, whiche shortely wolde fynyshe that warre. For by longe continuance of the same warre: many of the sayde marchauntes hadde wasted and spente muche of their sayde substaunce and rychesse. And also to suche desyrefull myndes as they had, nothing could to faste be hasted or brought to end.</p>
                     <p>¶Moreouer at thys season was in companye of the Romayne armye a certeine Numidian named Gauda,
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:2049:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whiche was sonne of Manastaball, and neuewe vnto Massinissa. Micipsa in his testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ordeined that this Gauda shuld be second heire of Numidi after the death of his two sonnes and of Iugurthe. This Gauda was sore enfebled wyth diseases and sickenes, and for that cause his mynd was a lytle endulled and priuate of rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son and memorie. While this Gauda (as sayd is) was in the Romains army: he required of Metellus to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hym to haue his seate and siege next vnto hym after the vse of kynges of Numidye. Also after that because of defence and garde of his body: he desired that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of souldiours of the Romayns myght be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and assigned to hym. But Metellus extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed both his peticions, saying for the firste, that suche honour longed only to them whom the Romaines toke and named for kynges. And also for the second peticion he sayd that it were vnaduised and iniurious ordinance if the Romaine souldiours were geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or assigned to the garde and seruice of a Numidian, which was no kyng but a souldiour lyke many mo hyred for stipend. Whyle Gauda was displeased and angry wyth Metellus for denying of these his peticions: Marius came to hym, and prouoked hym to reuenge the displeasure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurye whiche the captayne hadde done to hym with hys helpe and auauncement. This Gauda (as I haue sayd before) was feble and vnstable minde, and the mannes wytte was of lytle valour by meanes of diseases why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che long hadde holden hym. Wherefore Marius wyth hys elegante, fayre and flatteryng wordes at his owne pleasure induced hym, and exalted hys mynde sayinge that he was a kynge, and an excellente and great man: and also neuewe to the worthy and noble kyng Massi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa.
<pb facs="tcp:2049:168"/>
Wherfore (sayd he) yf Iugurth wer eyther slayne or taken prisoner it were lickely to come to that poynt: that the kyngdome of Numidi shulde be assigned and commytted to him of the Senatours without any tary or resystence: whiche thynge shulde shortely be brought to passe yf Marius himselfe were creat consull in place of Metellus, and than assigned to execute &amp; finyshe the warre with Iugurth. Vnder this maner Marius cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled and induced bothe the said Gauda, the Romayne knyghtes, the commen souldyours, and also the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes and occupyers whiche were in the towne at that season with many other who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he impelled with his wordes so: that some of them for loue whiche they had to Marius: And other some for great hope and desyre whiche they had to haue peace and concorde wrote to Rome to their to kynsmen and frendes of the bataile of Numidy and that very sharpely agaynst Metellus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syring and beseching them to labour at Rome with all their myght y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Marius might be elect consul &amp; assigned to erecte the warre of Numidi. And thus at Rome was the consulshyp desyred by many men with great fauour and very honest peticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for Marius. Also at that tyme had the said Marius this auauntage. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentie at that season deposed many of the states: and exalted suche as were newe gentelmen after the lawe of one na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med Manlius whiche before had ben protectour of the commentie. This Manlius ordeyned &amp; inacted a lawe that if any thing were vngoodly done and against right of the states beynge in any office or dignitie: than he whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che so had done shuld be deposed of his office: and in his place some newe gentyll or actyue man of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentie sette and deputed and so exalted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:2049:168"/>This lawe in those daies was kepte in effecte and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at Rome: wherfore euery thynge proceded prospe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rousely to the purpose and profite of Marius. For (as I haue saide before) in hym was no noblenesse of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lynage nor byrthe.</p>

So that he spared no pollicye to make them render them selfe againe to hym. In suche holdes &amp; townes as were in his possession: he set garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and defence of men of war. He renewed &amp; bought a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayne armour and wepen, &amp; set al other thinges which he had lost before, or deliuered to Metellus in hoope of peace.

But among al other thinhabitantes of the citie called Vacca (in which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus at beginning had set his garniso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whan Jugurth first sought his peace of Metellus) were desired often of Jugurthe and with great and importune instance exited to treason. In somuche that at last they assented to him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spire against the Romains. Thinhabitants of the cite dyd not yelde themselfe from Iugurth with their owne good wyll: and namely thestates and rulers therof did neuer yelde them to Metellus saue fainedly. Wherfore specially they were the firste that conspired against him secretely amonge themselfe. For why as it often happened the commentie, and speciallye of the Numidiens were vnstable of minde, vtterly enclined to sedicion and discorde couetous of newe thinges: and contrary to rest and quyetnesse. But (as I haue said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) whan the chife of this cite had secretly concluded &amp; apointed their mater &amp; treason among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe: against the third day they ordeined that the same thyrd day next after shuld be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded solemne, holy, and worshipped ouer all the countrey of Affrike, and Numidie.

All the Numidiens at a token geuen, and at one houre apointed before, slewe eche one his geest whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che dined with him without fauoure: so that among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all escaped not one, except the sayd Turpilius heed capi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine or lieutenant of the towne.

For though they were ignorant of the counsell of this dede: yet the noyse or skirmyshe and nouelty of the matter pleased them ynough. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main souldyours were ignorant and incertaine of the vnprouided feare and cruel murder douting what was best to be done. Their enemies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pasinge them on euery side letted them to go to the castell of the towne where their armour and wepyn was: &amp; the gates of the towne were shut on euery syde before this skirmishe beganne, wherby they wer prohibyted to auoyd the towne. More<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouer women &amp; children threw downe vpon them stones and other thinges that came next to hand from the win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dows &amp; hiest parts of their houses: striuing who might throw first and most. Thus this doutful &amp; vnprouided

Thus both good and yll worthy, and vnworthy, strong, and feble: wer all slayne without difference. In this so great ieopardy: the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiens being mad and cruell in murdre, and the gates shutte on euery syde: of all the Romayns, or Italyens: onely Turpilius the captayne escaped without hurt of his bodye. Whyther it so happed by the fauoure of his host which called him to banket: or by some apointment of treason: or els by some other chance: it was not know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne for certayn. But this was knowen that euer after as long as he lyued he was reputed for a vile &amp; a wretched cowarde and without credence: bycause that in so gerat losse and mischief he counted it better to escape: and after to lyue, and dye in shame and rebuke: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manly to haue died in defence of the towne.

Somtyme he addressed hym towarde his enemies: and anone after returned into wodes &amp; wildernesses.

Many of them were treene vessell which he had done to be gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the villages of the Numidiens. Farthermore he commaunded thinhabitantes of those marches whiche after the flight of Iugurth had yelded them to him that they shulde make them redy to folowe the hoost euery man with asmuche water as they myght beare. And assigned them a daye and place, where they shulde be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy vnder payne of deathe.

And so went towarde Thala, his hoost set in order and aray: so that if any ieopardy apered he was euer redy at defence but afterwarde whan he was come to that place where he had apoynted the Numidiens to mete him with the
<pb n="lxxviii" facs="tcp:2049:175"/>
water wherwith they were laded and folowed the host. And whan his tentes were pitched, set, and defended a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout with tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, cut tres, bowes and stakes after the polycie of warre, sodeinlye from the heauen descended greate violence and plentie of rayne water that it was more than sufficient to all the armye, as well to men as beastes. Moreouer their vitayles were more plentefull then they trusted or looked after. For the Numidians which newly were yelded, were so much the more serui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sable &amp; redy to minister euery thyng necessary to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And no maruell: for euery thyng is quicke at the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginnyng, which often fadeth at the ende. But the souldi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ours and men of warre, were more glad to occupye the rayne water for deuocion, than suche water which was brought to them in vessels by cariage. For thei supposed that their goddes loued and fauored them, whiche in so drye a countrey, and in suche a chaunce sente to them so greate plentie of water besyde prouision of theire cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. This thynge greatlye conforted the myndes of them all: and incouraged them with boldenesse, stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthe, and dilygence to ouercome all difficulties whyche remayned. Thys conforte kyndelynge theyr myndes: they sped them selfe so forward, that on the nexte daye after they came to the towne of Thala, contrary vnto the opinion or knoweledge of Iugurthe. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauntes whiche thought them selfe surelye defended by the sharpenesse and difficultie of the place, were sodein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abashed and astonied for that great vnwonte and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prouided case. Neuertheles they made prouision to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail as quickly as they might by sufferance of the time. The Romains addressed them in the same maner. But kyng Iugurth anone cast in his mynde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to Metellus
<pb facs="tcp:2049:176"/>
was nothing vnprouided nor vnable to be done: as he that by his craft, diligence, &amp; polycie: had ouercome both wepen, armour, place, and tyme. And also nature it selfe which ruleth other thinges longing vnto men. Iugurth this aduysing and reuoluyng in his mynde fled priuely by nyght forthe of the towne with his children and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great part of his treasour. Nor after this tyme he neuer taryed in one place paste the space of a daye or of a night fayning that he fled so fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place to an other bycause of his present besynesse: but the ryght cause of his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng was for that he feared treason whiche he thought best to auoyd and eschue by continuall chaungyng of places. For suche counsels of treason can not be taken without deliberacion &amp; proces of tyme, and conueniens or oportunyte of places where princes dothe longe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne and continue.</p>
                     <p>¶ But whan Metellus sawe that thinhabitantes wer redy to batayle, and also that the towne was strongly defended bothe by crafte of mannes handes and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the place. Anone he compased aboute the towne on euery syde with profounde dychesse, trenches, and herdels: of sharpe stakes the poyntes vpwarde to then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that none of thinhabitantes shulde breke out nor escape by night, as Iugurth had done before: nor that no vitels shulde be conuayed into them, wherby they might the longar resyst hym and indure the sege. After warde he commaunded scaffoldes to be made about the walles specially in such places as were most conuenient and penteses of sheldes conioyned in maner of vynes to be driuen to the walles vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wheles. And about the sayd scaffoldes to be cast a hepe of grauell and stones: and toures of tymbre and bulwarkes set vpon them and: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:2049:176"/>
souldiors he assigned to defend the worke, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also that laboured there vpon. These scaffoldes, penty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and pauasies were made to thenteut that vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romayns myghte vndermine the walles withoute great peryll or dammage. On the other syde, the garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and inhabitantes hastely labored to resiste the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and to defende them selfe and their towne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. So that on both parties was nothing forgotten, able to be done touchinge their defence. But briefely to speke, the Romains weried with much labour and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle .xl. daies after they were come thither, at last wan the towne. But all the pray &amp; ryches of the towne was destroyed by them which were within the towne in gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nison of the Romayns which had fled from Metellus to Iugurth: whiche speciallye had assigned them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the towne. These traytours whan they sawe the walles vndermined and brused with diuerse ingens of batayle: &amp; their fortune was brought to extremite: and no socours nor hope remayned. Than they assembled and caried together all the treasour and ryches of the towne, as golde, syluer, with other precious ornaments or iewels into the palays of Iugurth, and there fylled themselfe with wine and other delycate meates. And at conclusion whan they were full saturate and ingorged: they set fyre on the palaice and wylfully brente and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the ryches, the palayce, and them selfe wythall. So that suche punyshemente as they dreeded to suffer of theyr ennemyes, they voluntarely suffered the same wyth their owne handes to auoyde the subieccion and daunger of their ennemies, by desperate folye and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous madnesse.</p>

                     <p>¶ What tyme the Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ses had in possession and wer lordes ouer the moost part of Affryke: at the same season the Cirenenses also were great and famous of name: and abundant of welth &amp; riches. Than betwene the costes of these two cities was a great and large feld all ouer spred with sande without diuision, perticion, or difference. But bytwene them was neyther flod nor mountayne, whiche myght discerne the boundes and marches of bothe their coostes: whiche thyng caused co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall and longe warre often and great batayls by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene bothe parties. But after that manye armies on
<pb n="lxxxj" facs="tcp:2049:177"/>
both sydes were ouercome, slayne, or put to flight bothe by land &amp; by sea: and whan bothe people had somewhat wasted the one the other by spoylyng and murder: than began they to perceiue their owne foly on both partes, fearing lest some other nacion anone after shuld assaile them, both the ouercommers, and them that were ouer come, when they were wasted and weried wyth batails and brought to extremitie. Wherfore this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidred, they toke truce bytwene them both, and to auoide that longe variaunce betwene them: they made agremente and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant that messengers or embassadours of bothe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shulde depart out of their cities at one certaine day and houre assigned. And that same place wher the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of both the cities shuld meete together, shuld be for euer after taken for the bowndes &amp; marches of the contrey, of both the nacions and cities without more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tencion or variance. To bryng this apointment to effect and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, forth of the citie of Cyren were chosen .ij. for their parte and send forth at the daye and houre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And in lykewyse out of Charthage were sende two brethern named Phelen, which swyftely sped them in their iourney. But the Cirenenses wente much more slowely, whether it so fortuned by negligence or chaunce I know but lytle the truth. But this is knowen for cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne, that aboute those costes tempeste of wynd &amp; we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is wonte to let men and prolonge their iourney in lykewyse as vpon the sea, and that for this cause. For whan by those euen places wyde and bare without any thyng growyng on them: the wynd ryseth and styrreth the small sand from the ground, the same sande moued by greate violence of the wynde is wonte to fyll the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, mouthes and eyes of such as passe that waye with
<pb facs="tcp:2049:178"/>
dust and sande. And thus often by lettyng of their sight their iournay is prolonged &amp; hyndred. But after whan the Cyrenenses sawe themselfe some what ouer slowe and late in their iourney: they fered punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at their retournynge home for their neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And blamynge they accused the Carthaginenses obiectyng and saying that they had come forth of their citye before the tyme assigned: and thus they troubled al the mater and brake the ordynance. But shortly to speke these Cirenenses concluded rather to suffre death and to do any thynge possible than to retourne home again ouercome. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Carthaginenses desired some other condicion or apointment to be made indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and equal bytwene both the parties. The Cirenenses consented therto and put the Carthaginenses in choyse whyther they wolde be quicke buryed in that same place whiche they desired for their marches &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: or els that the Cirenenses vnder the same condicion shuld procede forward to that place whiche they desyred for their marches and there to be quicke buryed vnder the same maner. The .ii. bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne both named Phelene alowed and graunted the condicion subduyng and abandonyng their bodyes to death for the profet and wele of their contrey and cite of Carthage: and so were they buryed quicke. Wherfore the Carthaginenses in the same place where they were buryed raysed and halowed .ii. auters in worshyp and remembrance of these two brethern whiche set more by encrese of their contrey: than by their owne liues. These auters to this present day be called the Phylene auters after the name of the .ii. brethern named Phylenis ther vnder buryed, as sayd is for wele of their contrey. Also besyde this memorial within the cite of Carthage were

                     <p>¶ Moreouer he prouoked to hys fauour &amp; feloweshyp by great rewardes and much greater promises such as wer most nere frindes to Bocchus kyng of the Mauri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ens, by whose help he hym selfe went to kyng Bocchus &amp; desired hym in his quarel with hym to warre ageinst the Romains. To which request of Iugurth Bocchus
<pb facs="tcp:2049:179"/>
agreed so much the more for as muche as at the first be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginninge of the same warre, this Bocchus sente vnto Rome embassadours to desire of the Romains amitie, and a bond of continuall peace betwene him and them. But notwithstanding that this peticion and peace was muche expedient and necessary to the Romains for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse consideracions, and namely because of this war. Not the lesse it was not graunted by me me of a fewe such as at Rome blynded with auarice, wer wont to sel for money euery thinge both honest &amp; dishonest. Also be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this time the doughter of Iugurth was spoused to the sayd Bocchus. But this bond of friendshyp or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie amonge the Numidiens &amp; Mauriens, is reputed but of lytel or none effecte, because they are wont euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue diuers &amp; mani wiues according to their sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance &amp; riches. Some .x. and some mo, after as they ar of abilitie or power to meinteine. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges, because they are of most power &amp; substance, therfore they haue mo than other. Thus is their mynd &amp; fauour distracte and diuersly deuided from all their wiues for the multi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and because they haue so many that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue none for their speciall bedfelow. Wherfore they al ar reputed vyle &amp; litle set by after one maner. Thus the affinitie betwene these .ij. kinges, Iugurth &amp; Bocchus, was lytle set by and smal auayled in this busines. Not withstanding both they and their hostes came together in one place apointed therto: wher after they had geuen and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith &amp; truth one to other of fidelitie to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

So that for the same cause al kyngdoms to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were aduerse &amp; contrary, &amp; that he hym selfe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was enemy for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same cause. And not long before that tyme the Carthaginenses, &amp; afterward Perses kyng of Macedony were subdued and vndone by the Romains without any iust tytle or cause of bataile, saue only am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicion and enuy which the Romaines had against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that in tyme to come euerye nacion whiche shulde haue welth and riches shuld become enemies to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mains for their inordinate pride &amp; insaciable couetise.</p>
                     <p>¶Wyth these wordes and other lyke, Iugurth moued the mynde of Bocchus agaynste the Romaynes. In so muche that anone a daye was appointed betwene both the kynges to procede forthe together to the towne of Cyrtha, and to assayle the same wyth bothe their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers conioyned. Thys towne they purposed firste of all to besiege, because Metellus had lefte within the same towne prayes and prisoners whiche he hadde taken of Iugurth. And also muche of his owne ordinaunce had he lefte there to auoyde impedimente in his voyage. Thus Iugurth thoughte mooste expediente to do: For if he myght wynne the towne by assaulte before the res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous of Metellus, he thoughte that shulde be moste to hys honour and profite.

For warre may be begon of a cowarde or of any other wretch: but it can not be left of againe, nor ceassed but whan it pleaseth him which is strongest and is maister hauynge the vpper hand. And finally he had him better to prouide for himselfe and for his kingdom than he began to do: and not to adioyne nor myngle his goodes, treasour, and fortune: which were in estate roy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all florishyng with the goodes and fortune of Iugurth whiche were lost and distroyed to the vttermost. The embassadours of Metellus came to king Bocchus and shewed him their capitains wyl: as is said before vnder suche sentence. To the whiche wordes of Metellus Bocchus answered againe benignely &amp; mekely ynough sayng that he desyred nothyng more than peace: saue, that he had pyte and compassion of the aduers and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable fortune of Iugurth, but if the same Iugurth might be suffred also to haue frendship and amyte with the Romains and forgiuenesse: than said Bocchus that he wolde gladly agre to euery thynge desyred of Metel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lus, and euery thyng shulde be accorded bytwene them. The capitayne Metellus heryng this answere of Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus agayne sent messangers to him replyeng against his requestes and sayenge that some of his peticions
<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:2049:181"/>
were agaynst iustice and reason: also Metellus by these embassadours desired many other thinges of Bocchus of whom Bocchus graunted &amp; alowed some, and other some of them he denyed. After this maner the tyme ouerpassed and proceded forth, massangers often going and commyng bytwene them bothe: so that by such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the warre and batayle remayned vntouched and depended not medled with: as Metellus dyd greatly coueyt and desyre in mynde bycause he wolde kepe sure that laude whiche he had wonne: and also for that to his owne paryll and dammage he wold not auantage nor auance Marius: in a thinge which to him belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged.</p>

He demaunded of the senatours &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mens new supplement of soudyors to repare and restore the army whiche was in Numidy with Metellus.

Treuth it is: that ye haue commaunded me to warre agaynst Iugurth: whiche thing these noble men taketh very greuously. I require you consyder and dyscus in your myndes and in your inwarde consideracion ponder ye: whyther it be better, more necessary and expedient to chanuge the same your commaundement agayne: and to sende forth some other of that sort of auncient gentil men vnto this besynesse agaynst Iugurth or els to any other lyke. Send forth a noble man of old auncetry: in honour &amp; remembrance of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many ymages may be made and erecte or set vp on hye.

And also worthye citizens, I knowe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of these noble menne so farre oute of order, that whan they haue ben made consuls, then haue they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them selfe to readynge of actes of theyr elders and predecessours: and of the grekes preceptes of chiualrie: which doutles may well be called men wythoute order for thys consideracion. For they shoulde by due order firste learne to rule theyr office before they shulde take vpon them the charge thereof. But they do contrarye. Fyrst they take charge of the office, and than after lerne to rule it by waies inordinate: howe be it euerye wyse man wyll firste lerne to gouerne an office before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire or take vpon him the rule thereof. But these estates contrarely demeane them selfe. Thus worthy citizens, compare me newe gentlemen with their immoderate pryde, and take diligent consideracion whyche is beste: to be not gentle of byrth, and lowely and gentle of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: or elles to be gentle of bloud, and proude and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle of maners. Of suche thynges as they be wonte to heare and to read, somewhat haue I seene, and some I my selfe haue done. I haue learned that by exercise of chiualry, which they haue learned by readyng.

They dispyse my nouel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye of honoure and vnnoble lynage, and I dyspyse the vncraftynesse and slouthe of them.

Plane<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly I suppose bycause I haue no ymages of my progeni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tours exalted in remembrance of them as these gentyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue: and bycause my noblenesse is but newe and springyng. But theirs is auncient and by their dysorder decaynge. But certenly I counte it more better and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to be roote and begynner of noblenesse vnto all my progeny &amp; to leaue the same vnto my branches: than to corrupt and desyle noblenes receyued of my progeny as many of these gentylmen do. Forsoth I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant but that if these estates were nowe present and shulde answere to my wordes their speche shulde be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly painted, ornate and elegant ynough. But syth they cease not to blame &amp; reuyle with their lewde words in euery place bothe you &amp; me for this your great office whiche ye haue gyuen vnto me: it hath not pleased me to be styll nor to kepe secrete their fautes: lest some myght count me culpable &amp; worthy their rebukes: by reason of myne indyfcrete pacience &amp; sylence. Neuertheles sothely their wordes can not greue nor hurt me: after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scyence of myne owne mynd. For if they say trueth they can nought say but good and worshyp by me: but if they wyl nedesly on me my maners, my liuing, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is suche that I shall ouercome their wordes and proue their iniust accusementes fayned and false. But sith your counsell is blamed of these noble men bycause ye haue commytted to me this great honour and greater besynesse: consyder ye in your myndes diligently and often whether ye shall nede to repent you of this dede or not. To say trueth I can not host mi selfe of the ymages of my progenitors nor I can not recounte vnto you the triumphes or consulshyps of myne auncetry. But if the
<pb n="xc" facs="tcp:2049:184"/>

And other some which with mine handes I haue wonne of the enemies of the empire. I coulde also if it neded shewe you in the fore parte of my body manifold scarres of many and large woundes which I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in good worthe for defence of our contrey and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. These be my ymages whiche I can shew. Thys is my noblenesse, not lefte to me by heritage (as theirs is to them) but noblenes whiche I haue wonne and gotten wyth greate and sore labours of my bodye, and peryll of my lyfe.</p>
                     <p>¶ My wordes be not ordred in ornate langage, nor my speche painted with rethoricke lyke theirs, for I set lytle therby. My vertue sheweth it selfe plainly enough withoute glosed or paynted wordes. But these noble menne muste of necessitie haue crafte for to couer theyr shamefull and vngoodlie deedes, with these eloquente wordes their craftye and rethorike speche. Nor as for me, I neuer learned the greeke langage, which thynge these estates obiecte agaynste me as a greate faulte. But to be plaine: my pleasure was neuer much to lerne suche thynges, whiche haue lytle auayled vnto the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or lerners of the same, neyther to acquisicion of vertue nor expulsion of vyce. But I haue learned and am taughte in other thygnes muche better and more profitable to the common weale, as to assaile and strike myne enemies, to dispoyle their ordinaunce &amp; vytailes, to chafe their garniso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: nothing to drede nor fear saue an yl name, to indure &amp; take in good worth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plesure of the
<pb facs="tcp:2049:185"/>
somer and the hardnes of the wynter bothe in lyke: to lye vpon the ground, to endure honger and labour both together. Therfore I shall exhort and informe my soul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diours with these preceptes, which I my selfe haue ler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, vsed and assaied. Nor I shal not handle or intreate them by crafte to thintente they maye auaunce me with ryches: nor vse them sharply and my selfe plesantly: but in euery difficultie I shall be their example of labour: nor I shal not put the labour to them and take the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyp to me. This order is profitable. Thus ought a cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine demeane him amonge his souldiors, and namely among worthy citizens. For when a man liueth delicat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly him selfe, &amp; driueth his souldiours to the peryl of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile by punishement or other rigour: he is not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led a captaine or ruler of an armie: but rather a proude lorde or tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous opressor of citezins. Our elders wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely behauing them selfe after this maner, haue made noble and excellent &amp; inriched this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men weal, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe also. But these states which now lyue, trusting to be honored by the worthines of their progenitors, they them selfe vnlyke of condicions dispise vs, and haue us in disdaine which folowe the maners of their progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And euery hye office, &amp; all honors they chalenge &amp; demaunde of you not by their merites, but as it wer of duety and heritage. But sothly the ouer proud men erre much from the truth. For thoughe their progenitors &amp; ancestrie haue left to them euery thynge which to them was possible to leaue: as riches, patrimony, and their y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, for reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance &amp; example of them and of theyr worthy dedes. Neuertheles theyr vertue haue they not lefte vnto them, nor they coulde not keepe it: for that on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly canne neyther be geuen vnto theym in rewarde, nor
<pb n="xcj" facs="tcp:2049:185"/>
receyued of any man. These gentelmen say that I am a man withoute maners and vnclenlye of behaueour. And why? Forsoothe because that I prepare and dresse not curiousely many delicious bankets so superfluous and deinteous as they do: and because I haue no ioug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler nor dyzar with me to moue sportes and dissolute laughynge: nor no more curious cooke than one of the vilage longyng to rural people, which thinges to haue as these gentlemen haue, it pleaseth me not to knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For I neuer had pleasure in suche thynges. For I haue herde of my father and of other incorrupte and well disposed men, that such deliciousenes and curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, belongeth vnto women: and that laboure and busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse belongeth vnto men. Euery good man thinketh it more conuenient to haue plentie of worshyp than of ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches. And more honour it is to a good man to haue the walles of his house garnyshed and ouercouered wyth armoure wherewyth he may defende his contrey, his friendes, and hym selfe, then with riche ornamentes of curious worke of no profite saue onely the syghte and vaine regarde thereof. But sythe these gentlemen thus obiecte suche matters to me: let them continue alwaye in suche vyces whiche lyketh them, and that they haue euer reputed so dere. Let them inclyne to voluptuositie: as daunsyng, singyng, bankettynge, playing, to lechery to glotonye, and dronkennes. For in suche vyces haue they spende their youth: in the same let them passe forth their age, vtterly subdued to the bealy, to sleepe, to ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and subiect to lustes of the vilest part of the bodye. Let them leaue the sweate of fyghtinge, the peryll of deathe, the blynding of duste in batayle, and other lyke perilles vnto vs, to whome these be more acceptable
<pb facs="tcp:2049:186"/>
than their feestes and voluptuous bankettes or other vile pleasurs. But thei do not so, they be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented. For after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> such vngoodly &amp; vyle men haue dishonested themselfe, by their foule dedes: than be they redy to take awaye the rewardes of good menne vnto them selfe. Thus (agaynst all right) lechery and slouth most cursed vyces dothe no hurt to such as occupyeth them: but they be vtter distruction to the commen weal, and commens which be innocent and vnculpable.</p>
                     <p>¶ But syth I haue made answere to these dysordred gentylmen: and that moderately after my custome and condicion &amp; not so largely as their cursednesse and vices ar worthy. I shall speke nowe a fewe thinges touching the commen wele. And first of al haue ye good trust and esperance touching the besines of Numidy. For ye haue now moued &amp; auoyded euery thinge wherby Iugurth was defended from beginninge of the warre vnto this tyme: that is say the couetyse of Calphurnius, and of Albinus: the vncraftynes &amp; foly of Aulus: and the pride of Metellus. By these found Iugurth socour hytherto but al these be auoyded nowe. Moreouer ye haue there an army whiche knoweth the contrey, but verily it is more noble and manly than fortunate or happy. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great part ther of is wasted and spent (and that wors is infected and corrupted: what by the auarice and by the vnboldnes and cowardyse of their captayns. Wherfore ye whiche be of lusty age and mete to endure the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of warre and batayle: now labour ye with me, and take ye in hande defence of the commen weale. Nor let none of you be afrayed nor abashed for misfortune of the other souldiours which haue foughten there before this tyme nor of the pride of their captayns. For I my
<pb n="xcij" facs="tcp:2049:186"/>
selfe as counsellour of your besynes and felowe of your peryls shall be present with you in euery besynesse both in your iournays and in your batayle also. So that I shall gouerne you and my selfe withoute difference, and vnder one forme in euery poynt. And verely by helpe of the goddes we shall within shorte season obtayne all auantages &amp; commodities which any man may wyn in batayle, as prayes, victory, with immortall laude and worshyp. And certaynlie if these pleasours and auanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were in dout or harde to obtayne (as they be not). Neuertheles it were conuenient to euery good man) as ye be) to socour and defende the commen weale of their countrey fro distruccion and dyshonour. For certaynlie there was neuer man whiche obtayned immortal laude nor euerlastyng name by cowardise or sleuth. Nor there was neuer wyse father which wold wyshe his chyldren or sonnes to lyue euer: but only that they myght lyue so longe as they behaued them selfe worthelye in goodnes and honesty: and so to passe forth their life as naturall course requireth.</p>
                     <p>¶ Worthye Romaynes: I wolde speake more vnto you if I vnderstode that strengthe coulde be encreased to feble or fearefull menne by wordes: but it is not so.

How beit, it was inacted of the olde Romains that suche excused of war for cause aboue sayd: shulde pay a certayne somme of money pretaxed toward the wages of such as laufully were admytted to warre. Marius suffred none of these to pay any thinge at all: but elect many of them for his souldyours. Manye of the Romaines surmysed that Marius elected vnto warre these abiect persons: for want of other good souldyours. Some other demed that he so dyd for fauoure, ambicion, and parcialite: by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause

And therfore they iudge euery thinge whiche they do: good, honest, and laudable: if any auantage be therto appendant. Thus dout they no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll so that they may come therby to promocion. At last Marius departed from Rome with somwhat gretter nombre than was graunted and decreed to him of the senatours.

The army whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che was there with Metellus, was deliuered to him by one Publius Rutilius, which was embassadour with the said Metellus. For Metellus himself fled the sight of Marius b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But whan Marius had restored and fulfylled the legions of his souldyors and the cohortes for the subsidyes and rescous. Than went he into a plentifull place of Numidy whiche was full of prayes. Al that he toke there: he gaue frely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to his souldyours. This done: he assayled suche castels and townes which wer but febly defended with men and walles. He had many batayls &amp; lyght skyrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes: and many other thinges he dyd in other place not with much difficultie. In the meane time the newe soul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diours were redy manly fighting without fere: &amp; seyng that they which fled wer other taken or slayne: therfore they aduysed them wel that the strongest &amp; boldest was

most sure of all. They considred wel that it stode them in hande to defende with wepyn and armour their liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, their countrey, their frendes, and all other thynges longing to their helth and honour. Thus laboured they for glorie, laude, and riches which they optained: so that within short season the olde souldiours and the newe en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creased together cherishynge and infourmynge one an other tyl their vertue and boldnes was like. But whan the two kinges Iugurth and Bocchus vnderstode of the comminge of Marius: they deuyded their hoostes and went in sonder into dyuers places where no man coude attayne to them for difficultie of the places. This was done by counsell of Iugurth. For it pleased him so to do trustinge that within shorte space the Romaines wolde be spred abrode in spoilinge and than thought he to assayle them in euery place whan they were moost without fear at libertie, at large, and vnprouided: as men ar want to be specially whan their ennemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haueth them as if they were affraied.

He perceiued well and knew what was good and yll for auantage on both sides. He caused the waies &amp; iourneis of the two kinges to be dai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly searched and espied. He preuented &amp; interrupted their counsels, prouisions and guiles. He suffered nothyng to be vnprouided and vnredie on his side: but on the other syde and party of his enemies, he suffered nothing to be sure or prouided: for alwaie he preuented their prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; pursued them. Often while Iugurth and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tulians spoiled the Numidiens which had yelded them selfe to the Romaines, Marius was redie in their way and valiantly assayled them, &amp; ouerthrewe many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> while they were dispersed abroade and flying away for feare. And also not farre frome the towne of Cirtha, he made Iugurth hym selfe so trust in his flighte, that for hast to ren awaie: he left his armour behind hym. But whan Marius considered that his actes were only glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious and excellent without any auantage, and that he might not execute bataile with Iugurth for his vnsted<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fastnes. and mouinge from place to place, he considered in minde and ordeined hym redy to besiege the cities of the contreys one after another. And namelye suche as eyther of men or of place were necessarie and behoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his enemies, and contrarye or hurtefull to hym. Thys dyd he, thynkynge that if Iugurthe wythoute disturbaunce suffered hym so to do, he shulde eyther be spoyled and bereft of hys cities, ordinaunce, socoures, and refuge: or els he must abide the fortune of batail, &amp; striue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mastry in plaine field. Bocchus the kinge of the Mauriens had often sende messengers before vnto
<pb facs="tcp:2049:189"/>
Marius: saying that he wold gladly come into fauour, amyte, and frendship of the Romains: and bydding Marius not to dout him as an ennemy nor to fear any thing longing to an enemy to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted of him ageinst the Romains. It is but lytel knowen for trueth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bocchus fained this thing to the intent that his comming to batayle vnknowen and vnproued myght be to Marius more greuous: or els whether he was wont by vnstablenes of mynd to change peace somtime for warre: and somtime war for peace.

They were defeneded againste al ennemies: not onely with walles, armour, and men: but also with much stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger defence of the difficultie and hardnesse of the place and contrey nere about them. So that it was in maner impossible that any army could come nere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for wante of water and scarcite of vitels. For except the feldes and place nere to the citie, all the other be voyde and wast grounde &amp; desart without habitacion, vneyred, barayne and drie withoute water. All full of serpentes: whiche were somuche more violent and fiers for lacke of meat and sustenance, as al other wilde beastes be wont to inrage for honger. And moreouer the myscheuous and perilous nature of serpentes is more kindled to raging and vexed, with thyrst, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with any other thing: which thyrst they coude not quenche ther for wante of water.

Whan Marius cast al these difficulties in his mind his hert was persed with a merueylous desyre to wyn this cite, both for that it was muche hurtful to him: and profitable to Iugurth, and also bycause it was herde to do and muche honour myght be gotten in wynninge therof. And moreouer bycause Metellus the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull before him had won the cite of Thala, with great honour and glory: whiche of sytuacion was not valyke to this cyte: neyther vnlyke in defence.

fontayne: saue one and that was within the wals of the citie alway ful of water. All other whiche dwelled with out the walles, as in the suburbes: occupyed but rayne water. The inhabitantes of that contrey and of all the remenant of Affrike, whiche were far from the see and rude people coude muche the better endure this scarsite of water and thirst: for this cause. For the moost part of them were fed with milke and venyson not loking after salte, sauces, nor other suche thinges as be norishinges or prouocatiues to glotony. They toke meate &amp; drinke onely to slake their hunger, and to quenche their thirst: and not without measure to prouoke themselfe to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the fleshe, as many christen men do nowe in our dayes: which make of their bely their god. And eate not to liue: but they liue to eate contrary to mannes life, and vtterly encline to bestialite. O cursed glotony let vs chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sten men lerne here of panyms to eschewe thee: which wastest the body and goodes: damnest the soule: and art mother and norice of all vices. But to retourne to my purpose: this Marius after that he had serched euery thynge by his espyes, he proceded in his interprise and purpose (as men thought) holpen of the goddes. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst so many and hard difficulties he coude not haue made sure prouision by counsel of man nor by his owne priuate wyt: as he which had impediment and was let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not onely by sharpnes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey: but also by lacke and scarcite of wheat and of al other corne. For the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiens intendeth more, to norishe pasture for beastes than to labour or eire the grounde for corne. And also they had brought together all the seed and corne of the yere before into strong holdes as their kynge Iugurth had commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them and moreouer at that season the
<pb n="xcvj" facs="tcp:2049:190"/>
feldes on euery syde were drye and bare without corne: and no maruell. For it was about the extremite or later ende of somer. Not withstandyng all these difficulties and sharpnesses Marius made prouision ynough as the mater required. First he commytted all the bestes whiche he had taken in pray in foretyme vnto the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whiche of their owne wyl folowed hym to war: or were sende to hym for helpe by frendes of thempire. Marius commaunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take charge to driue forth these beastes. Than sent he Aulus Maulius embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the hoost to a towne named Laris, and all the cohortes of his souldyours with hym which were fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and lyght harnysed for to kepe the treasour of the souldyours wages and vitayles: whiche he had lefte in the same towne. Marius kept his counsel of this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise so secrete that none of all his company hye nor low knewe of his purpose nor what he intended. But whan Manlius and his company shuld depart toward Laris Marius dissimuled wyth them sayenge that he woulde stray abrode in Numidye in rouynge and afterwarde within few dayes: he and his company wold come also to the same towne of Laris, laded with prayes of his enemies. This done he departed towarde a flod named Tana: no creature liuely knowyng of his purpose. And euery day he distribued in his iournayes amonge his hoost .xlii. heed of oxen for vitayle, which he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be deuided by euyn porcion amonge them by hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders and halfe hunders together: deuidynge vitayls to euery company after their nombre. And in the meane season he charged bottels and bowges to the hydes of the same beaste and of other ledder in gerate nombre.
<pb facs="tcp:2049:191"/>
Moreouer he eased their scarcitie of wheate and other corne, by wyse prouision. And withoute knoweledge of al his company he made good prouision of euery thing whiche myghte be necessary vnto his armye in tyme of nede. At conclusion the syxte daie after whan they were come to the saide floud of Thana, thither was brought a myghtye multitude of bottels and bowges made of leather. There pitched they theyr tentes with easye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and smal defence. Than refreshed they them selfe with meate and drinke, and eased them a certeine space. This done, Marius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them that euery man shulde be ready to procede forward euen with the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne goynge downe, and that euerye man shulde onely lade hym selfe and his beastes with water in the sayd bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and bottels, leauing al other cariage, burthens and baggage there behynde them in their tentes vnder the custody of other souldiours therto assigned. After thys whan he saw his tyme, he departed forth from his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with his company, and labored all the nyght longe in hys iourney. The day after folowyng he rested in a secrete and couerte place. In the same wyse behaued he hym selfe the night next insuing, and in the third night muche before the day lyghte, he entred into a faire and large fielde full of small hylles and downes, no more but two myle space frome Capsa. And there he taried with all his hoste in the moste priuiest maner abidyng the daye light. But assone as the day light began to ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pear, many Numidiens issued forth of the towne: some to disport them selfe, and some about their busines, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge fearinge nor suspecting of their enemies. Whan Marius sawe that, anone with al hast he sent his horse men to the towne, and with them as many fotemen in

lyght harnesse as were moost swyft and spedy. Whome he commaunded to ren with all hast and boldely and valiantly to assayle the towne: and to besyege the gates. Than after he hymselfe folowed spedely: but with good hede and aduisement: not sufferynge his souldyours in the assaut nor in the way thyderwarde to fal to robbing nor praies by spoyling of their enemies.

Many of the cetezins whiche were without the towne and were taken and in power and captiuite of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains their ennemies sent vnto them within the towne desyring them for sauegard of their liues to yelde them selfe &amp; the cite to Marius. So was it done a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion. Howbeit this not withstanding Marius brent the cite. Al the Numidiens inhabytantes therof which were of full age and able to bere wepen were slaine: and the remanent as women, children, &amp; aged men were taken prisoners and solde for their raunsome. The pray and richesse was deuided among the souldyours.

Though he wer reputed noble, great and excellent before: than begane he to be counted more famous and excellent. Euery noble dede: was reputed to be done by strength and wisdom of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius: and ascribed to his strength and polycie. And that suche thynges as were done by good counsell and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, and also suche as hapened by fortune or chance: and by neglygence of ennemies. The souldiours were so manerly treated without crueltie or fiersnesse of their captayne, and also made riche and abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant in treasour and iewels: that they exalted and praysed his name to the heuen. And loued hym as themself. But in contrary wyse the Numidyens feared hym more than any man lyuyng. Shortly to speke: both the frendes of thempire and ennemies also thought verily that eyther Marius had a godly minde and was a god himselfe: or els that he was priue with the goddes: and dyd al his dedes and besynesse by their aduyse, counsell, and prouision: which shewed him before what shuld fortune after. But whan this chaunce had fortuned so well at Capsa: anone Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius drue him to other townes, and toke as many as he besyeged. In some towne the Numidyens resysted him to their power: but it coude not auayle. In many other townes the dwellers gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer &amp; lefte them voyde and ran away fering so to be treated and delt withal as they of Capsa were: bycause their townes were lyke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houable to Iugurth, and hurtefull to Marius. Whan Marius came to any such towne: destitute and voide of dwellers he set fyre in them and brent them grounde

smothe. The aged menne, women and chyldren tooke them to woodes and caues to hyde them selfe. The yong men &amp; lusty which were taken, were slaine downe ryghte. Thus was euerye place fylled with wepynge and waylinge, brenninge and slaughter: one myngled with another. Finally after that Marius had wonne in to his handes many townes and castels, and some with out resystence or bloud shedinge of his menne, he wente in hande wyth an other mayslrie and difficultye not so sharpe nor harde to come to as was Capsa, but to be wonne or besieged it was not lesse harde nor of lesse difficultie.</p>
                     <p>¶Not far from the flod of Mulucha (which water de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth the kyngdome of Iugurth, from the kingedome of Bocchus) was a great rocke or mountaine of stonne in the middes of a playne, open ynough to be sene haue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng therupon builded a meane castle of qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie, but of a meruelouse altitude, and only one strayte passage and narowe lefte to come thereto. But on euery other syde, the rocke of naturall growyng was downe ryghte lyke a walle, as if it had ben made for the nonce wyth mans handes. Marius purposed with all his myghte to take this castle: &amp; namely because the treasures of Iugurth wer within the same. But this his purpose at last came to effecte, rather by chaunce of fortune, than by prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or counsell. For thys castle was garnyshed and plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouselye instored wyth men, wepyn, vitayles, and with all other ordinaunce requisite &amp; necessarie to defence of such a fortres. More ouer wythin the same a foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teful of clere water.

nere therto their ingines of bataile to frushe the walles or any other part therof. Beside al these defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces the dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble walles of this castel were garnyshed with towres, bulwarkes, and all other defences and ingynes whiche coude be ymagined by mannes mynd: and that rownde about compasse aswell within, as without. The way therto: by whiche the inhabitantes and garnison vsed to go and come, was very straite and narowe. In somuch that the Romains entring by the same way with their ingines of bataile were constrained to cut their pauases on both sydes &amp; to make them more narowe for strayte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse of the passage. And in suche maner they proceded forward vnder the same in great parill and with much difficultie: and at conclusion al in vayne. For whan they were come nere to the walles &amp; wolde haue set vp and adioyned the same pauases to the walles to haue vnder mined vnder them: all their labour was frustrate. For what with stones and what with fire the defenders of the castel brake and brente them agayne downe to the grounde. Thus coulde not the souldyours which vnder mined the walles contynue together at their worke and besinesse: for starytenes and difficultie of the place and importune violence of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within the castell. Nor other souldyours coude not serue them whiche made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the pauases without great paryll and daunger.

                     <p>¶ But after that many dayes &amp; greate labours in this
<pb n="xcix" facs="tcp:2049:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
maner were ouerpassed and spente in vayne. Marius was sore angred &amp; vexed in his herte, reuoluing many thinges in mynde, but specially whether he mighte giue ouer his purpose (seing his labour frustrate) or elles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the chaunce of fortune which at many times before he had found fauorable &amp; friendly to hym. While Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius chafed &amp; bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning in desire reuolued such things in his mynd both day and night: it happened by chance of fortune that a certeine Lumbarde a symple souldioure, one of the companie which was laste sente from Rome to Numidy to supply the army, straied abrode from his companie a lytle way, which Lumbard as he wandred found among the stones many small snailes creping on the ground, not farre from that side of the castle whiche was ouer againste the side that the Romaines besieged and assailed. Bycause this Lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bard in his contrey was acostumed lyke other of his contrey menne to eate such snailes prepared after their maner: therefore he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red first one and than an other, and after that many: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending vp by lytle and lytle, somtime creping, somtime clyming, for no other intent and purpose saue to gether suche snailes: and so farre he proceded by lytle and litle tyl at last he came almoste to the top of the mountayne. But whan he sawe all that syde of the castle desolate, &amp; no person steryng, anone he beganne to haue a pleasure and desire in his mynde to worke some mastrie, as the propertie and condicion is of euery manne couetinge to wynne a name, laude and riches, and to be spoken of. By chaunce of fortune in the same place where the Lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barde stode in this aduisemente among the stones grue a greate and olde oke tree hauinge the middes a lytle bowing downe toward the grounde, and the remenant
<pb facs="tcp:2049:194"/>
crokyng vpwarde againe with myghty armes &amp; brann<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches ascendyng to the hiest of the walles with the toppe erect and lyfted vp as euery herbe and tre of nature is wont to growe vpwarde at the top. This lumbard wel aduised the same and aduentured to clime vpwarde ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng his holde somtyme by the branches and bowes of this oke: and somtime takyng holde and leanyng by the stones which appered forth in the wal, tyl at the last he attayned vnto the very top of the wall. And whan he sawe no man styring on that part there stode he styl es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed of no man and noted &amp; consydred wel at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure al the inwarde part of the castel &amp; the playne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walles about the towre. This lumbarde hadde so muche the more leasour to take so long aduisement vnes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyed for al the Numidiens defenders of the castel were on the other syde attendyng &amp; gyueng hede to the assaut and defendyng themselfe and the castel agaynst the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayns. Whan the lumbard had espyed and consydred euery thinge whiche he thought might be auantage to his after purpose: than he desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded agayne downeward by the same way which he asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: but not without hede nor with so lytel aduisement as he ascended vpwarde: but prouyng euery way, and lokyng about yf it were pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sible to brynge into the castel any company of men by that syde or not. This wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sydred: assone as he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: anone he went to Marius and informed hym of euery thinge as he had done exhortyng and requiring hym to put in profe whether the castel might be won on that syde wher he had ben. Fartherhmore he promised himselfe to be gyde vnto suche as wolde vndertake that interprise sayeng that in the matter was no danger. Marius heryng these wordes of the lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bard, send forth
<pb n="c" facs="tcp:2049:194"/>
wyth him certayne of his men of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were there present to vnderstand and know the truth of the mater. Whan they had ben there and retourned to Marius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: some brought hym worde that the mater was easy to do: and some other sayde that it was very harde and perylous. The sentence of euery man was after as their mindes gaue them. The cowards thought it hard but such as were of bolde hertes &amp; desyrous of worship thought it easy and without much peryl. Neuerthelesse the minde of Marius was somwhat exalted to comfort, and good hope: and therfore of al the company of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes, and of other suche mynstrels as be wont to be in batayle to giue courage and signes to the fighters, he chose forthe fyue whiche were mooste swyfte and moste lyghte: and foure hundred menne he assigned to assyste and defende the sayd trumpettes. And al them he com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded to obey to the lumbard and to be ruled and or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred by him in euery thynge. The day next folowynge was assigned to them to procede forth in their besynesse Whan the tyme assigned and prefexed by Marius was come the lumbarde with his company had made redy and ordred euery thyng: and so went to the place where he had ben before. But whan they wer come thyder: tho lumbard their gyde caused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to change their armour, and to make bare their heades and their fete: to thintent that they so bare heded the better might se aboue them and on euery syde of them: and that they being bare fote might labour so muche the better and, take better holde in clymming vp by the stones. Their swerdes were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened behynd at their backes &amp; their buckelers withall which wer made after the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Numidie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s buck<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers of lether: bycause of lighter weight and burthen.
<pb facs="tcp:2049:195"/>
And also to thinntent that they shuld gyue les sound or noyse, if it hapned any stone to smite againste the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This done: the lumbard went vp before them, and bounde smal cordes to the stones and to the olde rotes whiche apered aboue the stones where he coude espy any suche wherby the souldyours sustaining themself and taking hold might more lightly and with more ease mount and clyme vpward. And somtime he went before and helped them vp with his handes speciall suche as for that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed way were somwhat fereful. Somtyme whan thascending or going vp was ouer harde and sharpe: he put eche of them vp before him without armour: and than he himself folowed with their armour and wepyn. Such places where most dout was in: he specially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and assayd them most of al: &amp; in goyng and coming often times vp and downe by the same most dangerous passages: he encreased audacite and boldnesse to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menant. Thus after thei had ben sore weryed, and with long and great labour endeuored themselfe: at last they came into the castel, whiche on that syde they founde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate and without defence. For (as sayd is before) al they whiche were with in the castel were occupyed in fightyng, or redy to fight against the Romains: as they were on other dayes before. But whan Marius vnder stode by messangers how the lumbard had done: how be it that al the day before his men had ben sore besied and occupyed in fightyng: and assayling the castel. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles specially at this tyme he exhorted and enbolded them: and he himselfe departing forth from vnder his pauases caused his souldyours to adioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe nere together, &amp; to holde vp their shyldes aboue their heedes so that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyning of them semed as it wer the frame
<pb n="cj" facs="tcp:2049:195"/>
of a volt. Marius kept him vnder the same for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and so approched to the walles. And bothe he and his company whiche were nere about him valiantly assailed the castel: and also other of his company which stode a far of and coude not come nere the walles for prease: assailed the castel fiersly from a far &amp; sore vexed and put in feare their enemies within the castel throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plumettes of leed with slinges, arowes dartes, &amp; al other maner engyus of batayle wherwith any thynge coude strongely be throwen into the castel. But the Numidiens within the castel had often before this time ouerturned and brent the tentes &amp; pauases of the Romains &amp; toke therby so great audacite &amp; boldnes that they defended not themself within the castel walles but walked vp &amp; downe without the castel walles bothe day and night reuiling and reprouinge the Romayns and obiectyng cowardyse agaynste Marius. And thret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge that his souldyours shuld be made subiectes and bonde me to Iugurthe in tyme to come, whome they purposed at that tyme to make bonde to them. Thus whyle they thought themselfe sure and their matter in good case: they were harde and egar ynough reuylinge &amp; thretnynge the Romayns. In the meane space whyle the Romains and their ennemies were besyest fighting withall their myght: the Romains for laude, glorie, and lordshyp: and the Numidiens for their helth and sauing of their liues. Anone sodenly the lumbard with his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany which were within the castel on the backsede blew their trumpettes. First of all the women and children whiche went to the walles to se the bykeringe were al abashed and fled inwarde to the castel: and after them al the souldiours which were without and nerest to the
<pb facs="tcp:2049:196"/>
walles and coude escape in. And finally they all bothe armed and vnarmed fled inward. Whan the Romains sawe this they assayled the castel more fiersly: some they slew and ouerthrew: some they wounded ouerpassing or standyng vpon the bodyes of them whiche were slayne. Al their desyre was with their handes to wyn glorie and worshyp. They stryued to ascende vnto the walles euery man couetyng to be before other. None of them al taryed nor was let with spoylinge nor prayes. Their great courage suffred them not to loke there after, tyl by manhode and strength they had won the castel. Thus was fortune fauorable to Marius: so that his first negli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence &amp; vnwise boldnes to assaile a castel inexpugnable was tourned by chance from rebuke to glorie and laud such was his fortune. But whan Marius had won his castel after estimacion of man not able to be won: than was he lorde of the moost part of al the treasour of Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gurth: the castel was gyuen all to murder and hauocke. And the souldiours of Marius richely rewarded euery man after his desert.</p>

The first for that I intende not to make relacion of his behauour and maner in any other place of his cronycle saue here. Secondly for asmuch as none other authour hath written sufficiently of hym. For howe beit that one historiograph named Lucius Sisenna: wrote most dyli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gently and best of his actes of any other before: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles me semeth that he spake lytel acordyng to truth nor indyfferently.

For what by fauour and what by fere he durst not touche plainly the vices which were in him. But here I purpose (al fauour &amp; fere laid a part indifferenly to write of him.</p>
                     <p>¶This Sylla of progeny, was descended of most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble stocke of the Romains. How be it the name of hys auncestrie was almost lost and decayed by dulnes, neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligence and slouth of some of his lynage. In greke and laten he was of lyke connynge, and excellently seene in both the langages, his mynde was greate and bolde of corage. Of voluptuous pleasures he was desirous, but much more desirous of glory and laude. In vacant lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure he was much enclined to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lustes of his body. But such pleasure or voluptuousnes dyd neuer let nor wyth holde hym from any busines or occupacion necessarye: how be it such pleasure blynded hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he toke no wife of birth, manars, and honesty conuenient for his estate.
<pb facs="tcp:2049:197"/>
He was muche eloquent of speche crafty and subtyll ynough. He had the wayes easely to get frendshyp, and it was also no maistry to get fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dshyp of him: in faining dissimulyng, &amp; countrefaytinge of besynesses: his wytte was very hye and excellent. He was a marueylous and incredyble gyuer of many thinges, but specially of mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney: and before the warre and victory whiche the noble men of Rome: had agaynst the commen people: He was so noble &amp; worthy reputed that it is in maner incredible nor his good fortune neuer passed the policy of his wyt: in somuch that many men wer in dout whyther he was more fortunate than stronge. But after the victory of this warre: so vngoodly was his demeanour &amp; so cruel, that verily I knowe not whyther I may more be asha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med or greued to write or to speke therof. For after that this warre of Numidy was ended: and bothe Marius and this Sylla were retourned to Rome: a greate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde fel bytwene the lordes and commens. Marius toke part with the commons: but Sylla toke with the lordes &amp; at last droue Marius forthe of the citie. After that: an other man of great power called Cynna whiche had ben fyue tymes consul of Rome gathered an hoost of men &amp; toke parte with Marius agaynst this Sylla. But at conclusion Sylla ouercame hym in bataile: and slewe him. After this: Sylla cruelly murdred an other noble man of Rome named Caius Carbo: and with hym yonge Marius, sone of this Marius whiche war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Numidi. Last of al whan this Sylla had won victory ouer Marius and his fauourers: than became he most cruel of al other: in somuch that he fylled al the citie with blod of the citezins. But here wyl I leaue to speke farther of this Sylla, or of his behauour in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
<pb n="ciij" facs="tcp:2049:197"/>
and retourne to wryte of hys behaueoure in thys warre of Numidie vnder Marius.</p>
                     <p>¶After that this Sylla (as I haue saide before) was come to Affrike, and to the hoste of Marius with hys company of horsemen, within shorte season he became mooste experte in chiualrie and craftie aboue all other: howe be it before this tyme he was but rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante in dedes of chiualrie. And moreouer he treated &amp; gouerned his souldiours with maners and meekenes. And gaue rewards to many: to some which desired him and to some other of his owne pleasure not desired ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to. But he wolde take no rewardes nor gyftes againe, without it were against his wyll. And if he so dyd at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tyme againste his wyll: than was he more readie to giue againe that which was geuen to hym, than to pay that money which he had borowed of other. He demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded nothing againe of any man, though it wer due and det to hym: but rather he labored and endeuored hym selfe that many might be in his det, and bi such meanes to haue them bound to him. And how be it that he was one of the greatest of Rome, yet disdained he not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of the most symple souldiours of the hoste: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned and acompanied with them both in sportes and in sadnes. In labours he was alway ready. In bataile and watching, with other busines of war he suffered no man to be before hym. Nor in the meane season he ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt the good name of the consul, nor of none other good man: which thyng men desirous of worshyp &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be often wonte to do: for in dispraysinge of other, they thynke to obtaine greate laude to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe. He only lobored that none myght passe hym neither in counsell, nor in myght, or manhod of his handes: But he passed

manye. By whiche maners and condicions in shorte tyme he became verye deere and welbeloued, not onely to Marius: but also to all the hooste.</p>

The kinge Bocchus induced with hope of this reward: with a great multitude of people came to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth, and adioyned both their armies together in one.</p>
                     <p>¶ At this tyme Marius wyth hys company was in his iournay toward a prouince which was in the coost of Affrike and apartained to thempire: where the sayd Marius purposed to rest with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, tyl the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were paste. But whan he was in his iourney and in

least doute: Jugurth and Bocchus both together inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and set vpon him &amp; his men whan the tenth part of the day scarsely remained. This dyd they, thinking that the night which was nere come, shuld to them be great socour and defence if they were ouercome: &amp; if they dyd ouercome the Romains, it shuld be to them no damage nor impediment, bicause they knewe the contrey &amp; place better then the Romaines. But on the other syde bothe these chaunces in darkenes, were hard and contrary to the Romains: for they knewe not the coastes of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey. Marius anone had vnderstanding of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of his enemies by many of his espyes, but it was ouer late. For as sone as he hadde worde, his enemies were euen at hande: In so much that before the army coulde be set in order or araye, and or they could remoue or ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther together their baggage whych at that tyme was a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brode: and before they could take any commaundement of theyr captayne by worde or sound of trumpets: The horsemen of the Mauriens and of the Getulians ran together vpon them, not in order or araye of batayl: but by companies and bendes together, as it fortuned them to come togther in heapes and clusters. The Romains for the moste parte were all amased and greuousely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed for that sodaine and vnprouided feare. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles they forgat not their olde manhod and strength: Some drewe them to theyr armoure, and other some whiche were armed already defended their felowes tyl they armed them selfe. Other some mounted on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe and boldely rode againste their enemies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred them valiauntly. The fyghte on both partyes was more lyke a skyrmishe amonge brygandes and ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers, then to any appointed or ordered batayle.
<pb facs="tcp:2049:199"/>
For the horsemen and fotemen were myngled together without standerdes, cognisances, or any ordinaunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raye or order. The Mauriens and Numidians were fierse on their syde. Some of the Romains they beate downe and ouerthrew. Some they wounded mortally: And many they berefte vtterly of their lyues, and slew them in that place. The remenant whiche sharplye and manlye resisted, they compased them aboute on euerye side, and as well behynd as before assailed them: so that neyther manhod, strength nor armour, was able suffici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ently to defend them: And no maruel, for their enemies were mo in nomber than they: and compassed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute on euery syde of them. But finally the Romayne souldiours which were both of olde and newe, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both strong, bolde, and craftie in batayle: gathered them as nere together as they myght. And wher it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned any nomber of them to meete together, they tour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned backe to backe, and ioyned them round one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in maner of a compasse or cyrcle: and so they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and defended them selfe together that on the backe halfe no man coulde assaile them, but if he brake in tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rowe the myddes of them, which was in maner impossi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble. By this maner they sustayned the myghte of theyre enemies, and also saued them selfe. Nor their captayne Marius in this ieoperdous and sharpe busynes was not afrayed at all, nor of lesse corage and boldenes then he was before: but styrred about euery where in the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle. And his men of garde about hym, whom he had chosen rather of the strongest and boldest menne of the hoste, than of suche as were moste familiar wyth hym. For he set more by the audacitie of them, than by the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miliaritie of the other: &amp; namely in suche a ieopardous
<pb n="cv" facs="tcp:2049:199"/>
case. Somtime he socoured his souldiours in their nede or suche as he sawe in paryl. And somtyme he ran in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his enemies: wher thei wer thickest. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their resistence he assailed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> valiantly: &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, slewe, &amp; ouerthrue them on euery syde his weapen in the red bloud of the blacke Mauriens &amp; Getuliens. And bycause that in so harde a case: and in so great and troublous noyse and rumour, he coude not counsel nor comforte his souldyours with his tonge, therefore he thought to counsel, incorage, and confort them with hys hande, giuing them example surely to bestow their stro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes. Many of his enemies send he to hel crieng in vain vpon their ydolles of helpe. The dartes, iauelyns pikes plumettes of leed, stones, with other such instrumentes of bataile were cast so thicke on bothe parties, that the aire therwith was dimmed. The strokes wer so coursly charged on the bright helmes and harnesse, that the fire sprang out on euery side: so that it semed to be the lyght<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning: the cry of the men dieng: the neieng of the horses: and the dyn of the strokes, wyth the sounde of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes: was horrybe &amp; tedious to here. Thus continued they tyl the day light was passed, and the night come. The Numidians, getulians, &amp; maurians desysted nor ceassed nothing for that. But as bothe Jugurth and Bocchus before had warned and commaunded them: they continued more sharpely than before, thinking that the darkenesse of the night shuld be for their auauntage Marius this vnderstanding toke counsel &amp; made best prouision for himselfe and his men: whiche he might in suche case: and as the mater required.

two hylles nere together of whome the one was ouer narowe, and of litle grounde to receiue hys hole army and tentes: but in the top therof was a fayre fountayne of pure water much necesseary. The other hyl sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly large to receyue his hole hoost and tentes: and also very defensyue, for it was of a great altitude &amp; downe right on euery syde. In somuche that they whiche shulde take that hil wer sure ynough without great defence of them selfe, for nature had it sufficiently defended. This wel considred: Marius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded Sylla his vndercapten to take with him all the horsmen, and to tary that nyght about the smaller hyl where the fountayne was. This done: he himselfe gathered together by litel and litel the remanent of his souldyours dispersed abrode: their enne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies being not lesse troubled than were they. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius had thus assembled agayne his men together he led them all with ful cours vp vnto the larger hyl. Thus the two kinges Iugurth and Bocchus seyng it in vayne to fyght with them whiche were on the hyer ground, &amp; also on so sure a place: wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strained to leaue the fight: for difficultie of the place which the Romains had taken. But neuertheles in the meane tyme they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred not their men to departe far thens: but compased bothe the hylles round about with their hole multitude and there taryed &amp; rested, shed abrode vpon the ground. Whan they hadde taken their place in this maner: they made great fiers here and there in many places of their hoost: &amp; the barbarians after their custome passed forth the most part of the night in myrth, pleasure, &amp; gladnes reioysing, daunsyng: and making great noyse and dyn: rennyng and goyng from place to place: &amp; loudly crieng synging &amp; reuellyng. The kynges themselfe were also
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:2049:200"/>
not a lytle proud and fierse because they had not fledde from the batayle, and counted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe as ouercomers seyng that they helde the Romains so besieged, whiche as they thought durst not abyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. On the other part the Romayns intentifely gaue aduertens to the demea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour of their enemies. And for that the Romains were on the heygth of the hyll and withoute lyghte: therfore more easy from darkenes of hyer places they perceiued all the dedes and behaueoure of their enemies whiche were beneath them: and much more euidently by lighte of the fyers. This vnwyse behaueour of the Numidy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans put the Romains in great confort, and was greate courage to them. And speciallye Marius was greatly confirmed in hope seyng their negligence, their folye, &amp; vncraftines: Wherfore he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his folke to kepe silence as styll as myght be possible without any noyse. In so much that he suffered not the trumpets to sounde the watch as warriours are wont against nyght. After<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde whan the daye began to apeare, the Numidians were all wearyed with their cryinge, ouer late watche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, and reuell: and had geuen them selfe to reste a lytle before as men without feare or dout of the Romaines. But certenly it is a true prouerbe which is often sayde, that after faire wether succedeth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pesteous cloudes, &amp; after mirth and ioye often cometh sadnesse and sorowe. So it happened to the Numidyans. For whyle they ingorged and fylled with wynes laye sleepynge on the ground as beastes wythout feare &amp; wythout prouision: Marius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded sodenly al hys trumpets, clarioni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes with other minstrels to sound their instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as shirle as they could altogether, &amp; that al his souldiours shuld set vp a shout or cry as horribly as they myghte:
<pb facs="tcp:2049:201"/>
and with that inuade and breke into the tentes of the Numidiens. This was shortly done: wherfore the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiens, Mauriens, and Getuliens astonied &amp; abashed with that vnknowen and horryble noyse: were sodenly a wakened of sleape: and seyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus compased with their ennemies: what for feare of deth &amp; the noyse, they were so amased that they hadde no power neyther to fle nor draw to them their armour, nor vtterly to do or pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uide any manner socour for themselfe. Thus they stode astonyed for this horrible noise and cry as if madnesse had entred them: none able to socour himselfe nor other. The Romains alway increased to them their noise and feare assailing, murdring, and wounding them without any resistence. Finally al they were other ouerthrowen, slayne, or wounded: or els fled, their armour, standerdes and weapen left behynde them: and mo were in this ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle slaine: than in all the batayls before.

Of the treytours which had forsaken Iugurth &amp; came to the Romaines, such as were best labored, and knewe best the contrey were chosen forth and sent out to espye the contrey and wayes of Iugurth and Bocchus. But notwithstanding Marius him selfe was as prouident, circumsptet, and diligente withall, as if he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the charge to none other. He was mouinge continually from place to place ouer all the army: lauding, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and rewarding the good souldiours: and blaming and rebuking the bad: he hym selfe armed, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie prouiding and ministring vnto them euery thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and expedient: and compelled them that wer fro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward and yll wyllinge to labour.

Moreouer some other he ordred on the casting of the dyches and on outward bulwarks to defende the remenant if any sodaine peryll apeared. He him selfe armed myghtely went about and searched the watch. Not specially for any feare nor mystruste of anye peryll to come, nor for feare that his souldioures wold not obay his commaundemente. But chiefely to
<pb facs="tcp:2049:202"/>
the entent that the souldyours seyng their captayne not resusing labour nor paryl: shulde be also more wylling to folowe the same and take payne vpon themselfe as ashamed if they dyd not as muche as their captayn. And certenly at this tyme &amp; at many other during this war (as I rede) Marius constrayned his souldyours to la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour rather for shame than with sharpnes or punishe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. For shame it is to the seruant to be ydle whan the maister sore laboreth. Howbeit some sayd that Marius toke this labour vpon him for the desyre of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and worshyp: bycause that from his youth he was euer wont with hardnes, hunger, thirst, and labour: and many other thynges whiche the delycate gentylmen of our tyme count for miseries. But to Marius wer these hardnesses muche pleasure &amp; delite for affection whiche he had agaynste the commen weale, as equal persones supposed. But to what euer intent Marius: treated his army in his wyse: it was knowen that his dedes dyd asmuche profet and worshyp to the commen weale of Rome: as if he had more rigorously &amp; sharpely treated his souldyours. For al thynges were ordred wel and worthely for the honour &amp; profet of the commen weale as he had more rigorously treated his army.</p>
                     <p>¶ But to retourne to my purpose: whan Marius with suche dyligence as said is: was come not far from the towne of Cirtha, at the last the fourth day after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd batayle: the espyes of their ennemies appered on euery side. The Romains vnderstod anone therby that their ennemies were at hande. The espyes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns also whiche were sende sorth: brought the same tidynges from euery coost of the countrey. Marius per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued that hys ennemies were in diuerse companyes
<pb n="cviij" facs="tcp:2049:202"/>
and deuided: wherefore he was vncertayne howe he might best order his host to receyue them: And therfore perceyuing it vnsure: how to order the forfront of hys batayle as it ought: he abode hys enemies in the same place no order chaunged with his hoost deuyded in .iiii. partes (as sayd is) as he which was redy and prouided for euery chaunce. Thus was Iugurth disceyued and frustrate of hys purpose. For he had deuyded hys hoost into four partes trustynge to inuade some of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns on the backehalfe with parte of his army: and with an other parte to encounter with them, and with the other two partes to enclose them on bothe the sydes and so to enuyron them rounde aboute. In the meane time Sylla which first encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred with Iugurth exhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted and comforted his men aswel as he might for breui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of the time. That done: anone he proceded with hys company by bendes and clusters together, their horses conioyned in the moost thickest maner: and so fiersly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayled the Maurians. The remanent of the fotemen which wer vnder Sylla: remayned and kept themselfe styl in their firste place, and defended theyr bodies from the dartes whyche their ennemies threwe against them from farre. But if it chaunsed any of their ennemyes to come betwene their handes, they hewed them downe to decrease the nomber.</p>
                     <p>¶ Whyle Sylla and his horsemen thus fierselye were fyghtyng on the ryght wyng of the batayle: The kinge Bocchus assembled together the footemen whome hys sonne named Volux, had broughte thyther wyth hym. These footemen had suche impedimente in theyr iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naye thytherwarde that they came ouer late to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther batayle whiche was laste foughten before this.
<pb facs="tcp:2049:203"/>
Wherfore Bocchus: whan he had assembled &amp; inbolded with his words these freshe fotemen: with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he assailed fiersly the rere warde of the Romains.</p>
                     <p>¶ In the meane time Marius himselfe was occupied in the fore ward of his hoost and ther employed his wys<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome and strength, as a valyant and worthy captayne: and so stode it him in hande. For in the forwarde Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth himselfe with his grettest power &amp; strongest com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of men inbatayled with hym.</p>
                     <p>¶ But after that Iugurth knewe of the commyng of Bocchus to the felde: anone he turned hym with a smal company about him priuely vnto the fotemen of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mains: and there with an hye voyse he cried vnto them, sayng that they fought but in vaine. For a litel before he had slaine Marius with his owne handes. And in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng these wordes he lyfted vp withal, and shewed his swerde all ouersprincled and dyed with blode: whiche he had so couloured in the batayle fiersly ynough in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the fotemen of the Romains. These wordes Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth cried in latyn tong. For he had lerned to speke lat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyn longe before in the bataile of Numaunce. Whan the Romains herde these wordes they were affrayed, but more for crueltie of the noise: than for any confidence or trust which they had to the messanger. But on the other side the mindes of the barbariens wer bolded &amp; exalted by these wordes: by reason whereof more sharpely they inuaded the Romains, seinge them abashed &amp; astonied. And nowe were the Romains of the forwarde at that poynt that they were redy to giue them selfe to flight: as men discouraged for the said tidinges.</p>
                     <p>¶ Whan they were at this point: it fortuned so at the same tyme that Sylla had beaten and ouerthrowen the

Mauriens whyche inuaded and assayled hym on the ryghte wynge of the batayle: Wherfore he retourned to his companye and fiersely assayled the freshe footemen whiche were wyth Bocchus, and at one syde brake in a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monge the thyckest of them. But Bocchus anone tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his backe and gaue hym selfe to flyght.</p>

And at conclusion al in vaine. For while he labored there about as a worthy captaine, the spereme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romayns so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed hym and his company about both on the ryght syde &amp; on the lyft: that all his garde &amp; other which were about hym at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion wer slain. But he him selfe glad to saue his lyfe, brake forth alone from among the mids of his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies, and from wepons &amp; dartes with great difficultie.</p>
                     <p>¶But in the meane tyme Marius had ouercome and driuen away the horsemen which assayled hym. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anone he retourned fiersely to helpe and socour his company whom he vnderstode somewhat put backe by violence of their enemies. But he by his pollicy and va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liant deedes anone so reconforted his men that none of hys ennemies were able to withstand their vyolence in anye part of that batayle.</p>
                     <p>¶Thus finally the Romains after greate labour and manye greuous woundes disconfited their enemies on euery side. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the batail was ended, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains began to pursue the chase, then verelye it was a pytefull &amp; horrible syght to beholde in the open fieldes, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the cruell spectacle of bataile.

A litel fear was among them, but their hope and confort ouerpassed their feare. For why? they hadde the vpper hande before: and considred that they shulde bicker with them, whome they hadde often ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen and ouercomme before.

And so enuironed with falsehode and treason.

                     <p>¶ But touching your commen weal (for whose besines ye be sende hither as procuratour of the same) thys is
<pb n="cxvij" facs="tcp:2049:211"/>
my sentence and mynde in fewe wordes. Agaynste the Romains, nor agaynste their empire: I neuer moued nor made war: nor to make bataile against them: it was neuer in my mynde by my wyl. But the boundes of my marchesse haue I endeuoured me to defende agaynste the violence of your armed men. But this I leaue and set a side: syth I se that pleaseth you to do the same: exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ye batayle with Iugurth as ye will. And as touchyng me: I shall not ouerpasse the water of Mulucha, whiche was boundes bytwene my marches and Micipsa whyle he lyued. Nor into my countrey I shall not suffre Iugurth from hens forthe to entre for socours, as he hath done in time passed. Farthermore if ye desire any thinge of me conueniently: whiche I may worthely graunt, my royalte not distayned: it shall not be denyed to you. Thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded Bocchus his words.</p>
                     <p>¶ Vnto these wordes Sylla answered for hys owne part but moderately &amp; with fewe wordes. But touching the peace and besynesse concerning the commen weal: he spake many wordes, wherof the conclusion was suche.</p>
                     <p>¶ Kynge Bocchus I insure and promesse you: that the Romayns shal not be vnkinde to you if ye do some plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure to them: whiche may rather longe to them all holly in comen: than in me alone. And thynke ye for certayne: that they whiche haue ouercome you in batayle: shall lykewyse ouercome you with liberalite, kyndnesse, and good dedes: if ye so contende with them: whiche thynge is nowe redy in your power to do: consyderinge that ye haue Iugurth redy at your wil and pleasure. Therfore amonge all benefites or pleasurs: ye can do none more acceptable vnto the Romayns: than to delyuer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iugurth. By this meanes shal they be muche beholden
<pb facs="tcp:2049:212"/>
to you: &amp; thinke ye stedfastly: it shal not be vnrewarded on our behalfe. For tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal the Senate graunt to you amyte &amp; peace: and also a part of Numidy which ye do now clayme: shal than be graunted to you vnrequired.</p>
                     <p>¶ Bocchus heryng these words of Sylla: first excused himselfe by the affinyte whiche was bytwene hym and Iugurth: and by the longe familyarite &amp; aquaintance which they had together: saieng also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a bonde of peace was confederate and sworne bytwene them. And also that he fered and suspected that yf he so dyd: hys owne subiectes shulde hate him therfore, whiche much loued Iugurth: &amp; greatly hated the Romayns. But not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng these wordes of Bocchus: Sylla desysted not to attyse and counsel him: tyll at last he agreed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to hys desyre, promysinge to do euery thynge as Sylla required hym. But to thyntent to faine a treaty of peace (of which Iugurth weryed in war was much desirous) they ordayned suche craft: as to their purpose semed moste expedient. But whan they had ymagined and deuysed al thynges after theyr myndes: than bothe they departed in sonder: &amp; returned againe to their rest.</p>

<pb n="cxviij" facs="tcp:2049:212"/>
shewed to Asper: al his minde and pleasure concerninge the premisses. And within .viii. dayes after sende hym againe to Bocchus. Whan Asper was retourned againe to Bocchus: he shewed to him the wyll of Iugurth say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he coueted to do al thinge which shulde be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to him of Bocchus: but he had but small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydence in Marius. For asmuche as the peace whiche often before had ben conuented and apoynted of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maine captayns had anone after ben frustrate: &amp; broken of them agayne. But if ye will (said Asper to Bocchus that peace shalbe confirmed of the Romayns with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth and you also: Iugurthe desyreth &amp; requireth you to labour so: that Sylla, Iugurth, &amp; ye may come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to communycation: as if it wer to treat of peace and that ye wyll there betraye and delyuer Sylla to him. For if ye may ones bringe suche a man into power and handes of Iugurth: anone after it shal fortune without dowte that peace shalbe made and graunted to hym by comen assent of the Senatours: and commens of Rome also. And that: to thyntent to recouer Sylla againe out of the handes of Iugurthe. For without dout the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains wil not suffre so noble a man to be left in handes and danger of their enemies. And namely: whan they shal vnderstande hym taken, not by his owne folly nor cowardise: but in besines belonging to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men weal.</p>
                     <p>¶Bocchus hering these words, reuolued &amp; cast in his mynd what he might answer to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but at last he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therto. But whether he douted so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge before he gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        </gap>. But this is plainly knowen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the most parte lyke as the wylles &amp; mindes of kinges be veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t unmoderat and hastye: ryght so be they mouinge, vnstedfast &amp; variable:
<pb facs="tcp:2049:213"/>
and often aduers and contrary to their owne selfe: and with themselfe repugnant. But to our mater: Bocchus assigned to Asper a place and tyme: where Sylla and they shulde commen together of the peace. And in the meane whyle somtime he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned secretly with Sylla somtime with Asper embassadour of Iugurth, treating them both mekely and curtesly: and promisyng one selfe thing vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, Wherfore they both were glad: and also eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both had good hope in the promysses of Bocchus.</p>
                     <p>¶ But the night before that day: which was assigned to intreatment of the peace: Bocchus called vnto him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse of his frendes, as if he wolde haue taken counsell of them: and than immediatly he chaunged that mynde, commaundyng them agayne to auoyde from hym. And so (none of his counsell aboute hym) he stode all alone reuoluyng and tourning in mind many thinges by him selfe, chaunging oftentimes in countenance, and colour variable and diuerse: aperyng forthwarde by tokens of feare conceyued in his minde &amp; expressed by outwarde tokens of his body. In so muche: that all yf he expressed not his mind by wordes: neuertheles this ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> changing of countenance, declared the secretes of his hert. But at conclusion: after longe conflyct had within himselfe: at last he commaunded Sylla to be called vnto him. And than after his aduise and counsell he deuised &amp; prepared al thinges concerning the prodicion of Iugurth.</p>
                     <p>¶ After this counsel concluded: assone as the day light apered: tidynges were brought to Bocchus, that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth was not far thens: and commynge toward hym. Bocchus this herynge: anone prepared hymselfe and proceded forth agaynst hym accompanyed with a fewe
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:2049:213"/>
of his frendes, &amp; also with Sylla: fayning that he went so forth to mete wyth Iugurth and to receyue hym, by cause of honour. And thus they proceded forwarde: tyll at laste they came to an open heath, where they myghte easely se the comminge of Iugurthe: whiche place was apointed before to their treason. For in diuerse valeys of the same heath: were armed men lyeng in wayt redy and apointed before by Bocchus: for to assaile Iugurth and his company, whan signes shulde be giuen to them: to yssue forth of their lurking places. Anone Iugurth with many of his men about him came to the same place all vnarmed: as apointement was made before. For it was ordained that Bocchus, Iugurth, &amp; Sylla: shuld come together to communicacion: eche one with a small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and all vnarmed.</p>
                     <p>¶ Anon as Iugurth was come thider: king Bocchus gaue a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his men, which lay in wait for Iugurth. Anone as they hard the toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: sodainly they brake forthe and inuaded Iugurth &amp; his company: compasinge them about on euery side. Without great labour al the compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny of Iugurth were murdred: &amp; he himselfe taken and bounde hand and fote, &amp; so deliuered vnto Sylla: which without tary led him forth and deliuered him vnto Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius: whose hert was replenyshed and inuironed, with ioye inestimable.</p>

And by decre and ordinaunce, the prouince of Fraunce was committed to hym to be recouered.</p>
                     <p>¶For the same tyme whyle Marius warred in Numi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, and toke Iugurth prisoner: that contrey of Fraunce (whose people that tyme wer named Cimbrians) rebel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led against thempire of Rome. Against whom the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains send forth to represse their rebellion a greate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with .ii. captaines: one named Q. Scipio, the other M.

In so much that both the Romains which liued at that tyme, &amp; al their progenie which succeded them counted al other nacions ready to their obeisance, &amp; to wyn honor by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but thei thought neuer to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend in batel with this nacion of Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wyn glory &amp; honour by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather to defende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe and their libertie: which thinge if they myghte do,

Wherfore (as I haue before recounted) the Senate &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons of Rome decre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed this prouince of Fraunce to Marius for to reuenge the death of their men, and to recouer the contrey.</p>
                     <p>¶But to our purpose: whan Marius shuld enter into Rome, he was ioyfully receiued with great glory &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe, wherof the order was suche. Marius him selfe was set on hye in a golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chaire, which was drawen of foure white palfreis.

Farther, for more ample oste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacion of his glory, &amp; to declare how much he had enriched the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale of Rome, al the elephants, armour, iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, tresure &amp; riches which he had wonne in Numidy of Iugurth, were led &amp; borne before hym. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>natours, all the officers &amp; noble men of Rome, with an vnmesurable multitude of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons receiued hym with al honour and ioye: &amp; conueyed him to the principal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Rome, named the Capitol: wher he made sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with a bull to Iupiter, for his victory after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stume of that tyme. His sacrifice ended: then was he conuaied to the Senate house in his robe triumphall as neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sul was brought before his tyme.
