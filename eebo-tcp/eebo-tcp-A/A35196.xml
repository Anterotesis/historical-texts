         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN
ESSAY
ON
Coyn and Credit:</head>
            <p>AS the Wealth and Greatneſs of
the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by its Trade, ſo its
Trade is carry'd on by its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
this being as neceſſary to a Trading
Nation, as Spirits are to the Circulation
of the Blood in the Body natural, when
thoſe Springs (as I may ſo call them)
Decay, and grow Weak, the Body lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes,
the Blood Stagnates, and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of Death ſoon appear: Nor can a
good Credit be more uſeful to any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then it is to this, where our Trade
hath at all times very much exceeded our
Caſh; I mean the Species of Mony
hath not in any Meaſure anſwer'd the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41345:5"/>
transferring of Properties; and though
herein no Man can be at a Certainty
as to the <hi>quantum,</hi> yet ſuch probable
Conjectures Satisfaction that the Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is very great. If we would make
a Judgment of the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> it
cannot better be done, then by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what the annual Profits of that
Trade may be ſuppoſed to amount unto,
and this cannot better be computed, then
by making a probable Conjecture of the
Charge of its Expences, and this by
ſuch Steps, as may tend to make as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
a diſcovery thereof, as the nature of
the thing will bear. Suppoſe then the
Number of People in <hi>England</hi> to be
Eight Millions, (which is the loweſt
Computation I have ever met with) and
that each Perſon ſpends Eight Pounds
<hi>Per Annum</hi> for his Support, in Proviſions,
Clothes, and other Charges of living,
what any one pays ſhort of this himſelf,
is paid by another; he that is ſed at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man's Table, or wears another
Man's Cloaths, muſt remember that
thoſe neceſſaries are paid for, if not by
himſelf, yet by his Benefactor; add to
this the Charge of ſupporting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
eſpecially in this time of War,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41345:5"/>
and the amount will not be leſs then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi> though every
Man lived but from Hand to Mouth; add
to this Thirty Millions <hi>per Annum</hi> for
the Profits of Trade, which is but
Twenty Pounds to each Family, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Six Perſons to a Family; this
amounts to One Hundred Millions. Here
it muſt be noted, that I comprehend
all transferring of Properties under this
general Notion of Trade; the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,</hi>
the <hi>Tenant,</hi> the <hi>Manufacturer,</hi> the
<hi>Shop-keeper,</hi> the <hi>Merchant,</hi> the <hi>Lawyer,</hi>
all are Traders, ſo far as they live
by getting from each other, and their
Profits ariſe from the Waxing or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our Trade. We are next to
conſider how the Profits of our Trade
ſtand in Competition with Trade it ſelf;
and I believe it will be allowed, that one
with another, they do not amount to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> By this Scheme,
the Trade of <hi>England</hi> muſt be at leaſt a
Thouſand Millions <hi>per Annum;</hi> The
Money of <hi>England</hi> hath generally been
ſuppoſed to be about Seven, ſome have
thought Ten, which, at the higheſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
ſtands in Competition no more
then Ten doth to a Thouſand; this
hath made Credit always ſo neceſſary
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41345:6"/>
our Trade, that without it the other
muſt have ſtood ſtill.</p>
            <p>But the uſefulneſs thereof hath never
ſo much appeared, as now it doth. Here
it will not be amiſs to conſider the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
deſign of Mony, how it came
at firſt to be introduced into Trade, and
the Reaſon there was for mending our
<hi>Silver Money,</hi> and falling of <hi>Guineys.</hi> Our
Fore-fathers, whilſt they kept themſelves
only to the uſe of things neceſſary for
the Support of Life, were content with
what they could either provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or purchaſe from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
with ſuch things wherewith they
abounded, and the others wanted; but
as Pride and Luxury grew into the World,
ſo Mens deſires became more boundleſs,
and their Fancies prompted them to ſeek
after things from a greater diſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to pleaſe their Palates, or to ſet forth
their Grandure; This brought in the
Trade of Buying and Selling, whence
aroſe a ſort of People maintain'd by
Traffick, who ſoon put an end to the
Trade of Barter. And indeed it muſt
needs be ſo, ſince 'twas impoſſible for
them to fit every Man's occaſions, in
ſuch proportions as he required, and at
the ſame time to receive their Payments
in the Commodities wherewith he did
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41345:6"/>
abound, becauſe theſe would not anſwer
their ends in carrying on their Traffick,
therefore ſomething muſt be made the
Standard of Trade, which might be of
equal value in all Places, and a meaſure
to the worth of other Commodities, the
Excellency whereof was not to ariſe ſo
much from any intrinſick value in its ſelf,
as from the uſefulneſs of it to anſwer
that end. Silver was at laſt agreed on
by a common conſent, whoſe worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
from its Fineneſs and Weight; not
that this was eſteemed the richeſt of all
Mettles, Gold ſtanding in a very great
Diſproportion with it, even as to its
Weight, but that being more ſcarſe,
could not ſupply all the occaſions of
Trade, nor indeed could it be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo ſmall parts as Silver might; On
the other Side, Lead, Iron, Tin, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> being more common, would
have been too bulky to be made the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards
of Trade; nor could Diamonds, or
other precious Stones anſwer the end,
for beſides the abuſe which might be put
on the World by their Counterfeits,
their value ariſes only from Fancy, and
from ſuch Rules that a common Eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily diſtinguiſh; Silver being thus
ſettled, became by its Weight and Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
a Standard to the value both of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41345:7"/>
theſe and all other Commodities, which
were purchaſed by a quantity ſet out,
and meaſur'd by the Scale; and this
continued in the former Ages of the
World, till the vaſt increaſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Traffick made the ſeveral
Princes, who found their Advantages by
Trade, endeavour to render it more eaſie
to their Subjects; This was done by
forming Silver into leſſer parts, and by
their Stamp giving a Warrantie both to
the Fineneſs and weight of each Piece,
which they guarded with Laws, equally
Sanguinary with thoſe which ſecured
their Crowns. The firſt was called the
Standard, which is a mixture of ſome
Allay with the fineſt Silver; and though
it might be wiſhed, that all Trading Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had agreed upon the ſame, yet
ſince they have not, the Coyn of each
Nation ſtands in Competition, according
to the true Weight and Fineneſs of the
Silver in their Money, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Denomination; which, were
it not for other Accidents that attend it,
would be the Par and Meaſure of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes.</p>
            <p>The Standard, or Sterling Silver of
this Kingdom, is Eleven Ounces Two
Penny Weight <hi>Troy</hi> of the Fineſt Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41345:7"/>
mixt with Eighteen Penny weight
of Fine Copper, and according to this
Proportion ſhould all our Coyn and
Standard Plate be mixt, which Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
makes it more fit, both for the
Stamp, and alſo for Utenſils, being elſe
too ſoft to be wrought up of its ſelf, and
if more allayed, would become too Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and wear like Braſs, as our Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
generally agree.</p>
            <p>But whatever might be the cauſe that
perſwaded our Kings to ſettle this Allay,
it hath continued to be the Standard of
<hi>England</hi> ever ſince the Reign of King
<hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, being firſt contrived,
and brought hither by the <hi>Eaſterlings,</hi> a
Trading People living in the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi>
Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> who dealt
with us for our Product. Many good
Laws have been ſince made to keep it
from being vitiated, which were they
as well put in Execution, the deceits
uſed by the Workers of that Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to the increaſe of their Private Eſtates,
by abuſing the ignorant Buyers, might
ſoon be put to an end.</p>
            <p>Next, to the fineſs, the weight of
our Money was to be ſecured, and that
to be done in ſuch Parts, that one Piece
ſhould anſwer another. Thus the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41345:8"/>
Crown, as it comes out of the <hi>Mint,</hi>
weighs Nineteen Penny weight and
Eight Grains; the Half Crown, is juſt
one half of that Weight; the Shilling
one Fifth; and the Six Pence one
Tenth; ſo that theſe pieces receive their
values from their Weights, not from their
Names, though ſome unthinking People
have ſuppoſed otherwiſe; which Error
hath been the ground of many Diſputes,
and given Opportunitys to cunning Knaves
of abuſing our Coyn, both by adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Standard, and leſſening its
Weight, and others finding Advantage
by this Confuſion, have deviſed Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to maintain their falſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
ſuch as theſe; that it hath made
Trade to circulate; That it paſt currant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from Man to Man; That it hinder'd
our Money from being carry'd abroad;
and ſuch like; never conſidering that the
Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> may Trade till it
becomes Bankrupt; that it is not Buying
and Selling amongſt our Selves which
makes this Nation Rich, or able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
its Self, but the Trade we drive
with Forreign Nations; particular Men
may get, whilſt the Nation in general
looſes by the Trade it drives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41345:8"/>
It is a certain and undeniable Maxim,
that what is the true Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi>
is the Intereſt of every particular <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Man; for though private Men may ſeem
to get by the ruine of the Publick, this
laſts but for an Age, and their Poſteritys
will have cauſe to lament the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
a Trade ſo driven will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
            <p>No doubt the badneſs of our Money
was the cauſe of a great Circulation in
our Home Trade, but this aroſe from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reaſons then are commonly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and the Conſequence being the
advance of Guinneys, cauſed our Product
and Manufactures to be ſold to Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at undervalues, who would have been
enabled thereby in a ſhort time to have
carryed on the Trade of <hi>Europe</hi> on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Terms then we could.</p>
            <p>Which things being duly conſidered
by our Legiſlative Power, 'twas thought
fit the laſt Seſſions to call in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed.
Money then Currant, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
our Coyn by Degrees to the old
Standard and Weight, this gave freſh
occaſions for Clamours, and the People
were again furniſh'd by the Money Job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
with new Arguments againſt the
Government. Trade 'tis true, was hereby
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41345:9"/>
put to a ſtop, and this could not be helpt,
nothing elſe could be expected when ever
our Money ſhould have come to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the moſt clamorous thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be done, only deſired that it
might be deferred ſome time longer, or
at leaſt (to expreſs it in their own Terms)
that the Money might be raiſed, and that
the Crown might paſs for Six Shillings;
this they did ſuppoſe would cauſe more
Silver to be brought into <hi>England,</hi> and
leſs to be carry'd out, becauſe it would
be worth more in <hi>England,</hi> then in any
other part of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> they argued
in all Companies, that the Trade of
<hi>England</hi> was apparently ſlackened ſince
the Small Money was made unpaſſable,
and Guineys reduc'd from Thirty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to Two and Twenty; whereas they
did not conſider, that this was <hi>Non cauſa
Pro cauſa,</hi> 'twas the Fear and conſtant
Expectation of the calling in and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our Silver Money, and as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
thereof the falling of Guineys,
which made every Man willing to ſhift
off the loſs, and to diſcharge himſelf of
his Money, as faſt as he receiv'd it, by
turning it into ſome Commodities which
he might part with at leſs loſs to himſelf,
then he ſuppoſed the Money would be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41345:9"/>
if he kept it by him, ſo that had the
Parliament gratified theſe Mens deſires,
it would not have had the Conſequence
they expected, becauſe the Standard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once fixt, that uncertainty had cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
I ſpeak thus, becauſe I am obliged
to Anſwer ſuch Arguments in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Propoſer. For my own
Part, I am of Opinion, and I believe
moſt unbyaſſed Men will agree with me,
that Silver cannot be raiſed or fallen in
the Senſe theſe Men would have it; the
true value of Silver conſiſting in its
Weight and Fineneſs, cannot properly
be ſaid to riſe or fall, or to be worth
more in one place then in another; if
Silver riſes, it muſt be either with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to its Self, or to ſomething elſe;
the former is abſurd, an Ounce of fine
Silver cannot be worth more then an
Ounce of the ſame Fineneſs in any
part of the World, nor will the Stamp
make an Alteration, eſpecially in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where Silver in Bullion and in
Coyn muſt be alike, the Coynage here
coſting nothing; and as to the latter, its
Riſe and Fall with reſpect to other things,
this can never be limited by Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Buyer muſt pay for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
he wants, ſuitable to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41345:10"/>
and their Scarcity; thus one
Day a thing is worth an Ounce of Silver,
which at another time is not worth half
ſo much.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I would ask theſe People,
whether they think that a Crown or
Five Shilling piece as now Coyned, can
be worth any where, either at Home or
Abroad, Six ſingle Shillings of the ſame
Coyn, or to ſpeak plainer, Six pieces
of Silver, each one Fifth part of an
Ounce of the ſame Standard and Fineneſs?
if they think it can be ſo at home, they
may ſoon ruine themſelves by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and if it cannot here, why ſhould it
be ſo Abroad? Does any Man ſuppoſe
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> or other Forreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will make ſuch a Change? if they
will, 'tis our Intereſt to ſend our Coyn
to them, and this will be the way to
augment, and not to leſſen the quantity
of our Silver.</p>
            <p>But all this is a jeſt, for no Nation eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teems
Silver but for its Weight and
Fineneſs; and though the Money of ſome
Countreys may not agree with ours of
the ſame Denomination in either, yet
the Exchange ſets that right. Thus the
<hi>French</hi> Crown (called there Six Shillings,
or three Livres) hath not uſually been
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41345:10"/>
worth in Exchange above Fifty Six of our
Pence; now ſhould any Man be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
to bring it thence, and expect to
paſs it here for Six Shillings, becauſe 'tis
called ſo there, he would ſoon ſee, that
neither our Goldſmiths nor Traders would
take notice of the Denomination; on the
other ſide, ſhould any one carry the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Crown to <hi>France,</hi> becauſe 'tis there
worth above Three of their Livres, vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Six Shillings, he would find no more
Advantage, either in Buying of Goods, or
remitting it home again, then he might
have made by Exchange When our
Coyn was Corrupt and Baſe, all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
roſe upon us, but now it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to its ancient Standard, Exchange
returns to its old Courſe; not that the
Standard of our Money is always the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Rule of our Exchange, the Ballance
of our Trade often cauſes it to alter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to our Advantage, or to our Loſs,
beſides the Charge of Management; But
this is little in Compariſon with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
a familiar inſtance we have in the
Caſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, whilſt our Coyn
was Baſe, Seventy Pounds was worth
one Hundred Pounds here, which was in
ſome meaſure proportionable with the
value of Pieces of Eight, (which they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41345:11"/>
took in <hi>Ireland</hi> by weight) to our Clipt
Money, and alſo to our Guinneys at
Thirty Shillings <hi>per</hi> piece; and how far
this carried the Trade of <hi>England</hi> into
that Kingdom, the Traders to the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
have been too ſenſible; but ſince
the Error of our Coyn hath been Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
that very Exchange is ſo much
varied, that One Hundred Pounds here
is worth One Hundred and Fifteen Pounds
there.</p>
            <p>And ſince I have mentioned Guinneys,
I cannot let them paſs without ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations;
how eager was the conteſt
for keeping them up to that exorbitant
value? and how unwillingly did the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
Changers, and thoſe whom they had
deceived, yield to the Alteration? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was well known that the reaſon
why Guineys were ſo high was the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Coyn; Gold doth not receive
a value from the Stamp, but whether in
the Maſs, or in the Coyn, its Weight
and Fineneſs are to be regarded; the
Standard of both in <hi>England</hi> is the ſame,
being Twenty Two Caracts of fineſt
Gold, One Caract fineſt Silver, and one
Caract fineſt Copper; the Guinuea is
Five Penny Weight and Eight Grains,
which at the price of Four Pounds <hi>per</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41345:11"/>
Ounce (when Money was at its full Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
and Weight) came to One and
Twenty Shillings and Four Pence, but
when our Coyn was ſo Corrupted, that
Thirty Shillings contained no more Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
then Twenty One Shillings and
Four Pence formerly did, 'twas neceſſary
Guineys ſhould riſe, to put them on an
equal Baſis with Silver; on the other
ſide, when the Currant Coyn of the
Kingdom came to be rectifyed, and One
and Twenty Shillings and Four Pence
contained the ſame quantity of Silver it
formerly did, Guinneys muſt as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
fall, becauſe their value did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from their Denomination, but from
a proportionable ſtanding of their Weight
in Competition with the Weight of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and by the way, it is to be obſerved,
That Guinneys at Twenty two Shillings
(as now allowed to paſs by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament)
are worth Eight Pence <hi>per</hi> piece,
or Three <hi>per Cent,</hi> more then Standard
Gold in the Maſs will yield at Four
Pounds <hi>per</hi> Ounce.</p>
            <p>Here I would ask this Queſtion, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Guiney were adulterated, and
mixt with one Sixth part Copper, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of perfect Standard, were diminiſhed
one ſixth part in its Weight, whether
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41345:12"/>
ſuch a Guinney would ever have yielded
ſo much Silver as another of its full weight
and Fineneſs? if not, why then ſhould a
good Guinney be ſold for leſs then its
value in Silver, for the ſake of the Stamp
on our debaſed Money? or now our Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Money is rectifyed, why ſhould it
not ſtand in the ſame Competition with
Gold, as formerly it did? if it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that Gold is dearer in Forreign
Parts then it is here; I deſire to know
whether Gold ſtands in a greater Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
there with Silver as to its weight
and Fineneſs? I believe upon a ſtrict
Enquiry 'twill be ſound quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>I know it is objected, that Guineys
paſs for Twenty Six Shillings in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and that this advance on them there (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about Eighteen <hi>per Cent</hi>) will cauſe
our Guineys to be carryed thither; let
thoſe Gentlemen conſider, that Exchange
between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is at Fifteen
<hi>per Cent</hi> in our Favour, beſides Inſurance
by Sea, and riſque of Carriage by Land,
which cannot be reckoned leſs then Six
<hi>per Cent</hi> more, and they will then find
on making up the Accompt, that they
were better leave their Guineys in
<hi>London,</hi> and take Bills for their Money
payable in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41345:12"/>
One thing more I would obſerve to
theſe Gentelmen in their own Dialect,
that as our Coyn grew bad, ſo Standard
Silver roſe in its Price, thoſe who had it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Six Shillings and Six Pence to
Seven Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce of the then cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Coyn</hi> of the Kingdom, the Reaſon
of which is Plain from what hath been
ſaid before.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Arguments brought
againſt ſettling the <hi>Standard</hi> of our <hi>Money</hi>
as now 'tis happily done; if <hi>Silver</hi> ſay
they had been advanced to <hi>Six Shillings</hi>
per <hi>Ounce,</hi> this would have made it more
plenty amongſt us, becauſe that would
have cauſed more to have been brought
in, and leſs to have been carryed out.</p>
            <p>Here I muſt beg leave to diſſent from
their Opinion, and on the contrary to offer
it as mine, that if our <hi>Money</hi> had been
advanced, leſs <hi>Silver</hi> had been brought
into <hi>England,</hi> and more according to that
Proportion carryed out.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, we muſt conſider that
<hi>Silver</hi> is not a Commodity of the growth
of this Land, nor of the <hi>Plantations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, but of a Neighbouring
<hi>Nation,</hi> from whom we purchaſe it for our
<hi>Product</hi> and <hi>Manufacturers,</hi> and according
to the price we make of them Abroad,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41345:13"/>
ſo much more <hi>Silver</hi> do we bring home
for them; now ſeeing <hi>Silver</hi> could not be
advanced to <hi>Six Shillings</hi> per <hi>Ounce</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then by ſtanding ſo in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with all <hi>Commodities</hi> both in Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Selling, the Conſequence of
ſuch an Advance had been this, that our
<hi>Manufactures</hi> would have been ſold for
ſo much leſs <hi>Silver</hi> in Forreign Markets,
as the Price of <hi>Silver</hi> was advanced at
Home; thus the piece of <hi>Bays,</hi> which
formerly yielded <hi>Twenty Ounces</hi> of <hi>Silver,</hi>
being <hi>Five Pounds</hi> whilſt <hi>Silver</hi> ſtood at
<hi>Five Shillings</hi> per <hi>Ounce,</hi> would then have
been Sold for <hi>Sixteen Ounces</hi> and two
<hi>Thirds,</hi> which, at <hi>Six Shillings</hi> per <hi>Ounce,</hi>
is the ſame Sum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Exporter
would have gained as much by his Trade,
becauſe that quantity of <hi>Silver</hi> would
have ſtood in the ſame Competition
with any <hi>Commodities</hi> he was to purchaſe
here for a <hi>New Adventure,</hi> as <hi>Twenty Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
formerly did; but on the other ſide,
not <hi>one Ounce</hi> leſs would have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
Abroad then now there is, which
muſt have been ſo much the greater Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the Nation, as our Imports
thereof had been leſſened; here we are
to Conſider, what it is that cauſes the
exporting, of our <hi>Silver,</hi> and upon a due
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41345:13"/>
Conſideration we ſhall find, that as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Ballance of our Trade
brings it in, ſo nothing but the Ballance
of our Trade with particular places car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
it out, neither of them proceeding
from the choice of the <hi>Merchant,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
rather to Trade in any other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
<hi>Silver</hi> neither anſwering
Freights nor Inſurances; and therefore
it is that our <hi>Merchants</hi> bring home from
<hi>Spain,</hi> all the <hi>Wines, Fruit, Wooll, Iron,
Cochineal,</hi> they can get, and whatever
elſe is fit to Load their <hi>Ships,</hi> before
they meddle with <hi>Money;</hi> But the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of our Trade with <hi>Spain</hi> being ſo
much in our Favour, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
thereof cannot make it good, we
are oblig'd to bring home the reſt in
<hi>Bullion;</hi> on the other Side, there are
ſome places that neceſſarily require <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
to be exported, but let no Man
think that the Denomination of <hi>Money</hi>
will give it the greater value in thoſe
Countreys, the <hi>Silver</hi> we ſend thither
being valuable only by its Weight and
Fineneſs; As for our Trade with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
That often varies in its Ballance,
ſome Years it may be for us, and other
Years againſt us, as Accidents happen,
though I am of Opinion it hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41345:14"/>
been in our Favour; This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that if we run in Debt more then
we can pay by our Product and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
the reſt muſt be paid in <hi>Silver,</hi>
and the Receiver will take it at his
own Price, whatever value we may put
on it here; 'tis true, Exchange is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
where the Ballance is variable,
and that likewiſe muſt riſe upon us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Advance we make on our
<hi>Money;</hi> but where the Ballance is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, there Exchange cannot keep
our <hi>Silver</hi> at home, becauſe That alſo
muſt be provided for by Shipping it out.</p>
            <p>And as the Ballance of Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and <hi>Spain</hi> is in our Favour, and
thereby furniſhes us with <hi>Silver,</hi> ſo I am
of Opinion, that the Ballance of the
General Trade we drive in <hi>Europe</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in our Favour, otherwiſe 'twould be
impoſſible to keep that <hi>Silver</hi> at home
which we bring from <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince we
receive from abroad ſo great a ſupply
of the Commodities we uſe, which
would neceſſarily draw it away, were
they not the purchaſe of our Product
and Manufactures; therefore it appears
to me, that ſeeing our <hi>Silver</hi> increaſes,
the Ballance of our General Trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
likewiſe in our favour; whoever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41345:14"/>
will but conſider the great Conſumption
of <hi>Plate</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> by its being wrought
up into Utenfils for private Families,
and the great quantities wherewith the
Houſes of our Nobility and Gentry do
abound, even in thoſe common Maſly
things, which our Fore-fathers made of
<hi>Iron, Tin, Braſs,</hi> and <hi>Wood,</hi> may rather
wonder, how our Trade ſupplies ſo much
<hi>Silver,</hi> then that it brings home no
more; hence comes our want of it for
the <hi>Mint;</hi> and till the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
grow ſo wiſe, as to ſet the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
on ſeeing an Hundred <hi>Ounces</hi> of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
in their Houſes in the <hi>Coyn</hi> of the
Nation, as they now do in <hi>Plate</hi>
wrought up, we ſhall be ever complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for want of <hi>Money;</hi> though were this
done, and all the <hi>Plate</hi> of <hi>England Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
up, I am ſtill of Opinion, that there
would not be ſufficient to carry on our
<hi>Trade</hi> without a <hi>Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis our <hi>Manufastures</hi> and <hi>Product</hi> which
furniſh this <hi>Kingdom</hi> with <hi>Silver,</hi> and
the more they yield Abroad, the greater
is our Supply; whence 'tis plain, that
the <hi>Trade</hi> we now drive by means of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi>
to the <hi>Spaniſh West-Indies,</hi> is more
profitable to us in the Sales of our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures;</hi>
then when we ſent them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41345:15"/>
to <hi>Cadiz;</hi> in the One they yielded
<hi>Twenty</hi> per <hi>Cent</hi> advance, in the other
they ſell for <hi>Cent</hi> per <hi>Cent,</hi> all paid
in the ſame Specie.</p>
            <p>But let us duely conſider what had
been the Conſequence of raiſing our
<hi>Money</hi> at Home to <hi>Six Shilling</hi> the <hi>Crown,</hi>
as theſe Men deſired it; for either our
Goods would have roſe ſuitably with
it, or they would not; if they had, the
raiſing of our <hi>Money</hi> would have done us
no Service, becauſe it would have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
no greater quantities of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
then before, only it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed
with this ill Conſequence,
that the <hi>Landlords</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Poor,</hi>
the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer,</hi> and all who depend on ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Salaries, would have had their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
leſſened a Sixth part at once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Houſe-keeping and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
would have coſt them a Sixth
part more then they did before; But if
<hi>Rents, Wages, Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Sallaries,</hi> muſt
riſe ſuitable to the <hi>Money,</hi> what fignifies
its Advance? On the other ſide, if
Goods do not riſe as our <hi>Money</hi> is made
leſs, Forreign Nations will be ſupplyed
with our Product and Manufactures for
Five Sixths of their true value, whilſt
we grow poor by our General Trade,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41345:15"/>
and yet the Expences of every Private
Family be encreaſed, ſo far as they
make uſe of Forreign Commodities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Money</hi> cannot be raiſed, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into leſs Pieces, and this hath been
a great Stumbling Block to many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who have not well conſidered the
Difference; they tell us that a <hi>Penny</hi> in
former days was the ſame with <hi>Three
Pence</hi> now; this muſt be granted, and
yet it makes no difference, Twenty of
thoſe <hi>Pence</hi> made a <hi>Crown</hi> then, and ſo
they do now, only for the Conveniency
of our <hi>Trade,</hi> later Reigns have thought
fit to Coyn Pieces of <hi>Silver</hi> one Third
part of their Weight, and to call them
by the ſame Denomination, and yet
thoſe pieces receive no value from their
Name, but ſtand in an equal Proportion
with the other, Sixty of them making
a <hi>Crown;</hi> in like manner, ſhould the
<hi>Crown</hi> be divided into Six Parts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Name we might call them by, the
true value of each would be but Ten
<hi>Pence;</hi> but this being already ſettled by
Law, 'tis to be hoped that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
will not eaſily be prevailed with to
alter it.</p>
            <p>The thing I chiefly aim at is ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41345:16"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> to conſider how a Credit may
be ſettled in this Nation, as good, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much better then what hath been
loſt; That Trade cannot be driven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, I have offered at in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Treatiſe, and that it cannot
be ſupplyed by advancing our <hi>Money,</hi> or
any thing of that Nature, ſeems to me
out of douht; we are next to conſider,
what may be done; all former Methods
we ſee have failed, and indeed they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had a Foundation fit to ſupport the
Building raiſed on them; our Bank, and
Bankers had too much of ſelf in them,
to be the Support of a National Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Credit</hi> I take to be That, which makes
a ſmaller Sum of <hi>Money</hi> paſs as far as agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſerve all the ends of <hi>Trade</hi> as well,
and to give Satisfaction to every one
Concern'd, that he is ſafe in what he
doth, for if the leaſt Room is juſtly left
for doubt, ſo far is the <hi>Credit</hi> weakened;
It muſt be ſuch a <hi>Credit,</hi> as will anſwer
all the occaſions both of the <hi>Government,</hi>
and alſo of the <hi>Trader;</hi> It muſt be ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as to provide for thoſe who are out
of <hi>Trade,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Widdows, Orphans, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and others, who living by <hi>Uſury,</hi> care
muſt be taken that their <hi>Money</hi> may never
lye dead on their Hands, and that their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41345:16"/>
Security be unqueſtionable; by which
means, though they lend cheaper, yet
their Ptofit at the end of Seven Years
will be greater, then it formerly was,
when the rate of Intereſt was higher, but
attended with Accidents; It muſt be ſuch
a <hi>Credit,</hi> that the <hi>Trader</hi> may have <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
on ſuch reaſonable Security as he is
able to give, and for ſo long time as
he ſhall have need to uſe it, and yet That
Security be made ſtrong enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Sum borrowed; by which means
our Products will be increaſed, our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
incouraged, and our <hi>Fiſhery,</hi>
with other Forreign Trades, managed
on Terms equal with our Neighbours;
It muſt be ſuch a <hi>Credit,</hi> that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> may be furniſh'd with
<hi>Money</hi> at low Intereſt, and be permitted
to make their Payments by ſuch Parts
as they can beſt ſpare it, the want of
which is now a Clog on their Eſtates,
and eats up very good Families, who
when they are once gotten into the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
Books, can find no way out: ſuch
unhappy Gentlemen have too often their
Houſes filled with <hi>Scriveners</hi> and <hi>Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
who entertain them with the croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Muſick of <hi>Procuration</hi> and <hi>Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
till they have devoured their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41345:17"/>
It muſt be ſuch a <hi>Credit</hi> as ſhall
have an eſteem in Forreign Parts, and
make the <hi>Traders</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> deſire to houſe
their <hi>Money</hi> here; It muſt be ſo ſetled,
that the <hi>Nations</hi> Debts may be as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
paid as Forreign Bills, and all
Men who truſt the <hi>Government</hi> as well
aſſured of their <hi>Money</hi> when due, as they
are now from the moſt reputable <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;</hi>
then the King will buy cheap,
when all who ſerve him are paid exactly,
and the meaneſt <hi>Trades Men</hi> will not be
afraid to deal with the Publick, when
they are ſure to be paid according to
their Contracts, which now none but large
Stocks can adventure to do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make their own Terms; It muſt be
ſo ſetled, that he who hath <hi>Money</hi> in one
place of <hi>England</hi> may have it in any other
Place where he ſhall want it, at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
Charge, which cannot now
be done, without locally altering the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and carrying the <hi>Money</hi> to the place
where 'tis wanted; this will prevent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Robberies now committed; It muſt be
ſo ſetled, that as on the one ſide it may
anſwer the ends of the Borrower, ſo on
the other ſide it may likewiſe of the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
In a word, It muſt be a <hi>Credit</hi> ſet,
led on an unqueſtionable Foundation,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41345:17"/>
which may be wound up to a perpetual
Circulation, like thoſe Waters, which
being firſt drawn up from the <hi>Sea,</hi>
then ſhower'd down on the Earth, and
ſtrained through its porous Cranies,
glide through the <hi>Rivers</hi> into the <hi>Sea</hi> again
from whence they came, where they
become the Subject Matter for future Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Credit</hi> thus fix'd muſt needs be of
great Advantage to this Kingdom, and
ſhould it coſt an <hi>Hundred Thouſand Pounds
per Annum</hi> to carry it on, yet the <hi>Nation</hi>
would gain many <hi>Millions</hi> by it, though
if rightly ſetled, It will not only ſupport
its own Charge, but bring in a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Publick; ſuch a <hi>Credit</hi> as
This would make us the Envy of all our
<hi>Neighbours,</hi> who though they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it, are not able by the Conſtitutions
of their Governments to effect it.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe all the Advantages the
<hi>Nation</hi> will reap by a well ſetled <hi>Credit;</hi>
for beſides, that out of the Profits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
new Stocks might be provided for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Men, who, having been bred
up in <hi>Trades</hi> beneficial to the <hi>Nation,</hi>
and careful in thoſe <hi>Imployments,</hi> have
yet been forced to ſtoop under the Load
of their Croſs <hi>Fortunes;</hi> which Wheels
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41345:18"/>
being again ſet at Work, will by their
Circular Motion carry round many others,
and by theſe Means in time reimburſe
their Benefactor; much like unto well
manured Lands, whoſe plentiful Crops
do ſoon repay the Charge of Soiling laid
out on them by their Proprietors, with
Advantage, On the other ſide, Rewards
might be raiſed for thoſe, whoſe honeſt
Heads have grown Gray in the Service
of the Publick; and herein we ſhould
imitate our Wiſe Neighbours, who do
the ſame out of the antient <hi>Demeſn</hi> of
<hi>Holland,</hi> though in another way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they give Incouragement to thoſe
who paſs through the Imployments of
their <hi>State,</hi> to ſerve it with Integrity, by
an expectation to obtain this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Profitable Retreat in their Old
Ages.</p>
            <p>I ſay beſides theſe, many great things
might be done for this Nation out of the
Profits of this <hi>Bank;</hi> as the Draining of
Levels: Regaining Lands out of the <hi>Sea;</hi>
maintaining Lights for the Direction
of Navigation; providing Imployments
for the <hi>Poor;</hi> all which would more then
pay the Expences laid out on them, and
are Works too great for common Stocks,
and fit only for Parliaments to undertake;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41345:18"/>
New Inventions might be rewarded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they were found uſeful to the
Publick, which would be better then
confining their uſe for Fourteen Years
to the Inventor; Committees or Councils
of Trade might be erected; and Courts
Merchants ſettled for the more eaſie and
quick deciding of Differences relating to
<hi>Trade,</hi> which after great expences in
<hi>Weſtminiſter-Hall,</hi> are now uſually referred
to the Determination of Thoſe, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them better then the <hi>Lawyers</hi> can
pretend to do; Ships of <hi>War</hi> might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be built, fitted out, and ſeparated
for the Security of our <hi>Trade;</hi> and all
this out of thoſe Profits, which formerly
ſlid through private <hi>Channels</hi> into the
Pockets of uſeleſs Men, who muſt be
then forced to betake themſelves to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
more Serviceable to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
in this we ſhould out do our induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> even in
their own way.</p>
            <p>And ſince I have mentioned a Council
of <hi>Trade,</hi> I cannot let it paſs without
ſome Reflections, (though I have ſhewn
the Advantages thereof, if well ſettled,
in another Treatiſe) we generally imploy
Commiſſioners in the Management of
things of much meaner Circumſtances,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41345:19"/>
and believe they cannot be well carryed
on without them, who are ſuppoſed to
underſtand what they undertake: whilſt
at the ſame time, the general <hi>Trade</hi> of
the <hi>Nation</hi> (which is the ſupport of all)
lyes neglected, as if the Coggs which
directed its Wheels did not require skill
to keep them true; <hi>Trade</hi> requires as much
Policy as Matters of State, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be kept in a regular Motion by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident;
when the frame of our <hi>Trade</hi> is
out of Order, we know not where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to mend it, for want of a Sett of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Builders, ready to receive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
and able to judge where the
defect lies; 'tis not the twiſting of Laws,
and forcing them beyond, and ſometimes
contrary to their firſt Intentions, under
pretence of advancing His Majeſty's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
will anſwer that end; nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the <hi>Merchants</hi> with unneceſſary and
Groundleſs Suits, wherein the King's Name
and Purſe are often made uſe or to ſcreen
the Ignorance of Self Conceited Officers;
Honeſty, Induſtry, and good Judgment,
are three neceſſary Qualifications for
ſuch as are employed in the Publick
Revenue; if Reads vers'd in <hi>Trade</hi>
were ſet at Work, the King's Cuſtoms
might be advanced many Thouſand
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41345:19"/>
Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> by ſuch proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
as would at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<hi>Trade,</hi> and enrich the <hi>Trader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certain, we cannot ſupport our
<hi>Trade</hi> long without a Subſtantial <hi>Credit,</hi>
every Man running daily in Debt, and
not knowing which way to get out of
it; the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> will not anſwer
the occaſions we have to uſe it, by
which means there is a difference already
of Fifteen <hi>per Cent</hi> between <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi>
which muſt be paid, where Mens ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
do require the former, thus our
Forreign Bills will become a Burthen on
<hi>Trade,</hi> when the Premio of raiſing <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
to pay them ſhall be ſo great, and
conſequently the Importer muſt advance
it in his Sales, which will be a heavy
<hi>Tax</hi> on the <hi>Nation;</hi> both <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and
<hi>Traders</hi> who are engaged in <hi>Bonds,</hi> muſt
either make them a ſtanding Charge on
their Eſtates, or pay them off at Fifteen
<hi>per Cent</hi> loſs; and this is not likely to
grow better, but rather worſe; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailer
will be the happieſt Man, who hath
the Conveniency of raiſing <hi>Money,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he may purchaſe Bank Bills, and
pay his Creditors with them, for which
Opportunities will not be wanting in all
places of <hi>England,</hi> when the <hi>Cloathiers</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41345:20"/>
ſhall be forced to receive them in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from their <hi>Factors</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> under
pretence that they had them for their
Cloath, which, whether true or no,
they will have a fair Opportunity to put
upon them; theſe Bills not anſwering the
<hi>Clothiers</hi> Occaſions, who muſt have <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
to pay their Workmen, will be ſold
to <hi>Shop-keepers</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> who will
return them thither again, to anſwer the
<hi>Credits</hi> they have received there; This
will ſuddenly be our State, and the <hi>Trade</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> Center in that great City, to
the prejudice of all other Sea-Ports, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſome Care be taken to better our
<hi>Credit;</hi> for though our ſupply of <hi>Money</hi>
may annually increaſe from the <hi>Mints,</hi>
yet there will be People ready to catch
it up, in order to make theſe Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and indeed every Man, to whoſe
Hands <hi>Money</hi> ſhall come, will endeavour
to do the ſame, ſo that to what a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the King's Affairs will in a ſhort
time be reduced, 'twill not be difficult
to Gueſs, when, beſides former Cloggs,
another addition of Fifteen <hi>per Cent</hi> ſhall
be added to all the <hi>Money</hi> is taken up
for the Occaſions of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41345:20"/>
I am of Opinion that whatever Dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficulties
may ſeem to attend the ſettling
of ſuch a <hi>Credit,</hi> yet it may be done,
and I humbly Conceive that Methods
may be Propoſed, ſuch as may anſwer all
the <hi>Ends</hi> Intended by it; but then it
muſt be done with an Eye deſigning only
the general <hi>Good,</hi> Self muſt be clear ſhut
out, and had we more publick <hi>Spirits,</hi>
things which ſeem difficult would appear
more eaſie; Self Intereſt, as it Byaſſes
our Judgments, ſo it perplexes our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
a frank free <hi>Spirit</hi> for the common
Good will go a great way in a generous
undertaking, and the Publick is able to
reward ſuch honeſt Endeavours, which
'twas better they did, then ſuffer the
<hi>Treaſure</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> to be eat up by
<hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> and other <hi>Harpies,</hi> who prey
upon our <hi>Vitals;</hi> bv the one the generous
undertaker is no Charge to the Publick,
but increaſes its Treaſure, whilſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leſſens it, and deſtroys our <hi>Trade</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bargain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Face</hi> of our <hi>Affairs</hi> ſeems to look
lowring with reſpect to theſe three Things;
the meanneſs of our <hi>Credit;</hi> the laugniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our <hi>Trade:</hi> and the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Publick Offices in relation to
both; I do not mention this to amuſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41345:21"/>
the <hi>Nation,</hi> but as deplorable as things
ſeem to be, I doubt not a Remedy may
be found out to rectiſie all, if Men of
quick and ſtrong thoughts were ſet about
it.</p>
            <p>I have already ſpoken to the firſt, our
<hi>Credit;</hi> The next is our <hi>Trade,</hi> which
muſt be acknowledged to have laboured
under the neglect of a tedious, bnt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<hi>War;</hi> and this is not our Caſe
alone, all <hi>Europe</hi> has felt the ſmart of it,
and <hi>France</hi> hath had little Cauſe to boaſt;
I am apt to think it hath lighted more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
on that Nation then any other, it
hath ſeized on the <hi>Vitals</hi> of her <hi>Trade,</hi>
which it hath not done on ours; Here
let us Conſider what are the <hi>Vitals</hi> of
the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and we ſhall find
them to be, <hi>Wines, Brandy, Paper, Silks,
Salt,</hi> and <hi>Linnens,</hi> in all which both our
Selves, and other <hi>Nations,</hi> have made
ſuch a Progreſs, that the <hi>French,</hi> who
live by them, will ſcarce ever recover
the Blow they have Received; On the
other ſide, the <hi>Vitals</hi> of this Kingdom
are, our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> our <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> and
our <hi>Plantation Trade;</hi> As to the firſt, it
muſt be confeſt our Loſſes at Sea have
been great, and lighted heavy on the
Exporters, but ſtill the <hi>Manufactury</hi> it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41345:21"/>
felf hath not ſuffered, no other <hi>Nation</hi>
hath beat us out of the making of them,
nor hath had occaſion to diſuſe them for
want of a ſupply; and if our <hi>Woollen
Manufactures</hi> ſink not in their Reputations
Abroad, and Care be taken to ſecure
our own <hi>Wooll</hi> from being carryed out,
and to get that of <hi>Ireland</hi> brought hither
<hi>Unmanufactured,</hi> farther Improvements
may yet be made to the advantage of the
<hi>Nation;</hi> but having ſpoken largely to this
Subject in my <hi>Eſſay</hi> on <hi>Trade,</hi> I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
the <hi>Reader</hi> to it, where I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſhewed how the <hi>Wool</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> may
be ſecured hither; I ſhall only now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it as my Opinion, that better Steps
may be made towards keeping our own
from being Exported then have yet
been done; I confeſs all the Laws I
have yet ſeen about <hi>VVool</hi> ſeem to reach
but half way, they depend too much on
Force and Penalties, and too little on
Policy; we muſt begin deeper, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the <hi>VVool</hi> from the time of its grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till 'tis wrought up into <hi>Manufactures;</hi>
This may be done by practicable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
and nothing leſs then this can do
it; our Laws muſt be ſo framed, that it
ſhall be the Intereſt of every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in <hi>Wool</hi> to put them in Execution;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41345:22"/>
Proviſion muſt be made to ſupply the
Growers in all <hi>Countreys</hi> with <hi>Money</hi> to
ſerve their Occaſions, and when they
ſhall ſee it more their Advantage to ſell
their <hi>Wooll,</hi> to be wrought up at Home,
then to be ſent Abroad, no doubt they
will do it. Men are not apt to deſire the
ruine of their <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> but when
they think themſelves neglected, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
provoked to take ſuch Courſes, as
they would not otherwiſe do; Thoſe of
<hi>Rumny Marſh</hi> complain of this, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
few <hi>Clothiers,</hi> their <hi>Wooll</hi> lyes on
their Hands whilſt other <hi>Counties</hi> have
any to ſell, by which Means their Rents
are unpaid, whilſt their <hi>Tenants</hi> have
ſometimes Three Years <hi>Wool</hi> on their
Hands; now ſay they, let us be ſure of
our <hi>Money</hi> once in a Year, we our Selves
would take Care that none ſhould be
Exported, 'tis not the Price but the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that prompts us to take theſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which, in our own Judgments, we
think deſtructive to the <hi>Nation;</hi> This
might eaſily be done if our <hi>Credit</hi> were
well ſetled, and <hi>Wool</hi> might be made a
better Staple then now it is; nor am I
of Opinion that the beating down its
Price is our Advantage, 'twould bear a
better Rate if we could keep it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41345:22"/>
ſhipt out; I belive this Malady
might be ſoon Cured, were the thing
well Conſidered.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Vital</hi> in <hi>Trade</hi> is our <hi>Fiſhery</hi>
wherein we have had greater advantages
then the <hi>French;</hi> the <hi>Ports</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> have
been open to us, which have been ſhut
to them; This might be improved very
much to the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> were a good
<hi>Credit</hi> ſettled; many Hundred Thouſand
Pounds might then be raiſed from theſe
<hi>Northern Seas,</hi> which would be all Profit
to the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither have we ſuffered in our <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
Trade</hi> by this <hi>War</hi> ſo much as the
<hi>French</hi> have done; I do not ſay we
have not ſuffered in our <hi>Navigation,</hi> but
our <hi>Plantations</hi> are not leſſened ſince the
<hi>War</hi> began; and our Loſſes by <hi>Sea</hi> have
in ſome Meaſure been made good to us
by our <hi>Neighbours</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and others,
who have depended on us for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
to whom we have ſold both our
<hi>Sugars</hi> and <hi>Tobacco,</hi> at higher Priſes then
we could have done, if all our Ships had
come home well; Theſe are our <hi>Golden
Mines,</hi> and have helpt to ſupport the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of our <hi>Trade</hi> during the <hi>War,</hi> their
<hi>Products</hi> being clear Profit to the <hi>Nation;</hi>
and might be yet more Serviceable, were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41345:23"/>
Laws made which might effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
all their <hi>Product</hi> to be brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
eſpecially <hi>Tobacco,</hi> whereby we
might as it were put a <hi>Tax</hi> on moſt parts
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and make them pay towards
the Support of our <hi>Government;</hi> 'Tis a
mighty advantage to a <hi>Nation,</hi> when it
produces a <hi>Commodity,</hi> ſo generally deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſo univerſally uſed, as <hi>Tobacco</hi> is,
which, Cuſtome hath to ſome People
made equally-neceſſary with Proviſions, ſo
that they can as well be without the one, as
the other; ſuch a <hi>Trade</hi> as this, ought
to be guarded with a great-deal of Care,
and all our Laws ſhould tend to make it
eaſie; where great <hi>Duties</hi> are laid, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
ſhould be uſed to have them
equally paid, elſe Men do not Trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
but the honeſt <hi>Importer</hi> will be under
ſold by him, that runs them; I humbly
Conceive, a <hi>Modell</hi> might be propoſed to
make this Commodity much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to ſhut
out <hi>Strangers</hi> from being concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
ways may be found out to ſecure <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi>
from the time of its being cured in
the <hi>Plantations,</hi> till the <hi>Duties</hi> were paid
in <hi>England,</hi> and by ſuch Practicable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
that none ſhould go beſides the
<hi>Mill,</hi> or be Exported to <hi>Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:41345:23"/>
till it had firſt paid a <hi>Toll</hi> here; If
this were done, we might ſet almoſt
what Price we thought fit thereon to
<hi>Forreign Parts;</hi> ſuch a <hi>Trade</hi> as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
all the Incouragement the <hi>Nation</hi>
can give, both to the <hi>Planter,</hi> and alſo to
the <hi>Importer,</hi> which cannot be done by
any Laws I have yet ſeen, but new ones
may be made, whereby the former might
be incouraged to raiſe greater quantities,
and the latter to fetch them Home, and
the <hi>Government</hi> might receive a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Revenue thereon, both from the
<hi>Retailer,</hi> and the <hi>Exporter,</hi> with very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Charge, were a <hi>National Credit</hi> well
ſettled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly;</hi> The Publick Affairs cannot be
expected to be Managed well till a good
<hi>Credit</hi> is ſetled, and from hence do ariſe
all our Miſeries; 'Tis a Shame to ſee
how Its <hi>Debts</hi> are Compounded, and thoſe
who truſt It forced to make Proviſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
by great Over-charges, whilſt
the <hi>Nation</hi> pays the whole, The reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
devoured by <hi>Agents, Tally-Buyers,
Sollicitors, Goldſmiths,</hi> and others, who
raiſe great Eſtates on the ruine of the
Publick: beſides the exceſſive Rates the
KING is now forced to pay for <hi>Money,</hi>
and the Chain of ill Conſequences that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41345:24"/>
attend the non payment to ſuch as are
imployed: Our <hi>Souldiers</hi> would fight more
Couragiouſly, and our <hi>Sailers</hi> ſerve more
willingly, were they paid more Punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
and I dare preſume to ſay, that
if a <hi>Credit</hi> had been well ſetled at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this War, it might have been
carryed on with better Succeſs, and we
appeared more formidable to the <hi>French</hi>
then we have done, for half the Charge
it hath now coſt the <hi>Nation.</hi>
