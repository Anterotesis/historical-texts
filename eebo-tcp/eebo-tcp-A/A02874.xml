         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it is to entermeddle in those controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
wherein the minds of men being
stiffened in conceite, and possessed with
preiudice of opinion, they esteeme a man
in that degree learned or vnlearned,
wise or weake, according as hee doth either iump or iarre
with them in iudgement. But in these high controuersies of
state, it is dangerous also for a priuate man to deale; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that he may be assured not to escape the blowes of
them, whose enuious disposition cannot looke right vpon
any thing, nor endure the burthen of another mans deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
well; but especially, for that diuers times he engageth
his safetie vpon vncertaine euents, wherein his hazards do
very farre surmount his hopes.</p>
            <p>And yet, because in ciuill differences we cannot but hold
such for enemies, as, either through negligence, which is ill,
or through feare, which is worse, stand in shew of Neuters,
expecting the issue with an idle eye; for that it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth,
that by withdrawing our selues in the beginning of

which will ruinate so many as it doth rule; nor

alwaies esteemed more base than begging; nor by any false
and foolish ouerweening, whereby many doe conceiue that
nothing can be well either determined or done, except they
haue a finger in it: but first, for loue to the good of the state,
whereto we are by all true rules most neerely tied; and next,
in dutie toward his Maiestie, to whom we are not onely in
conscience but in necessitie bound to bee loyall. Touching
whom, it concerneth vs also to consider, in what state of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he shall stand, and how others will be encouraged

good of the state, so wise in discerning what is good; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we are not resolute but rash, and our constancie is no

not to be more wittie to frame feares, than wise to
iudge them, assuring our selues, that those things which
seeme dangerous and are not, doe daily decline and demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

not from iudgement well grounded, but from some distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of affection, after they haue a little throwne vp
their fume and fire, doe sodainly dissolue, and vanish as
vaine. Lastly it behoueth vs to foresee, that a time may
come, which will manifest how profitable it might be, not to
haue been negligent in things which seemed to be small: for
that oftentimes vpon matters appearing of little weight,
things of great consequence doe depend.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt to descend into particular consideration,
touching the vnion of these two Realmes
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the benefits which
are presented thereby are so many and manifest, that
the chiefest impugners thereof are not able, euen in
the greatest tempest of their iudgement, directly to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4131:4"/>
denie them, onely they seeke either in silence or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities
to passe them ouer, or els by propounding
many difficulties, to qualifie our wils from pursuing
them by desire. For, whereas there are two respects
which combine and knit people together, the one a
vehement feare, either in preuenting or in remouing
of some euill; the other (which is the weaker) an vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
hope and desire, in attaining of some good:
both these doe present themselues most liuely vnto
vs; and from these two principall respects, two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
benefits doe infallibly ensue. The first is, the
extinguishing of warres betweene the two nations:
the second is, the enlargement both of dominion
and power.</p>
            <p>Touching the first, it alwaies falleth, that the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of one countrey into diuers principalities, is an
assured ground of miserie and warre, by reason of the
diuersitie both of the interest and of the ends of
those that possesse it: neither is there any meanes to
reduce the same into conditions of quiet, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
it againe to the state of Vnion. This meanes
hath in a short course of time altogether appeased
the cruell and inueterate, not onely butcheries but
hate, betweene the English and the Welsh; and I
am not assured whether the want of this hath made
all other appliancies, whether of clemencie, or of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
or of armes, if not vnprofitable, yet insufficient,
to represse the riotous rebellions of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And
how great haue been the miseries and mischiefes,
which haue heretofore proceeded from the warres
betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> it may euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
by seuerall consideration of the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:4131:5"/>
First therefore the course of our conquests, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Victories hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> hath by this meanes been often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.
For to this end the French haue alwaies
held correspondencie with <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the only way
to diuert the enterprises of the English against them.
So that if this gap bee closed past their entrance, wee
haue taken from them their surest defence.<note place="margin">Inuasions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned.</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
opportunities haue bin opened to forreine inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
the people of both Realmes being hereby
weakened, the store and treasure wasted, matters of
themselues sufficient to beate open their gates to any
one that would attempt vpon them. And in truth, it
was vpon no other aduantage that the Saxons, and
after them the Danes found so easie entrance into
this Realme: calamities lamentable euen for stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to heare of, much more for those wretches to
endure, vpon whose neckes the law of destinie had
laid so hard and heauie a yoke. Thirdly, by meanes
of these warres,<note place="margin">Confines laid waste.</note> the confines of both nations haue
continually been held vnder the cruell calamitie of
the sword; they haue bin a nurserie of rapines, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries
and murthers; they haue bin not only vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
but very chargeable to the State, by continual
maintenance of many garrisons.<note place="margin">Inner parts distressed.</note> Lastly, the inner
parts of both Realmes haue been often pierced, and
made a wretched spectacle to all eyes of humanitie
and pitie: wherein notwithstanding the English
stood vpon the disaduantage, in that they fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them who had least to lose.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now, for the largenes of the benefit of enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of dominion, wee are chiefly to consider both
the nature and abilities, as well of the countrie which
shall be ioyned vnto vs, as of the people which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4131:5"/>
it. The countrey is if not plentifull, yet suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to furnish, not onely the necessities, but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
pleasures of this life: wherein, whosoeuer is
brought vp and bred, hee will neuer be grieued to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide.
The people are, great in multitude, resolute in
minde, for seruice apt, in faith assured, in wils tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
moderate in hopes, bearing one common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to commit their liues to any aduenture, not only
for the safetie, but for the glorie of their state: and
generally their conditions so well furnished, as they
did neuer better than now flourish in all mortall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities.
By addition of such both people and place,
many particular benefits will inseparably ensue.</p>
            <p>And first, it will bee a greater increase of dignitie<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>
and reputation to the common state, than our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thoughts can easily imagine. For, that which is
more generall, is more generous also and honorable
as <hi>Decius</hi> teacheth vs; for that it compriseth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
particulars within it: which is aduowed also by that
which <hi>Baldus</hi> saith; that by reason of vniuersalitie a
thing may be esteemed of greater worth. Hereto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
that sentence of <hi>Salomon; The honour of a King
is in the multitude of people.</hi> And therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
reporteth it as a great part of his glorie; that <hi>he
reigned ouer all kingdomes from the riuer (Euphrates) to
the land of the Philistims,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 24.</note> 
               <hi>and vnto the border of Egypt;
and in all the region on the other side the riuer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if in our hearts may be any desires more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than of glorie, there are other effects of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of dominion and power, more mightie to
moue vs, or at the least more necessarie. For hereby
also our defence will bee the more assured;<note place="margin">Defence.</note> because
against the forces and felicities of these two Nations,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4131:6"/>
it will be so hard, as almost impossible, either for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
enemie or domestical rebell to haue power to
preuaile. And whereas heretofore the ports of either
nation haue been so many gates for inuasion of the
other; the borders also betweene them haue been a
place of assured retreit to the rebels of both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
in case their enterprises did not succeede: these
passages being now closed, all secret supportance
withdrawne, and both people knit in a common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
it will not onely frustrate the end, but cut off
the hope of any such attempts.</p>
            <p>Further,<note place="margin">Enterprise.</note> wee shall be strengthened hereby in any
forreine enterprise, whensoeuer time shall cut out oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
fauourable to our desires. Whereas in a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rather confederated than vnited, is seldom seene,
either a conformitie in will, or a ioynt readinesse in
power, whether to pursue resolutely the fauour of
fortune, or constantlie to resist the stormes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse:
because in such enterprises as are occasioned
by diuersitie of interest, and draw with them diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of ends; disdaines, distrusts, and all kinde of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
are easily kindled.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Ease.</note> both our libertie and our plentie by this
meanes will encrease; and we shall with farre greater
both alacritie and ease sustaine the defraiments of
publike affaires. For generally, in small principalities,
the people are more wronged in person and wrung
in purse; their estates are more neerely raked and
gleaned; they haue lesse aduantage both by trafficke
and trade, then they who liue in large dominions.
And this will be the accomplishment of our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
if by our euill either fortune or aduice, we suffer
not the occasion to be lost.</p>

which is mightie to bend those minds that

by what meanes both nations may bee reduced to

harsh vnto many, in whose eares suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth sit, to beate backe the creadit of
any kinde whether of perswasion or
proofe. From these I expect two principall obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The first is, that the lawes of <hi>England</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
changed since the time of <hi>Brutus;</hi> not onely in
the peaceable state of the realme, but not by any of
the seuerall conquerors thereof: not by the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
Danes, Saxones; no not by the Romanes,
who vsually changed the laws of all other countries
which they brought vnder the sway of their sword:
but that in all other changes, whether of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
or of state, the lawes doe still remaine the same,
which <hi>Brutus</hi> compiled out of the Troian lawes;
and therefore it is not fit they should in any point be
altered. I will not now spend time vpon this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
partly because it is not commonly receiued,
but especially for that I haue in a particular treatise
examined at large, the parts and proofes of this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.
Not as derogating any thing from the true
dignitie of the common law; but as esteeming hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolicall
praises now out of season; as neuer su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

            <p>The second obiection will bee, that change of

                  </gap> be worse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet on the other side, I am as farre from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
a strict and seuere tenacitie of lawes; which
(being another extreame) is many times more either
hurtfull or vnprofitable, than the light change of
them. For who will commend the counsaile of the
<hi>Epidaurians,</hi> who for feare of attracting innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
interdicted their people from all forreine both
trauaile and trade? or that of the <hi>Locrians,</hi> who to
keepe their lawes both from change and encrease,
erected an vse, that whosoeuer would haue a new
law established, hee should propound the same, his
necke girt in a halter, that if it were not esteemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
his law and life might end together. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
entire alteration of gouernment is necessarie.
For so <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">In Pomp.</note> that <hi>Cratippus</hi> declared to
<hi>Pompey,</hi> being cast into flight, and complaining of
the prouidence of his Gods, that the peruerse state
of <hi>Rome</hi> stood in great necessitie of the gouernment
of one man:<note place="margin">Annal. 1.</note> and so <hi>Tacitus</hi> likewise reporteth, that
certaine wisemen discoursing of the life of <hi>Augustus</hi>
after his death, affirmed rightly, that there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes to appease the disorders of the state, but
by reducing it vnder the principalitie of one. But
the change of some particular lawes is many times
grounded vpon so great respects, that all nations do
vsually vary them, as occasions doe alter: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith;<note place="margin">Hist. 1. Necet priscus rigor &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Old rigour and too great seueritie
is hurtfull vnto vs, because we are not able to match.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is any inconuenience by such particular change
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4131:10"/>
of lawes either feared or felt, if two circumstances
be therein obserued. One, that the change bee not
great; the other, that it be not sudden, but at leisure
and by degrees.</p>
            <p>Now, to reduce the lawes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>
into one bodie, it seemeth the change will not bee
great. First, for that customes and priuiledges of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places are not to be impeached; for these are
diuers in euery nation, without any notable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience,
so that conformitie be held in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
law. Secondly, the fundamentall lawes (as they
are termed) of both kingdomes and Crownes doe
well agree. In other lawes of gouernment they hold
good conformitie, as hauing heretofore bin vnder
one scepter; but now by long seuerance the lawes
of either nation are like a shooe worne long vpon
one foote, and thereby made rather vnseemely than
vnseruiceable for the other. Of these lawes, they that
are diuers but not contrarie, may still be retained and
communicated to both people:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> for so <hi>Alexander</hi>
said, that his great Empire could not aptly be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but by deliuering to the Persians some lawes
and customes of the Macedonians, and by receiuing
likewise some things from them: and euen so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Romanes, those lawes which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people made onely for themselues, and those
also which the Senators had made, onely to binde
themselues, were by the law <hi>Hortensia</hi> made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vnto all. So then, the change shall be onely
where the lawes are contrarie; which will not bee
either great or vnprofitable, if it be not laid only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the lawes of one people, but indifferently diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
betweene them both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:4131:10"/>
Examples are obuious of the like commission of
lawes: but I will insist onely vpon one; which is
most memorable, and most properly concerneth
both our countrey and our case. When King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
surnamed the Confessor was aduanced to the
Crowne, he found the realme gouerned by three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
lawes; the West-saxon law, the Mercian law,
and the Dane law. Out of these three lawes, partly
moderated, and partly supplied, hee composed one
bodie of law, commonly called S. <hi>Edwards</hi> lawes:
which were of so great equitie, that when they were
abrogated by the Conquerour, and the Crowne fell
into controuersie betweene <hi>Mawd</hi> the Empresse and
King <hi>Stephen,</hi> the people alwaies inclined to fauour
that part, who put them in fairest hope of restitution
of those lawes. And afterwards in many ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
the greatest demaund of the people appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to haue been, the restitution of King <hi>Edwards</hi>
lawes.</p>
            <p>And yet these alterations are most safely wrought
in some meane course and compasse of time;<note place="margin">Ad Attic. lib. 11 Epist. 19. Dio. 52.</note> and as
<hi>Cicero</hi> saith: <hi>Et quam minimo sonitu orbis ille in rep. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertatur:

               <hi>without any great sound.</hi> And so <hi>Dio</hi> writeth, that

without which the bodily vnion is of

leaue out the will of man, without which it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

For although other creatures may be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

inforced: the vnderstanding must first be wrought

            <p>This vnion of will and of minde <hi>Seneca</hi> termeth,<note place="margin">De Clem. lib. 1. cap. 4.</note>

            <p>But this vnion of mindes betweene the English
and the Scots is not to bee esteemed a matter which
may easily be effected; by reason of the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
which haue been betweene them. For in old
enmities it is hard to establish both a present and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
reconciliation; because either suspition, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or desire of reuenge are proper and assured
meanes, either alwaies to continue, or readily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the ancient hate. And yet this will prooue most
easie and plaine, if industrie be applied to the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
present. And the rather, for that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to open the way to this Vnion in such a
time as there is almost no memorie of any warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the two nations: insomuch as the long peace
which hath now continued more than fiftie yeeres,
and the mutuall offices which in the meane time
haue been shewed, haue now either worne out, or at
least much weakned the hate, which in former times,
by reason of continuall warre, was almost growne to
be naturall. Onely some circumstances must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
without which it is alwaies hard, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is neuer impossible, to worke the willes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of diuers people into one. These circumstances
may bee reduced to two principall heads: the first is
equalitie; the second, conformitie or similitude in
all things whereby any notable difference should be
maintained or made.</p>

and aduancements of the one, would
worke both grieuance and preiudice to the other.
For first, no people will easily disgest, that more
should bee attributed within their state to others,
either in trust or in authoritie than vnto them: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they are not the most fit, either to counsaile

               <hi>To giue aduise in affaires of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
it is a principall point, to haue knowledg of the
same.</hi> Officers and employments of state are in the
hands of the King as graines, to make the ballances
equall; and must not promiscuously be bestowed,
vntill by benefit of time, the band of Vnion bee
made fast and indissoluble. For as things in nature
excellent ripe not hastily, so common-wealths least
of all; which rise not to the period of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in many ages, mouing leasurely, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
degrees: and the more slowly they doe
rise, the more surely for the most part do they stand.
In a small compasse of time, how little distastefull it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4131:14"/>
will be, that the men of one nation should beare
office and authoritie in the other, wee haue a faire
example by them of Wales; who, so farre from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
as without any note; doe many times enioy
very high places of preferment in <hi>England.</hi> And I
make little doubt but that this respect hath dazled
the iudgment of some persons, by whom whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is pretended, either against the whole Vnion,
or against any part of the perfection thereof, the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is (as men entred into suspition are prone, both
to interpret and coniecture all things to the worst)
that all the sweete of the land will hereby be drawne
from the auncient inhabitants of the same. Hereof
all laboring in one common doubt, and one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
the feare of another, they minister occasion
of bouldnesse vnto such, who suppose, by aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
popular aduise, to raise some reputation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
But it cannot bee coniectured that a King,
ripe in age, full of experience, holding much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
yet not reiecting the aduise of others, will giue
so confused forme to these affaires; and that he will
kindle such a fire of emulation, betweene both peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as cannot but cast forth daungerous sparkes.</p>

very generall vnder the Empire of <hi>Rome:</hi>
which, whether it were enforced by the

into it,<note place="margin">19. De ciuit.</note> many make a question. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it the fact of the imperious Citie; which word
<hi>imperious,</hi> whether hee vsed in the best sense, for bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
rule, or in the worst, for sharpe and seuere, it is
not materiall: for many things are seuere, which are
not vniust, which are not vnprofitable. Assuredly,
this change of speech is no waies contrarie to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
equitie; because one language doth no more
proceede from nature than another. It may seeme
hard (I grant) to impose a change of language vpon
any people; but it seemeth more hard, to be ioyned
with men of a strange tongue: such as are vnto vs
the Spaniards and French. This doth God threaten
as a plague to those that obey not his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<hi>The Lord shall bring a nation vpon thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 49.</note>

of Philosophie, <hi>Plato,</hi> who doth truly determine
those to be Barbarians, who in the manner both of

the second Emperor, and Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the

two factions of <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gebelines.</hi> Afterward
when the contentions ceased betweene the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors

encreased, without any other foundation, either
of suspition or of hate, (most mightie passions to
driue on disordered thoughts) but onely for diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of name. Hereupon many insolences, many
murthers and parricides were daily committed.
Neither was the crueltie discharged vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of men onely, but houses were ruined, townes
were ransacked, fields were wasted, all extremities
were pursued with a greater heate of hate, than if it
had been against infidels or traytors. And to so high
a pitch did this enmitie rise, that they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

not in fashion of their apparell; in disports, in
feasts, in the manner of their going, riding, speaking,
feeding, and generally in all things they affected a
difference.</p>
            <p>The like cruelties haue been exercised betweene
diuers families of <hi>Italy, France, England, Scotland,</hi> and
many other Christian countries: the beginning
whereof hath commonly risen vpon some priuate
either interest or reuenge; but growing into faction,
they haue been prosecuted and continued either

so D. <hi>Haillan</hi> noteth that to make a perfect recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement

betweene the Dukes of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and
<hi>Orleans,</hi> in the time of <hi>Lewes</hi> the cleuenth, the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
names of <hi>Burguignion</hi> and <hi>Orleannois</hi> were taken
away. So likewise the <hi>Adorni</hi> and <hi>Fregosi,</hi> two
families in <hi>Genoa,</hi> after they had wearied and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wasted themselues with mutuall cruelties, left
their old names, as the onely meanes both to draw
on and holde their reconcilement. And this did S.
<hi>Paul</hi> in good time foresee, when he blamed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
for diuiding in name; some holding of
<hi>Paul,</hi> some of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and some of <hi>Cephas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then that the bearing of one name is a
meane to knit men in affection and friendship; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also that difference in name doth often main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
men in diuision of mind; what shall we say of
them, who more contemning the benefit of Vnion,
than examining the parts and circumstances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
doe openly obiect, that they see neither vrgent
necessitie, nor euident vtilitie in comprehending the
English and the Scots vnder one common name?
that they finde no griefe in their present state, and
can foresee no aduancement to a better condition
by this change? Shall we say that their iudgment is
captiuated by affection? I cannot, I dare not, I will
not hold that opinion of them. I rather feare that
some euill destinie driueth them on. For it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie

            <p>When <hi>Egbert</hi> King of the West-Saxons had
brought the Heptarchie of the Saxons vnder one

of the kingdomes of West-Saxons and of <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>
by right of blood; whereof the first had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the progenic of <hi>Cerdicius</hi> (from whom he
was descended) about 300. yeares, the other had
been annexed thereto almost 200 yeares before: but
changed the names as well of them as of the rest into
one common name of <hi>England.</hi> So that if we free
our minds from rashnesse and dulnesse, the two
plagues of iudging right; if wee esteeme these and
the like proceedings by their naked nature and not
by apparances onely and shifts, we shall cleerely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
that it is so farre from wanting example, that
there is scarce any example to the contrarie, that
diuers people haue perfectly and for long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
combined together, whether by conquest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation,
or right of blood, but it hath been vnder

tongues, and the lightest reasons will
seeme to weigh greatly, if nothing bee
put in the ballance against them, let vs
consider what other obiections are made against this
Vnion of name, and whether they be worthie either
of yeelding or of answering. It is said, that this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of name will ineuitably and infallibly draw
on an erection of a new kingdome or state, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and extinguishment of the old; and that
no explanation limitation or reseruation can cleere
or auoyde that inconueniencie, but it will be full of
repugnancie or ambiguitie, and subiect to much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
and danger of construction. That diuers spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
and seuerall confusions incongruities and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
will necessarily and incidently follow in the
present time. As in sommoning of Parliaments and
recitall of the acts of Parliament. In the seales of the
kingdome. In the great offices of the kingdome. In
the lawes, customes, liberties, and priuileges of the
kingdome. In the residence and holding of such
courtes as follow the Kings person, which by the
generalitie of name may be held in <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4131:23"/>
seuerall and reciproque oathes, the one of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
at his coronation, which is neuer iterated; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the oathes of alleageance homage or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
made and renued from time to time by the
subiects. All which acts instruments and formes of
gouernment, with a multitude of other formes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
writs, pleadings, and instruments of a meaner
nature runne now in the name of <hi>England,</hi> and vpon
the change would bee drawne into incertaintie and
question.</p>
            <p>In truth this is much, if there bee much truth in it.
But, for my part, I wil not take vpon me, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
or dispute what the law of the realme is, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
either this generall point of erection of a
new state by alteration of name, or the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences
which for the present will ensue; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
my selfe herein to the learned Iudges and
professors of the same. Yet, vnder the fauour and
leaue of their iudgements, I will propound only two
or three doubts, which will serue much to the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this question; protesting therewith, that I
beare herein rather a desire to be satisfied, than a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to contend.</p>
            <p>The first is, how wee may bee assured, that by the
common lawes of <hi>England</hi> the change of name doth
infallibly inferre, an erection of a new kingdom, and
a dissolution of the old. For, the Common law is
commonly taken for the common custome of the
realme: and therefore in making proofe thereof we
vsually heare alleaged, either Iudgements and presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in cases of the same nature, or else arguments
drawne from cases somewhat like. But this case in
question hath not hitherto been thus determined
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4131:24"/>
by the common lawes of <hi>England;</hi> because the name
of a kingdome hath not bin changed since our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
lawes were therein planted. Or if it were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and by King <hi>Iohn,</hi>
who stiled themselues Kings of <hi>Britaine,</hi> then was it
without dissolution of the state. As for arguments <hi>à



similibus,</hi> I doe not see of what force they can be in
case of the Crowne; because by the lawes of this
realme, the Crowne is not touched, much lesse ruled
and ordred either by generall termes or by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
neither doth any act concerne the same, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
mention be not thereof made. Againe, if the
change of name doth infallibly inferre the erection
of a new kingdome, it seemeth that the King hath
power by vertue of his Proclamation to dissolue the
whole state and erect a new. Lastly, the little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which ensued the change of the Kings title in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> maketh this point more questionable and
suspect.</p>
            <p>The second doubt is concerning one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
inconueniences which are alleaged, namely
an euasion from the reciproque oathes betweene the
King and the people. For, seeing oathes doe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerne the soule and conscience, and therfore
are vnderstood and ruled onely by the lawes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
I doe not see how they should receiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from any nice point of positiue law.</p>
            <p>The third is, how all these inconueniences should
be, either so certaine, or of such nature and qualitie,
that no prouision can cleere or auoide them. What?
shall we suspect either the weaknesse of lawes, or the
weake wisedome of the state? Shall we suspect either
the wisedome of the state in making of lawes, or the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4131:24"/>
iustice thereof in maintaining them? Are lawes now
of force to hold these matters in forme, and shal they
not hereafter be able to doe the like? Are there any
such inward difficulties which lawes and policies
cannot combat and ouercome? For my part I think
(and thinke that I thinke true) that the wisedome of
the state is farre aboue these or any other inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities:
especially in a Monarchie, where ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
matters are easily redressed, by reason of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
authoritie of the Prince. Neither must wee
looke to enioy any notable benefit without some
difficulty and inconuenience. When did the cloudes
make flourishing fields, without trouble of moisture?
when did the Sunne yeeld plentifull haruest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
annoyance of heate? Such is the weaknesse of
man, that it cannot beare either good or euill sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
without temperature or allay.</p>
            <p>And yet (me thinke) although all other meanes to
cleere these inconueniences should bee perplexed
and hard, it should bee not difficult and direct to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
the same, by changing the Common law in
that point onely; and by new decree to establish, that
the change of name in the King should not draw on
an erection of a new kingdome, and a dissolution of
the old; and that whatsoeuer hath been done or
spoken by the one name, should be receiued by the
other. And this I doe the rather hold not to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
for that then the Common law should
herein agree with the Canon and Ciuill lawes; the
substance of which lawes (although they be often
abased by abuse) is the common practise of all the
world.</p>

to that which was done in the beginning of Queene

inuasion of the Normans, the souereigntie of state
had not been borne by a woman, some curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites,
hauing learned doubts out of leasure, brought
into question, whether the lawes which had passed
before vnder the name of King, should then bee of
force vnder the name of Queene. Whereupon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
was made;<note place="margin">2. Mar. 2. Par. 1.</note>

secured, and that is, a possibilitie of alienation
of the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> to the line of <hi>Scotland</hi> in

a new erected kingdom it must goe in the nature

of succession, which is obserued by all nations, in
questions for discent of Crownes; besides that it is
contrary to the Ciuill lawes, whereby the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is chiefly declared; besides that the peculiar law
of <hi>England</hi> in this point, if it be cleere fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> question, is

And whosoeuer doth vse such auoydances and

they will not want one euasion or other, when

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4131:28"/>
said before) in contracts of this high nature,<note place="margin">Bald. 5. cons. 305.</note> it is both
dishonourable and vniust not onely to inferre frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent
interpretations, but to inforce contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in fauourable contracts are neuer regarded: because
by too much subtiltie they doe often ouerthrow the
truth of meaning.<note place="margin">Dec. 3. con. 84.</note> For, nothing is more contrarie
vnto truth, than ouer sharpe subtiltie vpon words.</p>
            <p>Of no lesse truth can it be that the Kings prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
before other Christian kings (which is gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by antiquitie of kingdomes and not by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
may by this change of lawes be endaungered,
and place turned last, because it is the newest. For, by
the common law of nations (the equitie whereof is
held to be most liuely expressed in the Ciuill law)
so long as the people doe remaine the same, and
loose no point of their libertie and honor, there can
be no inward change, whether of name, of seate, of
title, or of forme of gouernment, whereby the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of their state may be endaungered. Of name I
haue sufficiently written before. And concerning
change of state, it was the same Empire whose prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
seate was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and at
<hi>Rauenna,</hi> and at <hi>Prage.</hi> And although it looseth in
one part and gaineth on the other; although it be
remoued thereby out of the originall seate, yet doth
it remaine the same Empire.<note place="margin">L. 64. D. de e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict.</note> Euen as a field remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the same which looseth vpon one part by allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion
of waters, and winneth vpon the other: or as
it remaineth the same sea, which leaueth one part of
earth, and possesseth another: or as it remaineth the
same riuer which doth altogether change the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:4131:28"/>
For change of title we haue an eui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent example
in the countrie of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> For, when that forme of
election of the <hi>Germaine</hi> Emperor was established
which is yet in vse, the Duke of <hi>Bohemia</hi> had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to giue his voyce, in case the other sixe Electors
should be equally deuided. Afterward, the Duke
was aduanced to the title of a King; which was held
no such alteration in that state, that his priuiledg
should be thereby either renewed or lost.</p>
            <p>The greatest doubt is concerning change in
forme of gouernment; because vpon change in
forme,<note place="margin">L. 9. §. si quis. D. ad exhib.</note> the substance is alwaies esteemed diuers. But
this is not true in accidentall formes; it is true in that
thing onely whereof the substantiall forme doth
perish. When the Kings were expelled out of <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Monarchicall forme of that gouernment did
change, and thereupon the Monarchicall Empire of
<hi>Rome</hi> did cease; but the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> did not
therefore cease. The Romane Empire did alwaies
remaine, although the gouernment thereof was
sometimes regal, sometimes popular, and sometimes
mixt: although the soueraigntie was transferred,
from Kings to Consuls, and from Consuls to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors;
and although these Emperours did hold,
sometimes by succession, and sometimes by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that sometimes of the souldiers, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the Senate, and now of the seuen Electors.
The forme of gouernment which was accidentall,
did change; but the substantiall forme of Empire
did remaine.</p>
            <p>But then doth a kingdome or Empire dissolue,
when it loseth the libertie; and then is a state newly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4131:29"/>
erected, when it beginneth to bee held free, either
from subiection or dependancie vpon any other. Of
the first <hi>Vlpian</hi> speaketh:<note place="margin">L. 209. D. de in. reg.</note>

<hi>Decianus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dec. 3. con. 19.</note> which were oppressed by the armes of the
Romanes: and so were those states newlie erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which could free themselues from that subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And in truth by no other meanes a state can bee
said to perish or cease, according to the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but either by yeelding it selfe into subiection,
or else by being possessed with the power and armes
of externall enemies. But this faileth againe in three
cases.<note place="margin">Arg. l. 1. de flu. &amp; l. 1. de riu. Alc. 5. cons. 69.</note> First, when any part is retained free. For that
kingdome or Empire ceaseth not, whereof any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
is held at libertie; because the least part of a
kingdome (either for hope of restitution, or for some
other fauourable respect) doth conserue both the
name and right of the whole: euen as the right of a
Colledge or of an Vniuersitie may be retained in
one,<note place="margin">Bald. in Prooem. D. &amp; l. 9. de leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XV. Of other obiections which concerne honour
and reputation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow, the last sort of obiections which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
honour and reputation, are full of
very emptie easinesse: and seeme to serue
rather for shew, than for strength; to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
number, but nothing at all to encrease weight.
These are, that by this change, the glorie and good
acceptance of the English name and nation, will be
in forreine parts obscured: that no worldly thing is
deerer to men than their name, as we see in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
that men disinherit their daughters to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
their name; much more in states, where the
name hath been famous and honourable: that the
contracted name of <hi>Britaine,</hi> will bring into obliuion
the names of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> that whereas
<hi>England</hi> in the stile is now placed before <hi>Scotland,</hi> in
the name of <hi>Britaine,</hi> that degree of prioritie and
precedence will bee lost: and that the change of
name will be harsh in the popular opinion, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to the countrey.</p>
            <p>Of all these obiections, the more I think, the lesse
I know what to thinke. For as I can suspect nothing
lesse than want of iudgement in those that cast these
inconueniences, so doe they appeare vnto me nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so certaine, nor of such qualitie, that for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4131:30"/>
of them wee should omit an aduantage, both
present, and of great consequence and weight. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the 7. kingdomes of the Saxons were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
vnder the name of <hi>England,</hi> yet their seuerall
names do still, &amp; are still like to remaine: and can we
imagine that the names of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
both more famous and of longer continuance, will
suddenly be either worne out or obscured? Cannot
the name be altered, but it must also be forgotten?
Or can wee account the name of <hi>Britaine</hi> either so
new or so harsh, which hath continued to bee the
name, generally of the whole Iland, but more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the parts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> euer since be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the inuasion of the Romanes? Or shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for generall precedence with them, with whom
we intend, or at least pretend desire to be one? Can
prioritie and vnitie stand together? Some (I grant)
vpon fond affection to their name haue disinherited
their daughters; but they were neuer allowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by any well grounded opinion. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,
<hi>If any man disinheriteth his daughter and maketh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his heire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alium quaerat consultorem, non Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> 
               <hi>let him seeke what Counsailer he can, he shall
neuer be aduised thereto by Augustine.</hi> Assuredly, I feare
that it is with vs, as with some good women, who are
often sick, forsooth, but in faith they cannot well tell
where. Our fancies runne, that something will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse;
but neither can it be well discerned by others,
neither is it fully perhaps resolued by our selues.
Things of greatest suretie breede many doubts in
mindes that are determined to beleeue the contrary;
whereas, in matters of this nature, all points are not
alwaies cast into question which may possibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4131:30"/>
for that many inconueniences are in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
onely; many are, either dissolued by time, or by
industrie auoided: much lesse are we bound to listen
vnto those, who confounding feare with discretion,
or else couering some corrupt conceit vnder the
name of foresight and preuention, doe stretch their
thoughts beyond probabilitie, and make all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
accidents as if they were certaine.<note place="margin">Liu. c. lib. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Agendo auden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doque

<hi>the affaires of Rome tooke encrease; not by these dull and
heauie counsailes which timorous men doe terme warie.</hi> A
wit too curious in casting of doubts for the most part
hurteth; and hee that omitteth an opportunitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vpon supposed dangers (if they be not both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and also neere) shall neuer aduance his owne
aduantage.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth aimed at this Vnion, when
he married his eldest daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight and all the chiefe Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the realme expressely desired it, when they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to haue a mariage knit betweene <hi>Edward</hi> and
<hi>Mary,</hi> the two yong Princes of both the kingdoms.
In solliciting this mariage, the English made offer to
communicate to the Scots the liberties and priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of their state, and to be ioyned with them in the
common name of <hi>Britaine;</hi> as appeareth by a letter
of the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> yet extant. For not obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this mariage, they led an Armie into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and ioyned fight with the Scots in <hi>Muscelborough</hi>
fields. These attempts not succeeding; our euill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
hauing frustrated these good endeuours; loe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4131:31"/>
here, our felicitie now offereth vs to kisse her cheeks;
our wish, loe here; and that which lately neither by
amitie nor by armes we were able to effect, loe here,
is freelie presented vnto vs. Seeing therefore our
good fortune hath now concurred with the good
fauour and inclination of men, in opening this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
vnto vs, shall wee deale so farre against all
good office and expectation, as not to seeme content
with our blisse? Shall wee all shut, or rather pull out
our eyes, because a few doe not seeme to see? Or
shall we, like some men, when a great good happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnto them, thinke our selues in a dreame, and
not haue power to taste our good? Shall wee burie
benefits with suspitions? Shall wee labour, with
counsailes fearefull and broken to obscure, or with
dregges of doubts and iealousies to defile our owne
glorie? Must we be entreated (like mad men) to be
good to our selues?</p>
            <p>I feare nothing lesse in vs, than such want of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
I feare nothing lesse, than that in mindes so
well instructed,<note place="margin">Pessimum veri affectus vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num sua cuique vtilitas. Ta. Histo.</note> particular respects (the bane, as <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
speaketh, of true affection) should not be farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the consideration of common greatnesse
and glorie. Onely I wish by way of warning, that we
bee not too much amazed at euerie accidentall
change, fearing wee know not what, like a Deere,
which then looketh most about when he commeth
to the best feede. Or that we be not more regardfull
of light harmes that are but in shew, than mindfull
to foresee, least with losse of assured benefits, great
dangers also resolue into effects; least by obstinate
confirmation of our first aduice such firebrands of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4131:31"/>
faction bee kindled amongst vs, as cannot be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
but in the bloud of the state. It is good to ioyne
action to opportunitie. Time is thankfull to such as
will apprehend it, and fauoureth them with occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
conuenient: but it was not vnfitly portrayed
by <hi>Lycippus,</hi> with Hindes feete, and Eagles wings,
hairie before, and smooth behinde; in token that if
it be not taken when it comes, it cannot bee ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
when it is gone. Fortune is seruiceable to those
that are forward: but they that are either carelesse
or slow when aduantage is offered, doe seldome
manage their affaires to an honourable issue.</p>
            <p>For this cause confidence for the most part is lesse
hurtfull to affaires, than faint feare, which vnder the
faire names of foresight and preuention, looseth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
benefits, which either our owne felicitie, or the
industrie of other men presenteth vnto vs. It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
shew of slow and sober warinesse; but it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
supported with the insolencie and rashnesse of
turbulent spirits, which partly by incapacitie, and
partly by particular respects, hold all things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
For timorousnesse and insolencie are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ioyned in the same subiect. It is not foresight
but feare to prouide beyond probabilitie: but to
cast many inconueniences, either contemptible,
or but in shew, doth sauour of some other passion
of worse nature.</p>
            <p>I will not proceede to charge any man with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
doubling, first in casting forth a light labour
for Vnion, and then in disposing and dispersing these
obiections against it: I will not (howsoeuer prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked)
either aggrauate or apply the qualitie of this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4131:32"/>
dealing. But againe I will aduise (for I thinke it not
vnfit to be repeated) that wee shew not our selues
too subtill in suspitions; making our owne fantasies
the true measure of all our actions. That by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of mind we rather seeke encrease of friends,
than by new attempts to procure daily new ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
by reason whereof in the end we must be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
masters of all, or scourged by all: and
which of these is likest to happen it
may be easily coniectured, if we
be not set to deceiue
our selues.</p>
