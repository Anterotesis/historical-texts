         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all the Faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus.</head>
            <p>PRetious and welbeloved Lambs, natural branches of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Vine, fruitful plants in the Heavenly Vineyard, babes born
again of Immortal Seed, who ſtands in the fear and councel of
the Lord God, with a free Reſignation into his bleſſed will,
following his leadings in ſincerity and truth; yee are his Jewells
whoſe amiable beauty adorns the Goſpel, and unto you his love
is very dear, and his eye is over you in much tenderneſs and
choiceneſs, freely diſpenſing his pretious virtue to your refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and comfort, whereby yee feel all things added for your
ſupport and ſtrength in the great work whereunto he hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you; ſo that yee are daily ſupplied from the riches of an
Everlaſting fountain that ſendeth relief in every condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
yee ſtand to ſerve the Lord; for he hath made you near to
himſelf in a perpetual covenant, and in the light hath ſet you
apart to bear witneſs unto his power, life and truth; and yee are
raiſed as a cloud of witneſſes that covers the Earth with brightneſs
and glory, and your faithful Teſtimony that yee have received
of God, and in which yee live unto God is a ſweet ſavour unto
the life in all; for in your faithfulneſs, patience, and innocency
you make way to the Juſt which witneſſeth for you: And though
your life be hated by that Spirit which would not have it reign,
and that yee ſuffer and endure great affliction by your oppreſſors;
yet in your meek and innocent life you reach Gods witneſs in
them, by which they are many times ſmitten for what they do
unto you; ſo that ye are manifeſt in their Conſciences, though
they be from that in themſelves, which makes you manifeſt, and
in cruelty proceeds againſt you from evil to worſe, that (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
they might darken your Glory, and bring down your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Teſtimony into obſcurity, and for that end they take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
againſt you whom God hath choſen to follow his leadings,
and you muſt either tranſgreſs the command of your Leader,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93257:2"/>
and deny his Spiritual Worſhip, or be expoſed to the ſeverity
of mercileſs men, and rendered Offenders by a pretended Law,
and this is determined againſt you, and done unto you, becauſe
they know not him that hath raiſed you in your living
Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>But Oh, how do theſe things work together for good unto
all that love God; how doth it quicken the true birth unto
watchfulneſs and faithfulneſs; how doth it enliven unto freeneſs
and chearfulneſs to do the will of God, and brings down the ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of life upon all the ſingle and upright hearted: Oh my dear
friends theſe purpoſed and practiſed cruelties of Sions enemies
doth much advance her glory, and worketh good for all her
Children though wickedly intended againſt them; for, thereby
our faith is tried and ſtrengthened, our peace increaſed and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied,
and in the hour we are preſerved.</p>
            <p>Oh dear Lambs, be yee ſtrong in the Lord, for you are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
though you may be caſt down, you are not extinguiſhed as
tow, though in the fire you be tried; but with mercy you are
compaſſed in the Salvation of God; and this he worketh for you
who is Lord of all, that hath all power in his hand, and in his
power ruleth over darkneſs, and enmity, and preſerveth Sion
in the midſt of her troubles; for the Remembrance of Sion is
alwayes with him, yea in the very time when ſhe ſits in the duſt
bewailing; therefore let the Babes rejoyce, and the plant be
fruitful, let the weak put on ſtrength, and the mourner be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
for of a truth God is with us, and he will not hold them
guiltleſs that any way oppreſs us: So be not diſcouraged thou
innocent birth, but keep cloſe to thy God, and truſt in him who
hath raiſed thee, and let not thy Faith fail within thee, then thou
wilt go comfortably in the Holy Teſtimony; and rejoyce over
all that would ſuppreſs the truth in thee, for the Lord God is
aſſuredly with thee in all thou ſuffers for him, and in all he calls
thee unto, his arme ſuſtaines thee; and though he permit darkneſs
for a time to try thee, yet his love and good will is to thee, and
his pleaſure and delight is in thee, and thou haſt had experience
of his favour towards thee, and knows how thou haſt been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured
in thy adverſity, and wonderfully delivered out of thy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93257:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Captivitie. Oh therefore keep thy eye to him that hath never
failed thee, nor never will fail thee as thou abides in his councel;
let not the world entice thee, nor flatteries prevaile with thee,
nor feares diſmay thee, but follow thy God who is greater then
all, ſo will his hand keep thee for being plucked out, and though
thou may be in the Furnace of affliction, and may feel it ſharp and
tedious to endure, yet from thence he will take thee, and as well
refined Gold will bring thee forth to his praiſe for ever.</p>
            <p>So all dear Friends every where, waite in that which makes
you ſenſible of your own conditions, that you may feele to Chriſt
your life and hope of glory, your helper, preſerver and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer;
ſo you will be ſtayed with a ſure anchor in a troublous
time, and will feel the ſpringings of life to revive the hope of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and then your Faith will not be driven to Shipwrack
though ſtorms be high and violent, but will be preſerved and
ſtrengthened unto a further growth in the power which raiſes the
ſeed, and this is teſtified in the power that yee may have ſtrong
conſolations in the midſt of your affliction, and in the teſtimony
all glory is given to the power as moſt worthy? Oh, a ſtayed
minde in the power is exceeding precious, for there the Birth
lives in that which is eternal, and feeds upon the virtue in which
it delighteth, and in ſtayedneſs, ſtillneſs and quietneſs, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
glory reſts upon it, and ſo there is a living ſenſibleneſs of the
deep love and life of God, in which yee abiding, yee will attain
unto wiſdom and underſtanding in the ſeed, and feel the Image
of God in you reſtored again, and ſo come to lye down in Chriſt
Jeſus your reſt and peace.</p>
            <p>And now dear beloved Friends, be ſtedfaſt in the Faith, and
hope to the end, for the end will manifeſt all things, and as yee
abide in the patience you will overcome; and as you keep the
Faith you will obtaine victory, and the Crown will be
yours.</p>
            <p>Dear and tender hearts, you may read the dearneſs of my love
in the lines of Life, where I lye down with you in the bond
of peace, beſeeching you all to have fervent love amongſt your
ſelves, and keep your eye ſingle one over another, and entertain
no exceptions one againſt another, for there is a watching eye
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93257:3"/>
that is not ſingle, and that will take occaſion to make a fault
where there is none, and then will be exceptions, and raiſe a
whiſper to accuſe; but the true birth that lives in the true love,
it covers faults as they happen through weakneſs, and reſtores
again in the Spirit of meekneſs, and ſo in the power that giveth
life unto its Teſtimony, it judgeth preſumptious pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy,
and covereth faults that happeneth through weakneſs
or infirmity, and reſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res that again which mourneth becauſe it
hath offended; and ſo it reacheth to its own in tenderneſs, and
condiſcends to the loweſt that travailes after Righteouſneſs, but
unvaileth all feigned ſubtilty that would exalt it ſelfe over the
Royal innocency, for the light diſcovereth and unvaileth the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Iniquity, and judgeth Infallibly, and none by wilt or
reaſon can either adde unto it, or diminiſh from it; therefore
all dear Friends, live in that which keepeth the minde low in the
fear and counſel of the Lord God, that in wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
yee may have clear diſcerning, and ſo in ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reach to the oppreſſed with mercy, that yee may break
down the nature of the Oppreſſour, and reſtore and heal the
grieved Birth that is ready to confeſs and forſake that which
through weakneſs hath been done amiſs, and here yee will have
the Soveraigne balme that healeth the wound ſafely, and not
ſleightily, and ſo you will be a comfort one to another, even as yee
are ſenſible that the Lord comforts you, in which work the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God confirm and ſtrengthen you all to the glory of his
Power, Life and Wiſdom for Evermore.</p>
            <p>The Salutation of my Life in the heavenly love unto every Babe that
Secretly panteth to doe the Will of God.</p>
            <p>This may be read among friends as freedome is given, being a true
token of my love (in a few words) as moved of the Lord.</p>
