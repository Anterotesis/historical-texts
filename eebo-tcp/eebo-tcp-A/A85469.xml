            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Author ought to be for his Countries Good) will tell you, which being ſent as an <hi>Herald</hi> to declare the <hi>Coming of God.</hi> It doth not Crave, but Command <hi>protection;</hi> And though I may not dedicate it, to any other then to whom God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath directed the matter of it; <hi>Primarily</hi> to you of this ſo ſinful City <hi>London, ſubſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to all the people of the three <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, yet is it good manners fairly to intreat of you, <hi>Oliver Cromwell Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,</hi> that it ſuffer not by any prohibition of yours, in ſale or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed I do not doubt of that from your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech from all, its good acceptance. Eſpecially if you did know or do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,

            <p>A perſon well known to your Lordſhip, <hi>E.

That <hi>paper</hi> he or they <hi>Burnt;</hi> Now to let you or them ſee clearly Gods diſlike of that wicked act, his <hi>Fire</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure not long after flamed out of the Chimney, <hi>twas near you;</hi> its rage frighted ſome, it was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to very many: in <hi>viſion</hi> was it ſaid to the party that gave the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> they have burnt thy <hi>Paper,</hi> but go forth, and thou ſhalt ſee their Chimney on <hi>Fire:</hi> the party did ſo, and ſaw it ſo on <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time, the ſame party
<pb facs="tcp:170434:4"/>
endevours to ſet a <hi>Paper</hi> on the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doors of <hi>White-Hall; White-Hall</hi> ſtill, the matter of that was, (as much of this Book is) what God would have ſpeedily done, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured <hi>King,</hi> and deſpiſed <hi>Church:</hi> of all which your ſelf, Chaplaines and others under that roof, were to take ſpecial notice, and conforme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The <hi>Chappel Officer</hi> would needs hinder the ſetting up of that <hi>Paper,</hi> for ſome time he did ſo; in fine he boldly ſaid, if ever it was ſet up, he would pull it down. He was then forewarned and charged not to do ſo, leſt <hi>God took ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> on him; he ſlighted the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and when it was ſet up, not fearing God but men, he puls it down. The next news heard and ſeen of him is, that very <hi>right
<pb facs="tcp:170434:4"/>
hand</hi> of his, ſo miſimployed as to pull it down, is ſuddenly bound up, becomes unuſeful, and withers, a very few dayes after, ſome 15. or 20. himſelf dyes. Theſe things are true, I can prove them. <hi>My Lord,</hi> it is very ſeaſonable here to remind you of what ſo ſadly befall <hi>Mr. Whaley Mayor</hi> of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> in the very year of his <hi>Majoralty,</hi> on Tueſday <hi>Eaſter next</hi> it is but two ſince, marke it well I beſeech you, for theſe things are clearly of God, yea clearly ſo.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Presbyter Whaley,</hi> an Early Complyer with the worſt times, moſt falſly and ſhamefully belyes me, he traduceth and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſuppreſs the ſo <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous proceedings</hi> of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty afforded in that Town of
<pb facs="tcp:170434:5"/>
               <hi>Northampton,</hi> on behalf of his own prophecy, my unworthy ſelf, and what paſt the very night of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement from <hi>priſon</hi> there. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had wrote to him, and followed him cloſe to know his grounds or reaſons of thoſe his <hi>ugly</hi> practices, but could never receive any from him: at laſt I wrote to his <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Iugler,</hi> and brother <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ball</hi> Miniſter in that Town, Charged him that he ſhould let <hi>Whaley</hi> know, if I received not ſpeedily from him in writing, he ſhould from me in print, yea both of them ſhould; On <hi>Goodfriday</hi> I finiſhed what I intended to print againſt them: The Tueſday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving God takes the buſineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hand, <hi>Whaley</hi> ſinks down and dyes ſuddenly in his
<pb facs="tcp:170434:5"/>
Clothes. Indeed I was unalterably reſolved not to endure them or any to belye, endeavour to ſuppreſs, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the proceedings of my <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Prophecy</hi> (for ſo this is) if I could help it: and becauſe I could not, God did it for me.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Manuſcript</hi> which your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> had of mine declaring their bad practiſes againſt Gods ſo wonderful proceedings in that place of <hi>Northampton,</hi> becauſe I could not get Printed, I left it in the <hi>Univerſity</hi> Library of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> My Lord, it is worthy your Remembrance for ever; I ſhall one day get moſt of it Printed, the world muſt know whats in it. For <hi>Ball</hi> his miniſter he is now become a <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-defender</hi> in Print, (the World hath too many ſuch) not long known
<pb facs="tcp:170434:6"/>
to be ſo; but he ſees early and comes round with the firſt: I have deſired him, <hi>Ball,</hi> by word of mouth, that his repentance be ſincere, early, and publick, the rather becauſe his aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were publick and with the firſt. <hi>Oh Presbytery, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery!</hi> Thou haſt not hitherto done Gods Church and this kingdom many good offices, <hi>mend</hi> for ſhame <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I muſt therefore Print theſe <hi>Precedents</hi> of truth, that they may deter all <hi>Presbyters</hi> or others, from belying, or impeding, the <hi>Revealed</hi> Decrees of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> in favour of <hi>Gods King</hi> and <hi>true Church;</hi> which decrees he is pleaſed now to have made publick, and by all are to be conformed unto.</p>
            <p>But why complain I of ill offices
<pb facs="tcp:170434:6"/>
done to me or others in theſe three <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> ſeeing I know very well (yea this Book tells you truly as much) that to remedy all this and more, <hi>God is coming?</hi> Whoſe <hi>Almighty fire</hi> ſent out up on the <hi>Eight</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> is gone before him, Commiſſioned to begin at this ſo ſinful <hi>City London,</hi> Converting or Conſuming the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church. Believe</hi> it Reader, our appeal is heard in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and we ſhall ſhortly have a <hi>Court</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> to remedy whats amiſs: For God hath <hi>revealed from between the Cherubins,</hi> where he is ſaid to dwell, <hi>That the Reſtoration of our King is of God:</hi> and then all thoſe leſſer devils, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Kingdom of darkneſs
<pb facs="tcp:170434:7"/>
will ſuddenly become inviſible.</p>
            <p>To conclude, why ſhould I in a <hi>Preface</hi> tell thee what I have therefore made ſo very ſhort in the book, on purpoſe, that it ſhould be <hi>Read,</hi> be <hi>Believed,</hi> and <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> by all? all are infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to do ſo; Certainly, <hi>happines</hi> will be had thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> diſtruſt me not, there is a <hi>ſtorm</hi> and change at hand, a greater, or any like it ſince our <hi>Saviors</hi> time, I firmly and warrantably believe hath not been on Earth: After which will enſue <hi>Golden times</hi> and <hi>dayes.</hi> A <hi>Church</hi> more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly glorious then ever:</hi> for the <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of which, God will afford his <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Old, but in his wiſdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb facs="tcp:170434:7"/>
for the fitteſt time.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Good Earneſt</hi> I do pray for all men, duty binds me to it; yet can I not but fear A very <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confuſion</hi> of the moſt. This is what I muſt faithfully let you all know, and ſtand to when I have done. <hi>So help me O God,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> ever own, in all times and places, thy <hi>Prophecy</hi> I formerly printed, and this <hi>book</hi> I now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the world, being both of thee; Witneſſed and ſealed unto by me <hi>VValter Goſtelo</hi> dwelling in <hi>Broad-ſtreet London,</hi> at which Church officiated as our <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,</hi> The ſo deſervedly beloved <hi>Doctor Oldſworth.</hi> Men and Brethren, <hi>Divines</hi> learned, Good, and of holy life like him, ever taught their <hi>Auditors,</hi> to be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <head>The Introduction.</head>
            <p>SOber men know very well, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us moſt ſort of villanies have been committed <hi>by a Law,</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as now he doth, to give deliverance to his people, commanding them to <hi>lift up their heads, for their Redemption draweth nigh;</hi> it remains, what will become of ſuch wicked Law-makers as ours have been, in that day, whoſe ſad fate being ſhewed me, and very ſhort alſo, like their continuance, Read that firſt I beſeech you, for ſo I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, and the rather read it, for as much as I am to let you ſee and know clearly, that the ſign by which my ſelf and you are given to underſtand, when the <hi>deliverance</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption doth draw nigh,</hi> is their ſudden diſſipation, and trouble, yea perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as to <hi>Law-makers,</hi> or <hi>Rulers,</hi> and that it is now come to paſs in this place where it was ſhewed me.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>City London,</hi> near two years ſince, particularly upon the eighth of <hi>March</hi> 1655. God ſhewed me with others this <hi>Viſion,</hi> which I preſently wrote to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector;</hi> he that believes it not, may ſee my <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> left near two years ſince in the
<pb facs="tcp:170434:10"/>
Univerſity Library of <hi>Oxford</hi> aſſuring it, there left, becauſe I could not get it printed. As for the Viſion it ſelf thus it was: <hi>I firſt ſaw the wicked Governours and miſ-Rulers of theſe people met as in a Convocation or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-houſe: That wicked Council was no ſooner ſet, but ſome of them haſtily roſe up, and bearded their fellow members, telling them you were for Preſbytery:</hi> others upbraid them with <hi>lying, cheating,</hi> and wicked practiſes. They go on to wrangle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, agree not at all, nothing but <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities</hi> amongſt them. Indeed they there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves juſt as our <hi>Glorified King</hi> propheſied it ſhould come to paſs: you that agreed in nothing more then to make me and this kingdom miſerable, ſhall agree in nothing leſs then to make your ſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; ſo his Majeſty propheſied, and ſo God will certainly now fulfill.</p>
            <p>In this wicked aſſembly of <hi>Black Saints</hi> and Juſticiaries, (for I heard not a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, condem himſelf,) though guilty, and ſtunk at ſtake (their looks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as much, yet, ſee I beſeech you, even to admiration, how God brought truth from their own mouthes, (they then charged themſelves, to be moſt culpable) not the people: <hi>Oh the wayes of God are paſt finding out!</hi> God will one day ſet the
<pb facs="tcp:170434:10"/>
ſaddle upon the right jade; when this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was at the higheſt, in comes a perſon very haſtily as ſent of God, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> is this perſon ſent of God, and looking bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them ſpake thus, <hi>Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is at hand:</hi> preſently theſe <hi>Grandees</hi> ſtartled, and looking pale as <hi>death,</hi> like <hi>Cowards</hi> and <hi>villains,</hi> faſtened their gaſtly eyes and looks upon that <hi>meſſenger;</hi> the <hi>meſſenger</hi> reiterates the words, <hi>Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is at hand;</hi> he after added, he is at the very doore, I ſaw him, he comes with <hi>Flagons:</hi> when this was ſpoken and heard, thoſe <hi>dirty</hi> fellows, and miſgovernours of the people, haſtily and confuſedly broke up <hi>houſe,</hi> ſtayed not at all, diſappeared imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, whither they haſted to their own home, or their laſt home ſwallowed them quick, I cannot tell, but this I am moſt ſure of, they were all made inviſible in an inſtant. Oh wickedneſs, wickedneſs in Governors can not ſtand in the day of Gods coming, though it be acted by a law of their own; of which vile nature theſe mens wickedneſs was, and doubtleſs more ſhould have been had not God ſo ſcattered them by his ſent meſſenger <hi>Oliver Cromwell;</hi> I told you it was but ſhort, God having done with them becauſe they were <hi>Dirt.</hi> I have done with them alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170434:11"/>
For a further confirmation of this thing, time, &amp; perſons, as Iam alive I ſhall declare truth unto you: Upon the firſt day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> laſt, being on a Friday and <hi>New-years day,</hi> my unworthy ſelf then in retirement, (after I had paſſed my moſt infirme devotions of prayer and meditation that day by the ſide of the River <hi>Meade</hi> in <hi>Kent)</hi> I was thus wonderfully dealt with.</p>
            <p>The Lord carried me in viſion to this City <hi>London,</hi> ſet me down in the inner <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>places</hi> where the people of this City performed their <hi>devotion</hi> or <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> and being there I was ſhewed the <hi>Cloſe hypocriſies,</hi> moſt irreverent and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble irreligious practiſes of the ungodly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this City and Nation, committed in thoſe very places where they pretended to worſhip God; for which their great impiety and fornications, I then ſaw ſome of them carryed away and thrown into a Bed, but it was a Bed of deſtruction, for in it was a pit out of which they never roſe nor appeared more, yet was it like a Bed. This terrible ſight made me make haſte from amongſt them; Going into other Chambers I ſaw more, but nothing that pleaſed me, <hi>Earthen veſſels,</hi> goodly to look on, <hi>Paintedboxes,</hi> but nothing in any of them; at which I being much troubled, ſome of them perſecuted me
<pb facs="tcp:170434:11"/>
from place to place, out they drove me into the ſtreet; Looking behind me to ſee if the Perſecutors ſtill followed me, I then ſaw them no more, but I did ſee a man making great haſte, coming after me with a <hi>Mete-wand, rod,</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> in his hand, it was about the length of ſix foot; by his ſide came only a harmleſs little boy, very Beautiful, and in appearance very innocent. Being then in the ſtreets of this City, I ſuddenly ſaw the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all of them wonderfully affrighted, and being ſo afraid, they run every man of them to my left hand, aſtoniſhed at the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; I asked what frighted the people, and why they run ſo to the left hand: I was forthwith anſwered by the man with the meaſuring <hi>Mete-wand</hi> in his hand, or <hi>rule,</hi> Their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are <hi>dirt;</hi> or thus, they offer <hi>dirt</hi> for <hi>ſacrifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In good earneſt when I had heard the words I looked up to heaven, and I there ſaw ſuch a Cloud of <hi>Blackneſs</hi> and <hi>Dirt,</hi> as could not poſſibly ariſe from any place but Hell, it was a Cloud made up of nothing but <hi>Devilliſh Dirt,</hi> and <hi>thick ſtinking Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> which Cloud almoſt totaly obſcured a very great light, that was in the Heavens above it, ſo that there appeared no more of that great light, but as a Quarter <hi>Moon.</hi> So ſoon as the Lord had ſhewed, it me perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:170434:12"/>
he ſcattered that dirty cloud with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, twas done immediately, and the place of it no more ſeen. What I ſaw after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>wonder,</hi> as well in this viſion as in the former, belongs not to theſe wicked ones, theſe were all to be firſt ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and made inviſible as well the wicked <hi>Okes</hi> choſen for their <hi>Law-makers</hi> or <hi>rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> as the <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thornes</hi> (being the people,) which ſent them up, for ſo they are all termed in the word of God, and they muſt periſh together. It is impoſſible in this depraved age of ours to have a good <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> if the people muſt chooſe, who are now ſo generally <hi>Bad;</hi> and here is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Lord gives me, of this <hi>dirty Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and this ſuitable peoples diſſipation and ſcattering, for a ſigne and ſignal watch-word, by which we were to know when our <hi>Redemption did draw nigh,</hi> and when we were to <hi>lift up our heads,</hi> as in the next Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I ſhall, and am to declare unto you.</p>
            <p>And now tell me <hi>Reader,</hi> was there not ſuch <hi>dirty</hi> wicked <hi>Law-makers</hi> as theſe in this laſt diſſolved <hi>Houſe?</hi> What think you, not to particularize any of that <hi>Rable,</hi> were not the moſt of them (too many at leaſt) bad from the Beginning, and did they not ſo continue all along, did they not divide? which of them repented himſelf of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:170434:12"/>
wickedneſſes? Find me the man that ever took the blame to himſelf; they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly divided and fell to wrangling, they would have us believe, it is you, and you, him and him that committed the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, none condemned himſelf; were there not the higheſt <hi>Animoſities</hi> imaginable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them? I dare ſay they would have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and imbroyled the Kingdom in a New war, rather then ſome of that faction, ſhould ſeem other then a true Saint, or <hi>White De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> (I ſtill ſpeak of the major part.) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, what number of them ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to make themſelves or the people happy, by returning to every man, or but to any man, his own inheritance? They ſpoke well of the covetous and deceitful perſon, whom God abhors; that they did, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being ſo: is it not high time think you that ſuch Miſcreants as theſe be ſcattered? Thanks be to God, who ſent <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> haſtily in amongſt them, as in the viſion, to do ſo; in great haſte he did come in upon them, yes he did ſo; ſo in the viſion, ſo in thefulfil.</p>
            <p>Reader, did not <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> come in upon them in haſte? did he not then, or at their ſitting down tell them plainly (moſt ſure he did) That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was at hand, and now at the very doore, and that he ſaw him coming with <hi>Flagons</hi> alſo?
<pb facs="tcp:170434:13"/>
as in the 85. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> Namely to eſtabliſh peace, <hi>to have mercy and truth meet together, that Righteouſneſs and peace may now kiſs each other,</hi> and that glory may dwell in our Land, did he not further ſay unto them, that he (our Lord) was coming to break in pieces all powers that were not of God, and for God, alluding to the leggs and feet of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars</hi> Image, which being Iron for oppreſſion, and dirt for irreligion, was now to have its end. Thus was his ſpeech, thus were his words to them, he told them, that both theſe prophecies were now fulfilling, he adviſed them ſo, and ſo inſtructed them: to this end he did it alſo, that they might now apply themſelves to be ſubſervient thereunto, here is what he directed unto, alſo what they ſhould have done; I told you before what they did, now ſee this very <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies</hi> fulfill; firſt, it muſt break in pieces the <hi>Powers</hi> that are not of God, I am ſure it points out them to be broken (point Blanck) and more alſo if Principled like them; they and ſuch as they broken to pieces, in comes that power and rule of Gods, under which we ſhall be bleſt, and our land happy for ever, as in the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and other part of his ſpeech taken from the 85. <hi>Pſalm:</hi> here is what he ſaid, heres what he did, broke them to pieces,
<pb facs="tcp:170434:13"/>
they are both of God, he did it in haſte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſo in the viſion ſo in the fulfill.</p>
            <p>O God, this thy ſignal ſigne given me, and then viſion ſhewed me, having thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, in all Circumſiances had its now fulfill, and being, as I may truly ſay, the very watch-word, and acting, by which I was to know when our <hi>Redemption ſhould draw nigh,</hi> and when we were to <hi>lift up our heads, Our heads,</hi> to whom the viſion was ſhewed with my ſelf; your heads, <hi>your</hi> with an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis;</hi> none of theirs, theirs, are to be Broken; the words <hi>lift up your heads,</hi> were not ſpoken, nor heard by me and them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til thoſe wicked ones were all diſſipated and gone. Truly I had been blind and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to you, if I had not thus proceeded for an introduction; I now ſee clearly the reaſon why I could not get this book prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as I intended before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> I pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it early, as once I did the like, for the Good of the world, and a <hi>Parliament</hi> then ready to meet and ſit, intitled it <hi>Charles St.</hi> and <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> united, ſo I have already printed, which I will ever ſtand to, and ſo will God certainly fulfill, let things ſeem to the world never ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for it is of God. But I could never get that book forth, until thoſe, as theſe, were turned out of Doors, becauſe good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb facs="tcp:170434:14"/>
Indeed the work of the Lord, as his ſecrets, is chiefly for thoſe that fear him, and ſuch the Lord will certainly <hi>now in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey give us</hi> for <hi>rulers,</hi> for <hi>Law-makers:</hi> We have no reaſon at all to doubt it. You may well wonder and ſtand amazed to read what the Lord ſhewed me as to this laſt Parliament ſitting, on purpoſe he did it, that I might know the approch of my ſignes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill: the firſt of <hi>Ianuary</hi> it is ſhewed me, the 20. they ſit, alſo, why the Lord would ſo diſſipate and over-turne them, becauſe there <hi>ſacrifices</hi> were <hi>Dirt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt give you a ſhort review of the whole, and then I get out of this <hi>dirty</hi> ſubject, in which <hi>dirt</hi> I am to ſtick untill I make you as clearly ſenſible as my ſelf, that God hath fulfilled to a tittle, the ſigne given me for <hi>Aſſurances,</hi> when <hi>deliverance</hi> to his <hi>Church, King,</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> (the <hi>Iſrael of God)</hi> was to be afforded, alſo when commanded to lift up their <hi>heads, redemption</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> being come unto them.</p>
            <p>On <hi>March</hi> the 8. 1655. this very ſigne and ſignal watch-word is given me. [That I then declared it to the <hi>Protector</hi> you have read, and he that doubts of it may read what I left almoſt two years ago in the Univerſity Library of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary</hi> the firſt 1657. on <hi>Earth,</hi> and in
<pb facs="tcp:170434:14"/>
               <hi>Heaven,</hi> is it firſt ſhewed, then ſaid unto me, their <hi>ſacrifices</hi> are <hi>dirt,</hi> that very new <hi>Moon,</hi> year, and day, points out their New <hi>Moons</hi> and <hi>dirty ſacrifices,</hi> both which God abhors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 20. this <hi>Dirty</hi> houſe meets, and falls to <hi>wrangling</hi> immediately, ſo in the Viſion, ſo in the fulfill.</p>
            <p>With in 15. dayes after God ſweeps away this <hi>Dirty</hi> houſe, by his ſent meſſenger <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell</hi> coming to them in haſte, ſo in the viſion, ſo in the fulfill.</p>
            <p>If all theſe viſions prove not themſelves to be real <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and that we have warrant and good occaſion alſo now to lift up our <hi>heads,</hi> as the next ſection will fully ſhew you, then cut off my <hi>head,</hi> and reckon me a lyar for ever; I Beg not your <hi>favour,</hi> but your <hi>Repentance.</hi> Theſe things I have wrote to the <hi>Protector</hi> preſently after they were ſhewed me; you have them more exactly in print, make therefore the beſt uſe of it.</p>

            <p>IMmediately after all thoſe <hi>miſcreants</hi> were ſwept away, my ſelf with ſomeothers plainly heard ſung by moſt <hi>Angelical</hi> voices,
<pb facs="tcp:170434:15"/>
theſe words, <hi>lift up your Heads, for your redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption draweth nigh: Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is at hand, he comes with Flagons;</hi> Thoſe <hi>Celeſtial</hi> voyces continue ſinging, and reiterate the words, <hi>lift up your heads,</hi> ſtill <hi>your,</hi> with an Emphaſis, <hi>for your Redemption draweth nigh.</hi>

            <p>Raviſhed with the Excellency of the voyces and the matter, I turned my head towards thoſe Heavenly <hi>Aires,</hi> (being faced about) I then ſaw many glorious <hi>Angels</hi> moving towards us in good order, two by two, they were all clothed in white, having on them <hi>Girdles of Gold,</hi> and in ſome of their hands were <hi>Flagons of ſilver.</hi> The place they ſo appeared in, Then ſeems a <hi>Church,</hi> up the middle of that <hi>Church</hi> they come, when advanced to the <hi>Table,</hi> which was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>clean Linen</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they there ſet down thoſe ſilver <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons;</hi> that done, they ſtand round about the <hi>Table,</hi> in a moſt <hi>reverent</hi> poſture and comly beauty, fit for <hi>devotion,</hi> on which <hi>Table,</hi> neer thoſe <hi>Flagons;</hi> on a <hi>ſilver plate</hi> was placed one <hi>Mauchet</hi> cut and prepared as at our beſt ordered <hi>Communions;</hi> this done, they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether began and ſung theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people, and hath raiſed up a mighty ſalvation for them.</hi> This heard and ſeen, the viſion and ſigne aſſuring deliverance

upon their diſſipation and rejection, as in the introduction upon the 8. of <hi>March,</hi> 1655. ended, the reſt of New-years day follows.</p>
            <p>After the man with the <hi>Mete-rod or rule</hi> in his hand had ſaid unto me, <hi>their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are dirt,</hi> and God hath ſcattered with a <hi>Vengeance</hi> that <hi>dirty ſtinking helliſh cloud,</hi> (gotten into the face of that great light) as in the <hi>Introduction</hi> and <hi>Viſion</hi> of laſt <hi>New-years day,</hi> forthwith the Lord drew my eye to look again up into the <hi>Heavens,</hi> but it was more upon my right hand: I then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſaw a wondrous <hi>high hill,</hi> upon which <hi>high hill</hi> was ſituate a very <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>high Wall,</hi> the <hi>wall</hi> was made all of divers <hi>Coloured ſtones, richly ſhining</hi> as painted Glaſs, the <hi>Morter</hi> or <hi>Cement</hi> which held thoſe ſeveral coloured ſtones together, appeared rich al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as the <hi>duſt of Gold.</hi> At the end or entrance into that <hi>wall,</hi> (for it was like the wall of a <hi>great City)</hi> yet I ſaw no houſe within it; without the wall I did ſee many houſes, but the ſtood at good diſtance from that wall, and all thoſe houſes were <hi>New,</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> and building was raiſed ſome few yards above the ground, being all of perfect <hi>white ſtone,</hi> but not finiſhed; indeed the man with the mete-wand or rule to meaſure with, that anſwered to me, they <hi>offer dirt for ſacrifice,</hi> that man and <hi>innocent

boy</hi> appeared unto me among thoſe <hi>New foundations</hi> which were on both ſides of a <hi>largeſtreet.</hi> At the end of that <hi>Rich wall,</hi> there ſtood a <hi>Tree</hi> or <hi>Trees,</hi> which were full as <hi>high,</hi> or <hi>higher</hi> then the <hi>Rich wall.</hi>

            <p>Within the <hi>wall,</hi> (and juſt over the place the <hi>wall</hi> ſurrounded) I did ſee a wonderful <hi>Great light,</hi> very <hi>Glorious</hi> it was, and of a <hi>Chryſtaline Colour,</hi> for bigneſs it appeared ten times as big as the <hi>Moon.</hi> This <hi>light</hi> ſhewed me a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and divers other <hi>clean Creatures,</hi> as <hi>ſheep</hi> and <hi>kids.</hi> What I ſaw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when I had wept and prayed to God that he would be pleaſed I might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole <hi>Viſion,</hi> I will not now tell you what that was, the obtaining of it coſt me dear; I am ſure I lay ſo long <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> with a reſolution I would have no denial, until the Lord was pleaſed to let me fully underſtand the <hi>Viſion,</hi> that it is his unparalleld goodneſs to me I am alive at this time.

            <p>
               <hi>Tuesday</hi> night, which was <hi>February</hi> the 9. juſt 5. dayes after this houſe was ſwept, I came home to my own houſe from <hi>Oxford;</hi> Being come home, God then ſhewed me a very <hi>great</hi> and <hi>Glorious people,</hi> ſtanding or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> they were a people <hi>richly ſhining;</hi> in the head of this ſo Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body after a ſhort time, there comes <hi>ſlowly</hi> moving, but in very <hi>great ſtate Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> the moſt <hi>Tranſcendently Glorious perſon</hi> that ever my eyes beheld, he was clothed in a very <hi>Rich Coat or long veſt,</hi> which <hi>Coat</hi> or Rich <hi>veſt</hi> was <hi>girt about his Middle</hi> with a <hi>broad Girdle</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> in his <hi>hand</hi> there was an extraordinary <hi>long</hi> and <hi>Broad naked ſword,</hi> which great <hi>ſword</hi> he held upright;

this Tranſcendent <hi>perſon</hi> had ſuch A <hi>Head,</hi> face and countenance, for beauty, <hi>Majeſty,</hi> power, and <hi>wonder,</hi> as I can never expreſs or ſet forth unto you, the figure of his perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Wonderful height,</hi> yet very ſtraight, having no defection in any part, but <hi>Tale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond compare: this Rich, <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi> perſon ſtood ſo long in the head of that beautiful and ſhining people, that I had a full view of him and them to my great contentment.

what we do, of wonder in the heavens;</hi> being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at more advantage to well obſerve, but ſtill in that City <hi>Bridges,</hi> I then looked up, and plainly ſaw (at good diſtance) coming from the <hi>North</hi> or <hi>North-weſt,</hi> very many ſmall bodies of <hi>horſe,</hi> having on them the beſt <hi>appointed Riders.</hi> Thoſe <hi>horſe</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Came towards the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>South-Eaſt;</hi> as they came nearer to me, they ſeemed to increaſe, ſo that very much of the <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere</hi> was ſuddenly over-ſpread with them; that part of the <hi>Heavens</hi> they moved in was all over of a perfect <hi>Fire colour,</hi> ſince I came into the world, I never beheld ſuch <hi>horſe</hi> and <hi>Riders,</hi> for <hi>Strength, Courage,</hi> and <hi>Reſolution;</hi> they came <hi>fiercely Trotting</hi> on, <hi>ſtamping</hi> alſo with their <hi>feet;</hi> their <hi>Hoofes</hi> and <hi>Shooes,</hi> which I perfectly ſaw, lookt like <hi>Flint,</hi> or ſomething <hi>Harder</hi> then the nether <hi>Mill-ſtone;</hi> they were <hi>ſhod,</hi> for the Lord knows what ſervice and <hi>Execution,</hi> I do not. <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Riders</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld ſtrength in every part, Their heads all <hi>Lift</hi> up, not a <hi>Man</hi> or Horſe of them that had any defect, or apprehenſion of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; what ſpeak I of danger? there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſtand before them, ſo ſure as the Lord lives, they were an <hi>Hoſt</hi> that ſhall not fail to effect whatſoever the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Hoſts</hi> ſhall <hi>Commiſſion</hi> them for, That is, <hi>to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his vengeance on evil-doers.</hi>

Whilſt with aſtoniſhment I looked upon all this, I prayed, and praying, beſought the Lord that he would be pleaſed to let me know what all that force ſignified, forthwith I heard a very ſtrong voice, coming direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down from Heaven, before the <hi>Horſe</hi> came up to me, which ſtrong voice ſpake theſe words only, <hi>It is the coming of God, It is the coming of God.</hi> I neither ſaw more nor heard more, but I ſhall tell you what I Read more, and it is the word of <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>ſuites</hi> in all things very well with this viſion of <hi>Gods,</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ioel</hi> you have theſe words: <hi>A day of Gloomineſs, Clouds, and thick darkneſs: A Great and ſtrong people, There hath not been ever the like, the land is as the Garden of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before them, and behind them a deſolate wilderneſs, nothing ſhall eſcape them;</hi> The <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of them is as</hi> the <hi>appearance of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>as horſemen,</hi> ſo <hi>ſhall they run to be avenged on his Enemies:</hi> this is in <hi>Ioel</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in the 11. <hi>verſe</hi> of that Chapter you have theſe very words, <hi>and the Lord ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his voyce before his hoſt:</hi> ſo in the head of the Hoſt was it ſaid unto me, <hi>it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God:</hi> the verſe concludes with theſe words, <hi>The day of the Lord is Great, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible, who can abide it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that word which came to <hi>Ieremiah</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I have a few words to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I dare not but obſerve to them before I quit this Section. Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> deceive not your ſelves, but warrantably believe, and patiently provide for, your ſad
<pb facs="tcp:170434:22"/>
ſhare of ſufferance in <hi>this coming of God</hi> to <hi>take vengeance on Evil-doers;</hi> therefore Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Read, and well conſider my Reaſons, it highly concerns you, for with your Church all is at ſtake.</p>
            <p>Firſt, theſe <hi>Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the Lords, which came from the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>North-weſt,</hi> moved ſo haſtily as if they would be with your <hi>Church</hi> preſently, having their faces directly ſet againſt the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> and ſo from thence, not onely <hi>Rome,</hi> but the proudeſt part of that <hi>Church</hi> lies <hi>(South</hi> and <hi>South Eaſt)</hi> is not onely the <hi>Eagles</hi> neſt, but that <hi>Brood</hi> alſo of <hi>Vultures,</hi> now to be <hi>deplumed, daſhed</hi> in pieces, and made <hi>inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, not long before this was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, I was alſo ſhewed the <hi>Altars</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> both of them in their <hi>Richeſt</hi> adorne and moſt ſuitable dreſs; at which time their <hi>Prieſts</hi> boaſted of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and <hi>Altars,</hi> Proudly ſaying to me; <hi>ſee,</hi> is <hi>not this to the Glory of God?</hi> In anſwer to which words, I preſently heard a voyce which deſended from above, and ſaid, <hi>The Altars of Rome are not fitted for the worſhip of God.</hi> Theſe words heard by her <hi>Prieſts</hi> alſo, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Cryed out, this is <hi>Goſtelo</hi> that hath <hi>Prophecied</hi> and <hi>Printed,</hi> Our <hi>Church ſhall fall; Away with him, Away with him:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170434:22"/>
The multitude derided me, and ſtrove who ſhould be formoſt to have me out; the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in their Rich habits, followed and helped to drive me out, when forced out of their Churches; for out went multitude, my ſelf, <hi>Prieſts</hi> and all. I then lookt behind me, and ſaw the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſtill in their Rich habits; but very ſtrangely <hi>Metamorphoſed,</hi> for all their heads were then as the heads of <hi>Wolves, Foxes, Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Swine;</hi> which whilſt I ſtood wondering at, immediately in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye all of them were <hi>ſtruck down</hi> flat to the <hi>Ground,</hi> on which they helpleſs lay <hi>Grovelling</hi> and <hi>bleeding, wounded</hi> only on the <hi>heads;</hi> at which <hi>wounds,</hi> and at the ſnout of their unclean <hi>heads,</hi> (for they ſtill retained them) they there and then, on the <hi>Ground,</hi> Expired and <hi>Bled</hi> to death; I ſaw not the hand that <hi>ſtruck</hi> them <hi>down,</hi> nor a man of them that ever roſe from the <hi>Earth</hi> again.</p>
            <p>My third Reaſon is, in the <hi>Prophecy</hi> I printed; which Prophecy I give you for the word of God (agreeable thereunto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is) there it is ſaid in that <hi>Prophecy</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall; and put me to death, if ever one <hi>word</hi> of that <hi>Prophecy</hi> go unfulfilled; Flatter not your ſelves you of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> to ſome of your more ſober ones, men in Orders alſo, to ſuch I have already imparted much that hath been
<pb facs="tcp:170434:23"/>
ſhewed me of that <hi>Churches</hi> ſad fate: thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ones have replyed to me, that truly they had reaſon to expect and fear, <hi>God</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to puniſh them and their <hi>Church</hi> alſo, but that ſhe ſhould fall, that could not be admitted; the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> poſſibly might fall, nay they believed, it ſhould fall, but for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> they believed, it was built upon that <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> which could not fall; would to God they were ſo. The <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledged (as well it may) to be infected, now ſick, and may fall; certainly the body which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready totters can not ſtand long: hear the words again you of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, Men</hi> in <hi>Orders</hi> and others, for clearly there is many of you, that I love well, and there is too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you that merit not to be beloved, the very words of the infallible <hi>Prophecy</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of <hi>God</hi> alſo, are theſe, <hi>The Church of Rome ſhall fall;</hi> the words heard in the viſion are theſe, <hi>The Altars of Rome are not fitted for the ſervice of God;</hi> you have read what her prieſts ſuffered, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtruck down to the Ground, <hi>wounded</hi> on the <hi>heads</hi> only, as <hi>Prophecied</hi> of Old, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall Break thy head,</hi> when a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful <hi>Serpent,</hi> on no part elſe is the wound viſible, what thoſe <hi>heads</hi> were all unclean; <hi>Wolves, Foxes, Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine.</hi> Laſtly how
<pb facs="tcp:170434:23"/>
they bled at them untill they Expired. And now believe me you of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> if all the men on <hi>Earth</hi> keep your <hi>Church</hi> from falling, put me not only to death, but put me alſo into your <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender</hi> in Great Red letters, and let my name ſtand there as a ſon of <hi>Belial</hi> and a lyar for ever, if that I have Prophecied of your Church come not to paſs, and I fear ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly alſo, I would you did the like: A few years will make it viſible to all, that ſhe is a Church <hi>may fall, ſhall fall, and never riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</hi> and this not raiſing againſt you, but as a friend I early tell you, and will for ever ſtand to; I believe I ſhall ſhortly come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, I intend ſo, and to this very purpoſe that you may turn from ſin <hi>and do your firſt works,</hi> for what you do now is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable and <hi>God abhors it,</hi> and you ſhall ſmoke for it. This digreſſion made I return to my purpoſed method; To <hi>London,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you of <hi>London God is coming alſo;</hi> but how think you? the manner follows; <hi>Repent</hi> or <hi>Burn, for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the Earth, and with righteouſneſs to judge the world, and the people with his truth,</hi> Pſal. the 96. 13.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Bridges</hi> in the morning of the Eighth of <hi>Aprill Stylo novo,</hi> about day, I clearly ſaw our ſoveraign Lord the King ſitting in Counſel with ſome ſix more, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> one of the Counſel, and whilſt they ſo ſate in Counſel, there came down from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, into the midſt of them, a very lively and wonderful bright <hi>Fire</hi> of Coles; Clear it was as the beſt Charcole fire when all of a Glow; No ſmoke about it, no aſhes under it: this fire was no more in compaſs, then what might well be contained upon ſuch a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> or plate of the <hi>Altar,</hi> as His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and Heroick Brothers offered their Alms upon the Sabbath day before, being <hi>Eaſter day,</hi> on which they all received the Moſt Bleſſed Communion of our Lords <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> by them received with that due <hi>Reverence,</hi> holy <hi>fear,</hi> and apparent <hi>contrition</hi> for ſin, that upon my very conſcience I may moſt warrantably ſay' their prayers and Almes reached <hi>Heaven;</hi> and to witneſs <hi>acceptance,</hi> their God ſends down the very next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, That his fire in their behalf, to do what you ſhall preſently read it commiſſioned for.</p>
            <p>This fire ſo fallen in the midſt of them,
<pb facs="tcp:170434:26"/>
firſt moved round, diſcernable to all, next it comes to a ſtand at the feet of our <hi>Soveraign Lord the King,</hi> pointing him out to us, to be the ſervant and for ever beloved of God Almighty: after it had ſtood ſome ſhort time there, I heard theſe words Commiſſioning it to go forth; <hi>Begin at London, and go throw all his dominions. Fear</hi> all that read it, and you that hear it, I ſay <hi>fear</hi> and Tremble, for they are the words of the Lord Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his alſo is this ſent-out fire. So ſoon as the words were ſpoken, <hi>Begin at London &amp; go thorow all his dominions,</hi> the fire immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately removed from between the Kings feet, to a diſtance ſome three yards from him, and there ſtood, but ſtill kept in a right line before him; there and then, that fire ſuddenly became <hi>dilated,</hi> and forthwith was big as the <hi>Sun</hi> in appearance; when ſo dilated it had then aſhes all under it, which aſhes were of the thickneſs of a pocket-<hi>Bible, fire, aſhes,</hi> and <hi>Bible</hi> are made up of the word and power of God, who ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems his word, his fire makes aſhes of them; contemn <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> and you periſh together.</p>
            <p>Certainly on purpoſe is it thus ſhewed me with <hi>aſhes</hi> under it, that I may let you all ſee and know its readineſs to Execute Gods Command, firſt upon you of <hi>London,
<pb facs="tcp:170434:26"/>
Begin at London,</hi> then his three Kingdoms and Chriſtian world: Men and Brethren, either ſuffer your <hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Rebellions</hi> of all ſorts of which you are Horridly Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God and his King <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> (your <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are <hi>Dirt,</hi> your hypocriſies are the Greateſt, your <hi>Rebellions</hi> have no compare) ſuffer all theſe things and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever more to be burnt up and conſumed in you by his ſent-out fire of mercy; which if you ſhall <hi>madly</hi> neglect to do, deceive not your ſelves, it ſhall ſuddenly do its other work commiſſioned, for to make aſhes of you and all thoſe mountains of oppoſition that <hi>men</hi> or <hi>Devils,</hi> have, <hi>can,</hi> or dare, raiſe up to obſtruct the way and rule of Gods Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> your only lawful King and Soveraign.</p>
            <p>God is irritated, and you have done it, look to your ſelves, when the Almighty kindles and ſends forth a fire as here he doth, read I beſeech you to what purpoſe he doth it; The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> aſſures evil doers, no leſs then ſix ſeveral times in his firſt Chapters, which are but very ſhort, yet moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble full to this very purpoſe, there he ſaith, <hi>That the Lord will ſend a fire, that the Lord will Commiſſion a fire, That the Lord will kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire.</hi> And to what purpoſe I beſeech you is all this? even as here, it ſhall devour, it
<pb facs="tcp:170434:27"/>
ſhall burn up, it ſhall conſume, if not ſin, then ſinful perſons: Do you ask me what it ſhall do? I anſwer, you and all for <hi>I</hi> fear no man; do? what ſhall it not do, when commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiond and ſent out by God as this is? what ſhall it do? why, it ſhall burn up his enemies on every ſide, if they repent not; <hi>Pſ.</hi> the 97. 3 verſe, <hi>There ſhall go a fire before him, and Burn up his Enemies round about:</hi> The Army of Horſes went before, this fire comes next after, that nothing may eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> dare not yet leave this <hi>Commiſſioned fire of the Lords,</hi> ſent out upon this particular day the Eighth of <hi>Aprill;</hi> what <hi>I</hi> have now to ſay in this ſo wonderful proceed of God Almighty, is to you <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of theſe three Kingdoms <hi>(pro Tempore)</hi> Sir, well look about you; and beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think your ſelf, and know Sir, That for more then three months it was my continual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and amaze to think why it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated, <hi>Waite until the Eighth of Aprill;</hi> why to that day, <hi>I</hi> could never give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Heroick Brother any clear or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſon for it, but having upon that day ſeen the viſion, and then heard the words of Commiſſion to the <hi>Almighties</hi> fire in our Kings behalf, <hi>I</hi> can now give His Majeſty, his Brother, you and all ſuch a certain and true reaſon for it, as will aſtoniſh the world;
<pb facs="tcp:170434:27"/>
there is in it <hi>Wonder</hi> upon <hi>Wonder,</hi> it looks like the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> upon the very day, both the Lords own doings: O that <hi>I</hi> were with you, your Lordſhip ſhould find, <hi>I</hi> would ſpeak to you as ſent of God, not flatteringly; Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min your ſelf, Sir, did not the Lord ſome two years ſince, <hi>Eaſter</hi> next it will be ſo, <hi>I</hi> again ſay, did he not then in mercy ſend to you <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> the wife of <hi>Thomas Chalener,</hi> a free-holder dwelling on the Edge of <hi>Suſſex?</hi> whoſe Commiſſion was to this very purpoſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, to ask you whether or no the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> you yet gathered the fruit of, was yours or Gods; if it was yours, then to ſay ſo; if Gods, then your duty forthwith to give the fruit of it to his Steward, <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> for God had given it unto him by inheritance; if you refuſed forthwith to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or doubted his right of inheritance, ſhe tells you that God had vouchſafed for the deciſion of his right three wayes; <hi>Chuſe</hi> you either of them: God would appear for him, whoſe unqueſtionable right it was, for in the Court and juſtice of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Father having paid the debt, the Son was to have the inheritance.</p>
            <p>Her firſt offer to you is, to caſt <hi>Lots,</hi> and by <hi>lot</hi> you ſhould ſee on whom the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:170434:28"/>
would reſolve it: to that you wiſely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſaid, what if the <hi>lot</hi> ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me? ſhe truly told you it would: your anſwer was, that way of lot you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline.</p>
            <p>Her ſecond offer was, would you fight perſonally with <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> and ſo decide it? to that, as <hi>I</hi> have heard, you gave no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; indeed God forbid that any ſuch dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thought or word, ſhould ever be found in your heart or mouth: An impiety of that ugly nature, <hi>I</hi> print to the whole world will never be found in you, as ill as men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeak of you: who was moſt Culpable before, God knows, <hi>I</hi> do not.</p>
            <p>The perſons of Kings are ſacred, <hi>Appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God,</hi> and anointed by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> wiſe and honeſt men know it well, their perſons are rarely to be expoſed; <hi>Crowns,</hi> not to be worne by any but whom the Lord ſets apart; with us it muſt be ſo, the law of God and our Land beſt directs in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and <hi>I</hi> firmely believe, That as you ſaid nothing to that ſecond offer of the Lords (for they are all his offers, not hers) ſo upon that very conſideration, let the world ſay what they will, you have hitherto declined, and ever will do, to put on his <hi>Crown:</hi> they were <hi>fools</hi> that ſaid, you were afraid of the Army when twas offered you; no no, you
<pb facs="tcp:170434:28"/>
were afraid of God, and your King; do well and be ſo Ever: <hi>I</hi> commend your wiſdom in that you put that <hi>Dirty</hi> aſſembly upon tryal what they would do with the Crown, whereby you might clearly ſee and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Enemies of God and the King, alſo the haters of Monarchy; how could you a ſerved your King better? you have out-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all thoſe Arrant Good ſubjects. The Lord ſhewed me before their ſitting, and told me when they were to ſit, their <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were Dirt,</hi> you had it before, thoſe were the very <hi>Men,</hi> that was the <hi>Dirty Parliament;</hi> his <hi>Crown, I</hi> ſay and print to the world, you will not touch it, nor med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it upon any ill account, indeed upon no account, except it be to ſettle it upon the right head. I have heard of a King who being at Sea, and his <hi>Crown</hi> on his head, by ſome unhappy accident his <hi>Crown</hi> fell into the Sea; a moſt Excellent ſwimmer dives after it, recovers it, brings it above water; which being too proud of, he ſtaid there and put it on his own head; at laſt the <hi>Crown</hi> came to the right hand and owner, the King Commands that the man ſhould be <hi>Royally</hi> rewarded for his ſwimming ſo well, and recovering the <hi>Crown,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtrictly charged he ſhould be forthwith Hanged, for putting the <hi>Crown</hi> upon his
<pb facs="tcp:170434:29"/>
own head. I ſpeak not this to deter you, you know very well that the <hi>Crown</hi> was none of thoſe upright juſt dealing mens to give, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were you to take it, it is Gods only to give, and our lawful declared Kings <hi>Charls Stuarts</hi> only to receive; God and our Laws, have both pointed him out, during life, and prohibited all others to be Capable of it. God <hi>ſave the King,</hi> Even Ours <hi>Charls Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> yea God will ſave him for Ever.</p>
            <p>Her third offer was, (you having been ſo well adviſed as to refuſe the two former) <hi>Whether or no you would ſet apart perſons on both ſides, and let them perſons ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented fight for the right of inheritance and future receit of the profits belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;</hi> if you would ſo fight, that you then declared when you would fight: (here was a moſt merciful proceeding of the Lords.) <hi>Davids</hi> three offers for choice were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother nature; To this laſt alſo you decline to anſwer. I am Glad to ſee now the power is in your own hand, that you are not for imbroyling the Kingdoms in a new war: Upon that very conſideration it may fare much better with you, then it hath with thoſe that ſet you to work; God aſſures us in his word (in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> of mine alſo) <hi>that he will ſcatter the men which delight in war;</hi> and I praiſe his name for it, he hath
<pb facs="tcp:170434:29"/>
done very much by your hand and wiſdom, to avoid the ſhedding of any more Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood. She tells you, ſhe is not to quit you, untill you do anſwer to this laſt offer, following and importuning you for it. In fine, after ſome ſhort demurre, Theſe very words, or words to this purpoſe come from you; If fighting could not be avoided, and it muſt be ſo, then be it, upon <hi>Munday come twelvemoneth:</hi> other anſwer untill then ſhe might not expect nor ſtay for, but be gone: To all which, as her ſelf hath ſince told me, She then replyed, God certainly would fight or appear in the behalf of his and our King <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> before that time, <hi>ſo ſure</hi> as the Lord is in Heaven; there was <hi>Prophecy</hi> in theſe, her laſt words, and ſhe knew it not.</p>
            <p>My Lord, and all that read this, Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve very well and ſee what God doth.</p>
            <p>The Munday come <hi>twelvemoneth</hi> you ſet for fighting or further anſwer, was with us of this Nation <hi>April</hi> the 6. 1657. and the very next day after <hi>Low-Sunday</hi> laſt; Where God ſhews me this Viſion, at <hi>Bridges</hi> in <hi>Flanders, Low-Sunday</hi> laſt fell out to be upon the Eight of <hi>April</hi> 1657. juſt one day before that Munday come twelvemoneth. Oh all that read! ſee here, how miraculouſly doth this make good
<pb facs="tcp:170434:30"/>
what ſhe ſaid and Propheſied, but knew not of, juſt as of old, to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom the Lord wrought for, and by his mighty hand brought out of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the very ſame day as promiſed, is not this our Eighth of <hi>April?</hi> ſo likewiſe, God lets it alone untill the very laſt day before that ſet Munday. Then he doth it, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next day before, none betwixt, and on that very day he doth it; as <hi>I</hi> foretold his Majeſty it ſhould be done on the eighth of <hi>Aprill.</hi> Who ſees not now clearly, we were all over-ruled of God, even you <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell</hi> alſo in your replyes? For my unworthy ſelf, in good earneſt I profeſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I could never tell the King what he might expect on that day; I deal clearly with you, I did in a very great meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that ſome ſudden judgement from <hi>Heaven</hi> would that day viſibly have fallen in <hi>England</hi> upon incorrigible ſinners; but ſee, and for ever praiſed be Gods holy name, it is the clean contrary for the preſent. This fire from Heaven muſt firſt burn up our corruptions, and make many of us true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>King Charles Stuart,</hi> in whoſe behalf it is ſent out. This is that I am to let you all know, and came hither for, I warrantably tell you, neither <hi>Men</hi> nor <hi>Devils</hi> ſhall be of power long to keep out
<pb facs="tcp:170434:30"/>
Gods <hi>Anointed</hi> and our lawful King <hi>Charles Stuart:</hi> God will not longer be mocked, undeniably thus it is, none ſhall proſper that oppoſeth him or his King; he that but puld down her Paper from the Chappel doore, his arm withers; God indeed ſuffers him to live ſome 15. dayes after, but it is to carry about with him a withered <hi>Arm,</hi> that the judgements of God may appear the more publick, and ſure to come upon evil doers, affording yet more time for him and us to repent, and amend for ſhame. In the Epiſtle you have read when <hi>Whaley</hi> of <hi>Northampton</hi> Belies, Traduceth, (and I fear) endevours much more, to ſuppreſs Gods ſo miraculous proceedings in that Town, on my behalf <hi>Prophecy</hi> and Book, he <hi>drops</hi> down and dies in his clothes immediately without any more a do. The Preface to the Reader tels you as much, he that fears man more then God, and to loſe an eſtate on <hi>Earth</hi> more then <hi>Heaven,</hi> Certainly his impieties are of the worſt nature and illeſt conſequence: God would convert you, and you abuſe his mercies, deſpiſe and perſecute his ſent Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers; Oh, mercy abuſed, leaves room for judgement, warning not taken is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preſage of deſtruction; if often we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pardon, as you have done, to expect it longer is deſperate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170434:31"/>
Look back a little and well conſider, what this <hi>fire</hi> of mercy hath done amongſt us, and the Kings Enemies, ſince ſent out by God on his Majeſties behalf, being but the Eighth of <hi>Aprill</hi> laſt; did it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or upon the fifteenth day of that very month of <hi>Aprill,</hi> defeat and bring to nought, that ſo bloody and damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, of the <hi>Annabaptiſt fifth Monarchy</hi> men, and <hi>Levellers,</hi> all ſworn Enemies to Monarchy, all miſchievous brethren? in that intended <hi>Rebellion</hi> did it not do its work alſo at <hi>London,</hi> as Commiſſioned, Begin at <hi>London,</hi> after go through all his dominions? (So that viſibly you ſhall know it) in ſtead of ſetting up their ſtandard, and Arming of thouſands, which they were provided of, and for, together with the ſpreading of their ſeditious <hi>Pamphlets</hi> for a new <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which the better to diſpoſe others to joyn with them, they had well provided by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences, and ſharing of other mens eſtates, not willing that any ſhould be poor amongſt thoſe only Saints, which as they ſaid and printed, were undonbredly the juſt ones that ſhould now rule the world, us of this part of it, at the leaſt; ſo that if Gods ſent-out <hi>fire</hi> on the Eighth of <hi>Aprill</hi> had not prevented it, Theſe Saints, <hi>Martin Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:170434:31"/>
them what you will, are the moſt impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable haters of all Kings and Monarches in the whole world) had ſuddenly or in a ſhort time molded and Gathered an Army of thirty or forty thouſand, whoſe buſineſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was to have embroiled this kingdom in a <hi>new</hi> and moſt dangerous <hi>war;</hi> the principles of thoſe men, with the now pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the moſt men, would a made mad work, had not this <hi>fire</hi> of Gods burnt up, and prevented the confuſions.</p>
            <p>As I am a Chriſtian, God ſhewed me in a <hi>viſion</hi> that whole Rebellion; Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, their actings, and their ruine; he ſhewed it me in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the wednesday before <hi>Eaſter</hi> 1657. On Goodfriday I told the King, after that I wrote it, and ſet my hand and ſeal unto it, that it was a true <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of Gods, Given by the Lord, for a ſigne that it ſhould all ſo and ſo Come to paſs by that day month, and this God did, to ſatisfie ſome that defired a ſigne of God, to the end belief might be created in the hearts of many that doubted. Nay I was ſo impowred of God, that after I had wrote it and ſealed unto it, I laid it upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table, and there received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion upon it, That this was Gods <hi>viſion,</hi> and he would fulfill it that day month, when as I am alive, I knew nothing of it,
<pb facs="tcp:170434:32"/>
but what the Lord ſhewed me of <hi>viſion,</hi> from thence I wrote to the <hi>Protector</hi> here, that he ſhould fear nothing, for God would diſappoint the deſignes of wicked men who were working miſchief, and that he would do it before the twentieth of <hi>April.</hi> Indeed I told the <hi>King</hi> the very day he would do it on, that <hi>wednesday</hi> moneth on which it was ſhewed me; for ſo was it ſaid unto me, after the <hi>viſion</hi> ended, this day month this <hi>viſion</hi> ſhall have its fulfill; Eight dayes before that day month came, was it ſaid unto me by <hi>viſion</hi> alſo, what ſhall be done that day is not of man, but that God may be Glorified, <hi>God,</hi> my <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>His</hi> two <hi>Princely Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> are my witneſs, I told them of it long before; and all this I now ſee is Gods working <hi>fire,</hi> which on my <hi>Kings</hi> behalf, ſhall <hi>Convert, defeat,</hi> or <hi>Conſume</hi> his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> This is that ſtone cut out without hands which ſhall now do that <hi>Great work</hi> of the Lords, <hi>Break in peeces the powers that are not of God,</hi> Prophecied of old by <hi>Daniel,</hi> but now fulfilling: and thus by the power of God, theſe mens <hi>Arms, Ammunition, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, books, deſigne</hi> and <hi>perſons,</hi> came all by that day month, (nay your own <hi>books</hi> tell you in print, that very morning, they came all) into and under the <hi>Protectors hand</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> Come I ſay he ſhall do the work of

God and his <hi>King,</hi> he ſhall ſubdue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Monarchy, yea his <hi>Kings</hi> enemies he ſhall ſubdue, root out, and make them incapable to offend or hurt; and this he ſhall do, becauſe his heart doth or ſhall fear God and the <hi>King:</hi> And this I will ever ſtand to, this I have related unto you was the initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory part and fulfill of that Great <hi>viſion,</hi> but the latter, and completory part of it is and will be the <hi>wonder of the world;</hi> bur I muſt yet conceal that part of it from the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned; a few ſhall know it, and but a few.</p>
            <p>For a ſecond work of this <hi>Fire</hi> ſent forth in the behalf of our King, in <hi>May,</hi> the very next moneth after, ſix thouſand men in arms are ſent for <hi>France,</hi> a ſhort time after them four thouſand more, in all <hi>ten</hi> thouſand men; pray tell me, are not theſe men, being ſo great a number, <hi>Converted</hi> or <hi>Conſumed?</hi> how many of them now live the <hi>Kings</hi> Enemies?

            <p>As for that blow at the <hi>Hermitage,</hi> and ſudden burſt by <hi>Gun-powder,</hi> was it not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you and me, as a <hi>warning-piece</hi> to look about us? it fell out ſo ſoon as ever I came over to Print unto you, that God had ſent out his <hi>Fire</hi> in behalf of our <hi>King,</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> or <hi>Conſume:</hi> in good earneſt I looked upon that Blow, though a judgement, yet a mercy, a few men killed, many houſes much defaced; I viewed it well, and in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber judgement with neighbours and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants there abouts; we allowed fifteen hundred houſes to be torn and damaged by it: All this is ſhewed me, and you, what your <hi>City</hi> ſhould be, if you repent not, an heap of <hi>Rubbiſh</hi> and <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Confuſion.</hi> For that ſo general ſickneſs, which went almoſt through the whole kingdom the laſt ſummer, taking away very many, Truly it was no other to my underſtanding, then the merciful ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods Rod over the whole land for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, for a <hi>Menace</hi> if they amended not; and look to it that you do Amend, or aſſure your ſelves ſudden <hi>Death, Plagus, Sword, Fire, Violence,</hi> what not, ſhall in a very ſhort time burſt in upon you, to <hi>devour,</hi> to <hi>burn</hi> up, to <hi>conſume,</hi> and to lay <hi>waſte.</hi> And this brings me to the now ſad fate of this ſo

<pb facs="tcp:170434:34"/>
on the North-fide of this ſo ſinful City <hi>London,</hi> the people of this City then appeared before me very fine, very numerous, Bargaining alſo, and full of jollity, every man putting the evill day far from him, deriding to the purpoſe my ſelf or any that durſt tell them they ſhould ſee Change or alteration: when all this jollity, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and trade was at the higheſt, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the day over-caſt, and became dark, that occaſioned us to look up into the <hi>Heavens;</hi> looking up, I ſaw over the <hi>Eaſt</hi> part of this City <hi>London,</hi> in the <hi>Aire,</hi> many ſtrange <hi>figures</hi> of furious <hi>Satyrs,</hi> as Executioners of Gods <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance;</hi> they had all ſhapes like <hi>Devils,</hi> not like <hi>men.</hi> At this Horrible ſight, the people ſuddenly looked <hi>Pale</hi> and <hi>Trembled;</hi> The day, <hi>that grew darker,</hi> and withall in an inſtant <hi>Soultry hot.</hi> Looking up again, the whole City then appeared to be ſurrounded with thoſe furious <hi>Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> ſo was it then ſurrounded by thoſe Executioners of Gods <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance,</hi> that there was no place left for eſcape, or to get out at.

it, which <hi>Lights</hi> clearly diſcovered to me the Ruinous condition of the <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> dedicated to Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> theſe lights were placed to ſo wonderful advantage, That they laid open to me, <hi>Cloſe Corners, Ware-houſes, Shops, dark places, places of Sacriledge, Theft, Murder, damnable uncleanneſſes, Hypocriſies as deep as Hell;</hi> indeed I cannot expreſs all I ſaw, but ſo much was ſhewed me, that my heart ſmote me, and put me thus to reaſon.</p>
            <p>O Lord, thought I, What art thou now ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this City <hi>London,</hi> as once thou didſt <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> with Candels? muſt this ſo ſad day be a day of <hi>Wrath, deſtruction,</hi> and <hi>deſolation?</hi> ſhall this place now be <hi>devoured</hi> and <hi>Conſumed by the fire of thy jealouſie?</hi> While I thus ſadly contemplated, there ſuddenly appeared, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by me on my right hand, a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White Enſignes,</hi> which <hi>Enſignes</hi> had in every of them, <hi>Ten times</hi> as much <hi>Black</hi> as <hi>White.</hi> Here and there a <hi>Pearl</hi> or <hi>Diamond</hi> of <hi>White,</hi> as in the <hi>Flag:</hi> but a very few that ſhall finde <hi>deliverance,</hi> his <hi>Iewels</hi> ſhall, in that day of <hi>Vengeance.</hi> The place theſe <hi>Flags</hi> ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in, was the very place your <hi>Enſignes of Rebellion</hi> were held up in, againſt your <hi>King, Law,</hi> and <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> when you uſurped the <hi>Militia</hi> from his <hi>Majeſties</hi> hand, The North-ſide of this City <hi>London,</hi> near the <hi>Winde-Mills,</hi> (which fitly reſembles your

empty turning pates) there were ſo many of theſe mourning <hi>Enſignes,</hi> that every <hi>Street, Alley,</hi> and <hi>cloſe Corner of iniquity</hi> was provided for, whilſt with admiration I looked upon them, firſt as being ſo vaſt a number, next as being all <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> and my Eye faſtened on them, ſuddenly all of them were raiſed up from the Ground, to ſuch a height were they raiſed, that they might go over the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Wall</hi> or <hi>Bulwark,</hi> obſerve with me if the <hi>Devil</hi> be gotten as high as <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſeeming an <hi>Angel of Light</hi> alſo, yet there Gods hand reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, and whirles him thence, I ſaw not any hand of <hi>Man</hi> raiſing thoſe <hi>Enſignes,</hi> no mans hand touched any one of them; being raiſed they moved all of them towards this City <hi>London,</hi> and juſt as they moved, <hi>I</hi> alſo was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up from the ground, but my face was then turned towards the North (from the City) ſtill I ſaw and beheld the <hi>Flags</hi> moving towards the City, and thoſe <hi>Enſignes</hi> paſsing on by me they went the neareſt way, at which time as they moved, I heard theſe words and no more, <hi>Now the King marcheth:</hi> When the words were ſpoken, <hi>Now the King marcheth,</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, I alſo by that power which took me up from the ground, was in that very inſtant of time carried away with my face from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I neither heard more, nor ſaw more, what ſo ſadly and in an inſtant followed me, is moſt
<pb facs="tcp:170434:36"/>
Tragical and full of Lamentation, as to this ſo ſinful City <hi>London.</hi> There preſently overtook me ſuch a Stink, yea ſuch a <hi>damnable</hi> ſtink, of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> that truly I thought it would have choked me, certainly the ſtink of Hell can not exceed it; for my own part <hi>I</hi> was not ſuffered then to pity you, nor once to look behind me. What think you now, have not your ſins exceeded thoſe of <hi>Sodom? I</hi> would to God your non-repentance, together with your certain puniſhment, might not anſwer theirs alſo; But <hi>I</hi> have done with you.</p>
            <p>This ſeen and heard, <hi>I</hi> could not be quiet until <hi>I</hi> privately imparted all to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and both his Heroick <hi>Brothers,</hi> Indeed whilſt <hi>I</hi> weeping imparted it to my pious <hi>King, I</hi> was forced to beſeech him, not to mournimmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately for them, to forgive them <hi>I</hi> told him it was his duty, and to pray for their ſouls, but certainly God would be glorified on them, whatſoever became of their <hi>Bodies or Eſtates,</hi> and that ſinke of wickedneſs, <hi>Brothell City of all ſin and Rebellion,</hi> now ripe for <hi>Iudgement.</hi> That done, <hi>I</hi> took leave of them, and haſted hither, whither <hi>I</hi> am come on purpoſe to let you of this ſo ſinful City <hi>London,</hi> know theſe ſad things, that if poſsible, you might <hi>Repent, Live,</hi> and finde <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true, <hi>I</hi> ſaw no hand of man in the whole viſion, nor do <hi>I</hi> think other of thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

words heard, <hi>Now the King marcheth,</hi> but that the workings againſt this City <hi>London,</hi> as well as the words, will be the workings of the <hi>Almighty King of Kings,</hi> he it is, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> that will ſo powerfully fulfil in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of our King <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi> Alas our good <hi>King</hi> is not rightly known to you, nor owned of you, but God owns him, and that you ſhall ſuddenly know and finde, he is miſrepreſented to you, and you are pleaſed with it, you are wilfully blind, and how ſhould you know him? you continue to injure him daily, beyond all compare, you traduce him ſtill, as you did of old his glorified Father, too many of you would willingly rid the world of him, as you did of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt; and to what purpoſe is all this miſchief and villany? onely. That you might the better enjoy his inheritance, with thoſe alſo which you have ſtollen from the Church and others; In this City <hi>London</hi> all this villany, with the Lord knows what more, hath been committed by a Law and Laws of your own making. Yet good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>King</hi> for all this he mourns for you, he daily prayes for you, and on my Conſcience he doth it from the very bottome of his heart, Praying for you in the Lords own words, <hi>That God would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him his Treſpaſſes, as he forgives thoſe that have treſpaſſed againſt</hi> (his Father and him) he ſees clearly judgement is haſting to you, and ſorrows for it, you continue blinde, and
<pb facs="tcp:170434:37"/>
will not ſo much as once ſee it moving towards you, by your non-repentance it appears ſo. Oh take your <hi>King</hi> for a better pattern.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Majeſties</hi> charity, and ſweetneſs of ſoul, in imitation of the higheſt example and beſt of patterns, his ever bleſſed Saviour, and lately Glorified Father, according to both their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, hath begot in him our <hi>King,</hi> ſuch a well grounded confidence, in the unchangeable favour of God Almighty towards him, and to his juſt cauſe, notwithſtanding, all thoſe late inundations of <hi>Evil,</hi> and other <hi>improbabilities of his Reſtore,</hi> That in good earneſt, when none preſent with his <hi>Majeſty</hi> but my moſt unworthy ſelf, He hath been pleaſed cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to tell me, ſeveral times, even to me hath his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſaid it, That he doubts not at all, but firmly believes, The Lord will <hi>Reſtore</hi> him to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Right of inheritance;</hi> indeed he needs not doubt of his <hi>Reſtore,</hi> nor any thing elſe thats beſt for him, God having given him a heart to refer all things, whether in matter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore,</hi> or <hi>Revenge, Time</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> to his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Father and <hi>Omnipotent God,</hi> moſt wiſely conſidering that to God onely it belongs to take <hi>Vengeance,</hi> to us not at all. As for you of this City and three Nations, Were your <hi>Repentance</hi> what it ſhould be, God would aſſure you of forgiveneſs in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> alſo, but <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> cannot truſt him, they have, So Irritated So diſſembled with; your <hi>Sacrifices are Dirt,</hi> and your ſelves are not other.</p>

of his coming?</hi> ſurely ſuch as thoſe, we have amongſt us now, who do not onely <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride</hi> what I have already ſaid as concerning the now coming of God, to take <hi>Vengeance</hi> on <hi>Evil doers,</hi> but are as ready, if not more ready, to ſcoff and deride at the <hi>Reſtore of our King,</hi> Seeing things continue as they were, <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Militia</hi> in their poſſeſſion ſtill; No God yet appears coming to avenge, no <hi>King</hi> as yet in any likely way of <hi>Reſtore,</hi> be it ſo, this ſtartles me not, it may them; Gods unexpected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brings to ſuch mockers and deriders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable judgement.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170434:38"/>
in the Chancell, full beſet with <hi>Cherubims,</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all of them juſt one againſt the other face to face, but ſuch was the tranſcendent Beauty of their <hi>faces, heads,</hi> and <hi>wings,</hi> that my eyes never beheld the like: this light alſo ſhewed me thoſe mockers and deriders of the <hi>Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore,</hi> ſtanding afar off towards the lower end of the Church, my ſelf with great admiration looking upon what then appeared, and my eyes faſtened upon the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> ſuddenly there glides in a light wonderfully tranſcending the former; indeed that laſt light was ſo very glorious, and withall ſo beautiful piercing alſo, that <hi>I</hi> have often thought and ſaid, a man could hardly look upon ſuch a <hi>Viſio.</hi> twice &amp; live: whilſt this ſo miraculous light appeared, all the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi> which ſtill kept their places and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of <hi>face to face,</hi> then ſoftly moved, and Reverently bowed their ſo glorious heads, at the ſame time alſo they ſlowly ſhook and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their <hi>Seraphical</hi> and ſnow-white wings, heads and wings were fuller of beauty then <hi>I</hi> can expreſs.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170434:39"/>
immediately haſted out: Here is a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mockers, haters, and deriders of our <hi>Kings Reſtore,</hi> (aſtoniſhed all of them) God here appeared for his and our <hi>King,</hi> as once he did on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> at the Promulgation of the Law, when he would have the incredulous and Rebellious <hi>Iſraelites</hi> know twas his, and obey it alſo, Then (on the Mount) the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Lord was in the eyes of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as <hi>Flaming Fire:</hi> I now ceaſe to wonder any more, that your brother Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells the <hi>Iews</hi> deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> onely to go up and near, for they could not approach the place, nor twice ſee without danger of Life; for thoſe Rebels as bold as they were at firſt, yet when it came to this <hi>Viſion, God made you ſtand afar off,</hi> you were not onely aſhamed, but then afraid, yea ſore afraid alſo, your haſte to be gone ſhews it, for not a man of you durſt look behind him, or ſtay ſo long as I did; it will ſhortly be all or many of your portions, haſtily to run away, or hide your ſelves: be gone, be gone, all you mockers, and deriders of the <hi>Kings reſtore,</hi> for God hath ſet you pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rid me of you.</p>
