            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that no more grant of the Dutchie lands ſhould paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it was tried in Parlament, and alſo offered him great honor
and dignity in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but before it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in Parlament, the Queen died.</p>
            <p>Then hee petitioned King <hi>James</hi> for a hearing in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to aſſign him Counſel, who did (<hi>viz.</hi>) Sergeant
<hi>Harris,</hi> Sergeant <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr <hi>Dyett,</hi> and Mr George <hi>Crook,</hi> and
then contrary to Law committed him cloſe priſoner, without
Ink or Paper, and ſo kept him in priſon untill a little before
his death, that the King intended to call a Parlament; and
being fearful that the horrible piece of tyrannie would bee
queſtioned, hee releaſed him, and promiſed him fair, (as hee
knew well enough how to diſſemble, and called it nothing but
King-craft) but performed nothing during his life. And after
his death, it beeing told, King <hi>James,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
was dead, hee anſwered, <hi>God have mercie on</hi> Charls <hi>and
his Iſſue, for hee had don the Duke of</hi> Lancaſter <hi>mickle wrong,</hi> and
that hee (meaning Mr <hi>Beck</hi>) <hi>had left a heavie curſ behind him;</hi>
which were King <hi>James</hi> his own words; for it was Mr <hi>Beck</hi>'s
cuſtom when hee ſpake with the King, to deſire God <hi>to deal
by the King and his, as the King had dealt with him.</hi> Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
King <hi>James</hi> dyed,</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Nevil Beck</hi> beeing in his travels beyond the ſeas came
back to claim his right to the Dukedom of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> of King
<hi>Charls,</hi> who delayed him, and would not conſent to a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
whereupon <hi>Nevil Beck</hi> deſired 400l. <hi>per An.</hi> for his
maintenance for the preſent; but the King anſwered, that,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40223:6"/>
if hee gave him that, it would enable <hi>Nevil Beck</hi> to make a
caſe of it, and ſo go to Law with him: whereupon ſom high
words of diſcontent paſſed from <hi>Nevil Beck</hi> in relation to his
wrong, that the King in fury cauſed him to bee put out of the
Court Gates, and gave order that the Porters ſhould not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to com in at any time after, which cauſed <hi>Nevil Beck</hi>
to uſe theſe words to the Kings ſervants, <hi>I do believ I ſhall
live to ſee him turned out, and that neither hee nor his ſhall have
any thing to do with this houſ,</hi> meaning <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Nevil Beck</hi> petitioned the Lord's and Commons of
the late long Parlament to hear his caſe, who deferred the
hearing of it, telling him that hee muſt firſt get an allowance
from the King, who was then at <hi>Oxford</hi> in open hoſtlity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parlament; and unleſs that were firſt don they
could not give allowance to his Bill, which how impoſſible
that was to bee don, let the world judg; and after the King's
execution they anſwered him, that they had pulled down the
houſ of <hi>York,</hi> and aboliſhed Kingſhip, and therefore it would
bee dangerous to ſet up the houſ of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> but iſſued out
to him ſom ſmall ſummes at ſeveral times, which kept him
onely from ſtarving, and alſo forbad the ſale of the Dutchie
Lands, and after his death iſſued out 20 l. to the uſe of his

               <head>The reply of Margaret Beck widdow, Mother
and Guardian to the Infant.</head>
               <p>IT is true, that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> had the Dukedom of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>
by his firſt wife, and that hee had H. 4. and two daughters
by the firſt wife as is expreſſed in the paper.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and <hi>Joan de Beufart</hi> came
of the body of <hi>Katharine Swinford</hi> his third wife.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>pag.</hi> 328. the paper faith, it is ſaid that H. 4. united
the Dukedome of <hi>Lancaster</hi> to the Crown, which proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but it will bee prooved that H. 4. was ſo far from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it to the Crown, that hee made a Charter of the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and confirmed it by act of Parl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment to <hi>Thomas de Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
in expectancy after his death, and that after his death
<hi>Thomas</hi> did enter, and did enjoy it all the time of H. 5. and
ſix years in the time of H. 6. and in all that time let Leaſe,
and granted Eſtates.</p>
               <p>And for that it was unlikely that H. 4. would paſs it to a
female, which is no proof; for <hi>Beck's</hi> caſe is not that H. 4.
paſſed it to a female, but that <hi>Thomas</hi> dying without iſſue, <hi>Joan</hi>
was his next heir at the common Law,</p>
               <p>And it doth appear by the grants made by H. 4. to <hi>Thomas
de Beufort,</hi> that hee eſteemed him above all others of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for in the grants it is for maintaining his Title to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40223:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Crown both at home and abroad, and ſo might verie well
truſt him to keep up his Childrens Title to the Crown after
his deceaſ.</p>
               <p>Alſo it appear's by Record that H. 4. created him Earl of
<hi>Dorſet,</hi> and afterwards Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and after that this
grant of the Reverſion of the Dukedome of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> thereby
the more to enable him to maintain his Children's Title to the
Crown.</p>
               <p>It doth not appear that <hi>Ralph Nevil</hi> had any more Children
by <hi>Joan de Beufert</hi> his ſecond wife, then <hi>George Nevil</hi> Lord
Latimer, and <hi>Cicilia,</hi> afterwards married to <hi>Richard Plantagenet</hi>
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from whom the Stewards family deſcended,
but it muſt needs bee, that the Children of <hi>Ralph Nevil</hi> were
of his firſt wife, otherwiſe how could it bee found in the office
after the death of Latimer, and wife of <hi>Beck,</hi> that her Child was
heir to <hi>Jone</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl
of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> All this appeared by the
coppies of the Records allowed by King <hi>James</hi> taken out of
the Tower, Court of wards, and Heralds office, when King
<hi>James</hi> aſſigned the Child's grandfather Counſel.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this the mother and guardian of the
Childe do ſubmit to the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> and his privy Counſel,
to deal with her and her poor Childe as they ſhall pleaſ,
whereupon the Childe was ſent to <hi>Eaton Colledg</hi> to bee bred

E. 4. kept it by wrong all his life, who was wicked in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

               <p>H. 7. entered upon the Dutchie Lands and ſold much of it,

left E. 6. his ſon, who died an Inſtant, and <hi>Mary</hi> his eldeſt

Shee reigned all her time in a bloody perſecution, and died;
all three Children of H. 8. raigning ſucceſſively one after the

               <p>King <hi>James</hi> entered upon the Lands of the Dukedom left
