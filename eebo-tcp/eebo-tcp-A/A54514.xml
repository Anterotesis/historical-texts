            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Should doe you and the Author an unexampled injury, should I detain this Dedication from you, since neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity on the one side, and equity on the other compels me to it: Necessity, in regard no other persons will patronize him; and equity, because you have been co-partners with him in all his misdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; so that you are by most well-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled men term'd, <hi>A Trinity of Traytors</hi>; but our author minding the Publike good, hath thus inrolled his name in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Wits, and desires to wipe off all the obloquy people have cast upon him, by leaving these <hi>Remains</hi> to after-ages, that
<pb facs="tcp:65493:3"/>
those which make him the subject of their discourses, may by remembring his Jeasts forget his Crimes; he hath long enough been covered with the Knaves-Coat, and therefore now puts on the Fools; for that as Mr. <hi>Nedham</hi> saith, Is the only way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and a Ladies Chamber: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controversie, the <hi>Levite</hi> may laugh, or cause laughter, as well as the <hi>Layman. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel in anno ridet Apollo.</hi> The God of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may frollick it sometimes, why then may not he unbend himself with moderate mirth? <hi>Non seria semper:</hi> he that with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> whines away his time, I judge more culpable, then he that with <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> shakes it away with laughter. I have long time known this second <hi>Scoggin,</hi> and have been an often hearer of him, and I finding his Discourses so much of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Mirth,</hi> could not but rake these embers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. There are amongst them several Pulpit-flashes, for indeed they are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of many of his Sermons, by the pen of a ready writer; they are the Cream of his Applicatory part: and since his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies would be too voluminous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb facs="tcp:65493:3"/>
impertinent. I have made this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, that his Memory may survive his ashes, and you likewise to whom it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated have a share in his Immortality. And beleeve me, let the World say what it will, <hi>Archee</hi> was a fool to him, as appears by his fulfilling the Proverb, <hi>Fortune favours Fools</hi>: for he got a good Estate; &amp; so did our Author too, You'l say: but Fortune playes the Strumpet, He got it like a Fool, and must loose it like a Fool: Icannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that Lesson he said the Heathen taught him, and indeed it concerns you all:
<q>
                  <l>â€” Non Lex est justior ulla,</l>
                  <l>Quam veris Artifices arte perire sua.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But you must know, <hi>A Fools Bolt is soon shot,</hi> and it is no matter what they say, that matter not what they say, I am sure no Heathen could exceed him, for a Heathen in teaching him taught a man, but he would preach to Horses, <hi>Even till they broke their Halters</hi>; and tell me which is the hardest task, for a Heathen to make him cry, or he
<pb facs="tcp:65493:4"/>
to make a Dog laugh. I remember he was once in Company with some Ladies, and was extreme bashful; whereupon a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman reproved him in this wise, <hi>Fool, at 'em</hi>; and ever since sprung up that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial word, <hi>Fool a-tum.</hi> This being all, Dear Brethren, I remain,</p>

            <head>JEST I How <hi>Mr. Peters</hi> being belated on a journey, lodged at a Millers house, and what passed between him and the Miller.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Peters</hi> being on a journey inquired of a Miller whom he saw standing on his mill, where he might have a lodging for himself, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie for his Horse; the Miller answered, he knew no place thereabout: whereupon <hi>Peters</hi> travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on his way, till he came to a little house, which as you shall hear anon, appear'd to be the Millers; there he knocks, the good Woman coming to the door, Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> desires her if she can to lodge him there; she tells him, she had but one bed in the house, and therein lay her husband and her self, but if he would be content with clean straw in the Barn, he might have that, and his Horse might stay there too; for she knew no other way to help him. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> accepted the proffer, and betakes himself to the Barn, where he had not long layn, but through a small cranny, he spies a man with a bottle of wine and a Capon, which was no sooner brought, but immediately a good fire was made, and down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it went; anon knocks the Miller, all the while the Dame was sore affrighted, and presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65493:7"/>
away the Capon on the spit, puts out the fire, hides her friend in a kneading trough hard by, and having thus with abundance of celerity made a clear coast, she opens the door for her husband. The good man being weary, is presently desirous to be at rest, and she as willing he should; but Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> seeing him betake himself to his bed, bethought how he might be Master of that Capon; which he effected in manner following. Leaving his Barn, he comes to the door of the House, knocks, and straight there appears the Miller: Honest friend, Quoth Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> I enquired of you for a lodging, but you knew of none, therefore I am content with this Barne; but being exceeding hungry I desire you by any means to refresh me with what you have, I shall content you to your own desire: Indeed, quoth the Miller, I have nothing but what I know you can scarce eat, being a peece of brown bread, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk-cheese; so opens the door, and lets him in: Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> being in, said, Now my friend, what if I should try a conclusion for some Victuals, thou'ldst not be angry, woulst thou? I angry? no in truth, Sir, not I, quoth the Miller. With that, quoth <hi>Hugh,</hi> When I was a youth I could conjure, and I thinke I have not forgot: so uttering some barbarous words, and making strange figures wich his fingers, saith he, Look in such a place, and see what there is. Oh Sir, quoth the Miller, I pray Sir, do'nt Conjure, I would not by any means you should, nor dare I doe as you command me; prethee, saith Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> doe so as I say, and fear not, we shall have good chear anon; by these perswasions the Miller was wrought upon, he looks, and finds a goodly Capon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65493:7"/>
piping hot, which he brings forth: to this they both fall to, and were very well satisfied; but Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> complaining of the smallness of the Millers drink, would needs conjure again: so doing as before, he bid the Miller look in such a place, the Miller look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and there finds a bottle of wine, this they drank, the Miller all this while admiring, and verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved his guest had been a conjurer: having now eat and drank sufficiently; Now, saith Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> but what if I should shew you the devil that brought these good things? Oh, quoth the Miller, for Gods sake, Sir, forbear, I never saw the Devil yet, and I would not see him now: Nay, saith Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> doe you doe as I shall instruct you, and you need not fear; stand in the next room, and when I stamp, then come forth: with much perswasions, he went in; being gone, Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> steps to the trough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the kind Devil had hid himself, and uncovering it, saith he, Goe your ways and be glad you scape so: out goes the man, and Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> then stamps with his foot, whereupon presently appears the Miller, Look, saith Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> see you where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil goes? Good God, replyed the Miller, if you had not said it was the devil, I durst have sworn it had been the Parson of our Parish. As indeed it was.</p>

            <head>JEST 2. How a notable Parson put a merry jest upon <hi>Mr. Peters</hi> and <hi>Mr. T.</hi> when he was examined by them.</head>
            <p>A Country Parson being examined in order to his settlement in a Benefice, in which Committee sat Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> the latter being chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65493:8"/>
he began to check the Parson for his former mormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, telling him how he had mispent his time in ryoting, and drunkenness, not regarding the good of Souls; to which the Parson humbly reply'd, It was true he had been too negligent of his duty, but had repented, &amp; was become a new man, and no man but had his failings, as we may read in the Example of the wisest men, <hi>Solomon, David,</hi> &amp;c. they were polluted with the flesh, and as the Apostle saith, <hi>Such were some of you.</hi> Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> thinking this to be an affront cast upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Quoth he, Here's a fellow abuses us to our teeth, and would by no means be perswaded to abide there any longer, but in anger went to an adjoyning room. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> being there, went to him, and advised him not 'to take exceptions at what was said, for saith he, The man said nothing but what was Truth and Scripture, and you need not apply it to your self, more then another man; at last Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> came again into the room, but willed Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to examine the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for he would not: whereupon Mr. <hi>T.</hi> askt him, How he came to be converted. The Parson answered, He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, it was by reading; for of late he had given himself much to reading, hearing, and praying. Why, saith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> What Authors have you read? The Parson replyed, He had read divers, as <hi>Nazianzen, Isidore,</hi> and many others. Which, saith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> wrought upon you, in reference to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version? In truth, Sir, said the Parson, that is very difficult to determine. But which doe you think? saith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Why indeed, saith the Parson, I have read many, but I suppose the chiefest Peece that wrought upon my heart, was Mr. <hi>B.</hi> against <hi>T.</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hearing him say so, was in as great a rage as his Predecessor: and taking Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> aside, told him, He was now of his opinion. Nay, saith Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> The man speaks truth, I beleeve, nor have you any reason to be angry with him; for in reading <hi>B.</hi> against <hi>T.</hi> he reads <hi>T.</hi> himself, and you know not, but it might be your part of the Book that converted him. But the Parson ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving set them together by the ears, went out, and never came before them any more.</p>

            <p>An unhappy boy that kept his Fathers sheep in the country, did use to carry a pair of Cards in his pocket, and with the same (meeting with companions) played at one and thirtie, (a Game so called) at which sport he would some dayes loose a sheep or two, for which his Father corrected him; in revenge whereof, the boy would drive the sheep home at night over a narrow bridge, where some of them falling into the water, were drowned. The old man wearied with his sons ungracious trick, had him before Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> (he being a man busie, and having some Authoritie in those parts where he lived) Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> begins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the boy in these words; Sirrah, you are a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Villain, you play at Cards, and lose your Fathers sheep at one and thirtie. The boy (using small reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and lesse manners,) Replyed it was a lie; A lie quoth Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> you sawcie Knave, do you give me the lie? No quoth the boy, but you told a lie; for I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65493:10"/>
never lost sheep at one and thirtie, for when my game was one and thirtie I alwayes won; indeed said Mr. Peters thou saiest true; But I have another accusation against thee, which is, that you drive your Fathers sheep over a narrow bridge, where some of them are often times drowned. Thats a lie too quoth the boy, for those that goe over the bridge are well enuogh, it is onely such as fall besides that are drowned, which Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> acknowledged for a truth, and be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ing well pleased with these clownish answers, gave him a short advice, and then dismissed him.</p>

For hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Parson was of so hot a constitution, that he would oftentimes preach in the Pulpit with his breeches down, he caused a Turf of an Ants hill to be laid on the Pulpit bench, The Parson seeing the Turf, was well pleased, supposing it was laid there onely as strowings to adorn his seat. So his breeches being down, he sits a while, and when the Psalme was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he rises to his Prayer, all which time the Ants were very civil, till he had proceeded a good way, but then a War began, insomuch that by their biting and his scratching, some drops of blood was spilt upon the place, which caused him to break forth into these words, The Word of God â€” and making a full stop, quoth he, good people, the word of God is in my mouth, but I think the Devil is in my tail.</p>

Of <hi>Binding the Kings in Chaines, and the Nobles with fetters of Iron</hi>; applying his Text and Sermon to the late King, and saying he had seen one joyfull day, and he hoped to see another to morrow as good as the former; There being at that time in the Church
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65493:19"/>
two Gentlemen, who as many more usually did went rather to hear his Jests then his Doctrine; they hearing how bitterly he inveighed against his late Majesty, and how he applauded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Army, being provided with Pen Ink and Paper on purpose to beare away some of his Pulpit Jests, immediately betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to send him a line or two, which acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally falling into my hands, I have here inserted.
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> We return you thanks for this your pains,</l>
                  <l>And hope you'l live your self to wear the Chains;</l>
                  <l>For if our Genius don't at this time falter,</l>
                  <l>Your merits well may claim both chain &amp; halter.</l>
               </q>
This being wrapped close up, and he drawing to the conclusion of his Sermon, they deliver it to be handed to him, as though it were the Petition of some dying soul; but he having read it, put it up, and as occasion served, made it now and then passe for a malignant Jest, notwithstanding at last it proved an earnest truth.</p>
            <p>For now at last I shall conclude with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors death; He was Indicted <hi>October</hi> 9. 1660. at <hi>Hicks-hall,</hi> and the Bill found by the Grand Jury of Knights and Gentlemen of Quality of the County of <hi>Middlesex</hi>; such a Bench and such a Jury hath rarely been seene in that Court, where that most learned Lord Chiefe Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgeman</hi> gave him his charge, and being asked <hi>guilty or not guilty,</hi> lift up his hands and his eyes (according to his custome,) and sayd, <hi>Guilty! no, not for ten thousand worlds.</hi> However after his Indictment was read and the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65493:20"/>
Jury sworne, he saw a whole congregation of witnesses against him; many things were by them asserted, relating to his guilt of being accessary to the spilling of his late Majesties Royall Blood, and his moving and stirring up seditious rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in his Majesties Dominions. To whch Mr <hi>Peters</hi> making no answer, the Jury gave their Verdict that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> was guilty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the sentence of the Court was, that he should be drawne upon a Sledge to the place of execution, and there be hanged by the neck till he be halfe dead, his Bowels burnt, and his quarters to be disposed of according to order; which on Tuesday the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done at the place where formerly <hi>Charing Crosse</hi> stood.</p>
            <p>Thus did he that called his sacred Majesty a <hi>Barrabas,</hi> a murderer, and seditious, die for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and sedition himselfe, so that the snare which he layd for another, hath catched hold of himselfe; in this may we see, that according to that of St <hi>Augustine, Justice hath leaden feete, but Iron hands; And though vengeance treads slowly, it comes surely,</hi> as hath appeared by this man, (sometime my acquaintance) who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and indeed nothing; sometime foole, and sometime knave; but what most commonly might induce to his benefit and advantage.</p>
