            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SHORT
ACCOUNT
OF THE
PROGRESS
OF THE
MOLE
AT
TANGIER,
From the firſt beginning of that WORK.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Majeſty having declared the Earl of <hi>Tiviot</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and conſtituted certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
for the care of that place, about the year
1662. the buſineſs of building a Mole there was
diſcuſſed in the preſence of Engineers ſent from
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and others that could be found verſed in
ſuch ſort of work, and becauſe <hi>Tangier</hi> was at that time only an
open Bay, and that Cheſts could not be framed but in a ſecure Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
it was found of abſolute neceſſity to begin the Work with
great looſe Rocks, after the manner that all other Moles are built,
excepting the New Mole at <hi>Genoa.</hi> Many of the <hi>Tangier</hi> Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
ſuch a Work could never be carried well on, but by way of
Contract, they gave encouragement to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Tiviot,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Lauſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chomeley,</hi> to enter into Articles for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame by the Cubical Yard. Thirteen Shillings for every
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103528:2"/>
ſuch Yard was the price asked, and as readily conſented to, in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
a work there was no other meaſures to go by than ſuch as the
Contractors themſelves laid down, who wanted not private aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to ſecure them from the danger of ſuch Accidents as might
render the bargain over-hard on their ſide, nor were they indeed
otherways miſtaken in their meaſures, than from ſuch contingent
cauſes as could not be foreſeen at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſoftneſs of the Stone,
which upon opening the Quarries wrought to half loſs, the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the Weather, and the very bad and dilatory payments by
Tallies.</p>
            <p>This Contract for building the Mole was ſigned in <hi>February</hi> 1662.
and the firſt Payment began the tenth of <hi>April</hi> following.</p>
            <p>It was no eaſie matter at this time to get Workmen to go to <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi>
becauſe of the ill reputation the place had, from the Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Countrymen, and the great ſufferings they at firſt met
with. Mr. <hi>Cholmeley</hi> by the Intereſt he had in the <hi>North,</hi> and by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf, prevailed with about forty Maſons, Miners, and other
proper Artiſts and Workmen to undertake the ſervice, with whom
he Arrived at <hi>Tangier</hi> about the beginning of <hi>June</hi> 1663. The place
being deſtitute of all conveniencies; much of that Summer was
ſpent in providing quarters for Men and Stores, and in putting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Engins prepared for the weighing Stones, ſo that it was the
end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> when the firſt Foundation of the Mole was laid, ſoon
after which the Earl of <hi>Tiviot</hi> went for <hi>England,</hi> and at his return,
about the end of <hi>December,</hi> found the Mole advanced beyond his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
but Mr. <hi>Cholmeley</hi> being obliged to go for <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
becauſe of the death of his Elder Brother, who left a Son in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
had not been long there, when news came of the loſs of the
Earl of <hi>Tiviot,</hi> chief of the Contractors, which occaſioned Mr. <hi>Cholme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
to return for <hi>Tangier</hi> ſo ſoon as he could ſettle affairs, provide
himſelf of Officers and Stores neceſſary, which delayed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
there until January 1664. And then he found little work had
been done in his abſence, chiefly becauſe the Workmen at the Mole,
by reaſon of the loſs the Garriſon had with the Earl of <hi>Tiviot,</hi> were
forced to the Duty of Soldiers, and becauſe the Water Engins were
found to be of little uſe, by reaſon of the frequent Levant Winds;
this made Mr. <hi>Cholmeley</hi> ſoon alter the Method from Water to Land-Carriages
drawn by Horſes, and to build at the Quarries a little
Town called <hi>Whitby,</hi> which contained Stables for a hundred Horſes,
large Magazines for all ſorts of Stores, and Quarters for the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103528:2"/>
and their Wives. He alſo adviſed Sir <hi>John Lauſon</hi> of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Impediments which made it impoſſible to carry on the Work at
the rate of the Contract, which procured an Order of Council of
the 31 of <hi>March</hi> 1665. by which His Majeſty was pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the intentions of the Contract, ſo as to leave the Contractors
free from danger of loſs, and to reduce the Work to an Account, if
the ſame were inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tangier</hi> was at this time under the Government of the Lord <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſis,</hi>
and the Mole advanced ſo well, that there was a Battery built
upon it which did ſecure the Trade of the place from the attempts
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but Sir <hi>John Lauſon</hi> alſo dying in that War, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the Mole was left to Mr. <hi>Cholmeley</hi> the only ſurviving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor,
whoſe Nephew dying about the ſame time, left unto him
the buſineſs and the Eſtate of his Family, and this occaſioned him
to paſs into <hi>England</hi> the end of this Year, having put the affairs of the
Mole into an excellent Method, and left the care under knowing
and intelligent Officers.</p>
            <p>The Plague and the War did occaſion that want of money, it
was impoſſible to get any other payment than Tallies anticipated
from 24 to 30 Months, ſo that Money could not be had but by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
ſecurity, which forced Stores to be bought at the worſt hand,
and the buſineſs to be carried on in the way of Trade, and much
time to be ſpent barely in keeping Account of the Money and the
Intereſt, and in the continual Negotiating the ſame by Tallies,
which received no amendment, notwithſtanding Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmeley</hi>
his daily complaints.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> being called from <hi>Madrid</hi> in the Year 1668.
had Inſtructions to call at <hi>Tangier,</hi> and take a Survey of the Mole,
which he did in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> by the help of one Mr. <hi>Shere,</hi>
and at his return to Court towards the end of that Year reported the
ſame to be 380 Yards in length, carried on by the Conduct of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Officers, and under ſuch a good Oeconomy as could not well be
mended: But the Work of the Mole being now carried into ſo deep
Water that there was a poſſibility of building with Cheſts, and ſome
neceſſity appearing to proceed in the future Work in a more ſolid
way than the Contract ſeemed to oblige, the carrying on of the
Work was reduced into an Office by Order of the King in Council,
dated the 27 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1669. under the care of Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmeley</hi> as
Surveyor General, who framed the method for governing the Work,
and iſſuing the Money under ſuch Checqs, and ſo well to the liking
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103528:3"/>
of the <hi>Tangier</hi> Lords, and the Lords of the Treaſury, that upon
the greateſt diſquiſition it hath not ſince met with one ſingle amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Some time before this ſettlement there was noiſe of breaches at
<hi>Tangier,</hi> which occaſioned diſcourſes of the neceſſity of building with
Cheſts, and obliged Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmeley</hi> to frame two Cheſts for a tryal
under the Survey of Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> a Gentleman, Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had lately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
who was experienced in ſuch Works, and under whoſe
care they were ſent to <hi>Tangier,</hi> from whence Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> embarks for
<hi>Genoa,</hi> to take exact obſervations of their proceedings, at his return
to <hi>Tangier</hi> gives his advice for building an inner Mole with Cheſts,
and for Protection of this an outward Work in dimenſions much
greater than that which was Contracted for, and in the ſame way
adviſed Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> at his arrival at <hi>Tangier, April</hi> following, to proceed
upon the repair of the Work. The Work with Cheſts ſeemed to
Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> ſuperfluous, becauſe it required an outward one for prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it, and this was propoſed to be made of Stones from 25 to
30 Tun each, which by reaſon of the continual agitations of the
Seas was at <hi>Tangier</hi> wholly unpracticable: He therefore immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
applied himſelf to the repair of the Work by Artificial Pillars
of about 100 Tun in bigneſs, which ſuddenly ſecured about 50
Yards of the ſide that was moſt expoſed, and the end of the Work
he ſecured by one of the great Cheſts he had ſent from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Month of <hi>July,</hi> this Year, Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> received a Letter
from the Lords Commiſſioners for the Affairs of <hi>Tangier,</hi> taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the ill reports they heard of the Mole, and commanding the
matter to be diſcuſſed in the preſence of the Chief on the place, and
be proceeded in the way ſhould be generally approved. The chief
Officers of the Garriſon, the beſt of the Citizens and Commanders
of Ships being ſummoned, the whole matter was diſcuſſed in the
preſence of his Excellency my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi> and the Mayor of the place, Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
preſent, who all unanimously concluded the preſent practice with
Pillars was the moſt probable expedient for the repair, and that if
the ſame reſiſted the Storms of the approaching Winter, the work
ought to be carried on in the ſame way for the future, and to this
purpoſe ſigned a Letter to the Lords Commiſſioners under all their
hands. The Work continued to reſiſt the Sea, not only the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but many Winters, ſo that the preſent practice gave ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
almoſt to every man, excepting Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> himſelf, who did then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103528:3"/>
declare that the Work was ſuch as he was able to carry on under
the exceeding bad payments with which it laboured, but ſuch as
could not be of laſting continuance. And having for above two
years managed the Work almoſt wholly without money upon his
own credit, was forced to return to <hi>England</hi> the beginning of the
Year 1672. where the Wars made Arrears impoſſible to get, beſide
that the trouble in ſoliciting for money, and Accounting for the
ſame, cauſed ſuch an Attendance as was incompatible with the
Service at <hi>Tangier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Winter ending, the Year 1674. brought news of ſome
breaches at <hi>Tangier,</hi> which Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> being much troubled to hear,
and aſſured within himſelf he knew to cure the Evil, ſo as would
take off all future complaints, if the want of money, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
of an Exchequer Account could give him leave to go to <hi>Tangier,</hi>
offered unto the Lords in the Year 1674. certain propoſals whereby
he undertook both to repair the preſent Work, and to carry it 100
Yards farther into the Sea, by which means there would be a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for Ships to ride ſafely in four Fathom at low Water, and all
this to be done in ſix Years, for the Annual Eſtabliſhment, and
though he could not give ſecurity for the whole Sum, he offered to
give, from Year to Year, ſecurity for the Money he ſhould receive,
and to be puniſhed or rewarded according to his yearly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> taking advantage of theſe propoſals, framed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by which he undertook the Work at 10000 <hi>l.</hi> leſs in the whole,
and with great upright Cheſts, maintaining that Figure beſt againſt
the reflux Sea; whereas by Sir <hi>Hugh</hi>'s offers the ſame was to be
done in ſolid Work, and with Cheſts too, yet ſo placed that the
force of the Sea ſhould be wholly diſſipated by a ſlope and gradual
interception of the Waters, after the imitation of Nature, that from
this poſition doth in many places guard the Coaſt meerly by a bank
of Sand. At the ſame time the Lord Privy Seal gave in other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
from certain Artiſts who offered to do the Work at a much
cheaper rate than that propoſed by Mr. <hi>Shere,</hi> and to give 60000 <hi>l.</hi>
ſecurity for their performance, but Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> had the preference, and
without ſecurity is truſted with the iſſuing and paying of the Money
with a reward of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> if he performs and nothing if he fails in
the ſame.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> was happy in the greateſt exigency of the Work, and
upon the moſt ſevere Enquiries to hit upon ſuch expedients for the
repair and advance as gave ſatisfaction to Mr. <hi>Shere,</hi> and all upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103528:4"/>
place without one diſſenting man, and this after Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> had been
at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and conſidered the way of their practice, it had been no
unuſual thing for one that had been ſo many years trained in the
Work under Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> to profit himſelf upon ſuch defects as he might
have obſerved. Let us then take a view of the preſent ſtate of the
Work, by which we ſhall ſee how far Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> hath exceeded or
come come ſhort of Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> his propoſals, or how near he hath
hitherto complied with his own undertakings.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> having carried the Mole 500 Yards into the Sea, within
which there was about 18 foot depth at low Water, was very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to leave the ſame compleat and finiſhed, that ſo it might have
had compariſon with any future Work. He offered for one Years
eſtabliſhment to compleat the Repair, and to finiſh the ſame, as well
on the inſide as outward, and to carry it farther 15 Yards into the
Sea, and to give ſecurity to do all this in ſo ſubſtantial a way, as
upon view and Tryal ſhould be judged and found durable; and in
caſe of failure, to pay back the whole Money, or as much as ſhould
be judged the deficiency might amount unto. But it was concluded
that this Repair ſhould alſo be undertaken by Mr. <hi>Shere,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now received 60000 <hi>l.</hi> and ſpent three years laſt Midſummer
about the ſame, we hear hath reparired the old Work, but there was
not at Midſummer one foot advanced into the Sea, nor will the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of another Year, at his rate of Work, ſcarce finiſh that which
Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> offered to give ſecurity to do for one Years allowance; yet
Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> computes he hath every Year performed his complement
of Work, which was 30 Yards yearly in length, until the whole
were finiſhed, and poſſibly he may have done ſo according to the
Numerical quantity of Cubical Yards contained in the Cheſts
placed; but certainly there is much more Work to ſecure the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of his Cheſts, and that according to his own Propoſals, than
barely the placing and filling the ſame: And what Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> hath
done in the Years paſt will be beſt underſtood by the Progreſs of
his future Work, if in other three Years be can compleatly finiſh
ninety Yards in length, which is his undertaking, then may it be
concluded, the paſt Work, though it comes much ſhort of what
Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> offered ſecurity to perform, is yet in proportion to his own
Agreements. And now that the Work done by Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
finiſhed and made durable by Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> himſelf. Sir <hi>Hugh</hi>
will allow he was miſtaken in his meaſures, if the future Work be
done in proportion any thing cheaper; but if it ſhall happen to coſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103528:4"/>
the King much more than the paſt Work now repaired hath done,
Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> humbly conceives the way of building is nothing impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and that it had been better to have continued the Work in the
old way, and afterwards to have ſecured it as Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> hath done
the paſt Work, than to proſecute it in a way much more coſtly, and
by confeſſion of himſelf no leſs durable; Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> was for building
with Cheſts as well as Mr. <hi>Shere,</hi> he differed only in the way of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
theſe Cheſts, which Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> propoſed by ſeveral Rows, one
ſet within the other, gradually breaking and intercepting the Sea,
Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> maintained, and undertakes to do the Work by one ſolid
Body, and an upright ſide, which from its own ſtrength ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Work without any other outward Work or Defence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
to this Sir <hi>Hugh</hi>'s Objections were, the difficulty of placing
theſe Cheſts cloſe one to the other, as at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and the danger of
the Works falling when the Worm had conſumed the Wood of the
Cheſt: By what hath been practiſed it is plain the Cheſts cannot be
cloſe joyned ſcarce nearer than four foot one to the other, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
the ſupplying the vacancy with a ſmall Cheſt, which hath
little ſubſtance, and therefore muſt occaſion many fears, and for
the great Cheſts, they are made of ſuch ſtrong Plank, and ſo bound
with Timber, that it is not poſſible for the Worm ſuddenly to deſtroy
them, and it is plainly demonſtrable, that if the Cheſts were filled
with Sand, they cannot poſſibly give way whilſt the Wood Work
continues unperiſhed, and therefore no tryal of the Work can be
ſuddenly expected; but if Mr. <hi>Shere</hi> be obliged to ſecure his great
Cheſts by other lower Cheſts ſet outwards towards the Sea, then
whatever he may pretend, his proceeding is directly according to
Sir <hi>Hugh</hi>'s Propoſal, only in the way of a far greater and needleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
by all the coſt of the great Cheſt, which is plainly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the ſolidity of the old Work, built without Cheſts, and
made durable by means of ſuch an outward Work as in the foreſaid
caſe is preſumed neceſſary to ſecure the preſent Work with great
Cheſts.</p>
            <p>It is not the Intention of this Paper to diminiſh ought from Mr.
<hi>Shere,</hi> whoſe diligence Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> heartily wiſhes may have all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
in ſo publick a Work; but not being conſcious by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
ſince he left the Work, or by the future advance, that it will
appear he hath any ways miſ-employed the Kings Money, he thought
it not unreaſonable, in order to his own Juſtification, to ſet down
this ſhort Narrative of the whole Affair. Written in the Year 1669.</p>
