         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

who giveth unto man breath and takes it away in a moment;
all Nations are as the drop of a bucket before his eternal eye,
he dwells in the high and holy place, and his habitation is
high above the world; he inhabits eternity forevermore, and
yet abideth, and walketh, and dwelleth with the children of
men, that fear his Name and tremble at his Word; he hath
been as a ſtranger, as one not known, for men have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
from him by tranſgreſſion, and have been ignorant
of his wayes; he hath been as one hidden for many ages,
and hath been worſhipped ignorantly, and hath winked in
the time of ignorance, but now he calleth all to repentance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

ſhall dwell in ſafety, and ſhall be a free people, to worſhip

            <p>The heads of the people, they have conſpired together
againſt the Lord, and againſt his truth; and have decreed
unrighteous decrees, that they might prevent the purpoſe of
the moſt High. Many of the Rulers and Judges, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the beaſtly power, rather than of Jeſus Chriſt, hath
unjuſtly judged and falſly impriſoned and trodden under
foot the meek and upright, who fear the Lord and walk in

of the worſhip and power of the Beaſt, which all the
world had wondered after, hath the Beaſt raiſed his force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.
How many hundreds in this Nation have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
falſly, and ſuffered grievous abuſes unjuſtly for
righteouſneſſe ſake, and not for evil doing, as a teſtimony
againſt this generation of Judges and people, and for a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
that they are of God, who have in patience born
the ſufferings, and the cruelties of the wicked, many have
ſuffered the loſſe of liberty and riches, and ſome the loſſe of
life, for the exerciſe of a pure conſcience towards God, and
for the Kingdom of Jeſus, many have ſuffered under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of wicked men, for declaring againſt ſin and iniquity,
in Townes, Steeple-houſes, or high wayes, and for crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
pride, and vanity, and idolatry, and coveteouſneſſe,
and the wickedneſſe of Rulers, Prieſts, and People, whoſe
deceits and tranſgreſſions hath abounded in this generation,
and others have deeply ſuffered grievous cruelties, becauſe
they could not ſwear &amp; reſpect perſons with hat or knee and
ſo were witneſſes for the Lord and his Kingdome, which
ſtands in righteouſneſſe, and againſt the power and kingdom
of the Beaſt; which ſtands in iniquity, in fainedneſſe and

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118908:5"/>
they cannot pay Tithes, that abominable and crying
oppreſſion, by which the Beaſt chiefly maintains his falſe
Prophets, and becauſe the unchangable Prieſthood is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the changable denied, and Chriſt the light of the
World followed, therefore is this ſuffering laid upon the
juſt, and many are ſufferers under hard tasks, becauſe they
cannot maintain the Idol temples, and Idol worſhips, and
Idol Prieſts, which the power of Antichriſt upholds againſt
the power of the Son of God, and againſt the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of life, where God in ſpirit and in truth is worſhipped
without reſpect of places, dayes, or men, or things; and the
true worſhippers, they worſhip God in the ſpirit and in the
truth, and cannot be ſubject to dayes, places, or things, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and ordained by the power of men and falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
and how many unjuſt fines and falſe inditements have
been moſt illegally charged upon the innocent, in many
Courts and Judicatories through this Nation, and all in the
defence of the kingdom of the man of ſin; leſt his authority
ſhould be abated, and the authority of Chriſt Jeſus exalted;
many cruelties have been done, and injuſtice acted both by
Rulers and People, againſt ſuch which no evil could juſtly be
charged againſt, nor yet the tranſgreſſion of any juſt law,
by any one of them; O! horrid grievances and cruel oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
hath been brought forth in this Nation, by ſuch who
ſhould have eaſed the oppreſſed, and ſet at liberty the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
ſuch who ſhould have judged juſtly the cauſe of the
poor, and heard the call of the oppreſſed, have turned judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
backward from the poor, and equity have found no
place to enter, but truth hath fallen in the ſtreets, and juſtice
and mercy have periſhed from among men, and the poor
hath been oppreſſed, and they that have departed from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
have been made a prey to the mouthes of devouring
Lions, for ſome of the Judges have been as ravening Wolves,
and as greedy devouring Foxes, the Lambs of Chriſt have
been chaſed by the wicked, and his power for their life; O
how have the oppreſſed groaned in this Nation, under falſe
judgment? to ages and generations for ever, may it be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

for a witneſſe againſt this generation of cruel hearted
men, whom the beaſt and falſe prophet hath raiſed in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus and them
that follow him, how full have the moſt part of the priſons
in all this land been with guiltleſſe ſufferers under cruel bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
with unjuſt dealings and falſe judgments, have gone
forth from ſome of your mouthes, you that have been ſet to
judge over the people, who ſhould have been a terror to the
wicked, but have rather ſtrengthened the hands of evil doers,
and been a terror to righteouſneſſe, ſo much as is poſſible,
the great whore which ſits upon the beaſt, hath made your
Rulers drunk and ſtagger with envy and hatred and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and works of wickedneſſe againſt the upright; Wo is
me for you, what have you brought forth? even iniquity by
Decrees, and injuſtice by Ordinances, and falſe judgment by
Lawes; alas, alas, your deſtruction cometh as an armed
man upon you. Was ever the like heard, or any preſident
in any generation before you, for impriſoning juſt men, for
declaring againſt ſin and the abominations of the times, as
you have done many, and for impriſoning men becauſe they
cannot put off their hat to you and reſpect your perſons,
and ſo tranſgreſſe the law of God, and becauſe they cannot
ſwear, and ſo break Chriſts command? For this you have
impriſoned many, and cauſed them to ſuffer becauſe of this,
may not you fear and tremble before the Lord God, and
your faces gather blackneſſe at this, when you conſider it?
Did ever any that were ſet to judge in the earth among men
ſo abuſe their power, and ſubvert it ſo, quite to another end
than wherefore it was committed to them? May not ſhame
cover you all, to commit men to priſon for the exerciſe of
pure conſcience towards God, becauſe they cannot ſwear,
or reſpect mens perſons, or maintain Idol-ſhepherds, and
Idol-temples and worſhips, which is abomination to the
Lord; and for taking peaceable men out of peaceable meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and out of their travel on the High-wayes, and firſt
whipping them, and ſending them to priſon, the example of
this which you have done, never went before in any age and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118908:6"/>
therefore have you exceeded in oppreſſion, in injuſtice, in
cruelty and falſe judgment; all your fore-fathers the Pope
nor Biſhops, hardly ever brought forth ſuch things; but the
Lord will reckon with you, and plead the cauſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
againſt all you oppreſſors; yea, and will give unto
you a recompence of reward according to your works; ye
that have exalted your ſelves againſt the innocent, ſhall be
brought down to the duſt of miſery, and the Saints ſhall
reign and rejoyce over you, when the Kingdom of Chriſt
Jeſus the Lamb ſhall be ſet up over you all, and your beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power daſhed to pieces as a Potters veſſel, when he whom
you have perſecuted and his followers ſhall rule with a rod
of iron, and break you aſunder; and this ſhall ſhurely come
to paſſe, therefore conſider it, ye that thus deal in your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
againſt the Lord and his choſen, for the Lamb ſhall get
the victory over the Beaſt, and over you all that ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him, and that ſtrive under his power; for they that are
with the Lamb are Called, and Faithful, and Choſen: O!
therefore be awakened, be awakened, ye heads, and Judges,
and Rulers of the people, remember and repent, the Lords
hand is ſtretched forth againſt all oppreſſion and oppreſſors,
and his wrath is kindled againſt the wicked ones, and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to overthrow his dominon which long hath reigned in
the Nations, and now though he ſeeks to defend himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lamb and his followers by injuſt dealing, yet the
out-ſtretched arme of the Lord ſhall bring deliverance to his
choſen, who hath been made havock upon, in their liberties
and in their eſtates; ſome cruelly ſuffering in priſon, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by ſpoiling of their goods, and none of theſe for evil
doing, but upon falſe ſuſpitions, and envious jelouſies, and
ſecret ſurmiſings, without any ground of occaſion given;
but by wickedneſſe have many of you ſought occaſion to
make offenders, by laying ſnares for the feet of the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and innocent; you have made men offenders for a
word, and perverted innocent words and actions, that you
might make to your ſelf a ground to perſecute, and have
ſought a cloake to cover your cruelty in the ſight of men,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118908:6"/>
but naked and bare are your hearts made manifeſt in the
ſight of the lord, who hath looked down from heaven, and
conſidered theſe things, and hath regarded the unjuſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of his people whoſe liberties, and eſtates, and good
names have been ſpoiled through injuſtice, by grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
laid upon ſome, becauſe they could not pay Tythes
(that hainous oppreſſion) to ſatisfie the unmercifullneſſe of
cruel men, and many ſuffers at this day, unjuſtly in the ſight
of God, and illegally alſo in the ſight of men; and ſome
ſuffer the ſpoiling of their goods, rather by way of robery
and theft, than by juſt execution of judgment in proceeding
of juſt law; this can largely be witneſſed, and this is brought
forth by ſubſervant Officers to you that are ſet to judge, and
you to them are evil examples, and ſtrengtheners of their
malitious hands, ſome of them are not aſhamed to take ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the value of what is unjuſtly claimed for the uſe of a
falſe teacher and deceitful hireling who rides upon the beaſt,
and make you their ſervants to oppreſſe the poor, to uphold
them and maintain them in their pride and vanities, but the
Lord hath conſidered theſe things, and he hath numbred the
oppreſſions againſt you, wherewith the juſt have been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and oppreſſed under you, he hath counted this cruelty
and recorded all your unjuſt dealing, which you have (or
ſuffered to be) brought forth, yea the day of account haſters
and the tearm draws near upon you, wherein the juſt and
righteous Judge of heaven and earth will call you to account
who will plead the cauſe of the poor, and of the unjuſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer,
and oppreſſed, againſt you all, who are oppreſſors the
innocent proſecute againſt you, and the begging of the poor
is heard, which calls for vengeance upon you. In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of juſtice, what account will you give to the Higheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power,
who rules over heaven and earth, for impriſoning
juſt men for crying againſt ſin, and declaring againſt the
wickedneſſe of this age; this ſhall be proved againſt you in
the day of the Lord; Is your anſwer ready, or will not
your mouthes be ſtopped and you ſpeechleſſe, when righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
it ſelf pleads againſt you? And what can you plead
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118908:7"/>
for fining men, and impriſoning them, for not reſpecting
your perſons, and bowing with hat and knee, and becauſe
they could not ſwear; this hath ſome of you done; will
you have any thing to ſay in the cauſe of theſe things, when
Chriſt Jeſus comes to reign and his Saints with him, unto
whom the government and the authority, and rule ſhall be
given: though now they are perſecuted, and as the refuſe
of men accounted by you, unto whom they are become
a prey, to act your oppreſſion and cruelty upon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they render not evil for evil, therefore is the impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of ſome men the more encreaſed, and their hardneſſe of
heart enlarged; and becauſe judgment is not ſpeedily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
therefore are the hearts of ſome men ſet in them to
do evil. O! what a ſad reckoning in that day, and what
large indictments and verdicts for your oppreſſion, will be
read againſt you, and proved to be juſt in the ſight of God
and men; a ſad thing will it be upon you, when laid to

generation brought forth in this day, wherein the dragon

the Lord hath conſidered and harkened from his holy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

Wo unto all you ſcorners, liers, back biters, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

ſins cry for vengeance againſt you, and though your hands
and tongues have been ſtrengthened to ſpeak and act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe,
by the evil example of your rulers, yet your own
iniquity ſhall you bear in the day of the Lord, and though
your rulers and judges have been ſtrengthened in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtneſſe
and mercileſſeneſſe, by the falſe lying teachers and
diviners of falſe viſions, which have ſeen vanity, yet their
own iniquity ſhall they bear, &amp; every man ſhall die for his

by flattering and lying words; they have daubed
with untempered morter, and healed up the wound deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,

            <p>And now whereas the Rulers and people have ſtretched
forth their hands to vex the Lords people, and have through
unjuſt judgment, and grievous oppreſſions, and unmercifull

a prey to their mouth, and divers waies have perſecuted in
cruel manner the followers of the Lamb; yet alſo have the
wiſe men of this world, even the Prieſts and Teachers, who
have led the people, and have cauſed them to erre, and have
ſet themſelves as in battle array againſt the Lord and his way
and people; How have you hardened your hearts and made
your forehead as braſſe, againſt the Word of the Lord, and
you have been as the fountain of all this wickedneſſe acted
againſt the juſt, and ſtrengtheners of the hands of ungodly
men; the Heads and Ruler, you have ſtrengthened in their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118908:9"/>
cruelty, of falſe judgments by your arguments of ſtrife;
in ſubtiltly you have been as nurſers of all this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and wickedneſſe, and have interceded for
oppreſſion, to cauſe the juſt to groan, whom the Lord hath
raiſed to teſtifie againſt you; the judges they have given re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
unto you, and the people they have taken you for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
who have been curſed preſidents to the Rulers and
people, who have followed your cruel ſteps of malice and
envy; and from the head to the tail, they have drunk in
your poiſonus doctrines; and made themſelves drunk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and out of reaſon, in their furious zeal of madneſſe,
and all have taken council together to ſlay the harmleſſe
from off the face of the earth; ſome by falſe judgment and
oppreſſion, and others by cruel abuſings, as beatings, and
ſtonings, unheard of, or unequalized in generations of late.
O ye Prieſts, and Teachers, and wiſe men, and Scribes! how
many of you in this Nation joyned hand in hand to betray
the innocent, by your falſe doctrines and lying divinations,
and have filled (and ſought to do ſo) the mind of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with ſlanders and falſe reproaches, and lying imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many conceptions and jealouſies againſt the people
of God; many of you have made it your ſtudy work, to
bring forth evil by cunning arguments, to ſuggeſt into the
hearts of people, that they might not enter the kingdom,
and even ſo have you been ſhutters of the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt men, and would not enter your ſelves, nor ſuffer
others that would.</p>
            <p>Wo unto you, you have taken away the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and loſt it, and multitudes of falſe aſperſions, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſertions have you brought forth without fear, by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conſequence and lying productions, that you might take
away the key of knowledge thereby, and hide it from men,
and lay ſtumbling blocks of iniquity before the people, to
ſtop the way of the upright, and you have travelled to ſeek
occaſions of evil againſt the juſt, and watched for the halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the innocent, that you might glory and rejoyce in
their fall, and without any occaſion by words or actions, you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118908:9"/>
have taken offence, and made offences by evil ſurmiſings, to
blind the eyes of people, that your Idolatry might not be
diſcovered, nor the way of righteouſneſſe ſhine forth. O
be aſhamed and repent, for to account muſt you Come, and
the ſin of Rulers and people, whom you have blindly led,
will be charged againſt you, who have given them wicked
examples, of cruelty in your pulpits, you have ſpent time in
rayling, and ſlandering, and lying, to infuſe evil into the
minds of men, againſt the truth, and many books have you
given forth and ſent abroad from your lying pens, out of
your vain ſtudies, of falſe propheſie, and mens hearts have
been filled with your damnable doctrines of Devils, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the ſimple have been poyſoned, and the innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed;
even great numbers of books, and lying ſcroules
have gone through the nation from ſome of you filled with
falſe divination, and intents of evil, againſt the way
of the Lord and his people, and worſe than Balaam,
and far exceeding him have you been: you have ſought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
to curſe the people whom God hath bleſſed
altogether, and ſome of you have done it to your evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of your evil work; and you have not known that
there is no divination againſt the holy ſeed. O! what will
become of you when he Lord is ariſen to plead with you for
theſe things, the cruelty and oppreſſion of the Rulers ſhall
be added to your account, and the ſin of the people which
you have ſwallowed down, it ſhall be laid to your charge;
for you have ſtrengthened the hands of evil doers, ſo that
none could turn from his evil way, but have by you been
hardened therein, and from you prophaneſſe have gone
forth to the ends of the earth. Woe, woe, is approaching,
what account will you render in the day of the Lord? you
will all be ſpeechleſſe in that day, when the ſwift witneſſe
doth ariſe; therefore to all you I am moved to write, who
have ſet your ſelves to gain-ſay the truth, and to write againſt
the people of the Lord, whom you call Quakers, who walk
in the truth, and have received the truth from the Lord,
whom you have reproached and ſlandered in ſecret, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118908:10"/>
in open print, in the face of the world, and have laid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cruel and falſe charges and accuſations againſt them, and
to all that hath, or ever ſhall hereafter bend your tongues
and pens, to utter wickedneſſe and falſhood by writing or
otherwiſe. Repent and ceaſe your wickedneſſe, for the
wrath of the Lord is kindled againſt you, and take this for
an anſwer in full to all your books, and falſe reproaches; we
are of God, and he that is of God heareth us, and the whole
world lyes in wickedneſſe, and we have the teſtimony that
we pleaſe God; and he is our God, and we are his people,
and he hath choſen us, and we have choſen him, and the
name of the Lord is our ſtrength, and his covenant of life is
with us, and among us hath he fullfilled his promiſe, and his
ſpirit is poured forth, and ſons and daughters do Propheſie,
and one king reigns upon mount Sion, and the night to us is
far ſpent, and the day is dawned, and the darkneſſe
of the night, which long hath overſhadowed the
world, in which no man could work, is from us fled,
and the marvellous light is riſen, and we are them whom
God hath gathered according to his promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.
from the mouthes of Idol-ſhepherds which once made a prey
upon us, and the glory of the Lord is revealed, and the time
is come of Reſtoration, and of bringing back out of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of darkneſſe, where all have laid, with a vail of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſpread over all their faces, and we are eye-witneſſes of
his glory, and it is given us to taſte, and feel, and handle the
Word of Life, which lives for ever, therefore I ſay unto you
all, it is a little thing to us and not reſpected to be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you; our life you cannot reach, nor our glory deface,
and you we know to be them who God never ſent, but muſt
fullfill your meaſure of wickedneſſe, till the time of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow,
which draws near upon you all, and deſpiſable
ſhall you be to all that fear the Lord and love his wayes, for
your nakedneſſe and ſhame ſhall be uncovered and them
that have loved you ſhall be filled with the indignation of
the Lord againſt you, all your writings, and books, and lyes,
and Senders, and falſe reproaches uttered in publick and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118908:10"/>
private, ſhall go into the pit from which they came, and
ſhall return upon your own heads, and when your vail of
ſlanders and falſe aſperſions is taken off, then ſhall we (as
we are) appear, and till then all your evil brought forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us we bear in patience, and love your revilings rather
than your praiſe; wherefore with ſhame put off your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and lay down your crownes, and ſtop your mouthes
in the duſt, and bow and tremble before the juſt God, and
before the lamb, who is riſen to make war againſt the beaſt

your time is at an end, wherein it was given you to reign, and

fines, and illegal proceedings, by beatings, halings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſings,
reproaches, and revilings, all manner of evil have

            <p>O! what have you? done conſider, and ſuffered to be
done under you, lay it to heart what havock of the people
of the Lord in their perſons and eſtates, and what cruelty
exerciſed upon them through your robellious hearts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any evil juſtly charged upon them, or breach of any law
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118908:11"/>
juſtly proved againſt them, for well doing and not for evil
have you cauſed them to ſuffer: For crying againſt iniquity,
and reproving ſin in the gate, and for bearing witneſſe to
the truth, and againſt all unrighteouſneſſe which abounds in
this generation; ſuch have you falſly judged to be offenders,
and cryed a confederacie againſt them, and ſtrengthened the
hands of the wicked, and cauſed the innocent to groan. O!
what will you do in the day of your viſitation, when the
Lord ariſeth to plead with you, to whom will you fly for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
and to whom will you cry for deliverance? Shall not
the Lords ſoul be avenged upon you, yea from the leaſt of
you to the greateſt? You ſhall feel his hand of judgment,
even all you who have had your fingers dipped in the unjuſt
ſufferings of the dear ſervants of the Lord, whom he hath
called to place his name with for ever, who are his faithful
witneſſes in this perverſe generation, and by your perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them have you proved them to be the people of God,
in the ſight of all Nations, and it is for a teſtimony unto
them, that they are of God, and againſt you, that you are
of the Devil; and Chriſts words are fullfilled upon them, to
their rejoycing, and to your ſorrow, who ſaid, <hi>The time
comes, that they ſhall ſpeak all manner of evil falſly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
you, and think they do God ſervice that kills you, and
caſts you from among them, and the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you
into priſon.</hi> And theſe things you have done, and fullfilled
Chriſts words againſt your ſelves, for a witneſſe againſt you,
and to ſhew that you are enemies to Chriſt and to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and that you will not have him to reign (as I have
ſaid: Therefore when hee reigneth, hee ſhall ſay, bring
hether thoſe mine Enimies and ſlay) them before
me.</p>
            <p>O! what will the juſt Judge of true judgment, the God
of Heaven and Earth render unto you, when he ariſeth to
plead the cauſe of the poor and needy, and to deliver his
Inheritance from under your oppreſſion into perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
What account will you give in that day, when hee
brings ſwift deſtruction upon you? And wherewith will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118908:12"/>
you anſwer him when the ſecrets of your hearts are made
manifeſt, and when the true witneſſe in you all is awakened,
which will bring to your remembrance all your cruel and
unjuſt dealing, and all your bitter and hard ſpeeches which in
your envy you have brought forth againſt the Lord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his people? What will be done to you his enemies,
when Chriſt Jeſus, whom you have perſecuted, comes to
reign in his Kingdom, and ſubdues the kingdoms of this
World, and changeth them into the Kingdoms of the Lord,
and his Chriſt, and the Saints which you have oppreſſed,
receives the Authority and Dominion? It ſhall be ſaid, All
that would not that Chriſt ſhould reign, ſlay them before
him; when it ſhall be given to the Saints to bind Kings in
chains and Nobles in fetters of iron, and to execute upon the
heathen all the judgments written; for behold all ye ſtout
hearted, the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints to
judge the World in righteouſneſſe, and you ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of all your ungodly deeds; for the Scriptures muſt
be fullfilled, and as you have done, even ſo will it be done
unto you, when the ſuffering of the righteous is finiſhed,
and your wickedneſſe come to an end; when the Lord ſhall
reign you ſhall lick the duſt off his feet, and all the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Chriſt ſhall be trodden down as mire, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
ſhall rejoyce over them, and the Lord ſhall mock
when your fear and calamity comes, which come ſuddenly,
in a day when you expect not, how ſhall the Lord pardon
you for this? you have ſinned againſt knowledge, and gone
on after warning, and hardened your hearts after reproof,
and the day of your viſitation you have greatly ſlighted, ye
Rulers have abuſed your power, and ye ſubjects have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
your ſubjection, and now conſider what God did in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
paſt unto the rebellious children, what he did to
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Hoſts, when his long ſuffering was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
how did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> harden his heart, and his cruel
Task maſters oppreſſe the righteous, even as you have done,
and they would not let Iſrael go free to ſerve the Lord, but
they kept them in bondage; and this way you walk, who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118908:12"/>
exerciſe cruelty as they did, and laid heavy burthens upon the
innocent grieveous to be born; cruel task-maſters have you
been over the heritage of the Lord, and in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of wickedneſſe have you walked, fullfilling his meaſure
of cruelty, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> example ſhall you follow in a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
end; remember how the loftineſſe of his heart was bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down, and how his proud heart was abaſed in the day
that God pleaded with him in his righteous judgments, he
and all his task-maſters was confounded in a day, and the
bondage of the righteous was broken in a moment, how
was his whole ſtrength of tyranie overturned and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
weakneſſe, the righteous were delivered, and he and all
his train overwhelmed in one day, and thus ſhall it come
to paſſe upon you: Therefore conſider this, all ye that full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the meaſure of iniquity, ſuddenly will the righteous God
be awakened to take vengeance upon you, and the juſt ſhall
not alwaies groan under your bondage, for he that looketh
from the heaven hath pity upon the diſtreſſed, for whom
now his arme is ſtretched out to bring deliverance unto
them, and all their enemies will he confound, who have this
long time ploughed long furrows upon the back of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
the oppreſſion, and cruelty, and injuſtice, brought
forth in this Nation, it calls for vengeance from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Alas, alas, woe is me for you, you Heads, and Rulers, and
Judges of <hi>England,</hi> what have you done and ſuffered to be
done (under you) againſt the innocent people of God, who
is as dear to him as the apple of his eye, for they be written
on the palms of his hands, and becauſe of the cry of the poor
and the needy will the Lord ariſe and plead their cauſe. Oh
conſider and let it enter into your hearts, the cruelty and
injuſtice that hath been brought forth in this land, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what God did unto all the perſecuters of old, how
was their ſtrength conſumed, and they overturned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
what did he to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt, who perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the ſeed of God, how was he deſtroyed and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

he juſtly rewarded, who perſecuted the innocent ſeed of
God? What did God to <hi>Herod</hi> and all his people who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
the innocent? and remember what he did unto them
that perſecuted the three children, and them that perſecuted
Daniel, how did they fall into the pit which they had dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for another, and how were they deſtroyed, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
delivered, conſider and remember theſe things, ye
that ſuffer the juſt to groan by you.</p>
            <p>Search through the records of old, and ſearch what God
hath done unto all them that lifted up their hand againſt
him and his people, and is he not the ſame at this day, his
hand is not ſhortened that it cannot ſave his people, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
his enemies, his ear is not dull of hearing that he ſhould
not underſtand this unjuſt ſuffering of his people, though
you live careleſſely in pleaſure upon earth, while the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
mournes, yet doth the Lord regard, though you ſpend
your time in pleaſure, and delight your ſelves in vanities all
the day long, yet the Lord hath taken it to heart, and his
ſpirit is grieved that his innocent ſervants ſhould lye in holes
and dungeons to be trodden upon, and be accounted as the
off-ſcouring of all things, hardly thought worthy to have a
place on the earth. Oh remember theſe things, ye that
are high minded, and conſider what God did to the Biſhops
and their crew of perſecutors in this Nation, your ſelves are
witneſſes how the Lord overthrew them, and delivered his
people in a few years time, and as little as you did they think
that they whom they perſeceuted, ſhould ſo ſoon come to
have reigned over them, the Lords hand was then againſt
oppreſſors as it is at this day, do you think the Lord hath
forgotten or that he takes no notice of what is come to
paſſe, how ſhould he forget his people to ſave them, or his
enemies, that he ſhould not recompence them; but know
ye aſſuredly that the Lord is the ſame, and all thoſe things
are written in a book, and remembred by him, and he will
judge juſtly and righteouſly in his dreadfull day, Ah let it
enter into your hearts, ſerve not your ſelves altogether in the
pleaſures of this world, but ſerve the Lord, and this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118908:13"/>
of you, let the oppreſſed go free, and break every
bond, whereby the innocent doth ſuffer, and this the Lord
requires at your hands; Oh but I feel great hardneſſe of
heart, and rather a ſtrengthening of cruel bonds, than a
breaking of them, and you appear rather to be given up to
work wickedneſſe, and to fullfill the largeſt meaſure of them
that went before you than otherwiſe, unrighteous decrees
are rather eſtabliſhed than diſſannulled.</p>
            <p>Oh what will be the end of theſe things, and what will be
your judgment when the Lord awakens himſelf as out of
ſleep, who hath left you to follow your own ſpirits to try
you, that it might be known unto all what is in your hearts,
and behold perverſeneſſe lodges in them, and while the Lord
hath looked for juſtice amongſt you, even the cry of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
hath been heard, even a grieveous cry of unjuſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and violence againſt the ſeed of God, and once you
would have been aſhamed of thoſe things which now you
act without ſhame, ſo that which is in your hearts is powred
forth in the ſight of the World,</p>
            <p>Oh ye Rulers of <hi>England,</hi> the Rulers of the Heathen
ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt you, even they that never
profeſſed ſo much as you have done, they ſhall be rather ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
than you whoſe wayes have been more equal than
yours, and leſſe cruelty brought forth by them than by you,
unto their ſubjects, and this makes your ſin more great, in
that many of you were raiſed from low eſtate, and you have
exalted your ſelves more than is meet, and have cauſed your

            <p>THere are only two Seeds in the World, and there
are but two and no more, to wit, the Seed of God,
and the Seed of the Serpent; and theſe two are contrary
one to the other, in their bringing forth, in their time,
and in their ends, they differ in their Nature, in their
fruits and works, and in their reward; and theſe two are
at continual enmity one againſt another, and never was,
is, or ſhall be reconciled, the life of one is the death of
the other, and where the one doth live, the other doth
dye, and where the one rejoyceth, the other is made ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,
and where the one is in freedom, the other is in
bondage, and where the one is Ruler, the other is a ſlave
and in captivity, and thus are they contrary, where the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118908:15"/>
one brings forth fruit, the other is barren, and the one is
rewarded with the overthrow of the other, and the one of
theſe is ruling in every creature man and woman, and
growing and bringing forth fruit from it ſelfe through the
creature; the fruits of the one is bleſſed for ever, and the
fruits of the other is curſed for ever, and betwixt theſe two
there is no concurrence or agreement in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
they differ in likeneſſe, and their fruits differ in
appearance, the fruit of the one is love, and peace, and
unity; the fruit of the other is hatred, and envy, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and enmity; the fruit of the ſeed of God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is truth, and righteouſneſſe, and faith, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
long-ſuffering, and temperance, and joy, and peace
in the Lord, with all other things which are good, and juſt,
and pure; but the fruits of the ſeeed of the Serpent are of
another nature, as lying, theft, murther, diſſimulation,
drunkenneſſe, and whordomes, hypocriſie and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe,
which is not according to God, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to him; and by theſe ſeveral fruits proceeding through
the creature, do we know every creature, and ſo judge of
him to be the child of God, or the childs of the Devil;
in the election, or in the reprobation, for through whom
the fruits of the ſeed of God doth ſpring forth, we know
ſuch are not of the Devil; and through whom the fruits of
the ſeed of the Serpent doth ſpring forth, we know ſuch
are not of God. And theſe two ſeeeds are now ſtriving
in the earth, the one againſt the other, and they in whom
the ſeed of God rules, are perſecuted by them in whom the
ſeed of the Serpent rules; for they in whom the ſeed of
God rules are born of God <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his Spirit, and they
in whom the ſeed of the Serpent rules are born of fleſh, and
minds the things of the fleſh, which ſhall not endure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſo every one that is born of the fleſh, is of the ſeed
of the Serpent, or the ſeed of the Serpent rules in him, and
every one that is born of the ſeed of God, the ſeed of God
rules in him, ſuch are perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118908:15"/>
the ſeed of the Serpent wich is at enmity againſt the ſeed
of God, which cannot fullfill the will of the Serpents ſeed,
nor be ſubject to his lawes, for the ſeed of God cannot be
ſubject to the Serpents ſeed in any thing, but is ſubject to
God, and not to any thing that is contrary to him; but
rather ſuffers impriſonment, and cruelties, and bonds,
under the ſerpents ſeed than in the leaſt to bow to
it.</p>
            <p>So this is the ground of all perſecution and enmity, which
is betwixt the two ſeeds, which ſeeks the overthrow each of
other, but who are of the ſeed of God, knowes that they
are of God, and that the whole world lyes in wickedneſſe,
under the government of the ſeed of the Serpent; and
ſuch where the ſeed of God is brought forth, hath the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
in themſelves that they are of God, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in the Sonne of God who is the light of the world,
and knowes him to be the foundation and the rock of ages,
and the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt him, nor the
enmity of the Serpents ſeed overcome him, nor they that
are builded on him; and this is a teſtimony for the ſeed of
God, and againſt the ſeed of the Serpent in all the World,
that it is perſecuted of the ſeed of the Serpent, and ſpoken
all manner of evil of by the World, according to the
words of Chriſt, which are fullfilled upon us to our rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who are of the ſeed of God, and to the trouble of all
our enemies, who are of the ſeed of the Serpent. And
otherwiſe it cannot be, but that they who are born of the
fleſh muſt perſecute them who are born of the ſpirit; for
becauſe of the enmity that is placed between the two ſeeds,
the one cannot love the other, nor have fellowſhip the one
with the other, and which of our fore-fathers the Prophets
and Diſciples of Chriſt, which were of the ſeed of God,
were not perſecuted, hated, and reviled, and reproached
by your fore-fathers who were of the ſeed of the Serpent,
and they, no more than you, could receive the knowledge
of God and his waies, but ever deſpiſed the path thereof,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118908:16"/>
and counted the wiſdom of God fooliſhneſſe, and ſtood in
the enmity againſt God and his people, and all their wayes,
and they that were of the ſeed of the ſerpent ever called
truth error, and the way thereof hereſie and blalphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeremiah, Amos,</hi> and the reſt, were called deceivers and
mad men, and ſeducers of the people, and evil was done
unto them, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was put in the ſtocks and in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
by the Rulers of that generation, who were of the
ſeed of the ſerpent, even the Prophets of God who were
ſent of God, and were witneſſer of his name in truth
and righteouſneſſe, were acounted and called deceivers,
and were perſecuted by impriſonments, and ſome unto death
as you may read in the Scripture, <hi>Jeremiah 20. Amos</hi>
7.</p>
            <p>Theſe with others who were ſent of the Lord to bear
teſtimony of God and againſt the Rulers, who executed not
true juſtice and judgment, but were oppreſſors of the poor,
who judged for gifts and rewards, and againſt the falſe
Prophets and Prieſts that ran and had not been ſent, who
uſed thir tongue, and ſaid the Lord ſaith, and the Lord
had not ſpoken to them, who propheſied falſly, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for hire, and bare rule by their means, and made a prey
upon the people, theſe were of the ſeed of ſerpent, and
did perſecute them that bore witneſſe againſt them, that
were of the ſeed of God.</p>
            <p>The Word of the Lord was even a reproach unto <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
daily, and they ſmote him with the tongue, and the
chief governour of the houſe of the Lord, ſmote him and
put him in the dungeon, and <hi>Amos,</hi> which had been no
Prophet not the ſon of a Prophet but a herdſman, he was
perſecuted by the Prieſt of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and was commanded not
to Propheſie in the Kings Chappel, and <hi>Amaziah</hi> the
Prieſt complained to <hi>Jereboam</hi> the King againſt <hi>Amos</hi> the
Prophet, and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Prophet could not be received of
the people, for ſaith the Lord, they will not hear thee,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118908:16"/>
for they will not hear me, and they were a rebellious houſe,
and impudent, and hardhearted, and would not receive the
Prophets words, and thus it was in the time of the Apoſtles
and Chriſt Jeſus, they were perſecuted, and ſome of them
put to death for bearing teſtimony unto the father, whom
they were witneſſes of and againſt the World; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
ſlanders, beatings, buffetings, ſcornings, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
uproars, and all manner of evil did they ſuffer in
their generation by the ſeed of the Serpent, from the hands
of the Rulers, and Prieſts, and people; Chriſt was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a deceiver, and called a devil, and a blaſphemer; and
the Apoſtles were called heretiques, deceivers, and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
fellowes, movers of ſedition, deſtroyers of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and turners of the World upſide down, and ſuch like: All
theſe were of the ſeed of God that were perſecuted, and
the perſecuters were of the ſeed of the Serpent, which
brought forth violence, and wickedneſſe, and falſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the innocent; and ſome were put to death
upon the falſe account of being deceivers and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
            <p>If you ſearch through the whole Scripture, you may
read how the juſt were perſecuted, even from <hi>Abel</hi> who
was of the ſeed of God, and all that ever were perſecuted
for righteouſneſſe ſake, were perſecuted upon the account
of being evil doers, and the perſecuters judged themſelves
to be righteous.</p>
            <p>He was the chief Governor of the houſe of the Lord, that
perſecuted <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the people that ſmote him with
the tongue, ſaid, They knew the Law ſhould not periſh
from the Prieſt, nor Counſel from the Honourable: and
it was <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Kings Prieſt that perſecuted <hi>Amos,</hi>
and it was they that ſeeemed to be religious that perſecuted
the Prophets, and it was the wiſe Scribes and Phariſees, and
the chief Prieſts, that handled the Law, and that offered
Sacrifice, that perſecuted Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>How zealous were the Jewes in their traditions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118908:17"/>
in their ſabboth-keeping, and in the dayes of
their humiliation, in their Temple-worſhip, and in all the
Commandments of God? They were zealous according
to their own thoughts, yet were they of the ſeed of the
Serpent; and perſecuted the ſeed of God in blind zeal, upon
falſe judgment, and the perſecutors had a name to be
righteous, and the perſecuted were accounted unrighteous,
and ſo darkneſſe was put for light, and light for darkneſſe,
and them that were well-doers were accounted evil doers,
and them that were evil doers were accounted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>And ſuch was the blindneſſe of Rulers and people, ſuch as
propheſied falſly, and came in their own name were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for the people loved to have it ſo when the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
was committed, but they that came in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
name could not be received, but were perſecuted; the
Prophets, Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles could not be received
of the World, but were perſecuted in it, and lawes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
were made againſt them, whereby they ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
upon grounds ſuſpitions and jealouſies, for that way
was called hereſie, in which the true God was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was called a deceiver, and the wiſdom of the
World could not receive the knowledge of the things of
God, and as it was then, ſo is it now in every particular,
if any man hath an ear to hear he may hear, and a heart
to underſtand he may perceive; for now is the ſeed of God
and the ſeed of the Serpent at enmity, ſtriving one againſt
the other, and the one perſecutes the other in this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as ever it was we are perſecuted upon the falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and falſe judgement of being evil doers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
and our perſecuters accounts themſelves righteous
and zealous for Gods waies, and ſuch as are falſe Prophets
and deceivers, are accounted true Miniſters of Chriſt, even
them that preach for hire, and ſeek for their gain from their
Quarter, and through convetouſneſſe, by feigned words
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118908:17"/>
makes merchandiſe of ſoules, ſuch were, and ſuch are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
and were never ſent of God, and yet ſuch in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
are accounted Miniſters of Chriſt, and ſuch as are
Miniſters of Chriſt, who walk in the Doctrin of Chriſt, as
they have received freely, ſo do they freely give, and ſeek
not advantage themſelves, but are perſecuted and reviled
for righteouſneſſe ſake, ſuch are accounted and falſly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
deceivers, and ſo true judgment is turned backward,
good is called evil, and evill good, deceivers are called
Miniſters of Chriſt, and Miniſters of Chriſt are called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
and thus people in this generation erres in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and perſecutes the righteous, who are of the ſeed of
God.</p>
            <p>And it was ever the Miniſters of Chriſt that were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and never any of them perſecuted any, nor ever any
of the deceivers perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, but
they ever perſecuted the juſt and ſought to the Rulers, and
to the Elders of the people for violence to be done unto
them that feared the Lord, and witneſſed againſt their
wickedneſſe, it was the Chief Prieſts and them that handled
the law, which cauſed Chriſt and the Apoſtles to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſought to <hi>Jereboam</hi> to have <hi>Amos</hi> perſecuted
and as it was then, ſo it is now. How doth the Teachers
of this Nation ſeek to the Magiſtrates to have the innocent
perſecuted, and yet theſe men are zealous for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
and duties in the ſet dayes of humiliation and
lectures, and even they think they do God good ſervice
in impriſoning the innocent, they have great zeal without
knowledge as the Jewes had, and they are ſtrict in their
Sabboth keeping, in their ſinging and praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
yet is violence done to the juſt and true judgment and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
neglected, and therefore all that which they perform
to God is abomination in his ſight.</p>
            <p>Oh what complaining is by the Teachers of this N<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion
to the Magiſtrates? What crying out for defence, ſhewing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118908:18"/>
that they want the ſpiritual armour, and dare not truſt the
Lord? What plotting and contriving againſt the ſeed of
God by the ſeed of the Serpent, who ever was a perſecutor
and never was perſecuted? What lawes and decrees are
brought forth againſt the Lords people, as traps to enſnare
their fee, like as it was in the dayes of old, even like unto
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the King, who made a Decree and gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
that the City of God ſhould not be builded,
and this was from the information and complaining of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum</hi>
the Chancellor and <hi>Shimſhai</hi> the Scribe, who brought
certain accuſations to the King againſt the people of God,
and called the holy City, a rebellious and bad City, and
that it was hurtfull unto Kings, and danger to endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
the revenue of Kings.</p>
            <p>Here was a conſpiracie by the Scribes and ſuch as han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
the Law, with the King againſt the people of God,
and thus it is now, he that hath an eye to ſee may ſee; how
many petitions have they put to the Rulers againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God? What grieveous and falſe accuſations have
they laid to the charge of the innocent, ſaying they be
Popiſhly affected, and diſobedient to Government: ſo that
the ſeed of the Serpent ever doth hatch evil againſt the
ſeed of God to deſtroy it from off the face of the earth, and
it was the wiſe, and the learned, and the Rulers, whom the
Devil made uſe of to perſecute the righteous: it was ſuch
as <hi>Rhehum</hi> the Chancellor, and <hi>Shimſhai</hi> the Scribe, and
<hi>Paſhur</hi> the chief Governor in the houſe of the Lord, and it
was ſuch as the chief Prieſts and Elders of the people, and
the wiſe men of this world, ſuch as theſe it was that perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the righteous, and ſo it is now, Orthodox men (ſo
called) Juſtices of Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom the Devil makes uſe
of; to perſecute the innocent, againſt which no occaſion
can be found but concerning the Law of God, as it was
with <hi>Daniel,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Daniel</hi> 6, and 5, 6. againſt
him they could find no occaſion that they might preſecute
him, but concerning the Law of his God, and it was the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118908:18"/>
Preſident and Princes, and Counſellors and the Governors
which conſulted together againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God.</p>
            <p>And as it was then, ſo it is now in this generation, they
can find no occaſion againſt us (the people of God) either
by doctrin or converſation, but onely concerning the law
and worſhip of our God, for there is a law againſt the law
of Chriſt, and all that will not ſwear contrary to the law of
Chriſt, muſt be counted evil doers and Popiſh recuſants, and
puniſhed, and this is not for any evil in us, but becauſe we
cannot tranſgreſſe the law of our God, and alſo another
decree, which takes hold upon them that travell to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God on the firſt day of the week, whereby the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
doth ſuffer and are like to ſuffer; and not for evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is any occaſion againſt us, but becauſe we will not ſtay
from the worſhip of our God, but are made to travel that
we may meet together to worſhip him; with ſuch other
decree; which ſheweth unto all men that they ſeek occaſion
againſt us concerning the law of our God, not having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
by doctrine, or converſation, or any other thing; ſo
for righteouſneſſe ſake are we perſecuted, and not for evil
doing; ſome are perſecuted becauſe for conſcience ſake
they cannot ſtay at their own houſes but are moved by the
Lord to declare the Name of the Lord abroad in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
many by a decree are taken and puniſhed as for vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,
and this is an occaſion concerning the law of our
God; and Chriſt was perſecuted and put to death by an
unrighteous decree, for they had an (unrighteous) law, as
they ſaid, aad by it he ought to dye, and unrighteous laws
and decrees were made againſt the Apoſtles, whereby they
were commanded to depart out of their townes, and to
preach no more in the Name of Jeſus, and by ſuch decrees
were the Apoſtles perſecuted. So that this may ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all, that our fore-fathers who were of the ſeed of God,
ſome were perſecuted unto death by unrighteous decrees
and ſtatutes, and as it was then, ſo it is now, he that hath
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118908:19"/>
an eye to ſee may ſee: the ſame as ever was is come to
paſſe in the earth, the ſeed of the Serpent ſtriving againſt
the ſeed of God and perſecuting it where it is brought
forth: by unrighteous decrees, how did the late Biſhops of
<hi>England</hi> perſecute the harmleſſe? What Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
were then brought forth, whereby violence was done
againſt ſuch as feared the Lord, and then was the ſeed of the
Serpent ſtriving againſt the ſeed of God.</p>
            <p>And this is given forth to ſhew unto all the World the
cauſe of perſecution in its firſt ground, (to wit) the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
enmity which is betwixt the two ſeeds, the one
continually hating and perſecuting the other, and ſeeking
the overthrow each of other, and the enmity betwixt the
two ſeeds, is the cauſe of ſtrife, the one being innocent, and
the other unrighteous, ſo it is not for the perſons ſake, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing that the juſt are perſecuted, but it is becauſe
of the ſeed of God, which cannot bow, nor worſhip the ſeed
of the Serpent, that is the firſt cauſe of perſecution.</p>
            <p>Again, all may ſee what unrighteous lawes and decrees
were and are brought forth to perſecute the innocent,
whereby they have ſuffered in all generations for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſake, and not for evil doing; alſo it may be ſeen, that
it was the wiſe, the learned, the Preſidents and Chancellors
and chief Prieſts, and Scribes, who were and are the very
active perſons by whom the ſeed of God is perſecuted, and
even ſuch as were and are zealous in their obſervances and
Sabboth-keeping, and ſuch like, it was not the poor nor the
fooliſh only, which the Devil made uſe of to do his work;
but it was the wiſe, and the learned, and the chief in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and ſuch like, it was ſuch in whom the ſeed of the
Serpent ruled, who were the active men againſt the ſervants
of God.</p>
            <p>Alſo it was through the evil counſel of ſuch as were
Teachers and Scribes, and handlers of the law, and it was
through the falſe accuſations of the chief Prieſts unto the
Governors and Elders of the people, and ſo it is now at this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118908:19"/>
day, as I have proved; and alſo the righteous was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the falſe judgment of others, and they were falſly
adjudged to be deceivers, and blaſphemers, and evil doers,
and upon this account were they perſecuted and as being
falſly reputed to be deſtructive to Government, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of Kings, and upon ſuch like, and that they made void
the Law of God, and were movers of ſedition and upon ſuch
accounts as theſe, was the ſeed of God perſecuted, as it is at
this day; and all men that read this with moderation may
come to the good underſtanding, upon what account and
by what inſtruments and by what means the ſeed of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
hath perſecuted the ſeed of God, even from <hi>Cain</hi> unto
this day.</p>
            <p>And this is to go abroad into this Nation, and into the
World, and it is given forth from the ſuffering ſeed of God,
to clear it ſelf in the ſight of all men, that not for evil, but
for good are theſe ſufferings laid upon it. But behold the
Lord regardeth the cry of the poor and of the unjuſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer,
and he will remember his mercy and his covenant with
his own ſeed; and when it paſſes through the fire, he is
with it, and though it be afflicted it cannot be forſaken,
though the Lord hide his face from his people, and ſuffers
grievous things to be done againſt them by the wicked, yet
it is but to try them and to prove them, that they may be
found faithfull to him, and the ſeed of God ſhall reign in
the earth, and the ſeed of the Serpent, and his head ſhall be
bruiſed, and is bruiſed already, and it bruiſeth its heel by
following after with perſecution and cruelty, but the ſeed of
God ſhall ariſe and is ariſen, and praiſeth the living God for
evermore.</p>
            <p>It plainly appears that the ſuffering of the people of God
in this Age, is a greater ſuffering and more unjuſt, than in
the dayes of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles, or in any time ſince:
Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes brought not forth a ſuffering more
cruel, and in many reſpects, as doth appear; Firſt, What
was done to Chriſt and the Apoſtles, was chiefly done by a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118908:20"/>
law, and in a great part by the due execution of a law; and
alſo the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, had more juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
and a more juſt perſecution in law, than the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God have now, for now it is a matter of conſcience
among ſome of the Magiſtrates in <hi>England</hi> to caſt men into
priſon, and confine them, and to cauſe their goods to be
ſpoiled, without any law or the due execution of a law;
which is utterly contrary to the Charters of <hi>England,</hi> and
hereby it appears the ſuffering to be more unjuſt, becauſe
what the perſecuters of old did to the people of God, they
did by a law, and by the due execution of a law, but now
many are cauſed to ſuffer deeply; whom the tranſgreſſion
of no law, good or bad, can be charged againſt; and others
ſuffer without the due execution of a Law.</p>
            <p>Again, herein it doth appear to exceed the ſuffering of
the Saints in former ages, in that many ſuffer now cruel
things about trivial fooliſh matters, as for not putting off
a Hat or Theeing men; and for denying the fooliſh circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of ſwearing; and we do not read that the worſt of
Tyrants in the Apoſtles dayes, or before or ſince, ever cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
any to ſuffer for ſuch things as theſe, or ever queſtioned
any upon any ſuch ſmal accounts, for hundreds have ſuffered
upon ſuſpition, when nothing at all can be charged againſt
them, and this is contrary to <hi>Magna-Carta,</hi> and in many
other reſpects which might be named; this ſuffering is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than hath been in any age, for many have ſuffered in this
Common-wealth, which have been faithful, and hazarded all
in time of war for the good of the Common-wealth; and
many of them ſuffer by them who have been enemies and
in Armes againſt the Common-wealth, and herein the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appears more intolerable. But doth the Magiſtrate think
to come to account for theſe things, yea the Lord is juſt,
and his way is righteous; What fleſh could but be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
hereby? But the Saints are changed in nature, and are
to fullfill the Will of the Lord by ſuffering: the cruelty of
men is become exceeding great againſt the Lord and his
people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:118908:20"/>
Again, hereby the perſecution in this age appears more
to exceed former ages, becauſe liberty of conſcience in the
exerciſe of Religion, was never ſo much promiſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
as in this Nation at this day; and yet for the exerciſe
of a pure conſcience many are wofull ſufferers, even by
ſuch who in words profeſſe liberty of conſcience themſelves;
and yet perſecutes the exerciſe of it in others, even for not
putting off a hat or the like to them; theſe with many other
things, may aggravate the hainouſneſſe of the ſinne of
perſecution to be great and more unjuſt than in former
Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alas how is the ſword of juſtice turned backward, and the
innocent ſmitten and perſecuted, and that for righteouſneſſe ſake
and not for evil doing.</hi>
