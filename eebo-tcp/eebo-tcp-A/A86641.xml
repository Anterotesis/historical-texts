            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Winter Dream.</head>
            <p>IT was in the dead of a long Winter night, when no eyes were open but Watchmen, and Centinell's, that I was fallen ſoundly aſleep, the Cinq out-Ports were ſhut up cloſer then uſually, and my ſences ſo treble lock'd, that the Moon, had ſhe deſcended from her watry Orb, might have don much more to me then ſhe did to <hi>Endymion</hi> when he lay ſnoaring upon the brow of <hi>Latmus</hi> Hill; nay, (be it ſpoken without prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) if a rib had bin taken out of me that night, to have made a new model of a woman, I ſhold hardly have felt it.</p>
            <p>Yet, though the Couſin-german of Death had ſo ſtrongly ſeiz'd thus upon the exterior parts of this poore Tabernacle of fleſh, my inward were never more actif, and fuller of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then they were that night.</p>

            <p>Me thought my ſoul made a ſallie abroad into the world, and fetch'd a vaſt compas; ſhe ſeem'd to ſoar up and ſlice the air, to croſſe ſeas, clammer up huge Hills, and never reſted till ſhe had arriv'd at the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> Now ſom of the moſt judicious Geometricians and Chorographers hold, that the whole Maſſe of the Earth being round like the reſt of her fellow Elements, ther be places, and poizing parts of the Continent, there be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117298:3"/>
Peninſulas, Promontories and Ilands upon the other face of the Earth that correſpond and concenter with all thoſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Iles that are upon this ſuperficies which we tread; Countries that ſymbolize with them in qualities, in tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of air and clime, as well as in nature of ſoile; The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants alſo of thoſe places which are ſo perpendicularly oppoſit, do ſympathize one with another in diſpoſition, complexions and humors, though the Aſtronomers wold have their Eaſt to be our Weſt, and ſo all things <hi>vice verſa</hi> in point of poſition, which diviſion of the Heaven is only mans inſtitution.</p>
            <p>But to give an account of the ſtrange progres my ſoule made that night; the firſt Country ſhe lighted on was a very low flat Countrey, and it was ſuch an odd amphibious Countrey, being ſo indented up and down with Rivers and armes of the ſea, that I made a queſtion whither I ſhold call it Water or Land; yet though the <hi>Sea</hi> be invited and uſher'd in into ſom places, he is churliſtly pen'd out in ſom other: ſo that though he foam and ſwell, and appeer as high Walls hard by, yet they keep him out, maugre all his roaring and ſwelling.</p>
            <p>As I wandred up and down in this Watry Region, I might behold from a ſtreight long Dike whereon I ſtood, a ſtrange kind of Forreſt, for the trees mov'd up and down; they look'd afar off as if they had bin blaſted by thunder; for they had no leafs at all; but making a neerer approach unto them, I found they were a nomberleſſe company of Ship Maſts, and before them appeer'd a great Town incorporated up and down with<note place="margin">

was ſo dull in point of motion, as if his veines had bin filld with buttermilk in lieu of blood: I began to mingle words with him, and to expoſtulate ſomthing about that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and peeple; and then I found a great deal of downright ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities in him: He told me that <hi>They</hi> were the only men who did miracles of late yeers; Thoſe innumerable piles of ſtones you ſee before you in ſuch comely neat fabriques, is a place (ſaid he) that from a Fiſh <hi>Market</hi> in effect is com to be one of the greateſt <hi>Marts</hi> in this part of the world, which hath made her ſwell thrice bigger then ſhe was 50. yeers ago; and as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this floating Forreſt of Maſts before her mole, ſo if you could ſee the foundations of her houſes, you ſhold ſee another great Forreſt, being rear'd from under ground upon fair piles of timber, which if they chance to ſink in this Marſhy ſoyl, we have an art to ſcrue them up again. We have for 70. yeers and above without any intermiſſion, except a ſhort-liv'd truce that once was made, wraſtled with one of the greateſt Potentates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and born up ſtoutly againſt him, gramercy our two next neighbour Kings, and their <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our ſituation. We have <hi>fought</hi> our ſelfs into a free State, and now quite out of that ancient alleageance we ow'd him; and though we pay 20. times more in taxes of all ſorts then we did to him, yet we are contented: We have turn'd <hi>War</hi> into a <hi>trade,</hi> and that which uſeth to <hi>beggar</hi> others, hath <hi>benefited</hi> us: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have bin and are ſtill the rendevous of moſt diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Subjects, when by the motions of unquiet conſciences in points of Religion, or by the fury of the ſword, they are forc'd to quit their own Countreys, who bring their arts of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and moveables, hither; In ſo much that our Lombards are full of their goods, and our banks ſuperabound with their <hi>gold</hi> and ſilver which they bring hither in <hi>ſpecie.</hi> To ſecure our ſelfs, and cut the Enemy more work, and to engage our Confiderats in a war with him, we have kindled fires in evry corner; and now that they are together by the Eares, we have bin content

lately, being long woo'd thereunto, to make a peace with that King to whom we once acknowledged vaſſalage; which King out of a height of ſpirit, hath ſpent 500. times more upon us for our reduction, then all our Countrey is worth; But now he hath bin well contented to renounce and abjure all claimes and rights of Soverainty over us; In ſo much, that being now without an Enemy, we hope in a ſhort time to be maſters of all the comerce in this part of the world, and to eat our Neighbours out of trade in their own Comodities: We fear nothing but that exces of Wealth, and a ſurfet of eaſe may make us careles and breed quarrells among our ſelfs, and that our Generall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married to a great Kings daughter, may—</p>
            <p>Here he ſuddenly broke the threed of his diſcourſe, and got haſtily away, being hal'd by a ſhip that was ſailing hard by.</p>
            <p>Hereupon my ſoul took wing again, and cut her way through that foggy condens'd aire, till ſhe lighted on a fair, ſpacious, cleare Continent, a generous and rich Soile mantled up and downe with large woods, where, as I rang'd to and fro, I might ſee divers faire Houſes, Townes, Palaces and Caſtles, looking like ſo many <hi>Carkaſes,</hi> for no humane ſoule appear'd in them; me thought I felt my heart melting within me in a ſoft reſentment of the caſe of ſo gallant a Countrey, and as I ſtood at amaze, and in a kind of aſtoniſhment, a goodly perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage makes towards me, whom both for his comportment, and countenance, I perceiv'd to be of a finer mould then that companion I had met withall before: by the trace of his looks I gueſſed he might be ſom Nobleman that had bin ruin'd by ſom diſaſter: having acoſted him with a fitting diſtance, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in a Maſculin ſtrong winded language full of aſpirations and tough colliſion of Conſonants, to tell me as followeth: Sir, I find you are a ſtranger in this Countrey, becauſe you ſtand ſo agaſt at the devaſtations of ſuch a fair piece of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, then know Sir, becauſe I beleeve you are curious to carry away with you the cauſes thereof, that theſe ruthfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117298:4"/>
which you behold, are the effects of a long lingring war, and of the fury of the Sword, a cruentous civill War that hath rag'd here ubove 30. yeares: one of the grounds of it was the infortunate undertaking of a Prince, who liv'd not far off in an affluence of all earthly felicity; he had the greateſt Lady to his wife, the beſt purſe of money, the faireſt Stable of horſe, and choiceſt Library of books of any other of his neighbour Princes. But being by deſperate and aſpiring coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells put upon a Kingdome, while he was catching at the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Crowne, he loſt the ſubſtance of all his own ancient poſſeſſions: by the many powerfull alliances he had (which was the cauſe he was pitched upon) the feud continued long; for among others a <hi>Northern</hi> King took advantage to ruſh in, who did a world of miſchiefs, but in a few yeers that King and he found their graves in their own ruins neer upon the ſome time; but now, may heaven have due thanks for it, there is a peace concluded, a peace which hath bin 14. long yeers a moulding, and will I hope, be ſhortly put in execution; yet 'tis with this fatall diſadvantage, that the ſaid Northerne people, beſides a maſſe of ready money we are to give them, are to have firme footing, and a warm neſt ever in this Countrey hereafter, ſo that I fear we ſhall hear from them too often: upon theſe words this noble perſonage fetch'd a deep ſigh, but in ſuch a ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thence my ſoule taking her flight o're divers huge and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cacuminous mountaines, at laſt I found my ſelfe in a great populous Towne, but her buildings were miſerably battered up and downe, ſhe had a world of Palaces, Caſtles, Convents and goodly Churches: as I ſtepped out of curioſity into one of them, upon the Weſt ſide there was a huge Grate, where a creature all in white beckned at me, making my approach to the Grate, I found her to be a Nun, a lovely creature ſhe was, for I could not diſtinguiſh which was whiter, her <hi>hue</hi> or her

ſhe was then beginning to expoſtulat with me about the ſtate of my Countrey, and I had a mighty mind to ſatisfie her, for I could have correſponded with her in the relation of as ſtrange things, but the Lady <hi>Abadeſſe</hi> calling her away, ſhe departed in an inſtant, obedience ſeem'd to be there ſo preciſe and punctuall.</p>
            <p>I ſteer'd my courſe thence through a moſt delicious Countrey to another City that lay in the very boſome of the Sea, ſhe was at firſt nothing els but a kind of poſie made up of dainty green hillocks, tied together by above 400. bridges, and ſo coagulated into a curious Citie; though ſhe be eſpous'd to <hi>Neptune</hi> very ſolemnly once evry yeer, yet ſhe ſtill reſerves her maydenhead, and beares the title of the <hi>Virgin Citie</hi> in that part of the world; But I found her tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mainly with a huge Giant that wold raviſh her; He hath ſhrewdly ſet on her skirts, and a great ſhame it is, that ſhe is not now aſſiſted by her Neighbours, &amp; that they ſhold be together by the eares when they ſhold do ſo neceſſary a work, conſidering how that great Giant is their common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; and hath lately vow'd <hi>ſeven yeers</hi> warrs againſt her; ſpecially conſidering, that if he comes once to <hi>raviſh</hi> her, he will quickly <hi>ruin</hi> them; She to her high honor be it ſpoken) being their only rampart againſt the incurſion of the ſaid Giant, and by conſequence their greateſt ſecurity.</p>
            <p>From this <hi>Maiden</hi> Citie, mee thought, I was in a trice carried over a long gulf, and ſo through a Midland Sea, into another Kingdome, where I felt the Clime hotter by ſome Degrees; a rough hew'n ſoile, for the moſt part, it was, full of craggie barren hills; but where there were valleys and water enough, the countrey was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fruitfull, whereby nature (it ſeems) made her a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the ſterility of the reſt. Yet notwithſtanding the hardſhip of the ſoyl, I found her full of Abbeys, Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Hermitages, Convents, Churches, and other places of devotion; As I rov'd there a while, I encountred a grave
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117298:6"/>
man in a long black cloak, by the faſhion whereof, and by the brimms of his hat, I perceived him to be a Jeſuit; I clos'd with him, and queſtion'd with him about that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: He told me the King of that Countrey was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Potentat of that part of the world; and, to draw power to a greater unitie, they of our <hi>Order</hi> could be well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he were univerſall Head over Temporalls, becauſe 'tis moſt probable to be effected by him, as we have already one univerſall Head over Spiritualls: This is the Monark of the Mines, I mean of Gold and Silver, who furniſhes all the world, but moſt of all his own Enemies with money, which money foments all the warrs in this part of the world: Never did any earthly Monark thrive ſo much in ſo ſhort a tract of time; But of late yeers he hath bin illfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly ſhaken by the revolt and utter defection of two ſorts of Subjects, who are now in actuall armes againſt him on both ſides of him at his own doors. There hath bin alſo a long deadly feud 'twixt the next tramontan Kingdom and him, though the Queen that rules there be his own ſiſter, an unnaturall odious thing: But it ſeems God Almighty hath a quarrell of late yeers with all earthly Potentats; for in ſo ſhort a time there never happen'd ſuch ſtrange ſhocks and revolutions: The great Emperour of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> hath bin outed, he and all his children by a petty companion: The King of <hi>China</hi> a greater Emperour then he, hath loſt almoſt all that huge Monarchy by the incurſion of the <hi>Tartar,</hi> who broke ore the Wall upon him; The grand <hi>Turk</hi> hath bin ſtrangled, with 30. of his Concubines; The Emperur of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> hath bin content to beg his life of his own vaſſalls, &amp; to ſee before his face divers of his chief Officers hack'd to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; their heads cut off &amp; ſteep'd in ſtrong water, to make them burn more bright in the market place. Beſides the above mentioned, this King hath alſo divers Enemies more, yet he bears up againſt them all indifferently well, though with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117298:6"/>
infinite expence of treaſure: and the Church, ſpecially our Society, hath ſtuck cloſe unto him in theſe his exigents: whence may be inferr'd, that let men repine as long as they will at the poſſeſſions of the Church, <hi>they are the beſt anchors to a State in a ſtorme,</hi> and in time of need to preſerve it from ſinking; beſides acts of charity wold be quite loſt among men, did not the wealth of the Church keep life in them: Hereupon drawing a huge paire of Beads from under his cloak, he began to aske me of my Religion; I told him I had a long journey to go, ſo that I could not ſtay to wait on him longer; ſo we parted, and me thought I was very glad, to be rid of him ſo well.</p>
            <p>My ſoule then made another flight over an Aſſembly of hideous high hills, and lighted under another Clyme, on a rich and copious Countrey reſembling the form of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenge, but me thought, I never ſaw ſo many poor peeple in my life; I encountred a Peaſan, and asked him what the reaſon was, that there ſhold be ſo much poverty in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where there was ſo much plenty: Sir, they keep the Commonalty poor in pure policy here; for being a peeple, as the world obſerves us to be, that are more humerous then others, and that love variety and change, if we were ſuffered to be pamper'd with wealth, we wold ever and anon riſe up in tumults, and ſo this Kingdome ſhold never be quiet, but ſubject to inteſtine broyles, and ſo to the hazard of any invaſion: But there was of late a devilliſh Cardinall, whoſe <hi>humour</hi> being as ſanguin as his <hi>habit,</hi> and working upon the weaknes of his Maſter, hath made us not onely poore, but ſtark beggars, and we are like to continue ſo by an eternall war, wherein he hath plung'd this poore Kingdom, which war muſt be maintained with our very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirits: but as dejected and indigent as we are, yet upon the death of that ambitious Cardinall, we had riſen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, who hath the Vogue now, (with whom he hath

left his principles) had not the fearfull example of our next tranſmarin Weſtern neighbours, and the knowledge we have of a worſe kind of ſlavery, of thoſe endles arbitrary taxes, and horrid confuſions they have fool'd themſelfs lately into, utterly deterr'd us, though we have twenty times more reaſon to riſe then ever they had: yet our great City hath ſhew'd her teeth, and gnaſh'd them ilfavouredly of late, but we find ſhe hath drawn water only for her owne Mill, we fare little the better, yet we hope it will conduce to peace, which hath been ſo long in agitation. I cannot remember how I parted with that Peaſan, but in an inſtant I was landed upon a large Iſland, and me thought, 'twas the temperat'ſt Region I had been in all the while; the <hi>heat</hi> of the Sun there is as harmles as his <hi>light,</hi> the evening <hi>ſerenes</hi> are as wholſome there, as the morning <hi>dew;</hi> the <hi>Dog-daies</hi> as innocuous as any of the two <hi>Equinoxes.</hi> As I rang'd to and fro that fair Iland, I ſpied a huge City whoſe length did far exceed her latitude, but neither for length or latitude did ſhe ſeem to beare any politicall proportion with that Iland: ſhe look'd, me thought, like the Jeſuits hat whom I had met withall before, whoſe brimms were bigger then the crowne, or like a petticoat, whoſe fringe was longer then the body. As I did caſt my eyes upwards, me thought I diſcern'd a ſtrange Inſcription in the aire which hung juſt over the midſt of that Citie written in ſuch huge viſible characters, that any one might have read it, which was this: <hi>Woe be to the bloody City.</hi>

completeſt condition of happineſſe of any part on earth, inſomuch that ſhe was repin'd at for her proſperity and peace by all her neighbours, who were plung'd in warre round about her, but now ſhe is fallen into as deep a gulf of miſery, and ſervitude, as ſhe was in a height of felicity and freedom before: Touching the grounds of this change, I cannot impute it to any other then to a ſurfet of happineſſe; now <hi>there is no ſurfet ſo dangerous as that of happines:</hi> There are ſuch horrid diviſions here, that if they were a foot in hell, they were able to deſtroy the Kingdom of Satan: truly Sir, there are crep'd in more opinions among us about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, then the Pagans had of old of the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> which <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith were 300. the underſtandings of poor men were never ſo puzzled &amp; diſtracted; a great while there were two oppoſit powers who ſwayed here in a kind of equality that people knew not whom to obey, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands complied with both, as the men of <hi>Calecut</hi> who adore God and the Devill, (<hi>Tantum Squantum,</hi> as it is in the Indian language) the one for love, the other for feare: there is a monſtrous kind of wild liberty here that ever was upon earth; that which was complained of as a ſtalking horſe to draw on our miſeries at firſt, is now only in practice, which is meer <hi>arbitrary rule;</hi> for now both <hi>Law, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> are here arbitrary: Touching the laſt, 'tis quite loſt, 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that any one may prate, preach, or print what they will in derogation of their anointed King: which word <hi>King</hi> was once a Monoſyllable of ſome weight in this Ile, but 'tis as little regarded now as the word <hi>Pope</hi> (among ſom) which was alſo a mighty Monoſyllable once among us: the rule of the Law is, that the King can <hi>do</hi> no wrong, there is a contrary rule now crept in, that the King can <hi>receive</hi> no wrong; and truly Sir, 'tis a great judgement both upon Prince and peeple, upon the one, that the love of his vaſſalls ſhold be ſo alienated from him; upon the other, that their

            <p>There happen'd a ſhrewd commotion &amp; diſtemper in the Body Naturall 'twixt the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Members;</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Noble</hi> parts (ſom of them) but the common inferior organs alſo banded againſt him in a high way of unnaturall preſumption; The heart, which is the ſource of life, with the <hi>Pericardiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But now Sir; becauſe I ſee you are ſo attentive, and ſeem to be much mov'd at this Diſcourſe, as I have diſcover'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the generall cauſe of our calamities, which was not onely a ſatiety, but a ſurfeit of happineſſe, ſo I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend now to a more particular cauſe of them; it was a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nation that brought theſe cataracts of miſchief: upon us; and you know the old ſaying,</p>

            <p>Far be it from me to charge the whole Nation herewith; no, but onely ſome pernicious Inſtruments that had inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated themſelfs, and incorporated among us, and ſway'd both in our Court and Counſells: They had a hand in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Monopoly; they had out of our Exchequer, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms neer upon 400000.

they wold bring our necks into their yoak, as if they had a greater talent of reaſon, &amp; cleerer illuminations, as if they underſtood Scripture better, and were better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God Almighty then we, who brought them firſt from Paganiſme to Chriſtianity, and alſo to be reformed Chriſtians: but it ſeems, matters have little thriven with them; nay the viſible hand of heaven hath bin heavily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them divers wayes ſince they did lift <hi>their</hi> hands againſt their <hi>native King;</hi> For notwithſtanding the vaſt ſumms they had hence, yet is the generality of them as beggarly as ever they were; beſides, the Civill Sword hath rag'd there as furiouſly as here, and did as much execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.

I preſently after awoke about the dawnings of the day, when one could hardly diſcern Dog from Wolf; and my ſoule, my <hi>Animula-vagula blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula,</hi> being re-entred through the Horn gate of ſleep into her former manſion, half tyr'd after ſo long a Peregrination; and having rub'd my eyes, diſtended my limms, and return'd to a full expergefaction, I began to call my ſelf to account touching thoſe world of objects my fancy had repreſented unto me that night; and when by way of reminiſence I fell to examine and ruminate upon them; Lord, what a maſſe of <hi>Ideas</hi> ran in my head! but when I call'd to mind the laſt Countrey my ſoule wandred in, me thought I felt my heart like a lump of lead within me, when I conſiderd how pat every circumſtance might be applied to the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>England:</hi> I was meditating with my ſelf what kind of dream this might be; whereupon I thought upon the common diviſion that Philoſophers make of dreames, that they are either<list>
                  <item>Divine,</item>
                  <item>Diabolicall,</item>
                  <item>Naturall, or</item>
                  <item>Humane.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, they are <hi>Viſions</hi> more properly or <hi>Revelations,</hi> whereof there are divers examples in the holy Oracles of God, but the puddled cranies of my brain are not roomes clean enough to entertain ſuch: Touching the ſecond kind, which com by the impulſes of the Devill, I have heard of divers of them, as when one did riſe up out of his ſleep, and fetcht a poyniard to ſtab his bedfellow, which he had don,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117298:11"/>
had he not bin awake; Another went to the next chamber abed to his mother, and wold have raviſh'd her; but I thank God this dream of mine was not of that kind? Touching the third ſpecies of dreames; which are <hi>naturall</hi> dreames, they are according to the humor which predominats; if Melancholy ſway, we dream of black darkſom devious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; if Phlegm, of waters; if Choler, of frayes, fightings and troubles; if Sanguin predominat, we dream of green fields, gardens, and other pleaſant repreſentations; and the Phyſitian comes often to know the quality of a diſeaſe by the nocturnall objects of the patients fancy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humane</hi> dreams relate to the actions of the day paſt, or of the day following, &amp; ſom repreſentations are clear &amp; even; others are amphibious, mongrell, diſtorted and ſqualid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, according to the ſpecies of things in troubled matters; and the object is cleer or otherwiſe, according to the tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or the groſſnes of the vapors which aſcend from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle up to the brain.</p>
            <p>Touching my dream, I think it was of this laſt kind; for I was diſcourſing of, and condoling the ſad diſtempers of our times the day before: I pray God ſom part of it prove not propheticall; for, although the Frenchman ſayeth, <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſont Menſonges,</hi> dreames are deluſions, and that they turn to contraries, yet the Spaniard hath a ſaying,</p>
            <lg>

            </lg>
            <p>Inſomuch that ſome Dreams oftentimes prove tru; as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> makes mention of a rich Merchant in <hi>Milan,</hi> who being dead, one of his Creditors comes to his ſon to demand ſuch a ſum of money which he had lent his father; the ſon was confident 'twas paid, but not finding the Creditors Receipt, he was impleaded and like to be caſt in the Sute, had not his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117298:11"/>
fathers Ghoſt appeared to him, and directed him to the place where the Acquittance was, which he found the next day accordingly. <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks of one that dreamt he had a wooden leg, and the next day he was taken with a dead Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in one whole ſide. Such a Dream was that of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> when he thought he had felt a cold guſt paſſing through his bowells; and the next day he was ſlain in the guts, by the glance of an arrow, in new Forreſt, a place where he and his Father had committed ſo many Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. I have read in <hi>Artimed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rus,</hi> of a woman that dreamt ſhe had ſeen the pictures of three faces in the Moone like her ſelf, and ſhe was brought to bed of three daughters a little after, who all died within the compas of a moneth. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreamt, that <hi>Xanthus</hi> water ran red, and the next day he fell a ſpitting of blood.</p>
            <p>To this I will add another fore-telling Dream, whereof I have read, which was thus: two young Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travelling abroad in ſtrange Countreyes, and being come to a great towne, the one lay far in the Citie, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an Hoſtry without the walls in the Suburbs: he in the City did dream in the dead of night, that his friend which he had left in the Suburbs ruſh'd into his chamber panting and blowing, being purſued by others; he dreamt ſo againe, and the third time he might ſee his friends Ghoſt appeering at his beds ſide with blood trickling down his throat, and a Poyniard in his breſt, telling him; Dear friend, I am come now to take my laſt farewell of thee, and if thou riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, thou ſhalt meet me in the way going to be buried; the next morning his friend going with his Hoſt towards the Inn in the Suburbs where he left his friend, they met with a Cart laden with dung in the way, which being ſtaid and ſearch'd, the dead body was found naked in the dung.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with a notable Dreame that <hi>Oſman</hi> the great Turk had, not many yeers ſince, a few dayes before the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117298:12"/>
was murthered by his Janizaries, 1623. He dreamt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted upon a huge Camell, he could not make him go, though he ſwitch'd and ſpur'd him never ſo much; at laſt the Camell overthrew him, and being upon the ground, onely the bridle was left in his hand, but the body of the Camell was vaniſhed: the <hi>Mufti</hi> not being illuminated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to interpret this Dream, a <hi>Santon</hi> who was a kind of Idiot, told him, the Camell repreſented the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> which he not being able to govern, he ſhould be o'erthrown, which two dayes after proved tru.</p>
            <p>By theſe, and a cloud of examples more, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Dreams are not altogether impertinent, but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be gathered out of them; though the application and meaning of them be denied to man, unleſſe by ſpeciall illumination.</p>

            <p>THus have you a rough account of a rambling <hi>Noctiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> up &amp; down the world: I may boldly ſay, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sir <hi>John Mandevile,</hi> or <hi>Coryat</hi> himſelf travell'd more in ſo ſhort a time: whence you ſee what nimble Poſtillions the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are; and with what incredible celerity the <hi>imagination</hi> can croſſe the <hi>Line,</hi> cut the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> and paſſe to the other <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> of the world; which ſhewes, that humane ſoules have ſomthing in them of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that their faculties have a kind of ubiquitary freedom, though the body be never ſo under reſtraint, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors is.</p>
