            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And two conſiderations eſpecially ſwaied mee
to write a fewe lines in this kinde. The firſt whereof is
the Authors great deſerts towards the Church of God;
great in teaching, great in writing. Many a man there
is, who hauing learnedly, iudiciouſly, and plainly taught
the truth of God, hauing taken heed to the Miniſterie
which hee receiued in the Lord, to fulfill it, and that
in preaching alone; not withſtanding he hath left his
memoriall bleſſed upon earth, euen in that regard and
naked reſpect. But if there bee one man of a great
companie, who as he taught religiouſly and powerfully
in his life, ſo beſides in his life he did write to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
edification of the Church, and yea alſo left after
his death other things to be publiſhed for the behoofe
of Gods Saints, without queſtion ſuch a worthy may
well haue double honour put vpon him. Many ſuch
deſeruing inſtruments, hath God raiſed vp in our
Church exceeding both for mouth, and penne: among
the laſt of which, the Author of this Sermon need not to
<pb facs="tcp:19667:4"/>
be ranked.<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 31.</note> 
               <hi>His workes praiſe him in the gates</hi> as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon

and third, nay the fift and ſixt editions of certaine
Treatiſes written by him, though in a dumb, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
with a mouing rhetorick, ſpeake effectually to his
commandation. In the ſecond place, that did not a little
encourage me, that this Sermon (if much affection haue
not dazled ſome eies) may well bee eſteemed amongſt
one of the cheife he did deliuer. It was preached in a
famous Vniuerſitie, in a moſt learned, &amp; ful auditory,
it was heard with attention (his godly voice, &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
geſture enliuening the hearers:) afterwards it was
ſpoken of with reuerence and affection; as both hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, and hearing of it, I can truely auouch, it was his
farewell Sermon to his Mother Vniuerſitie, although
not (I ſupoſe) in the Authors intent, yet in the euent:
the Lord often directing matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwiſe then for
the preſent wee dreame of. Receiue therefore Chriſtian
Reader this Sermon, ſound for edification, ſweete for
application, ſhewing Miniſters thier duty, ſhewing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19667:6"/>
cannot containe it; ſometimes againe, it falles
backe ſo low, that a man muſt goe farre from the
banke before hee can come neere it. It is (vnder
God) chiefly gouerned by the Moone, then the

            <p>The Doctrine now deliuered, affoords a

much vncertaintie, ſo much confuſion and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſuch oppreſſion and cruelty, where the Diuell
beareth ſuch exceeding ſway; what is there to be
found worth delighting in? A man imagines
himſelfe ſure in reſpect of his outward eſtate; at

Marke and conſider, oh ye men of the earth, all

it is euen a very Sea of vncertainties

the very hold &amp; kingdome of the diuell. We hunt

got it? or what haue we procured to our ſelues,
but vanitie and vexation of ſpirit? The further we
wade into it, the further are we from the Lord:
for <hi>the amitie of the World is the enmitie of God</hi>

            <p>THe next thing is touching the Church: <hi>The

               <note place="margin">The ſtate of the Church in this world, compared to a ſhip or boat vpon the Sea.</note> And that eſpecially in this

            <p>Of Trauailers by Sea it is ſaid, that they are
toſſed too and fro, and ſtagger like drunken men,
and all their cunning is gone<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 107 27</note>. Not vnlike to
this is the ſtate and condition of Gods Church.
It fareth with it, as with the Ship <hi>Ionas</hi> was in;
There was a mightie tempeſt in the Sea, ſo that
the Ship was like to be broken<note n="i" place="margin">Chap. 1. 4.</note>: or which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were in; There aroſe a great tempeſt in the
Sea, ſo that the Ship was couered with waues<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 8. 24.</note>.
Such was the ſtate of the Church of old, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
whereof complained, how <hi>the waters had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
drowned them, and the ſtreame had gone ouer
their ſoule</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 124. 4.</note>. And <hi>Dauid</hi> as a man experienced in

ſuch ſtormes, cryeth out to God<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 69. 1.</note>, <hi>Saue me, for the

take mee out of the great waters</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 144 7.</note>. And as it was
with the Ship in which <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo exceedingly
hazarded, <hi>that they ſaw neither Sunne nor Starres in
many daies</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 27. 20.</note>: ſo the Church of God, is often dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
into that extremitie, that it is for a time, euen
depriued of all ordinary comfort, and ſeemes to
bee without all hope of any more refreſhing.
Hence are theſe complaints of the Church, <hi>O God
why haſt thou put vs away for euer? Why is thy
wrath kindled againſt the ſheepe of thy paſture?
thinke vpon thy congregation &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 74. 1 2.</note>; and <hi>wilt thou be

               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 85. 5. 6</note>. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> as a trauailer in

               <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal 77. 7.</note>? And

               <note n="t" place="margin">Act. 14. 22.</note>; God hath ſo appointed for his owne

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the troubles of his Church and the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his people, do make his power and mercy
to be knowne; euen as the skill of a Pilot, is moſt

through weakeneſſe</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 9.</note>. The Lord bringeth matters
to an exigent, and ſuffereth them to come to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19667:9"/>
very brinke of hazard, that ſo his might and
goodneſſe in the deliuery of his ſeruants may be
the more apparent. When the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
was in a wonderfull ſtrait, the Sea before them,
the mountaines on both ſides, the enemyes at

            <p>2. For their good: firſt, It makes them to
looke vpward with the greater feruency. <hi>Dauid</hi>
ſayth of ordinary paſſengers by Sea, that when
<hi>they mount vp to the heauen, and deſcend to the deepe,

cry vnto the Lord in their trouble &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 107. 28.</note>. The Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

were they vpon their knees, <hi>and euery man cryed
vnto his God</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ioans 1. 5.</note>. And ſo the ſwelling waues of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,

of Gods ſeruants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <note n="a" place="margin">Hoſea 5. 15.</note>. Secondly, it makes them long ſo

it makes the deliuerance when it comes to be

which comes at the very pinch of neceſſity. The

               <hi>redeeming of Dauids life from the graue,</hi> the rayſing

what they muſt make prouiſion for, if they will
be ſaued. By their profeſſion, they are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church of God, not as into a Garden of

               <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 12. 19.</note>; but as into a Ship, a houſe of
continuall motion, where though there may be
calmeneſſe for a time, the Sun ſhining out, the
winds layd, and the Sea ſmooth, yet it is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to be in continuall expectation of a ſtorme.
God hath not called vs vnto caſe and quiet, but
to the croſſe. Many things are to be endured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our ſetting out here, and our arriuall at the
Land of Promiſe. Many ſtormes to bee gone
through, many rocks and ſands to be aduentured
by, many Pirats ſeeking the ſpoyle of our ſoules
to be grapled with, before the hauen of Reſt can
be entred into. The ignorance, or the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this point hath deceiued many. They
may thus fitly be ſhadowed out. Some freſh tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailer
ſtanding vpon the ſhore in a faire day, and
beholding the Ships in their beautie lye readie
rigged and trimmed in the Harbor, thinks it a
gallant thing to goe to Sea, and will need aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but being out a league or two, and feeling by
the rocking of the Ship his ſtomacke begin to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19667:10"/>
worke and grow ſicke, and his ſoule euen to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
all manner of meat; or otherwiſe a ſtorme
to ariſe, the wind and the water as it were conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ouerthrow of the veſſell, and euery ſea
carrying in it the face of death; forthwith repents
his folly, and makes vowes, that if he can once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the ſhore, he will bid an eternall farewell
vnto all ſuch voyages. Thus, there be who in the
calme dayes of peace, when Religion is not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clowded
by the times, that will needs ioyne
themſelues to the number of Gods people, they
will be as earneſt and forward as the beſt. But
when a tempeſt begins to appeare, and the Sea to
grow rougher then at the firſt entry, the times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
trouble is rayſed, and many croſſe winds of
much oppoſition and gainſaying begin to blow,
they are weary of their courſe, and will needs be
ſet aſhore againe, reſoluing neuer to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
into any more aduentures. How needfull
then is it that Chriſtians ſhould often remember,
how by Chriſts ſpeech here, the Church is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
reſembled to a Ship? enter not into it, to be
a guide or a paſſenger, a Miniſter, or a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
vnleſſe thou reſolutely make prouiſion for a
ſtorme. Till the end of the voyage there is no reſt
to be looked for: wherein notwithſtanding this
may be for a comfort, that this Ship (the Church
of God) hath a priuiledge which none hath elſe,
no not the greateſt Gallioun or Argoſy vnder

               <hi>Though the waters of the ſea rage and bee

               <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 5.</note>. It is as the Arke

            <p>The ſecond vſe ſerues to teach vs (becauſe the

ſuch things as appertaine to this ſpirituall voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:<note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2</note>
not to inſiſt vpon many, two things eſpecially
muſt be looked too. Firſt, That we be diligent in
obſeruing the direction appointed by God, for
the true guidance of our courſe. The Sea-men
haue their Card and their Compaſſe, they haue
the Sun and Stars, and the motions of heauen to
direct them. That which our courſe muſt be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by is the word of God; it is like the pillar that
went before the hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the
mouing or ſtanding whereof they ordered all
their iourneyes. Hither may be referred that of
<hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">2. Epiſt. 1. 19.</note>, <hi>We haue a moſt ſure word of the Prophets, to
which ye do well that ye take heed, as vnto a light that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19667:11"/>
ſhineth in a darke place.</hi> It is an alluſion to a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
when the Admirall hangs out a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne,
and all that come behind ſteere to that. We
cannot wander if we be led by this light: It is that
good Spirit which <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed <hi>to be led by vnto
the land of righteouſneſſe</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 143. 10.</note>. What other Load-ſtar
of cuſtome, or opinion or faſhion of the times
men attend vpon, they muſt needs run vpon the
rocks and make ſhipwrack of the faith. Secondly,
That we take with vs the knowledge and faith of
Gods promiſes. It is called <hi>the Anchor, Hebr.</hi> 6. 19.
This is our ſtay, in the day of tempeſt; <hi>I know
whom I haue belieued</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 12.</note>: ſuch an one <hi>cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
for his heart is fixed, and belieueth in the Lord</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 112. 7.</note>.
The promiſes being either not knowne or not
applied, the ſoule is toſſed without reſt, and muſt
needs be ouerwhelmed with deſpaire. This <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor</hi>
being tyed to the ſoule by the ſtrong <hi>cable</hi> of
a li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely faith, giues comfort vnto it in the greateſt
ſtorme.</p>
            <p>THE third thing is concerning the ſtate of
men.<note place="margin">The ſtate of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by nature compared to fiſhes in the Sea, ranging after their owne diſpoſi io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>
               <hi>That we are all by nature in the ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
This is cleere out of this place. By this <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,</hi>
or <hi>catching</hi> (the very ſubſtance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
office) is meant, <hi>a bringing of men into the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19667:12"/>
way of life.</hi> Now then, in as much as we are all by
nature vncaught (otherwiſe why ſhould Chriſt
ſend out his Apoſtles to take vs?) it followeth,
that we are all by nature without grace, euen in
the very gulfe and iawes of eternall woe. This is
eaſily prooued by the Scriptures; <hi>All fleſh hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
his way vpon the earth</hi>

            <p>And well in this are we compared vnto the
fiſh: For as the fiſhes skippe and play and take
their pleaſure in the ſea, and are vnwillingly taken
in the net, and labour to get out, and being in the
boate, would faine, if they could, leape backe into
the ſea; ſo naturally wee take pleaſure in our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wayes. <hi>It is a pastime for a foole to do wickedly</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Prou 10 23.</note>.
The net of the Goſpell muſt encloſe vs; of our
ſelues we abhor it, and to the death will not come
within the compaſſe of it; and being entangled,
we deſire ſtill to be looſed, and to returne againe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19667:12"/>
vnto our wonted courſe. This is the verie true
ſtate of vs all. We neither are in the ſtate of grace
by nature, neither doe we deſire it. We be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into a ſea of miſerie, and in our owne diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we would neuer forſake it.</p>
            <p>It were well for vs, if we could learne by this to
ſee our ſelues what we be, and what we would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be, if we were leſt to the ſwinge of our owne
affections. Nature hath (as it were) ſpawned vs
forth into this worldly ſea: and as it ſelfe <hi>lieth in
wickedneſſe</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Iohn 5 19</note>, <hi>ſo do we drinke iniquitie like water</hi>

meanes of our ſaluation, nor affect it when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
Either the Scripture is falſe, or this is true.
How happy were we if this could humble vs! it
would make vs afrayd of following our owne
thoughts, or of being led by the ſway of our owne
hearts. Our not knowing the miſerie of our owne
eſtate, is the cauſe of all the ſecuritie, of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe,
of all the boldneſſe in ſinne, of all the
contempt of Gods word which is in the world at
this day. This place among others, is as a glaſſe to
ſhew vs what wee are; ſtrangers from ſaluation,
and as farre from anie inclination to it as a fiſh is

            <p>THe fourth thing is of the ſtate of the Miniſter.<note place="margin">The ſtate of miniſters, who be as Fiſhers.</note>
Heere are two things: Firſt, the ſtate of the

Miniſterie: Secondly, the labour, buſineſſe and
worke of the Miniſterie. Of the firſt thus we ſee:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is no ſuperfluous or needeleſſe function,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>but a
calling of great neceſsitie for the winning and ſauing of
mens ſoules.</hi> This is cuident out of this place. The
Lord intending the conuerſion of ſome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able diuers waies to accompliſh his purpoſe in
that behalfe, yet hath thought it good to ſingle
out this meanes among all the reſt, euen by man
to catch man, and by his miniſterie to bring ſoules
into his Kingdome. This is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

who thinke, that among all the profeſſions
which are at this day in the world, that of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie may
beſt be ſpared. It is ſtrongly thought
by many, that it were no danger or preiudice to
mens ſoules, though there were no Miniſter at all
to inſtruct them. O ſay ſome, what neede they
trouble themſelues? Euerie man muſt anſwer for
his owne ſoule; and if we do not as we ſhould, we
ſhall beare the blame.</p>
            <p>Thus they would ſhift off all dependance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ordinance of God, and lay an imputation
of ſuperfluitie vpon that calling, by which it is the
pleaſure of God to ſaue thoſe that beleeue. This
one place is ſufficient to ſtop their mouth; For I
may truly auouch it out of the words heere, that
(ordinarily) there is no more hope of a mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
without an able and induſtrious Miniſter,
then there is that the fiſh in the Sea will of it ſelfe

            <p>It meeteth with two euills in Miniſters; firſt,
the idleneſſe which hath ouertaken ſome that are

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</hi>

I take no pleaſure in laying open the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of men of mine owne coate: yet God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that I ſhould vſe my tongue to the licking of
their ſores, which prooue the very bane of Gods
Church, and doe make it lie like the field of the
ſluggard, or as the garden of the idler. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the ſpirit of greedineſſe which (is to be feared)
is in many. <hi>They can neuer haue enough &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 56. 11.</note>. They
goe out to catch, yet not ſoules to God, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:19667:14"/>
people, who account the Miniſters calling to be
an idle and a lazie calling; we get our liuings ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
in the conceit of ſome, and it is no ſinne nor
pitty (in their vnderſtanding) to defraud vs; and
how vſuall is it in the mouthes of many, to ſay,
Wee muſt labour for them? I confeſſe, that as
ſome vſe it, it is a calling of exceſſiue idleneſſe, if
they be ſuch as <hi>feede themſelues, and feede not
the flockes</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ezech. 34. 1</note>, ſuch as take <hi>away the key of Knowledge</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Lu. 11. 52.</note>;
but conſider it in it owne nature, and as it ought
to be performed, we ſhall finde it to be a ſeruice
of greater buſineſſe. Let <hi>Peter,</hi> or anie ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
of <hi>Peter</hi> buſie himſelfe (as he muſt) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

is a Miniſter, therefore he hath an eaſie occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <note n="f" place="margin">Matt. 28. 19.</note>, <hi>of Declaring the

               <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 21. 15.</note>:
and Chriſt himſelfe compareth the Goſpell to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19667:15"/>
net<note n="i" place="margin">Matt. 13. 47.</note>. The compariſon agreeth fitly after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
            <p>The preaching of the Goſpell is like to a net;
firſt, in the generall driſt and vſe: the vſe of a net
is to take fiſh: the drift of preaching is to bring in
ſoules. Secondly, in the ordering of it: It is not
the net lapped vp together that bringeth in the
draught, but haled out at length and ſpread forth
that encloſeth the fiſh: It is the opening and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
of the Goſpell, the ſtretching it out by
preaching which doth encompaſſe ſoules. There
may a fiſh or two hang in the net being let downe
on a heape, but that is a chaunce, and is no wiſe
aduenturing. The word read, and ſo brought in
(as it were) in groſſe, may (by the mercy of God)
take ſome; but we haue no warrant from hence to
make a rule generall. Againe, it is neede that the
nette be ſtrong, otherwiſe the greater kinde will
breake through, and make all the labour and
charge to be in vaine; ſo it is meete that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
be well ſtrengthened out of the word of
God, that it be well prooued, that it be well preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and applyed, that the conſciences of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
may be conuicted, and that they may ſee it
is God, and not man with whom they haue to do.
For a man ſhall meete with many froward and
wilfull and violent natures, that will not be held
in, but when they feele themſelues within the net
will cry, <hi>Let vs breake thier bands, and cast their
cords from vs</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 2. 3.</note>; ſo that euen a kinde of violence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19667:15"/>
may be vſed to keep them from deſtruction. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the ſucceſſe of it. Many a draught the poore
Fiſherman makes and taketh nothing, yet he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not off: many a time is the net of preaching
ſhot forth, and yet none conuerted thereby: ſo it
pleaſeth God to exerciſe the patience of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants;
yet ſtill the worke muſt be followed, and
the Lords leiſure muſt be waited for. Often doth
the net incloſe many, which yet after breake away;
and many are at firſt drawne in by the power of
the Goſpell, which yet afterwards ſlide backe and
returne againe to their old profaneneſſe. There is
much brought in in the Net, which yet is good
for nothing when it is got: There come in frogs,
and weeds, and a great deale of traſh, which in the
end is caſt away, though for the loue of the fiſh
there were no little paines in drawing it in: ſo, as it
is ſhewed <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 47. &amp;c. many hypocrites and
reprobates are gathered into the outward ſocietie
of the Church by preaching, and ſo are let alone
like weedes vntill the day of harueſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 30.
Thus as our calling is to be fiſhers, ſo our Net is
preaching.</p>
            <p>It ſhewes plainely,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> that all the enemies and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
of preaching, are enemies to the good
and ſaluation of mens ſoules. This is the Net, and
without this I will not feare to ſay, that ſurely
men ſhall periſh in their ſinnes. The diuell that
great hunter after ſoules, laboureth by his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
euen with the very ſpirit of his helliſh poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19667:16"/>
to diſgrace this courſe, to ſuppreſſe it, to put
it downe, to draw men from affecting it. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to be the meanes to abridge his kingdome,
he feareth the pulling of ſome ſoule or other out
of his clutches at euery Sermon. Let vs not ſuffer
our ſelues to be coſined by his wiles. Let me that
am a Miniſter remember the Seruice I am called
to, euen to <hi>catch men,</hi> to win ſoules, let me be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
plying this buſineſſe; and you <hi>(Beloued)</hi> when
the Lords Net is caſt in among you, run not from
it, grudge not at it, preſſe and ſtriue to be brought
within the compaſſe of it, otherwiſe you ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
within the ſea of this world ſtill, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be ſaued. Fiſhes doe die if they be taken; wee
can not eſcape eternall death if we be not caught.
The hooke may be ſharpe, but the baite is ſweet,
and it will ſeeme a yoake to our nature, to be knit
vp (as in a Net) and to be reſtrained from our
owne wonted carnall liberty; but let vs
looke to the end, which is the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of our ſoules.
