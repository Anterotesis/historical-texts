            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the Contagious time did dissipate us a while, and it hath pleased the mighty and Almighty God to recollect us againe, let us unanimously concurre in ratifying, determining, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the weighty affaires of this Kingdome: for it is not unknowne to you all, what Plots, &amp;; formidable Conspiracies have beene invented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our <hi>Brethren the Scots, who are blessedly convented in that Assembly:</hi> and God knowes, what Stratagems are now plotted against our
<pb facs="tcp:96703:3"/>
selves. Therefore J acknowledge it very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and requisit, that all our consultations bee firmely concatenated, in the indissoluble linke of unanimity.</p>
            <p>The Papists have beene alwayes mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our State, and especially to our Religion, and if they be not prevented with the expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Justice, I feare they will adde constructive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their former intentions.</p>
            <p>They swarme most confusedly in our streets, daily studying to subvert, and fully eradicate the true Reformation of Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>And their hourely intent is to supplant the Foundation of our pious Lawes, and to diffuse aspersions upon our Church. They expalliate their knaverie, and have done so a long time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, thankes be to God, they have now beene discovered, and many of their Stratagems appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently demonstrated, to the publique Spectacle of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You know in what danger our Scottish Brethren were incident unto;</hi> Therefore, I beseech you, lay it to your serious cogitations, and if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let us labour to prevent their Treason-grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malice. It hath bin oftentimes moved unto us, to expell them utterly from our Dominions, but as yet we have not enacted it.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I pray God we may confirme that first motion, and what wee have heretofore in action conceived fit, let us now indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For I am confident hereof, that our State,
<pb facs="tcp:96703:3"/>
and Commonwealth cannot be secure, untill we exenterate those deadly Exulcerators of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In the meane while, give me leave to pause. — And now J thinke on't, we have a second crew, and but a little inferiour to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>I meane the Separatists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the new crept in <hi>Caterpillars</hi> of our <hi>Kingdome,</hi> who by their private malice doe as much contaminate the purity of Religion, as the former. Alas! can we not keepe the middle way? can we not walke in the middle, and secure path of piety, but we must thus variously deviate; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther swelling too high in <hi>Papisticall opinions,</hi> or else sinking too low in <hi>Brownisticall Heresies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that wee had a second <hi>Cicero</hi> to cry out againe, <hi>O tempora! O mores!</hi> The Poets feigned that <hi>Phaeton,</hi> when he neglected the middle way, wherein his Father did direct him, <hi>was inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently destroyed with a praecipitious ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mythologie</hi> and <hi>Affabulation</hi> hereof, may agree with our times; <hi>for there may be a Golden Morall contained in a leaden Fable:</hi> And I doubt, if we likewise neglect the middle, and true ground of <hi>Religion,</hi> all things will turne into a suddaine confusion; for according to the Poet, <hi>Medio tutissimus ibis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96703:4"/>
But stay! what should the cause be of these in digested Distractions of Impurity. I conceive there is some proper, and peculiar Author of ale these malignities. For according to the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers rule, <hi>Nullus effectus datur sine causa;</hi> there can be no effect without a cause naturally: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I imagine, but that our corrupted springs of Piety doe flow from one polluted Fountaine.</p>
            <p>You know my meaning, my mentall reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion includes <hi>Canterburry,</hi> that incendiary of this <hi>Kingdome:</hi> therefore let us not deferre or procrastinate the businesse any longer, but call him to an <hi>Answer,</hi> with all possible expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath hanged as Abrahams Ram in the Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars a long time: therefore I thinke it high-time now to sacrifice him on his owne Altar.</hi>

               </gap> beseech you, take all these precedent premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses into your serious; and grave considerations, and let not this Kingdome, which hath a long time languished in various, and erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, be any longer frustrated of the peacefull expectations of all men.</p>
            <p>Once more, I beseech you, let us proceed in our determinations begun; for the whole Nation depends upon us:  therefore I crave your judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous resolutions herein.</p>
