            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Hebr. IX. 27, 28.</bibl>
               <q>And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is appointed unto men once to die, but
after this the Judgment; So Christ was once
offered to bear the sins of many, and unto
them that look for him shall he appear the

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>MAN is born to die, and he dies in
order to his last Judgment. This
is an hard Sentence; but the
latter part of the Text mollifies
it;</hi> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
many, and unto them that look for him shall
he appear the second time, without sin, unto
salvation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is terrible, but the <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
is comfortable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scope</hi> of the Apostle in this Chapter
is to prove that the Sacrifice of Christ exceeds
in worth and merit all the Sacrifices of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30493:3"/>
Law. And one Argument is this, That the
Sacrifice of Christ was so perfect, that it needs
not to be repeated; But whereas the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Law were offered by the High-Priest
yearly, our Lord Jesus by one single
oblation of himself hath obtained eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
for us. And this Argument is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated
in the words of my Text; As men
die once, so Christ died once for men; for
his death was equivalent to many deaths:
And as men after death must appear to be
judged, so Jesus Christ after his death shall
appear to judge men. He shall die no more,
but when-ever he appears again, it shall be to
judge the world, and to save his Elect. This
proves the vertue and merit of his death; for
if Christ by his death had not wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
himself from the imputation of sin,
he must have been a Prisoner, and not a
Judge.</p>
            <p>Now as the words shew us the <hi>sufficiency</hi>
of Christs mediation, so in the second place
the <hi>suitableness</hi> thereof to those estates
whereunto all mankind is ordained. We
must all die of necessity, we must all come to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30493:3"/>
Judgment; but this we have for our comfort,
Jesus Christ is gone before us in Death, and
will meet us in the day of Judgment</p>
            <p>And from hence we raise this Observation.</p>
            <p>Those last,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> inevitable, and dreadful estates of
Death and Judgment are sanctified and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to all true Believers by the precious Death
and glorious Appearance of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Death and Judgment are the terrors of
mankind, but they are consecrated into bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and comforts by the death of Christ, and
the appearance of Christ.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine falls into two Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Jesus Christ hath sanctified to us a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
estate by his own Death.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. He will sweeten to us our day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by his own Appearance.</p>
            <p>To begin with the first.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> We are all subject to a state of death, and
that, not by hap or chance, but by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the living God.</p>
            <p>It is appointed unto men once to die.</p>
            <p>1. In Gods secret and everlasting Decree.</p>
            <p>2. In that express Decree, <hi>Gen. 3. 19. Dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</hi> God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30493:4"/>
hath said it, and hath performed his word in
all ages; So that we must needs dye, and are
as water spilt upon the ground.</p>
            <p>Now seeing we cannot possibly avoid a
dying condition, let us see how we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
it. And truly if we look back upon its
first Institution, and the occasion of it, we
shall find it to be full of malignity and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness.</p>
            <p>For what is death, but the curse of the
great God upon rebellious man, the bitter
fruit of sin, a period to all earthly comforts,
and the beginning of an everlasting Hell?
Death destroys vital union, dissolves the knot
of natural Relations, divorces the wife from
her husband, pulls the child out of his fathers
bosom; it marrs the greatest beauties, stains
the pride of earthly glory; it degrades the
Honourable, binds the strong, beggars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
rich; it casts us out of our houses and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
disappoints our earthly expectations;
In a word, it rends a man asunder, and sends
part of him into the prison of the Grave; and
the other part into the dungeon of Hell.
And now what will ye do in the day of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30493:4"/>
How will you save your selves? To
whom will ye flee for help, and where will
you leave your glory? Can your hearts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
or your hands be made strong in the day
that the great God shall deal with you? O
unhappy Mortals, that are born to such mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who have no sooner entred a single life,
but are liable to a double death!</p>
            <p>And surely if the Son of God had not died
in our Nature, we should envy the condition
of Toads and Serpents; we should curse the
day of our birth, and tremble before the day
of our death. <hi>But Christ was once offered to
bear the sins of many.</hi> This offering hath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
our state of mortality. For as it is
appointed to men once to die, so Jesus Christ
was appointed to die once for men. He died
once,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> that we might not die ever. The blood
of God was an acceptable sacrifice to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God. Infinite blood hath satisfied
infinite Justice. So that wheresoever this
blood is sprinkled, it redeems the soul to
God, even from the hand of all her enemies.
Particularly death threatned us with Hell and
Damnation; But now the death of Christ is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30493:5"/>
               <hi>the plagues of our death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and the peace of our
souls.</hi> And what is it now for us to die, but
to pass into the bosom of a reconciled God,
to leave the world, and to go to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>We die still, yet it is upon a new account.
As good <hi>Josiah,</hi> though he died in blood, yet
he went down into the grave in peace. The
sentence of death, though it be still passed
upon us, yet its commission is altered through
Christ. Before it was a Serjeant to carry us
to the dark and dreadful prison of Hell; but
now it is as it were a Porter to set open Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-gates
for us. Death hath a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and a new aspect by vertue of the
death of Christ.</p>

sting of death; 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56. The sting of
death is sin.</hi> Guilt is the vigour of death.
Guilt and sin makes death to be venomous
and deadly; But a Child of God dies not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of sin, neither in his sin, nor
for his sin. <hi>Christ was offered up to bear our
sins.</hi> That was the business of Christs death,
to be a sacrifice for sin. But our death is a
service, not a sacrifice. This is enough to
make our death tolerable; 'tis no punishment
for our sins.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Christ by his death hath taken away the
Curse of our death. Death at the first was
threatned as a Curse, and as an Instrument of
Gods revenging Justice.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>But Jesus Christ by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30493:6"/>
suffering the cursed death of the Cross, hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away the curse of our death.</hi> Here is more
comfort for us, Christians; death is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed
with the wrath of God; It is no

Curse, but only a rougher sort of love.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Jesus Christ hath taken off the shame of
a dying condition. Death was a shameful
penalty inflicted upon ambitious man, that
would needs have been a God. Death was
sent to reproach him, to stain the pride of his
glory. But our Lord cloathed himself with
our shame, you know, how he was buffeted,
derided, spit upon, crowned with thorns, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed
with mock-apparel. Why was this?
but to take off the reproach of our sufferings,
and the shame of our death.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Jesus Christ by his agonies and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,
and terrible sufferings, hath freed us
from the terrour of death. There is a fear of
death arising from the natural constitution of
man; this is a guiltless infirmity, which all
are subject to. But then there is a slavish fear
of death, as it is penal, as it is an issue of the

For when the world disquiets us, pains tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>You see, my Beloved, what an innocent
thing death is; you may touch it, handle it,
converse with it, it will do you no hurt. It
is but a necessary Ceremony and Formality,
through which we must pass into everlasting

               <hi>Death is yours.</hi> Dear Christians,
<hi>All are yours;</hi> And as the Ministers of the
Gospel are yours, and the world is yours,
and life is yours, so death is yours; yours
in Covenant, yours to serve you. If ye
are Christs, death is yours; but if you are
not Christs, you are Deaths, you are deaths
prisoners; but in Christ we are deaths Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
For all true Believers, though they
have not made a Covenant with death, yet
they have death in the Covenant. We call
death a Debt of Nature, but to us it is the
gift of God; A Legacy rather than an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
A Priviledge rather than a Burden. It
is a conquered Enemy, and is become Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. It gives us rest from all our labours.
<hi>Rev. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead that die in
the Lord, for they rest from their labours.</hi>
These are our working days, our <hi>dies profesti,</hi>
the days of our toil and pilgrimage; <hi>But there
remains a rest for the people of God, Heb.</hi> 4. 9.
There remains a Sabbatism (as it is in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30493:7"/>
Original.) And death is the evening of our
everlasting Sabbath.</p>
            <p>Here Gods people are labouring under sin,
and against sin, under temptations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
temptations, in their heavenly Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and in their earthly Callings. But
then these weary Pilgrims shall be at rest,
when their souls shall be lodged in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of Christ, and their bodies shall rest in a
bed of earth. Our souls shall rest in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and our flesh shall rest in Hope.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Death enters us into our Masters joy,
into the presence of God, where there is the
fulness of joy. Here the Children of the
Bride-chamber are fasting and mourning for
the absence of the Bridegroom. Here <hi>they
hang their Harps upon the Willows, and how
can they sing songs in a strange land?</hi> But when
once they come into their Lords presence,
they shall break forth into singing; Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joy shall be upon their heads, sorrow and
sighing shall flye away.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. To die is gain. For it perfects our
knowledge, Grace and Communion with
God. Alas, here we know but in part. The

The Apostle tells us, <hi>We are but children, we
think as children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9, 11.</note> 
               <hi>we discourse as children;</hi> but
when we are grown up to a full stature in
Christ, when we are once got to Heaven, <hi>we
shall put away these childish things.</hi> Then
we shall see God as he is, and know him as
we are known, and shall behold his face in
righteousness, and shall be satisfied with his
likeness. Then our Faith shall end in vision, and
our Hope in fruition, and our Graces shall be
perfected in glory. Our love shall burn, our
zeal shall flame, our holiness shall shine; Then
our peace shall be as a river, and our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
as the waves of the Sea. Then we
shall have perfect, immediate, uninterrupted
Communion with God.</p>
            <p>This it is to die in the Lord.</p>
            <p>But after death comes Judgment.<note place="margin">II. Part of the Doctr.</note> There
is a vain Argument that <hi>Lactantius</hi> confutes;
<hi>Epicurus</hi> slighted death upon this account,
because said he, <q>Whilst we are, death is not;
and when death is, we are not; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
death is nothing to us.</q> But this man
erred, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the
power of God: For after death comes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30493:8"/>
wherein the souls and bodies of men
being re-united, all Nations, Tribes, and
Languages shall appear before the living God
to give an account of their lives, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their final sentence. Now it is the
dreadfulness of the day of Judgment, that
makes the day of Death so terrible. And
the poor guilty soul was not more loth to
part with her body in the day of Death, than
she shall be to re-enter it in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the Lord Jesus shall appear from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with his mighty Angels in flaming fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>to
take vengeance on all those that know not God,
and obey not the Gospel of Christ,</hi> where then
will guilty sinners appear? Or where will
you hide your selves from the presence of the
Lamb? Alas, there will be no possibility of
escaping his terrible presence; you shall see
him coming in the Clouds, you shall hear him
pronouncing your dreadful Doom, you shall
feel him pressing down your souls with the
power of his wrath.</p>
            <p>But <hi>fear not, little flock;</hi> for your Enemies
shall not sit in Judgment; when you shall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30493:9"/>
come upon tryal for your lives, to have your
everlasting estate determined: It is your
Friend, your Brother, your Advocate that
shall be your Judge: 'Tis he that led you by
the hand through the valley of death, that
shall meet you in the day of Judgment. Then
you shall say, <hi>Lo, this is our God,</hi> our Jesus,
we have waited for him, and he will save us.
Then the object of our Faith shall be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Sight. Him whom our souls have
loved, and longed for, we shall see with
these eyes of ours in that day; We shall see
him coming in the clouds with power and
great glory, we shall see him not with scorn,
but with admiration, not with trembling, but
with rejoycing.</p>
            <p>Christs first Appearance was very mean.
He appeared as the Son of man, or rather as
<hi>a worm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 22. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>a reproach of men; all that saw him
laughed him to scorn.</hi> But hereafter he shall
appear as the God of all glory, and the
Judge of quick and dead. In the days of
his flesh he appeared as a Prisoner at <hi>Pilates</hi>
Bar, and as a Malefactor on the Cross; then
indeed he stood charged with the sins of all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30493:9"/>
his people, but in the day of Judgment he
shall appear without sin unto their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The glorious presence of the Lord, that
shall be as a devouring Fire to consume his
Enemies, shall be a warm Sun to refresh his
Saints. And that day, that shall be a day of
terrour to guilty sinners, shall be to us a day
of refreshing from the presence of the Lord.</p>
            <p>It's wonderful to think, what infinite ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and priviledges shall be conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us (poor dust and ashes) in that day. How
we shall be caught up in a Chariot of clouds,
and shall meet the Lord in the air, where we
shall receive kind salutations from him, and
smiles, and blessings, and acknowledgments
of service, and Crowns of glory, and shall be
made his Assessors whiles he is judging the
world, and after all this, shall attend him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>This day of Life, is a day of Trouble; but

the day of Judgment, is a day of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
            <p>This is a day of Confession, but that is a

               <hi>but in the Lords day</hi> we shall judge the

            <p>O most blessed day, that ever shone, being
thus enlightned by the bright and glorious
Appearance of the Sun of Righteousness!</p>
            <p>Now if Death and Judgment are thus
sweetned,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> and blessedly altered through
Christ, as you have heard; then O how happy
are the Saints departed. <hi>Rev. 1413. Blessed are
the dead which dye in the Lord from henceforth.</hi>
They are Blessed from henceforth; Here
their Blessedness commences, even in this same
point which puts a period to their sins and
sorrows. And the Spirit of God bid his
<hi>Amanuensis</hi> write it down, as a remarkable
note, that a Christians Blessedness takes date
from the time of his death. Till then he was
a wretched sufferer under a body of death,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30493:10"/>
and a mass of corruption, but now he is a
blessed Triumpher. His sins have left him,
his good works follow him, and Heaven
affords him Rest.</p>
            <p>I confess, 'tis a common Errour among the
worst of men, that when they die, they shall
be at rest; and in their pains, they will wish
to die, that they may go to rest. But alas,
'tis only those that die in the Lord, that shall
rest from their labours. Cursed are they
that die out of the Lord, that die in the old
<hi>Adam</hi> only, and upon the old score. I have
spoke nothing all this while in favour of the
unregenerate; Let them not boast with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag,</hi>
surely the bitterness of death is past, for
death will hew them in pieces, as the unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Executioner of Divine Justice.<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 24.</note> They
that die out of Christ, die in all the sins that
ever they have committed. Those dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
words which our Saviour spoke to the
Pharisees,<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 21.</note> will reach them—<hi>Ye shall die in
your sins; and whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi>
Their dying, alas, what is it but a going to
Hell?</p>
            <p>As the rich Glutton, when he died, the next
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30493:11"/>
news that we hear of him is, that he is in Hell;
The Devil did not make him roar till he had
him there. Death stings a wicked man, and
leaves its sting in him, and casts all its venom
upon him.</p>
            <p>A wicked man is a great loser by his death;
he loses all he is worth, he loses his Heaven
here, his Paradise, and his hearts delight;
Death sends him into another world begging.
And he that had his Cups of Wine here,
would there be glad of Drops of Water. He
is a great sufferer by his death; for it is the
Devils Trap, wherein he takes his soul; it is
the Door of Hell, which lets him into that
abhorred place of everlasting Torments.</p>
            <p>But, O how safe and quiet are those that
are fallen asleep in Jesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are resting
securely, they are unconcerned in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
affairs and changes of this life: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
disturbs their rest.<note place="margin">Isa. 63. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham is ignorant
of us,</hi> saith the Church; but he is Acquainted
with God and Christ, and that is sufficient.
He is ignorant of us and our Calamities, but
he is sensible of his own Mercies.</p>
            <p>Alas, here can be no perfect happiness on
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30493:11"/>
this side death; <hi>for whiles we are present with

            </p>
            <p>It was excellently spoke of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
               <q>Whiles I call things past to mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
things present, and expect things to
come, I hold them happiest that go hence
soonest.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Surely all the Faithful have cause to bless
the Lord for a state of mortality. <hi>Job</hi> loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to think of a state of immortality upon
earth,<note place="margin">Job. 7. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 16. I loath it, I would not
live always. The soul of this righteous man
was like a bird caged or pinioned, and if she
had her freedom, she would soon flie away,
and be at rest. What delight could she
take in such an unclean cage, in such a rotten,
ulcerous body, in such a base treacherous
world? she would fain be gone, and is wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and requesting for leave. It was once the
speech of a good man, <q>I have been seeking
death these forty years, and cannot find it.
I care not when, nor where, nor how I die;</q>And seeing our lives be so miserable, it is
our happiness that they be mortal. Truly
our condition would be very sad, if we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30493:12"/>
should have immortal sins, immortal cares,
immortal miseries, but death proves mortal
to them all. And whereas our bodies shall
be recovered from a state of death in the
Resurrection, our sins and sorrows die and
rise no more.</p>
            <p>I must needs say, 'Tis an happiness to be
Christs Souldier in the field of this World,
but O how happy are his Courtiers! They
are resting in their beds, whiles we are toiling
in the house of bondage. They are singing
on the Shore, whiles we are floating on the
Waves: we are sowing in tears, but they are
reaping in joy, and rejoycing as in the joy of
harvest. We are wrestling with Devils, but
they are conversing with Angels.</p>
            <p>But <hi>when the Lord Jesus shall descend from
Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
Archangel, and the Trump of God,</hi> then shall
these blessed souls attend upon him; and they
shall immediately recover their proper bodies
after their long separation; and then soul and
body shall mutually comfort and welcome
one another, and rejoyce together, being
both dressed up into a conformity to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30493:12"/>
Image of God, the King of Glory, and
arrayed suitably to the solemnity of that
day.</p>
            <p>Imagine we two Travellers sweetly and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciably
walking together, till night overtakes
them; one of them loses himself in the dark,
and being tired with his journey, lies down,
and falls asleep; The other being more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and lively, walks on till he spies a
light in a stately Lodge, there he knocks, and
finds good entertainment, and is kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to stay. There he refreshes himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his travel, and enjoys himself: yet he
wishes for the company of his fellow-travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
to compleat his felicity. When morning
light appears, he goes out, and seeks his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
that had been sleeping upon the cold
earth all night; there he renews his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with him, and brings him into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his new-found friend, where they
both share in his courtesie and bounty.</p>
            <p>These two Travellers are the soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a Christian. Their days journey is the
twelve hours of their life; the night is death.
Both walk friendly together, till night parts
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30493:13"/>
them; the weary body falls asleep; the active
soul keeps on her way till she comes to the
light of Heaven, where she is most kindly
treated by the Lord and his Angels. But yet
in the midst of her entertainment, she cannot
forget her old mate, but is ready to say,
Lord, I have a body below, which used to
pray with me, and to fast for me. Well, it
is not long e're morning-light appears, and
then the soul looks abroad, and takes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with her body, and carries it into
the presence of her noble and gracious Lord,
where both are welcomed with his Smiles,
and enriched with his Favours. Such honour
have all his Saints.</p>
            <p>How happy is our Friend departed? She
is with her Father above, with her Husband
above, and with her Children in Glory.</p>
            <p>I shall not insist much on her praises: for
though <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>A vertuous woman shall
be praised:</hi> yet he says in another place, <hi>Her
own works shall praise her in the gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that knew her most, loved her best.
Among several good things that were
found in her, there are four which I would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30493:13"/>
not have buried with her in the Dust, but
shall publish them as worthy of your Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>1. Her private Conversings with God.</p>
            <p>2. Her affectionate Hearing of Gods
Word.</p>
            <p>3. Her professed Esteem of the Merits of
her Saviour.</p>
            <p>4. Her frequent, savoury Discourses of
her own Mortality.</p>
            <p>Her Infirmities she oft bewailed, and they
served but to enhance the price of her Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Blood. She professed she was willing
to die, that she might cease from sin; And
upon her Death-bed she rejoyced in hope of
the Glory of God. She hath left us such
Evidences of her Holiness, that we doubt
not of her Happiness. And how happy are
the Saints departed!</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> Learn from hence how to die, and
how to prepare for Judgment. We all
know, we must die; but who knows how to
die? Death is the way of all the Earth, but
an happy death is a way that few find
out. Now seeing we cannot make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30493:14"/>
with Death, let us labour to have Death
in the Covenant. Wouldst thou die and go
to the Grave in peace?</p>
            <p>Then 1. Meditate on the Death of Christ.
Some harden themselves against the fear of
death, because 'tis the general Lot of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
<hi>All must die,</hi> say they. <hi>It is appointed
for all men once to die.</hi> But alas, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
can it be to them to be bound up in a
Bundle of Tares, and to be cast into unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
fire? But, poor Christian, let this
be thy Comfort, that death was the Lot of
Jesus Christ, that he hath consecrated a dying
state for us in his own Body, and <hi>that he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth his Soul unto death,</hi> that our Souls
might be bound up in the Bundle of Life.
The Life of our Souls lies in the Blood of
Christ. O my Beloved, take heed of slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a crucified Christ. They that are against
Christ, either in their Judgments or Hearts,
that dispute against him, or live against him,
seem to hate their own Souls, and to be in
love with Damnation, as it is in <hi>Prov. 8. ult.</hi>
How can such ever look death in the face,
that hide their faces from Christ, and esteem
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30493:14"/>
him not? Where will they find such another
Saviour? In vain do you run from Mountain
to Hill, Christ, Christ alone can secure you
from the Plagues and Hellish terrors of death.
He is the Foundation of an Holy life and
Happy death. The readiest way to learn
this long Art of dying well, is to study the
Death of Christ. Now the Intendment of
the Death of Christ, was not meerly to teach
us to die Patiently, but to enable us to die
Comfortably. And if thou wouldst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this Life in peace, then first possess thy
Soul with a right apprehension of the Death
of Christ. Study the words of the Apostle,
<hi>Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many,
and to them that look for him shall he appear
the second time, without sin, unto salvation.</hi>
In these words, you have four things touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Death of Christ very considerable.</p>
            <p>1. The Death and Blood of Christ was Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious,
instead of many. Many deaths were
summed up in his one death. <hi>He was offered
upon the Cross, to bear the sins of many.</hi> The
Jews thought he died worthily for his own
sins, for Blasphemy and Treason: No, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30493:15"/>
it was our Blasphemies and Treasons, our sins
against God and Man, that he died for. <hi>Isa.
53. 4.—We did esteem him striken, smitten of
God, and afflicted (viz.</hi> for his own sins; that
was their great mistake, which the Church of
God corrects in the next verse.) <hi>But he was
wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace
was upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Observe, Christs deaths was an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
He was offered in Sacrifice to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar of the Cross. He did not fall as
a Sacrifice to the Rage of the Jews (for he
could easily have rescued himself out of their
hands) but he was offered up to the Justice
of his Father. <hi>Eph. 5. 2—Christ hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, and hath given himself for us, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
savour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In respect of sin, Christs death was not
only Penal, but also Expiatory. <hi>He bore the
sins of many, i. e.</hi> the punishment due to
them, even what was equivalent to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Hells. There are not such Torments
to be found in Hell, as he suffered upon the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30493:15"/>
Cross, <hi>where he bore the sins of his people.</hi> And
yet he did so fully discharge himself of sin,
that at his second Coming, he shall appear
without sin.</p>
            <p>4. In respect of his Enemies, the Death of
Christ was Victorious. Once he was devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for his people, Cursed, Tortured by a
bitter death: But in death he overcame
Death, and all the Powers of Hell. And
therefore Death could not hold him, the
Grave could not detain him, the wicked One
could not touch him, Heaven could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
him. He died once for sin, but he shall
die no more, for his death was Triumphant
over sin: And he shall shortly appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin, to the terror of his Enemies, and the
Salvation of his dear People.</p>
            <p>We should treasure up such sweet Notions
of a dying Jesus, to prepare us against our
dying day.</p>
            <p>To die, my Friends, is a solemn Work; it
is a loud Summons that calls the Soul to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before her Judge. We go from Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to Funeral, and may see death riding
through our Towns, but little do we think
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30493:16"/>
what it is to have Death come home to our
selves. O what strange thoughts of heart,
what hurrying of passions will the sight of
death beget, when it layes close Siege to a
man, and begins to make its breaches upon
the Body. Then the Soul views and reviews
her self;<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> As all the Virgins looked into their
vessels, when they were awakned by the loud
Cry at midnight, to see if they had Oyl for
their Lamps. Then all the signs of Grace,
and grounds of Hope must be brought to
tryal; then she examines whether her matters
be right and good, whether her condition be
safe. But be it safe or perillous, death comes
in haste,<note place="margin">Joh. 11. 29.</note> as <hi>Martha</hi> to her Sister, <hi>The Master
is come, and calls for thee;</hi> and thou must
away: Then all the world could not redeem
one hour for Repentance. Now how if thou
shouldst be surprised, and taken away by a
sudden stroke, and arrested by death, before
thou hast well thought of it, what a sad blow
would that be?</p>
            <p>O therefore now be wise, be wise, for thy
self; It is a great point of wisdom to consider
our latter end;<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 28.</note> As the Lord saith, <hi>O that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30493:16"/>
they were wise to consider their latter end!</hi> I
beseech you therefore, familiarize death in
your thoughts, make it near. What think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou? Durst thou dye this night? Durst
thou meet thy Judge this night? Thy heart,
it may be, trembles at the thoughts of this O
spare me a little. But then ask thy self, why
thou wouldst not dye, what art afraid of? Let
me offer some consolatory Meditations to a
poor Soul that is trembling under the fears of
death. Art thou afraid of the wrath of God?
Then meditate, But Christ died as a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
Sacrifice to satisfie the Justice of God.
He drank off the very dregs of Gods wrath in
the Cup of his Death.</p>
            <p>Art thou afraid of losing thy Soul for ever?
O but Jesus Christ died for the Redemption
of poor Souls. His Soul went for our Souls,
and his life for our life. <hi>He gave his life a
ransom for many, Mat.</hi> 20. 28. The price of
Christs Blood is a Souls Ransom.</p>
            <p>Art thou afraid of falling short of Heaven?
But the Death of Christ opened our passage
to Heaven.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 19, 20.</note> The renting of the vail of his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30493:17"/>
blessed Body made an open passage into the
Holy of Holies.</p>
            <p>Art thou afraid thy sins should find thee
out in another world? Then meditate, <hi>The
Lamb of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 19.</note> that great Sacrifice, <hi>takes away
the sin of the world.</hi> Sin was condemned in
the Death of Christ, and receives its final
execution in the death of a Christian.</p>
            <p>Art thou afraid the Law should condemn
thee? Then remember, the Death of Christ
hath rebated the edge of the Law, <hi>and hath
abolished the Curse of the Law.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Art thou afraid the Devils should fetch
away thy soul at death?<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 14.</note> But <hi>the Lord Jesus
hath destroyed him that had the power of death,</hi>
and hath bruised the Serpents head, by the
power of his death.</p>
            <p>Thus you should anoint your heads against
your Funeral, with the precious Oyntment
of the Name of Christ, and bathe your souls
in such heavenly comfortable Meditations.</p>
            <p>2. It is not enough for us to meditate on
the Death of Christ, but we must apply it to
our selves by a lively Faith, that it may have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30493:17"/>
an influence upon our death. Have Faith in
the Blood of Christ. The Blood of Christ is
the Wine and Marrow of the Gospel-feast,
the strength of our Sacraments, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an everlasting Covenant. This Blood
seasons all the mercies of a Believer, sanctifies
all his offerings; It makes his heart chearful,
his life comfortable, his death precious, his
grave sweet, his soul fit to enter into the
Holy of Holies. O derive the stream of it
upon thy soul.</p>
            <p>Thou canst not instantly believe that
Christ died for thee, yet labour to stay thy
heart upon the satisfaction, sufficiency, and
worthiness of the Death of Christ. Hide thy
self in the clefts of the Rock, the Wounds of
thy Saviour. Embrace a crucified Christ,
and lay him in thy heart, as <hi>Joseph</hi> did in his
Garden. Why hath the Righteous hope in
his death, but because he hath Faith in the
Death of Christ? A living Faith in a dying
Christ is a soveraign remedy against the
plagues of death, and an infallible prevention
of the pains of Hell. <hi>Joh. 11. 26. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30493:18"/>
lives and believes in me, he shall never
die,</hi> as we read it. But yes, he shall die once
by Gods appointment; but he shall not die
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as in Original) He shall not die
ever,<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 14.</note> he shall not die to eternity. <hi>Death is cast
into the lake of fire.</hi> They that are thrown
into the Lake of fire, meet with death there:
In the Lake of fire they are ever dying. But
he that hath faith in the Blood of Christ, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from death to life. What was it that
gave the <hi>Israelites</hi> safe passage through the
Red Sea? Read <hi>Heb. 11. 29. By faith they
passed through the Red Sea as by dry land;
which the Egyptians</hi> (through presumption)
<hi>assaying to do, were drowned.</hi> Even so death
will drown us and sink us into Hell, if we
have not Faith to clear our passage for us.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Would you hold up your heads in
the day of Judgment, then look for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ. Wo be to those souls to
whom Christ shall come unlooked for. O
how sadly shall the drowsie world be surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the sudden Appearance of Christ!
But Christ shall appear to the Salvation of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30493:18"/>
those faithful Servants, that are watching
and waiting for his second Coming. He
shall come to them, not as a Thief in the
night, but as a Friend in the day. Faith and
Love combine together in an earnest expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of Christ, and that is the reason, that
it is so kindly accepted, and so richly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And therefore, good Christians, keep
watching, if you have any affection for
Christ. <hi>Cannot you watch one hour?</hi> It is
but <hi>yet a little while,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 37.</note> 
               <hi>and he that shall come,
will come and will not tarry.</hi> You have but
two things to do, and Christ will either meet
you or send for you; and that is to finish
your work, and to fill up the measure of your
Graces. God hath something to do for us,
and something to do by us, and then he will
take us to himself.</p>
            <p>1. We must be careful to dispatch our
business,<note place="margin">Luke 13. 23.</note> and to finish our Task. <hi>Herod</hi>
might threaten death, but our Saviour could
not die <hi>till he had finished the work which God
gave him to do.</hi> So neither shall a Christian
die, till his work be done. We read, <hi>Act. 13.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30493:19"/>
36. David after he had served his own gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by the will of God, fell on sleep.</hi> Or, as
others read it, <hi>When David had served the will
of God in his age and generation, &amp;c.</hi> Both
are true; He was serviceable to God, and an
useful Instrument in the Church; and when
all his work was ended, he fell on sleep, and
sweetly rested in the Lord.</p>
            <p>2. Again, We must fill up the measure of
our Graces.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 7.</note> There is a certain measure and
proportion of Grace assigned to every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Body of Christ. Some have more,
some less: Every one shall have his proper
sufficient measure. A Christian shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Glory, till he hath received his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Grace. Read the Parable of the seed
growing secretly, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 26, 27, 28, 29.
And observe that passage, <hi>After that the full
corn is in the ear, and the fruit is ripe, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
he putteth in the sickle.</hi> When our Grace
is like full Corn in the ear, when the fruit of
Gods Spirit is ripe in us, then immediately
comes the sickle of Death; then <hi>we are meet
to be partakers of an inheritance with the Saints
in light,</hi> O then we shall come and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:30493:19"/>
               <hi>Consider what hath been said;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>For, you
see,</hi> all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as
the flower of the grass; the grass withers, the
flower thereof falls away; But the Word of the
Lord endures for ever.</p>
