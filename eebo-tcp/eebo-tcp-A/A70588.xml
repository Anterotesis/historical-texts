         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And becauſe I obſerve that feare and dull diſpoſition, lukewarmeneſſe &amp; ſloth are not ſeldomer wont to cloak themſelves under the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted name of moderation, then true and lively zeale is cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſpareg'd with the terme of indiſcretion, bitterneſſe, and choler, I could not to my thinking honor a good cauſe more from the heart, then by defending it earneſtly, as oft as I could judge it to behoove me, notwithſtanding any falſe name that could be invented to wrong, or undervalue an honeſt meaning. Wherein although I have not doubted to ſingle forth more then once, ſuch of them as were thought the chiefe and moſt nominated oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers

on the other ſide, whom no man elſe undertooke: if I have done well either to be confident of the truth, whoſe force is beſt ſeene againſt the ableſt reſiſtance, or to be jealous and tender of the hurt that might be done among the weaker by the intrapping autority of great names titl'd to falſe opinions, or that it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to attribute ſomewhat to guifts of Gods imparting, which I boaſt not, but thankfully acknowledge, and feare alſo left at my certaine account they be reckon'd to me many rather then few, or if laſtly it be but juſtice not to defraud of due eſteeme the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome labours and ſtudious watchings, wherein I have ſpent and tir'd out almoſt a whole youth, I ſhall not diſtruſt to be acquitted of preſumption. Knowing that if heretofore all ages have receav'd with favour and good acceptance the earlieſt induſtry of him that hath beene hopefull, it were but hard meaſure now, if the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of any timely ſpirit ſhould be oppreſt meerely by the big and blunted fame of his elder adverſary; and that his sufficiency muſt be now ſentenc't, not by pondering the reaſon he ſhewes, but by calculating the yeares he brings. However, as my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is not, nor hath beene formerly, to looke on my adverſary abroad, through the deceaving glaſſe of other mens great opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, but at home, where I may finde him in the proper light of his owne worth, ſo now againſt the rancor of an evill tongue, from which I never thought ſo abſurdly, as that I of all men ſhould be exempt, I muſt be forc't to proceed from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained and diligent inquity of mine owne conſcience at home (for better way I know not, Readers) to give a more true account of my ſelfe abroad then this modeſt Confuter, as he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hath given of me. Albeit that in doing this I ſhall be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of two things which to me will be nothing pleaſant; the one is, that not unlikely I ſhall be thought too much a party in mine owne cauſe, and therein to ſee leaſt; the other, that I ſhall be put unwillingly to moleſt the publick view with the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a private name; as if it were worth the while that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould care whether ſuch a one were thus, or thus. Yet thoſe I intreat who have found the leaſure to reade that name, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of ſmall repute, unworthily defam'd, would be ſo good and ſo patient as to heare the ſame perſon not unneedfully defended. I will not deny but that the beſt apology againſt falſe accuſers is ſilence and ſufferance, and honeſt deeds ſet againſt diſhoneſt words. And that I could at this time moſt eaſily, and ſecurely,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57327:3"/>
with the leaſt loſſe of reputation uſe no other defence, I need not deſpaire to win beliefe. Whether I conſider both the fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, and ridiculous aiming of theſe his ſlanderous bolts, ſhot ſo wide of any ſuſpicion to be faſtn'd on me, that I have oft with inward contentment perceav'd my friends congratulating themſelves in my innocence, and my enemies aſham'd of their partners folly. Or whether I look at theſe preſent times wherein moſt men now ſcarce permitted the liberty to think over their owne concernments have remov'd the ſeat of their thoughts more outward to the expectation of publick events. Or whether the examples of men, either noble or religious, who have ſat downe lately with a meeke ſilence and ſufferance under many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellous endorſements, may be a rule to others, I might well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe my ſelf to put up any reproaches in ſuch an honourable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of fellow-ſufferers uſing no other defence. And were it that ſlander would be content to make an end where it firſt fixes, and not ſeek to caſt out the like infamy upon each thing that hath but any relation to the perſon traduc't, I ſhould have pleaded againſt this Confuter by no other advocates, then thoſe which I firſt commended, Silence, and Sufferance, and ſpeaking deeds againſt faltering words. But when I diſcern'd his intent was not ſo much to ſmite at me, as through me to render odious the truth which I had written, and to ſtaine with ignominy that Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick doctrine which oppoſes the tradition of Prelaty, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceav'd my ſelfe to be now not as mine own perſon, but as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber incorporate into that truth whereof I was perſwaded, and whereof I had declar'd openly to be a partaker. Whereupon I thought it my duty, if not to my ſelfe, yet to the religious cauſe I had in hand, not to leave on my garment the leaſt ſpot, or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in good name ſo long as God ſhould give me to ſay that which might wipe it off. Leſt thoſe diſgraces which I ought to ſuffer, if it ſo befall me, for my religion, through my default re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be made liable to ſuffer for me. And, whether it might not ſomething reflect upon thoſe reverent men whoſe friend I may be thought in writing the Animadverſions, was not my laſt care to conſider, if I ſhould reſt under theſe reproaches having the ſame common adverſary with them, it might be counted ſmall credit for their cauſe to have found ſuch an aſſiſtant, as this babler hath devis'd me. What other thing in his book there is of diſpute, or queſtion, in anſwering thereto I doubt not to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57327:4"/>
juſtifi'd; except there be who will condemne me to have waſted time in throwing downe that which could not keepe it ſelfe up. As for others who notwithſtanding what I can allege have yet decreed to miſ-interpret the intents of my reply. I ſuppoſe they would have found as many cauſes to have miſconceav'd the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my ſilence.</p>
            <p>TO beginne therefore an Apology for thoſe animadverſions which I writ againſt the Remonſtrant in defence of <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſince the Preface, which was purpoſely ſet before them, is not thought apologeticall anough; it will be beſt to acquaint ye, Readers, before other things, what the meaning was to write them in that manner which I did. For I do not look to be askt wherefore I writ the book, it being no difficulty to anſwer that I did it to thoſe ends which the beſt men propoſe to themſelves when they write. But wherfore in that manner neglecting the maine bulk of all that ſpecious antiquity, which might ſtunne children, but not men, I choſe rather to obſerve ſome kinde of military advantages to await him at his forragings, at his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trings, and when ever he felt himſelfe ſecure to ſolace his veine in deriſion of his more ſerious opponents. And here let me have pardon, Readers; if the remembrance of that which he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenc't himſelfe to utter contemptuouſly of thoſe reverend men provoke me to doe that over againe which ſome expect I ſhould excuſe as too freely done; ſince I have two provocations, his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt inſulting in his ſhort anſwer, and their finall patience. I had no fear but that the authors of <hi>Smectymnus</hi> to all the ſhew of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity which the Remonſtrant could bring, were prepar'd both with skill and purpoſe to returne a ſuffizing anſwer, and were able anough to lay the duſt and pudder in antiquity, which he and his, out of ſtratagem, are wont to raiſe; but when I ſaw his weake arguments headed with ſharpe taunts, and that his deſigne was, if he could not refute them, yet at leaſt with quips and ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping adagies to vapour them out, which they bent only upon the buſineſſe were minded to let paſſe, by how much I ſaw them taking little thought for their own injuries, I muſt confeſſe I took it as my part the leſſe to endure that my reſpected friends through their own unneceſſary patience ſhould thus lye at the mercy of a coy flurting ſtile; to be girded with frumps and curtall gibes, by one who makes ſentences by the Statute, as if all above three
<pb facs="tcp:57327:4"/>
inches long were confiſcat. To me it ſeem'd an indignity, that whom his whole wiſdome could not move from their place, them his impetuous folly ſhould preſume to ride over. And if I were more warme then was meet in any paſſage of that booke, which yet I do not yeild, I might uſe therein the patronage of no worſe an author then <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> who mentioning his ſharpneſſe againſt <hi>Eunomius</hi> in the defence of his brother <hi>Baſil,</hi> holds himſelfe irreprovable in that it <hi>was not for himſelfe, but in the cauſe of his brother; and in ſuch caſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>perhaps it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier pardon to be angry, then to be cooler.</hi> And whereas this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer taxes the whole diſcourſe of levity, I ſhall ſhew ye, Readers, whereſoever it ſhall be objected in particular that I have anſwer'd with as little lightneſſe as the Remouſtrant hath given example. I have not beene ſo light as the palme of a Biſhop which is the lighteſt thing in the world when he brings out his book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: For then contrary to that which is wont in releaſing out of priſon, any one that will pay his fees is layd hands on. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, it would not be amiſſe though the Remonſtrant were told, wherefore he was in that unuſuall manner beleaguer'd; and this was it, to pluck out of the heads of his admirers the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that all who are not Prelaticall, are groſſe-headed, thick witted, illiterat, ſhallow. Can nothing then but Epiſcopacy teach men to ſpeak good Engliſh, to pick &amp; order a ſet of words judiciouſly? Muſt we learne from Canons and quaint Sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings interlin'd with barbarous Latin to illumin a period, to wreath an Enthymema w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> maiſtrous dexterity? I rather encline, as I have heard it obſerv'd, that a Jeſuits Italian when he writes, is ever naught, though he be borne and bred a <hi>Florentine,</hi> ſo to thinke that from like cauſes we may go neere to obſerve the ſame in the ſtile of a Prelat. For doubtleſſe that indeed according to art is moſt eloquent, which returnes and approaches neereſt to nature from whence it came; and they expreſſe nature beſt, who in their lives leaſt wander from her ſafe leading, which may be call'd regenerate reaſon. So that how he ſhould be truly eloquent who is not withall a good man, I ſee not. Never the leſſe as oft as is to be dealt with men who pride themſelves in their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed art, to leave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unexcuſable wherin they will not be better'd there be of thoſe that eſteeme Prelaty a figment, who yet can pipe, if they can dance, nor will be unfurniſht to ſhew that what the Prelats admire and have not, others have and admire not.

The knowledge whereof, and not of that only, but of what the Scripture teacheth us how we ought to withſtand the perverters of the Goſpell were thoſe other motives which gave the animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions no leave to remit a continuall vehemence throughout the book. For as in teaching, doubtleſſe the Spirit of meekneſſe is moſt powerfull, ſo are the meeke only fit perſons to be taught: as for the proud, the obſtinate, and falſe Doctors of mens devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be taught they will not; but diſcover'd and laid open they muſt be.

And againſt ſuch kind of deceavers openly and earneſtly to proteſt, leſt any one ſhould be inquiſitive wherefore this or that man is forwarder then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, let him know that this office goes not by age, or youth, but to whomſoever God ſhall give apparently the will, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the utterance. Ye have heard the reaſons for which I thought not my ſelfe exempted from aſſociating with good men in their labours toward the Churches wellfare: to which if any one brought oppoſition, I brought my beſt reſiſtance. If in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of this and for that I have not been negligent toward the reputation of my friends, I have gain'd a name beſtuck, or as I may ſay, bedeckt with the reproaches and reviles of this modeſt Confuter, it ſhall be to me neither ſtrange, nor unwelcome; as that which could not come in a better time.</p>
            <p>Having render'd an account, what induc't me to write thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imadverſions in that manner as I writ them, I come now to ſee what the confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath to ſay againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but ſo as the confuter ſhall hear firſt what I have to ſay againſt his confutation. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he pretends to be a great conjector at other men by their writings, I will not faile to give ye, Readers, a preſent taſte of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57327:5"/>
him from his own title; hung out like a toling ſigne-poſt to call paſſengers, not ſimply <hi>a confutation</hi> but <hi>a modeſt confutation</hi> with a laudatory of it ſelfe obtruded in the very firſt word. Whereas a modeſt title ſhould only informe the buyer what the book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines without furder inſinuation, this officious epithet ſo haſtily aſſuming the modeſty w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> others are to judge of by reading, not the author to anticipate to himſelf by foreſtalling, is a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that his modeſty ſet there to ſale in the frontiſpice, is not much addicted to bluſh. A ſurer ſigne of his loſt ſhame he could not have given, then ſeeking thus unſeaſonably to prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe men of his modeſty. And ſeeing he hath neither kept his word in the ſequel, not omitted any kinde of boldneſſe in ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, tis manifeſt his purpoſe was only to rub the forehead of his title with this word <hi>modeſt,</hi> that he might not want colour to be the more impudent throughout his whole confutation. Next what can equally ſavour of injuſtice, and plaine arrogance, as to prejudice and forecondemne his adverſary in the title for <hi>ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſcurrilous,</hi> and as the Remonſtrants faſhion is, for <hi>frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, tedious, and falſe,</hi> not ſtaying till the Reader can hear him prov'd ſo in the following diſcourſe; which is one cauſe of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion that in ſetting forth this pamplet the Remonſtrant was not unconſulted with; thus his firſt addreſſe was <hi>an humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance by a dutifull ſon of the Church,</hi> almoſt as if he had ſaid her white-boy. His next was <hi>a defence</hi> (a wonder how it ſcapt ſome praiſing adjunct) <hi>againſt the frivolous and falſe exceptions of Smectymnus,</hi> ſitting in the chaire of his Title page upon his poore caſt adverſaries both as a Judge and Party, and that before the jury of Readers can be impannell'd. His laſt was <hi>A ſhort anſwer to a tedious vindication</hi>; ſo little can he ſuffer a man to meaſure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his eye or judgement, what is ſhort or what tedious without his preoccupying direction: and from hence is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this <hi>modeſt confutation againſt a ſlanderous and ſcurrilous libell.</hi> I conceave, Readers, much may be gueſt at the man and his book, what depth there is, by the framing of his title, which being in this Remonſtrant ſo raſh, and unadviſed as ye ſee, I conceit him to be neere a kin to him who ſet forth a Paſſion Sermon with a formall Dedicatory in great letters to our Saviour. Although I know that all we do ought to begin and end to his praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet to inſcribe him in a void place with flouriſhes, as a man in complement uſes to trick up the name of ſome Eſquire, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

But I ſtep againe to this embla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoner of his Title page (whether it be the ſame man or no I leave it in the midſt) and here I finde him pronouncing without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve thoſe animadverſions to be <hi>a ſlanderous and ſcurrilous libell.</hi> To which I, Readers, that they are neither ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I never thought the humane frailty of erring in caſes of religion infamy to a State, no more then to a Councell; it had therefore beene neither civill, nor Chriſtianly, to derogate the honour of the State for that cauſe, eſpecially when I ſaw the Parlament it ſelfe piouſly and magnanimouſly bent to ſupply and reforme the defects and overſights of their forefathers, which to the godly and repentant ages of the Jewes were often matter of humble confeſſing and bewailing, not of confident aſſerting and maintaining. Of the State therefore I found good reaſon to ſpeak all honourable things, and to joyne in petition with good men that petition'd: but againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats who were the only ſeducers and miſ-leaders of the State to conſtitute the government of the Church not rightly, me thought I had not vehemence anough.

And this we know in <hi>Laertius,</hi> that the Mimes of <hi>Sophron</hi> were of ſuch reckning with <hi>Plato,</hi> as to take them nightly to read on and after make them his pillow. <hi>Scaliger</hi> deſcribes a Mime to be a Poem imitating any action to ſtirre up laughter. But this being neither Poem, nor yet ridiculous, how is it but abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively taxt to be a Mime. For if every book which may by chance excite to laugh here and there, muſt be term'd thus, then may the Dialogues of <hi>Plato,</hi> who for thoſe his writings hath obtain'd the ſurname of Divine, be eſteem'd as they are by that detractor in <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> no better then <hi>Mimes.</hi> Becauſe there is ſcarce one of them, eſpecially wherein ſome notable Sophiſter lies ſweating and turmoyling under the inevitable, and mercileſſe dilemma's of <hi>Socrates,</hi> but that hee who reads, were it <hi>Saturne</hi> himſelfe, would be often rob'd of more then a ſmile. And whereas he tels us that <hi>Scurrilous Mime was a perſonated grim lowring foole,</hi> his

But in an ill houre hath his unfortunate raſhneſſe ſtumbl'd upon the mention of miming. That hee might at length ceaſe, which he hath not yet ſince he ſtept in, to gall and hurt him whom hee would aide.

Certainly he that could indure with a ſober pen to ſit and deviſe laws for drunkards to carouſe by, I doubt me whether the very ſoberneſſe of ſuch a one, like an unlicour'd <hi>Silenus,</hi> were not ſtark drunk.

Which being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe propenſe to all ſuch as were for their ſtudious and civill life worthy of eſteeme, I could not wrong their judgements, and upright intentions; ſo much as to think I had that regard from them for other cauſe then that I might be ſtill encourag'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the honeſt and laudable courſes, of which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended I had given good proofe. And to thoſe ingenuous and friendly men who were ever the countnancers of vertuous and hopefull wits, I wiſh the beſt, and happieſt things, that friends in abſence wiſh one to another. As for the common approbation or diſlike of that place, as now it is, that I ſhould eſteeme or diſeſteeme my ſelfe or any other the more for that, too ſimple and too credulous is the Confuter, if he thinke to obtaine with me, or any right diſcerner.

Thoſe morning haunts are where they ſhould be, at home, not ſleeping, or concocting the ſurfets of an irregular feaſt, but up, and ſtirring, in winter often ere the ſound of any bell awake men to labour, or to devotion; in Summer as oft with the Bird that firſt rouſes, or not much tardier, to reade good Authors, or cauſe them to be read, till the attention bee weary, or memory have his full fraught.

So if my name and outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour be not evident anough to defend me, I muſt make try all, if the diſcovery of my inmoſt thoughts can. Wherein of two pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes both honeſt, and both ſincere, the one perhaps I ſhall not miſſe; although I faile to gaine beliefe with others of being ſuch as my perpetuall thoughts ſhall heere diſcloſe me, I may yet not faile of ſucceſſe in perſwading ſome, to be ſuch really themſelves, as they cannot believe me to be more then what I fain. I had my time Readers, as others have, who have good learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon them, to be ſent to thoſe places, where the opinion was it might be ſooneſt attain'd: and as the manner is, was not unſtudied in thoſe authors which are moſt commended; whereof ſome were grave Orators &amp; Hiſtorians, whoſe matter me thought I lov'd indeed, but as my age then was, ſo I underſtood them; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were the ſmooth Elegiack Poets, whereof the Schooles are not ſcarce.

For by the firme ſetling of theſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I became, to my beſt memory, ſo much a proficient, that if I found thoſe authors any where ſpeaking unworthy things of themſelves; or unchaſte of thoſe names which before they had extoll'd, this effect it wrought with me, from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their art I ſtill applauded, but the men I deplor'd; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all preferr'd the two famous renowners of <hi>Beatrice</hi> and <hi>Laura</hi> who never write but honour of them to whom they devote their verſe, diſplaying ſublime and pure thoughts, without tranſgreſſion. And long it was not after, when I was confirm'd in this opinion, that he who would not be fruſtrate of his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things, ought him ſelfe to bee a true Poem, that is, a compoſition, and patterne of the beſt and honourableſt things; not preſuming to ſing high praiſes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if I found in the ſtory afterward any of them by word or deed breaking that oath, I judg'd it the ſame fault of the Poet, as that which is attributed to <hi>Homer</hi>; to have written undecent things of the gods. Only this my minde gave me that every free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that even thoſe books which to many others have bin the fuell of wantonneſſe and looſe living, I cannot thinke how unleſſe by divine indulgence prov'd to me ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements as you have heard, to the love and ſtedfaſt obſervation of that vertue which abhorres the ſociety of Bordello's. Thus from the Laureat fraternity of Poets, riper yeares, and the ceaſeleſſe round of ſtudy and reading led me to the ſhady ſpaces of philoſophy, but chiefly to the divine volumes of <hi>Plato,</hi> and his equall <hi>Xenophon.</hi> Where if I ſhould tell ye what I learnt, of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity and love, I meane that which is truly ſo, whoſe charming cup is only vertue which ſhe bears in her hand to thoſe who are worthy. The reſt are cheated with a thick intoxicating poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which a certaine Sorcereſſe the abuſer of loves name carries about; and how the firſt and chiefeſt office of love, begins and ends in the ſoule, producing thoſe happy twins of her divine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration knowledge and vertue, with ſuch abſtracted ſublimities as theſe, it might be worth your liſtning, Readers, as I may one day hope to have ye in a ſtill time, when there ſhall be no chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; not in theſe noiſes, the adverſary as ye know, barking at the doore; or ſearching for me at the Burdello's where it may be he has loſt himſelfe, and raps up without pitty the ſage and rheumatick old <hi>Prelateſſe</hi> with all her young <hi>Corinthian Laity</hi> to inquire for ſuch a one. Laſt of all not in time, but as perfection is laſt, that care was ever had of me, with my earlieſt capacity not to be negligently train'd in the precepts of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: This that I have hitherto related, hath bin to ſhew, that though Chriſtianity had bin but ſlightly taught me, yet a certain reſerv'dneſſe of naturall diſpoſition, and morall diſcipline learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

out of the nobleſt Philoſophy was anough to keep me in diſdain of farre leſſe incontinences then this of the Burdello. But having had the doctrine of holy Scripture unfolding thoſe chaſte and high myſteries with timelieſt care infus'd, that <hi>the body is for the Lord and the Lord for the body,</hi> thus alſo I argu'd to my ſelfe; that if unchaſtity in a woman whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> termes the glory of man, be ſuch a ſcandall and diſhonour, then certainly in a man who is both the image and glory of God, it muſt, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly not ſo thought, be much more deflouring and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. In that he ſins both againſt his owne body which is the perfeter ſex, and his own glory which is in the woman, and that which is worſt, againſt the image and glory of God which is in himſelfe. Nor did I ſlumber over that place expreſſing ſuch high rewards of ever accompanying the Lambe, with thoſe celeſtiall ſongs to others inapprehenſible, but not to thoſe who were not defil'd with women, which doubtleſſe meanes fornication: For mariage muſt not be call'd a defilement. Thus large I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely bin, that if I have bin juſtly taxt with this crime, it may come upon me after all this my confeſſion, with a tenne-fold ſhame. But if I have hitherto deſerv'd no ſuch opprobrious word, or ſuſpicion, I may hereby ingage my ſelfe now openly to the faithfull obſervation of what I have profeſt. I go on to ſhew you the unbridl'd impudence of this looſe rayler, who having once begun his race regards not how farre he flyes out beyond all truth &amp; ſhame; who from the ſingle notice of the animadverſions, as he proteſts, will undertake to tell ye the very cloaths I weare, though he be much miſtaken in my wardrobe.

For certainly this tormenter of ſemicolons is as good at diſmembring and ſlitting ſentences, as his grave Fathers the Prelates have bin at ſtigmatizing &amp; flitting noſes. By ſuch handy craft as this what might he not traduce? Only that odour which being his own muſt needs offend his ſenſe of ſmelling, ſince he will needs beſtow his foot among us, and not allow us to think he weares a Sock, I ſhall endeavour it may be offenceleſſe to other mens eares. The Remonſtrant having to do with grave and reverend men his adverſaries, thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him to tell them in ſcorne, that <hi>the Biſhops foot had beene in their book and confuted it,</hi> which when I ſaw him arrogate, to have done that with his heeles that ſurpaſt the beſt conſideration of his head, to ſpurn a confutation among reſpected men, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd not the lawfulneſſe of moving his jollity to bethink him, what odor a Sock would have in ſuch a painfull buſineſſe. And this may have chanc't to touch him more neerly then I was aware; for indeed a Biſhops foot that hath all his toes maugre the gout, and a linnen Sock over it, is the apteſt embleme of the Prelate himſelfe. Who being a pluraliſt, may under one Surplice which is alſo linnen, hide foure benefices beſides the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan toe, and ſends a fouler ſtench to heaven, then that which this young queaſineſſe reches at. And this is the immediate reaſon here why our inrag'd Confuter, that he may be as perfet an hypocrite as <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> ere he be a High Prieſt, cries out, <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blaſphemy!</hi> and like a recreant Jew calls for <hi>ſtones.</hi> I beſeech ye friends, ere the brick-bats flye, reſolve me and your ſelves, is it blaſphemy, or any whit diſagreeing from Chriſtian meekneſſe, when as Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaking of unſavory traditions, ſcruples not to name the Dunghill and the Jakes, for me to anſwer a ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wincer of a confutation, that, if he would needs put his foot to ſuch a ſweaty ſervice, the odour of his Sock was like to be neither musk, nor benjamin? Thus did that fooliſh Monk

in a barbarous Declamation accuſe <hi>Petrarch</hi> of blaſphemy for diſpraiſing the French wines. But this which followes is plaine bedlam ſtuffe, this is the <hi>Demoniack legion</hi> indeed, which the Remonſtrant feard had been againſt him, and now he may ſee is for him. <hi>You that love Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and know this miſcreant wretch, ſtone him to death, leſt you ſmart for his impunity.</hi> What thinks the Remonſtrant? does he like that ſuch words as theſe ſhould come out of his ſhop, out of his Trojan horſe? to give the watch word like <hi>a Guiſian of Paris</hi> to a mutiny or maſſacre; to proclame a <hi>Cruſada</hi> againſt his fellow Chriſtian now in this troublous and divided time of the Kingdome? if he do, I ſhall ſay that to be the Remonſtrant is no better then to be a Jeſuit. And that if he and his accomplices could do as the rebels have done in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Proteſtants, they would do in <hi>England</hi> the ſame to them that would no Prelats. For a more ſeditious and Butcherly Speech no Cell of <hi>Loyola</hi> could have belch't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one who in all his writing ſpake not, that any mans skin ſhould be rais'd. And yet this curſing <hi>Shimei</hi> a hurler of ſtones, as well as a rayler, wants not the face inſtantly to make as though he <hi>deſpair'd of victory unleſſe a modeſt defence would get it him.</hi> Did I erre at all, Readers, to foretell ye, when firſt I met with his title, that the epithet of modeſt there, was a certaine red por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſigne, that he meant ere long to be moſt tempeſtuouſly bold, , and ſhameleſſe?

For if the ſore be running upon me, in all judgement I have ſcapt the diſeaſe, but he who hath as much infection hid in him, as he hath voluntarily confeſt, and cannot expell it, becauſe hee is dull, for venomous Atheiſme were no treaſure to be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him elſe, let him take the part hee hath choſen, which muſt needs follow, to ſwell and burſt with his owne inward venome.</p>

If therefore the queſtion were in oratory, whether a vehement vein throwing out indignation, or ſcorn upon an object that merits it, were among the apteſt <hi>Ideas</hi> of ſpeech to be allow'd, it were my work, and that an eaſie one to make it cleare both by the rules of beſt rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians, and the famouſeſt examples of the Greek and Roman Orations. But ſince the Religion of it is diſputed, and not the art, I ſhall make uſe only of ſuch reaſons and autorities, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cannot except againſt. It will be harder to gainſay, then for me to evince that in the teaching of men diverſly temper'd different wayes are to be try'd. The Baptiſt we know was a ſtrict man remarkable for auſterity and ſet order of life. Our Saviour who had all gifts in him was Lord to expreſſe his indoctrinating power in what ſort him beſt ſeem'd; ſometimes by a milde and familiar converſe, ſometimes with plaine and impartiall home-ſpeaking regardleſſe of thoſe whom the auditors might think he ſhould have had in more reſpect; otherwhiles with bitter and irefull rebukes if not teaching yet leaving excuſeleſſe thoſe his wilfull impugners. What was all in him, was divided among many others the teachers of his Church; ſome to be ſevere and ever of a ſad gravity that they may win ſuch, &amp; check ſometimes thoſe who be of nature over-confident and jocond; others were ſent more cheerefull, free, and ſtill as it were at large, in the midſt of an untreſpaſſing honeſty; that they who are ſo temper'd may have by whom they might be drawne to ſalvation, and they who are too ſcrupulous, and dejected of ſpirit might be often ſtrength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ye will ſay theſe had immediat warrant from God to be thus bitter, and I ſay, ſo much the plainlier is it prov'd, that there may be a ſanctifi'd bitterneſſe againſt the enemies of truth.

as we may reade in <hi>Sleiden.</hi> Yea he defends his eagerneſſe, as being <hi>of an ardent ſpirit, and one who could not write a dull ſtile</hi>: and affirm'd <hi>hee thought it Gods will to have the inventions of men thus laid open, ſeeing that matters quietly handled, were quickly forgot.</hi> And herewithall how uſefull and available God had made this tart rhetorick in the Churches cauſe, he often found by his owne experience. For when he betook himſelfe to lenity and moderation, as they call it, he reapt nothing but contempt both from <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> from <hi>Cocleus,</hi> from <hi>Ecchius</hi> and others, inſomuch that blaming his friends who had ſo counſel'd him, he reſolv'd never to runne into the like error; if at other times he ſeeme to excuſe his vehemence, as more then what was meet, I have not examin'd through his works to know how farre he gave way to his owne fervent minde; it ſhall ſuffice me to looke to mine own. And this I ſhall eaſily averre though it may ſeeme a hard ſaying, that the Spirit of God who is purity it ſelfe, when he would reprove any fault ſeverely, or but relate things done or ſaid with indignation by others, abſtains not from ſome words not civill at other times to be ſpok'n. Omitting that place in Numbers at the killing of <hi>Zimri and Cosbi</hi> done by <hi>Phineas</hi> in the heigth of zeal, related as the Rabbines expound, not without an obſcene word, we may finde in Deuteronomy and three of the Prophets, where God denouncing bitterly the puniſhments of Idolaters, tels them in a terme immodeſt to be utter'd in coole blood, that their wives ſhall be defil'd openly. But theſe, they will ſay were honeſt words in that age when they were ſpok'n. Which is more then any Rabbin can prove, and certainly had God been ſo minded, he could have pickt ſuch words, as ſhould never have come into abuſe. What will they ſay to this. <hi>David</hi> going againſt <hi>Nabal,</hi> in the very ſame breath when he had but juſt before nam'd the <hi>name of God,</hi> he vowes not <hi>to leave any alive of Nabals houſe that piſſeth againſt the wall.</hi> But this was unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſpoke, you will anſwer, and ſet downe to aggravate his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.

            <p>Now that the confutant may alſo know as he deſires, what force of teaching there is ſometimes in laughter, I ſhall returne him in ſhort, that laughter being one way of anſwering <hi>A Foole according to his folly,</hi> teaches two ſorts of perſons, firſt the Foole himſelfe <hi>not to be wiſe in his own conceit</hi>; as <hi>Salomon</hi> affirms, which is certainely a great document, to make an unwiſe man know himſelfe. Next, it teaches the hearers, in as much as ſcorne is one of thoſe, puniſhments which belong to men carnally wiſe, which is oft in Scripture declar'd; for when ſuch are puniſht <hi>the ſimple are thereby made wiſe,</hi> if <hi>Salomons</hi> rule be true. And I would ask, to what end <hi>Eliah</hi> mockt the falſe Prophets? was it to ſhew his wit, or to fulfill his humour? doubtleſſe we cannot imagine that great ſervant of God had any other end in all which he there did, but to teach and inſtruct the poore miſledde people.

But he by a ſhew of good upholding the evill which in them undoes it ſelfe, hinders the good which they by accident let in. Their manifeſt crimes ſerve to bring forth an enſuing good and haſten a remedy againſt themſelves, and his ſeeming good tends to reinforce their ſelfe-puniſhing crimes and his owne, by doing his beſt to delay all redreſſe. Shall not all the miſchiefe which other men do, be layd to his charge, if they doe it by that unchurchlike power which he defends? Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he that is not with me is againſt me, and he that gathers not with me ſcatters.</hi> In what degree of enmity to Chriſt ſhall wee place that man then, who ſo is with him, as that it makes more

Evill, evill, would be your reward ye worthies of the Parlament, if this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter and his accomplices had the cenſuring, or the ſounding forth of your labours. And that the Remonſtrant cannot waſh his hands of all the cruelties exercis'd by the Prelats, is paſt doubting. They ſcourg'd the confeſſors of the Goſpell, and he held the ſcourgers garments. They excuted their rage, and he, if he did nothing elſe, defended the government with the oath that did it, and the ceremonies which were the cauſe of it: does he think to be counted guiltleſſe?</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. In the following Section I muſt foretell ye, Readers, the doings will be rough and dangerous, the bating of a <hi>Satir.</hi> And if the work ſeeme more triviall or boiſtrous then for this diſcourſe, let the Remonſtrant thank the folly of this confuter, who could not let a private word paſſe, but he muſt make all this blaze of it. I had ſaid that becauſe the Remonſtrant was ſo much offended with thoſe who were tart againſt the Prelats, ſure he lov'd toothleſſe Satirs, which I took were as improper as a tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sleekſtone. This Champion from behind the Arras cries out that thoſe toothleſſe Satyrs were of the Remonſtrants making; and armes himſelfe heretooth and naile and <hi>horne</hi> to boot, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of teeth, or rather of gumms in the Satirs. And for an onſet tels me that the ſimily of a Sleekſtone <hi>ſhewes I can be as bold with a Prelat as familiar with a Laundreſſe.</hi> But does it not argue rather the laſcivious promptneſſe of his own fancy, who from the harmeleſſe mention of a Sleekſtone could neigh out the remembrance of his old converſation among the <hi>Viraginian</hi> trol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops?

Readers, that ſure this muſt be ſome ſucking Satir, who might have done better to have us'd his corall, and made an end of breeding, ere he took upon him to weild a Satirs whip. But when I heard him talk of <hi>ſcouring the ruſted ſwords of elviſh Knights,</hi> doe not blame me, if I chang'd my thought, and concluded him ſome deſperate Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For a Satyr as it was borne out of a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> ſo ought to reſemble his parentage, to ſtrike high, and adventure dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly at the moſt eminent vices among the greateſt perſons, and not to creepe into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

His ſeventh ſection labours to cavill out the flawes which were found in the Remonſtrants logick; who having layd downe for a generall propoſition, that <hi>civill polity is variable and arbitrary,</hi> from whence was inferr'd logically upon him that he had concluded the polity of England to be arbitrary, for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall includes particular, here his defendant is not aſham'd to confeſſe that the Remonſtrants propoſition was ſophiſticall <hi>by a fallacy call'd ad plures interrogationes</hi> which ſounds to me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange that a Remonſtrant of that pretended ſincerity ſhould bring deceitfull and double dealing propoſitions to the Parlament. The truth is he had let ſlip a ſhrewd paſſage ere he was aware, not thinking the concluſion would turne upon him with ſuch a terrible edge, and not knowing how to winde out of the briars, he or his ſubſtitute ſeems more willing to lay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his Logick to pawn, and grant a fallacy in his owne <hi>Major</hi> where none is, then be forc't to uphold the inference. For that diſtinction <hi>of poſſible and lawfull</hi> is ridiculous to be ſought for in that propoſition; no man doubting that it is poſſible to change the forme of civill polity; and that it is held lawfull by that <hi>Major,</hi> the word <hi>arbitrary</hi> implyes. Nor will this helpe him, to deny that it is arbitrary <hi>at any time or by any undertakers</hi> (which are two limitations invented by him ſince) for when it ſtands as he will have it now by his ſecond edition <hi>civill polity is variable but not at any time or by any undertakers,</hi> it will reſult upon him, belike then at ſome time, and by ſome undertakers it may. And ſo he goes on mincing the matter, till he meets with ſomething in Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> then he takes heart againe and holds his <hi>Major</hi> at large. But by and by as ſoon as the ſhadow of Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> hath left him, he fals off again warping and warping till he come to contradict himſelfe in diameter: and denies flatly that it is <hi>either variable or arbitrary, being once ſettl'd.</hi> Which third ſhift is no leſſe a piece of laughter. For before the polity was ſettl'd how could it be vari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What ever elſe may perſwade me that this confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not made without ſome aſſiſtance or advice of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant, yet in this eighth Section that his hand was not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intermixt, I can eaſily believe. For it begins with this ſurmiſe, that <hi>not having to accuſe the Remonſtrant to the King, I do it to the Parlament,</hi> which conceit of the man cleanly ſhoves the King out of the Parlament, and makes two bodies of one. Whereas the Remonſtrant in the Epiſtle to his laſt <hi>ſhort anſwer, gives his ſuppoſall that they cannot be ſever'd in the rights of their ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.</hi> Mark, Readers, if they cannot be ſever'd in what is ſeverall (which caſts a Buls eye to go yoke with the toothleſſe Satyrs) how ſhould they be ſever'd in their common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the wellfare of the land, by due accuſation of ſuch as are the common grievances, among which I took the Remonſtrant to be one. And therefore if I accus'd him to the Parlament, it was the ſame as to accuſe him to the King. Next he caſts it into the diſh of I know not whom that <hi>they flatter ſome of the Houſe and libell others whoſe conſciences made them vote contrary to ſome proceedings.</hi> Thoſe ſome proceedings can be underſtood of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the <hi>Deputies</hi> execution. And can this private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocter of malecontent, at the very inſtant when he pretends to extoll the Parlament, afford thus to blurre over, rather then to mention that publick triumph of their juſtice and conſtancy ſo high, ſo glorious, ſo reviving to the fainted Common-wealth with ſuch a ſuſpicious and murmuring expreſſion as to call it <hi>ſome proceedings?</hi> and yet immediately hee falls to glozing, as if hee were the only man that rejoyc't at theſe times. But I ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ye Readers, that this his praiſing of them is as full of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and Scolaſtick foppery, as his meaning he himſelfe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to be full of cloſe malignity. His firſt <hi>Encomium</hi> is <hi>that the Sun looks not upon a braver nobler convocation then is that of King, Peers, and Commons.</hi> One thing I beg of ye Readers, as ye beare any zeale to learning, to elegance, and that which is call'd <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum</hi> in the writing of praiſe, eſpecially on ſuch a noble argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ye would not be offended, though I rate this cloiſter'd Lubber according to his deſerts.

Firſt therefore the moſt of them being either of ancient and high Nobility, or at leaſt of knowne and well reputed anceſtry, which is a great advantage towards vertue one way, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of welth, eaſe, and flattery, which accompanies a nice and tender education, is as much a hindrance another way, the good which lay before them they took, in imitating the worthieſt of their progenitors, and the evill which aſſaulted their younger yeares by the temptation of riches, high birth, and that uſuall bringing up, perhaps too favourable and too remiſſe, through the ſtrength of an inbred goodneſſe, and with the helpe of divine grace, that had markt them out for no meane purpoſes, they nobly overcame. Yet had they a greater danger to cope with; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing train'd up in the knowledge of learning, and ſent to thoſe places, which were intended to be the ſeed plots of piety and the Liberall Arts, but were become the nurſeries of ſuperſtition, and

And although their lot fell into ſuch times, and to be bred in ſuch places, where if they chanc't to be taught any thing good, or of their own accord had learn't it, they might ſee that preſently untaught them by the cuſtome and ill example of their elders, ſo farre in all probability was their youth from being, miſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which two things God hath inſeparably knit together, and hath diſclos'd to us that they who ſeek to corrupt our religion are the ſame that would inthrall our civill liberty. Thus in the midſt of all diſdvantages and diſreſpects (ſome alſo at laſt not without impriſonment and open diſgraces in the cauſe of their countrey) having given proofe of themſelves to be better made and fram'd by nature to the love and practiſe of vertue, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under the holieſt precepts and beſt examples have been headſtrong and prone to vice, and having in all the trialls of a firme ingrafted honeſty not oftner buckl'd in the conflict, then giv'n every oppoſition the foile, this moreover was added by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from heav'n, as an ornament and happineſſe to their vertue, that it ſhould be neither obſcure in the opinion of men, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſt for want of matter equall to illuſtrat it ſelfe; God and man conſenting in joynt approbation to chooſe them out as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt above others to be both the great reformers of the Church, and the reſtorers of the Common-wealth. Nor did they deceave that expectation which with the eyes and deſires of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was fixt upon them; for no ſooner did the force of ſo much united excellence meet in one globe of brightneſſe and efficacy, but encountring the dazl'd reſiſtance of tyranny, they gave not over, though their enemies were ſtrong and ſuttle, till they had laid her groveling upon the fatall block.

And whereas at other times we count it ample honour when God voutſafes to make man the inſtrument and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate worker of his gracious will, ſuch acceptation have their prayers found with him, that to them he hath bin pleas'd to make himſelfe the agent, and immediat performer of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; diſſolving their difficulties when they are thought inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, cutting out wayes for them where no paſſage could be ſeene; as who is there ſo regardleſſe of Divine providence, that from late occurences will not confeſſe.

And were the puniſhment and miſery of being a Prelat Biſhop terminated only in the perſon, and did not extend to the affliction of the whole Dioceſſe, if I would wiſh any thing in bitterneſſe of ſoule to mine enemy, I would wiſh him the biggeſt and the fatteſt Biſhoprick. But hee proceeds; and the familiar belike informs him, that <hi>a rich Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or a Lecture, or both, would content me</hi>; whereby I perceave him to be more ignorant in his art of divining then any Gipſy. For this I cannot omit without ingratitude to that providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, who hath ever bred me up in plenty, although my life hath not bin unexpenſive in learning, and voyaging about, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe him to lend mee what he hath hitherto thought good, which is anough to ſerve me in all honeſt and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall occaſions, and ſomething over beſides, I were unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to that higheſt bounty, if I ſhould make my ſelfe ſo poore, as to ſollicite needily any ſuch kinde of <hi>rich hopes</hi> as this Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller dreams of.

The feind therefore that told our <hi>Chaldean</hi> the contrary was a lying feind.

               </gap>y whom God hath ſet apart to his miniſtery, are by him endu'd with an ability of prayer; becauſe their office is to pray for others. And not to be the lip-working deacons of other mens appointed words. Nor is it eaſily credible that he who can preach well ſhould be unable to pray well; when as it is indeed the ſame ability to ſpeak affirmatively, or doctrinally, and only by changing the mood to ſpeak prayingly. In vaine therefore do they pretend to want ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance in prayer, who can finde utterance to preach. And if prayer be the guift of the Spirit, why do they admit thoſe to the Miniſtery, who want a maine guift of their function, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe guifted men to uſe that which is the remedy of another mans want; ſetting them their tasks to read, whom the Spirit of God ſtands ready to aſſiſt in his ordinance with the guift of free conceptions. What if it be granted to the infirmity of ſome Miniſters (though ſuch ſeeme rather to be halfe miniſters) to help themſelves with a ſet forme, ſhall it therefore be urg'd upon the plenteous graces of others? and let it be granted to ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple while they are babes in Chriſtian guifts, were it not better to take it away ſoone after, as we do loitering books, and <hi>interline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> tranſlations from children; to ſtirre up and exerciſe that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit which is in them, &amp; not impoſe it upon congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations who not only deny to need it, but as a thing trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and offenſive refuſe it. Another reaſon which he brings for liturgie, is <hi>the preſerving of order, unity, and piety,</hi> and the ſame ſhall be my reaſon againſt Liturgy. For I Readers, ſhall alwayes be of this opinion, that obedience to the Spirit of God, rather then to the faire ſeeming pretences of men, is the beſt and moſt dutifull order that a Chriſtian can obſerve. If the Spirit of God manifeſt the guift of prayer in his Miniſter, what more ſeemely order in the congregation, then to go along with that man in our devouteſt affections? for him to abridge himſelfe by reading, and to foreſtall himſelfe in thoſe petitions, which he muſt either omit, or vainly repeat, when he comes into the Pulpit under a ſhew of order, is the greateſt diſorder. Nor is unity leſſe broken, eſpecially by our Liturgy, though this author would almoſt bring the Communion of Saints to a Communion of Liturgicall words. For what other reformed Church holds communion

               </gap>ieſt nor people ſpeak any intire ſenſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves throughout the whole I know not what to name it; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the timely contribution of their parted ſtakes, cloſing up as it were the <hi>ſchiſme</hi> of a ſlic't prayer, they pray not in vaine, for by this means they keep life betweene them in a piece of gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſenſe, and keep downe the ſawcineſſe of a continuall reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nonſenſe. And hence it is that as it hath been farre from the imitation of any warranted prayer, ſo we all know it hath bin obvious to be the pattern of many a Jig. And he who hath but read in good books of devotion and no more, cannot be ſo either of eare or judgement unpractiz'd to diſtinguiſh what is grave, <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall,</hi> devout, and what not, but will preſently perceave this Liturgy all over in conception leane and dry, of affections empty and unmoving, of paſſion, or any heigth whereto the ſoule might ſoar upon the wings of zeale, deſtitute and barren: beſides er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57327:26"/>
               <hi>tautologies,</hi> impertinences, as thoſe thanks in the womans Churching for her delivery from Sunburning and Moonblaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if ſhe had bin travailing not in her bed, but in the deſerts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> So that while ſome men ceaſe not to admire the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable frame of our Liturgy, I cannot but admire as faſt what they think is become of judgement, and taſt in other men, that they can hope to be heard without laughter. And if this were all, perhaps it were a complyable matter. But when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this our liturgy where we found it, whence we had it, and yet were we left it, ſtill ſerving to all the abominations of the Antichriſtian temple, it may be wonder'd how we can demurre whether it ſhould be done away or no, and not rather feare we have highly offended in uſing it ſo long. It hath indeed bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be more ancient then the Maſſe, but ſo little prov'd, that whereas other corrupt Liturgies have had withall ſuch a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming antiquity, as that their publiſhers have ventur'd to aſcribe them with their worſt corruptions either to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Mark,</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> or <hi>Baſil,</hi> ours hath bin never able to find either age, or author allowable, on whom to father thoſe things therein which are leaſt offenſive, except the two Creeds, for <hi>Te Deum</hi> has a ſmach in it of <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi> As if Chriſt had not <hi>open'd the kingdome of heaven</hi> before he had <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſharpneſſe of death.</hi> So that having receav'd it from the Papall Church as an originall creature, for ought can be ſhewn to the contrary, form'd and faſhion'd by work maiſters ill to be truſted, we may be aſſur'd that if God loathe the beſt of an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters prayer, much more the conceited fangle of his prayer. This Confuter himſelfe confeſſes that a community of the ſame ſet forme in prayers, is that which <hi>makes Church and Church truly one</hi>; we then uſing a Liturgy farre more like to the Maſſe-book then to any Proteſtant ſet forme, by his owne words muſt have more communion with the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> then with any of the reformed. How can we then not partake with them the curſe and vengeance of their ſuperſtition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom we come ſo neere in the ſame ſet forme and dreſſe of our devotion? do we thinke to ſift the matter finer then we are ſure God in his jealouſie will? who deteſted both the gold, and the ſpoile of Idolatrous Cities, and forbid the eating of things offer'd to Idols. Are we ſtronger then he to brook that which his heart cannot brook? It is not ſurely becauſe we think that praiers are no where to be had but at

We ſtand for a Popiſh Liturgy as for the ark of our Cov'nant. And ſo little does it appeare our prayers are from the heart, that multitudes of us declare, they know not how to pray but by rote. Yet they can learnedly invent a prayer of their own to the Parlament, that they may ſtill ignorantly read the prayers of other men to God.

To which let him heare in briefe; that thoſe Prieſts whoſe vices have been notorious, are all Prelaticall, which argues both the impiety of that opinion, and the wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſſe of that government. We hear not of any which are call'd <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> that have been accus'd for ſcandalous living; but are known to be pious, or at leaſt ſober men. Which is a great good argument, that they are in the truth and Prelats in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. He would be reſolv'd next <hi>What the corruptions of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities concerne the Prelats?</hi> and to that let him take this, That the Remonſtrant having ſpok'n as if learning would decay with the removall of Prelats, I ſhew'd him that while books were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and in print, learning could not readily be at a worſe paſſe in the Univerſities then it was now under their government. Then he ſeeks to juſtifie the pernicious Sermons of the Clergy, as if they upheld ſoveranty, when as all Chriſtian ſoveranty is by law, and to no other end but to the maintenance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. But their doctrine was plainly the diſſolution of law which only ſets up ſov'ranty, and the erecting of an arbitrary ſway according to privat will, to which they would enjoyne a ſlaviſh obedience without law; which is the known definition of a tyrant, and a tyranniz'd people.

Becauſe neither we, nor the Prelats can abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh widows houſes which are but an occaſion taken of evill without the Church, therefore we ſhall ſet up within the Church a Lottery of ſuch prizes as are the direct invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cauſes of avarice and ambition, both unneceſſary and harmefull to be propos'd, and moſt eaſie, moſt convenient, and needfull to be remov'd. <hi>Yea but they are in a wiſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers hand.</hi> Let them be in whoſe hand they will, they are moſt apt to blind, to puffe up and pervert the moſt ſeeming good. And how they have bin kept from Vultures, what ever the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers care hath bin, we have learnt by our miſeries. But this which comes next in view, I know not what good vein, or humor took him, when he let drop into his paper.

               </hi> he hath met withall, <hi>as he would never deſire to have them better cloth'd.</hi> For me, Readers, although I cannot ſay that I am utterly untrain'd in thoſe rules which beſt Rhetoricians have giv'n, or unacquainted with thoſe examples which the primeau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of eloquence have written in any learned tongu, yet true elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I find to be none, but the ſerious and hearty love of truth: And that whoſe mind ſo ever is fully poſſeſt with a fervent deſire to know good things, and with the deareſt charity to infuſe the knowledge of them into others, when ſuch a man would ſpeak, his words (by what I can expreſſe) like ſo many nimble and airy ſervitors trip about him at command, and in well order'd files, as he would wiſh, fall aptly into their own places. But now to the remainder of our diſcours. Chriſt refus'd great riches, and large honours at the Devils hand. But why, ſaith he, <hi>as they were tender'd by him from whom it was a ſin to receave them.</hi> Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember'd: why is it not therefore as much a ſin to receave a Liturgy of the maſſes giving, were it for nothing elſe but for the giver? <hi>But he could make no uſe of ſuch a high eſtate,</hi> quoth the Confuter; opportunely. For why then ſhould the ſervant take upon him to uſe thoſe things which his maſter had unfitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57327:30"/>
to uſe, that hee might teach his miniſters to follow his ſteps in the ſame miniſtery. But <hi>they were offer'd him to a bad end.</hi> So they prove to the Prelats; who after their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt uſually change the teaching labour of the word, into the unteaching eaſe of Lordſhip over conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and purſes. But hee proceeds, <hi>God entic't the Iſraelites with the promiſe of Canaan.</hi> Did not the Prelats bring as ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh mindes with them, as the Jewes brought out of Egypt, they had left out that inſtance. Beſides that it was then the time, when as the beſt of them, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>was ſhut up unto the faith under the Law</hi> their School-maiſter, who was forc't to intice them as children with childiſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements. But the Goſpell is our manhood, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery ſhould bee the manhood of the Goſpell, not to looke after, much leſſe ſo baſely to plead for earthly rewards. <hi>But God incited</hi> the wiſeſt man <hi>Salomon with theſe means.</hi> Ah Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer of thy ſelfe, this example hath undone thee, <hi>Salomon</hi> askt an underſtanding heart, which the Prelats have little care to ask. He askt no riches which is their chiefe care: therefore was the prayer of <hi>Salomon</hi> pleaſing to God: hee gave him wiſdome at his requeſt, and riches without asking: as now hee gives the Prelats riches at their ſeeking, and no wiſdome becauſe of their perverſe asking. But hee gives not over yet, <hi>Moſes had an eye to the reward.</hi> To what reward, thou man that looks't with <hi>Balaams</hi> eyes, to what reward had the faith of <hi>Moſes</hi> an eye to? He that had forſaken all the greatneſſe of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and choſe a troubleſome journey in his old age through the Wilderneſſe, and yet arriv'd not at his journies end: His faithfull eyes were fixt upon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible reward, promis'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> hee ſought a heav'nly reward which could make him happy, and never hurt him, and to ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every good man may have a reſpect. But the Prelats are eager of ſuch rewards as cannot make them happy, but can only make them worſe. <hi>Iacob</hi> a Prince borne, vow'd, that if God would <hi>but give him bread to eat and raiment to put on, then the Lord ſhould be his God.</hi> But the Prelats of meane birth, and oft times of loweſt, making ſhew as if they were call'd to the ſpirituall and humble miniſtery of the Goſpell,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57327:30"/>
yet murmur, and thinke it a hard ſervice, unleſſe contrary to the tenour of their profeſſion, they may eat the bread and weare the honours of Princes. So much more covetous and baſe they are then <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> for he proffer'd a reward to be admitted to that work, which they will not be mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hir'd to. But ſaith he, <hi>Are not the Clergy members of Chriſt, why ſhould not each member thrive alike?</hi> Carnall textman! As if worldly thriving were one of the priviledges wee have by being in Chriſt, and were not a providence oft times extended more liberally to the Infidell then to the Chriſtian. Therefore muſt the Miniſters of Chriſt not be over rich or great in the world, becauſe their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is ſpirituall, not ſecular; becuaſe they have a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warfare, which is not to be intangl'd with many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments: becauſe their Maiſter Chriſt gave them this precept, and ſet them this example, told them this was the myſtery of his comming, by meane things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſubdue mighty ones: and laſtly becauſe a middle eſtate is moſt proper to the office of teaching. Whereas higher dignity teaches farre leſſe, and blindes the teacher. Nay, ſaith the Confuter, fetching his laſt indeavour, <hi>The Prelats will be very loath to let go their Baronies, and votes in Parlament,</hi> and calls it <hi>Gods cauſe,</hi> with an unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impudence. <hi>Not that they love the honours and the means,</hi> good men and generous, <hi>but that they would not have their countrey made guilty of ſuch a ſacrilege and injuſtice.</hi> A wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patriot for his owne corrupt ends! That which hee imputes as ſacrilege to his countrey, is the only way left them to purge that abominable ſacrilege out of the land, which none but the Prelats are guilty of. Who for the diſcharge of one ſingle duty receave and keepe that which might bee anough to ſatisfie the labours of many paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters better deſerving then themſelves. Who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe huge Benefices for lazie performances, great promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, only for the execution of a cruell diſgoſpelling ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. Who ingroſſe many pluralities under a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſident</hi> and ſlubbring diſpatch of ſoules. Who let hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of pariſhes famiſh in one <hi>Dioceſſe,</hi> while they the

Prelats are mute, and yet injoy that wealth that would furniſh all thoſe darke places with able ſupply, and yet they eat, and yet they live at the rate of Earles, and yet hoard up. They who chaſe away all the faithfull Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of the flocke, and bring in a dearth of ſpirituall food, robbing thereby the Church of her deareſt treaſure, and ſending heards of ſouls ſtarvling to Hell, while they feaſt and riot upon the labours of hireling Curats, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming and purloyning even that which by their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is allow'd, and left to the poore, and to repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Church. Theſe are they who have bound the land with the ſinne of Sacrilege, from which mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ingagement wee ſhall never be free, till wee have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally remov'd with one labour as one individuall thing Prelaty and Sacrilege. And herein will the King be a true defender of the Faith, not by paring or leſſning, but by diſtributing in due proportion the maintenance of the Church, that all parts of the Land may equally partake the plentifull and diligent preaching of the faith, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of Ceremonies thrown out, that delude and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the faith. And the uſurpation of Prelats laid levell, who are in words the Fathers, but in their deeds the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners of the faith. This is that which will beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme him in that glorious title. Thus yee have heard, Readers, how many ſhifts and wiles the Prelats have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to ſave their ill got booty. And if it be true, as in Scripture it is foretold, that pride and covetouſneſſe are the ſure ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For betweene this and the judgement day, doe not looke for any arch deceavers who in ſpight of reformation will uſe more craft, or leſſe ſhame to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their love of the world, and their ambition, then theſe Prelats have done. And if yee thinke that ſoundneſſe of reaſon, or what force of argument ſoever, will bring them to an ingenuous ſilence, yee think that which will never be.
