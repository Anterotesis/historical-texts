         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER
That would be safe and happy.</head>
            <p>IF it were only possible thou mayst live hereafter, and
be called to account in another world for what thou
dost in this, it would be thy wisdom to take the
safest course, and not to run the constant hazard of
being dragg'd by death to Iudgment, before thou wert
prepar'd to meet thy Iudge. But <hi>another Life,</hi> and a
<hi>Judgment to come,</hi> are more than possible; there is an
high probability, yea as great a certainty as can with
reason he expected, that death will not put an end to thy
being, that thou shalt live after the return of thy body to
the Earth, and that then thou shalt be tryed, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to such an happiness or misery, as will be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
greater than any thing, nay than all thou didst
ever feel or see, hear of or imagine. These weighty Truths
are taught and establisht in some measure by the Light of
Nature, but much more clearly and firmly by the Oracles
of God in the Holy Scriptures. Besides what they say of
the different states of separated Souls, they plainly
teach, and strongly assert, <hi>That God hath appointed
a time in which he will judge the whole world
by the Mediator Jesus Christ; that that great
Mediator who is God as well as Man, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from Heaven, attended by its glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
with triumphant Acclamations to his
Royal Throne; that a mighty Voice will cite all
that ever dwelt on Earth to make their personal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
that that awakening and commanding
Summons shall be presently heard and obeyed by
<pb facs="tcp:44948:4"/>
the dead, and they with the quick then remaining
alive, shall all stand before the Judgment Seat;
that after a throughly searching and impartial tryal,
which will reach mens several talents, trusts and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of getting and doing good, and their
most secret actions, words and thoughts, every one
shall receive an unalterable Sentence of Absolution
or Condemnation; and that then such as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
and absolv'd, shall inherit an heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
prepared for them from the foundation of
the world, be like the Angels their delightful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
converse with their most amiable and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Saviour, beholding and partaking of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yea resemble, see and enjoy God himself in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
Holiness, and everlasting Bliss: And those
on the other hand, that are reprobated and damn'd
shall never be admitted into the Regions of Light,
nor yet be favour'd with a glimpse thereof; but
suffer with Devils in the blackness of darkness for
ever, the perpetual gnawings of the Worm that
dieth not, and the extreme torments of unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fire.</hi> Seeing then these things cannot be denied,
thou must be guilty of such woful abuses of reason as far
exceed all the extravagancies of them that want it;
thou must be most grosly foolish, most unnaturally cruel
to thine own Soul, to thy whole self, if thou dost not
earnestly desire to be one of those unto whom the Lord
shall say, <hi>Come ye blessed,</hi> and not, <hi>Depart ye cursed;</hi>
if thou dost not readily welcom, and diligently use any
proper helps for the avoiding of the heaviest endless mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
and for the attaining of the purest, vastest, everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happiness. And such helps are now offered thee in
this little Book, which hath a taking tincture of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Author's flaming love to God, and useful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Souls of men; and now it is in thine hand,
let me tell thee, it cannot be refus'd the reading, or rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
without doing what it so plainly teacheth and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb facs="tcp:44948:4"/>
urgeth, but at thy greatest peril. If thou wilt
not be at a small expence of time and pains to read it
over, if after the neglect of so many means of instruction
this also be rejected, how justly mayst thou be <hi>destroyed
for lack of knowledge?</hi> How soon may <hi>the things
which belong unto thy peace be hid from thine eyes?</hi>
A continued wilful <hi>want of understanding</hi> is large
ground for fear, lest <hi>he that made thee should not
have mercy on thee, and he that form'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
thee should shew thee no favour:</hi> If thou
readest, but dost not practise what Scripture and Reason
so pathetically plead for, the <hi>increase of thy knowledge
will increase thy sorrow,</hi> because it will aggravate thy
sin; for <hi>to him that knows his Lords will, how and
why to do good, and doth it not but the forbidden
evil, to him 'tis heinous, inexcusable sin, for which
he is liable to be beaten with many stripes, in</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
dreadful danger of severer punishment. I hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou wilt peruse so short a discourse, and art not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to do it in such a manner as to grow acquainted
with, and be perswaded to thy great duty, and which is
inseparable from it, thy greatest advantage; and that
thou may'st not fail thereof, is the design of the following
Directions.</p>
            <p>1. Pray in the name of Christ as thou art and shalt be
enabled, for the more effectual assistances of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Such is the corruption of our nature, that it utterly
disables to make a saving use of outward means without
inward aids. Unless the Spirit by his powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
work thee into a serious teachable temper, set home
the attempts of Gods Messengers, and give them an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
far beyond their own, the most concerning truths and
weightiest arguments can never be so represented and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd,
as to overcome thy sensual, worldly inclinations,
rescue thee from the dominion of sin and Satan, and bring
thee back to God. Thou must therefore pray, and that
<pb facs="tcp:44948:5"/>
with becoming apprehensions of the great God, due regard
to the gracious Mediator, deep shame and sorrow for the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ins thou confessest, ardent desires of all the grace thou
beggest, and faithful improvements of such measures as
thou hast already received. And if thou thus askest,
with fervent importunity and persevering constancy, thou
wilt undoubtedly find that <hi>God bade thee not to seek his
face in vain.</hi> As our Lord warrants us to argue, Luke
<hi>II. If a man will not deny a Friend what he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
for, and if a Father will grant his Son
what he asks and wants, much more will thy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father give thee the Holy Spirit for all needful
purposes, to produce all those effects in thee, that
are truly necessary for thine Eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Consider seriously what thou readest, and work it on
thy Soul as far as thou art concern'd therein. Medicines
for the Body will operate though they are not thought of;
but Spiritual Remedies for the mind require its co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with them; the clearest explications, fullest proofs
and strongest motives about matters of nearest and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
concernment will not do the Soul any good, unless by
thinking it apply them, and extract their vertue; nor will
the Spirit heal its lamentable Diseases, if his influences
be not answer'd with suitable endeavours. <hi>Work</hi> then as
he works in and with thee; take into most serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
whatever is apt to promote thy recovery; lay those
things closest to heart which are likeliest to cure the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof; inculcate and urge them, and withal cry
mightily unto him, <hi>who is able, and no less willing to
help thee,</hi> till thou feelest his gentle force, and comest to
a conquering resolution, that thou must and wilt do as
thou art advis'd, till thou dost not only assent to the course
propos'd as fit to be taken, but art steadily determin'd,
that it is best for thee, that it is absolutely necessary, and
must effectually be prosecuted; that by the grace of God
thou wilt thoroughly change thy heart and life, and so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
<pb facs="tcp:44948:5"/>
from the greatest evil, and make sure of the chiefest
good.</p>
            <p>3. When thou hast seriously consider'd and resolv'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
presently to practise, with all thy might, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least delay. 'Tis commonly a work of some time
to alter the temper of the Soul, and change the course of
the life; and according to God's usual methods, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
thou hast been accustom'd to do evil, the more time and
pains will be requisite, to break the force of stubborn lusts,
to weaken and subdue vitious habits, and to gain those of
grace and goodness, to travel back the way thou hast gone
wrong, and to get out of it into the path of life. 'Tis well
then if there be days enough before thee to do the <hi>one thing
needful,</hi> to be sure thou art not certain of an hour to spare,
the loss of so small a part may prove the loss of all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
if thou putt'st off thy reformation though but for a
little while, 'tis a sign thou dost not really intend it at all,
for thou purposest against conviction to add sin to sin at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and how can that consist with an hearty design of
growing good afterward? Delude not therefore thy self
with such a desperate cheat, but imitate the Royal Ps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
<hi>When thou hast thought on thy ways turn thy
feet unto Gods testimonies; Make haste and delay
not to keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Remember that conversion unto God is but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of thy duty, that thou must afterward obey him all
the days of thy life, and that there is no other way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
an interest in his favour, and a right to the great
expressions thereof. They are the largest and the last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of Divine Grace, that <hi>teach thee to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness
and worldly lusts, to live soberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and godly in this present world, and so doing
to look for the blessed Object of thy hope;</hi> they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough warn thee against <hi>drawing back unto perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
they threaten a <hi>final rejection if thou deniest thy
<pb facs="tcp:44948:6"/>
Saviour in words or works,</hi> and they oft direct and
command thee to <hi>seek for glory and honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
by patient continuance in well-doing;
to be faith ful unto death whatever it cost thee, that
thy Lord may give thee a crown of life:</hi> These may
seem hard sayings, but they contain nothing like a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
discouragement. There's misery more than enough in
Hell to necessitate a prevention by any temporary labours,
wants and suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rings, and an abundantly sufficient happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Heaven to encourage a <hi>stedfast</hi> perseverance in the
work of the Lord, though it were more harsh and grievous
than sinners imagine. And even at present, Religion is
not without a reward, yea thou wilt find it, if thou triest
as thou shouldst, a reward to it self, when the main diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
at first are over, thy duty will grow daily easier,
it will have many pleasures mixed with it, and become
at length it self the greatest. It will not abridge thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
of any desirable gratifications, but give them a
new delicious relish of the Fountain from which they flow.
Instead of the girds and twinges of a bad Conscience, and
dread of an after-reckoning, 'twill settle peace within,
and fill thee with comfortable reflections and joyful hopes;
and a loving, thankful, praising obedience will by degrees
become thy sweetest employment. Therein thou may'st <hi>draw
still nearer to God, delight thy self in, and receive
from him the desires of thine heart,</hi> thou may'st walk
always in the <hi>light of his countenance,</hi> and feed on <hi>his
loving kindness, which is better than life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, before thou ascendest to Heaven thou may'st be
in an Heaven on Earth, and find by happy experience,
that the way to have all thou canst wish hereafter, is to
be and do what is best for thy self here.</p>

            <head>An Earnest Invitation to Sinners to
Turn to God in order to their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Salvation.</head>
            <p>DEarly Beloved, and longed for, I gladly
acknowledge my self a debter to you
all, and am concerned, as I would be
found a good Steward to the Houshold of
God, to give to every one his Portion. But the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
is most solicitous for those Patients, whose case
is most doubtful and hazardous, and the Father's
bowels are especially turned towards his dying Child.
The numbers of the unconverted souls among you,
call for my most earnest compassions and hasty dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to pluck them out of the burning, <hi>Iude</hi> 23. and
therefore to these first I shall apply my self in these
lines.</p>
            <p>But whence shall I fetch my arguments, or how
shall I choose my words? Lord, wherewith shall I
woo them? wherewith shall I win them? Oh that I
could but tell! I would write unto them in tears,
would weep out every argument, I would empty my
veins for Ink, I would petition them on my knees,
verily (were I able) I would. O how thankful I
would be, if they would be prevailed with to repent
and turn.</p>
            <p>How long have I travelled in birth with you?
how frequently have I made suit to you? how
often would I have gathered you? how instant have
I been with you? this is that I have prayed for, and
studied for, for many years, that I might bring you
to God: Oh that I might but do it! Will you yet be
intreated? Oh what a happy man might you make
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44948:9"/>
me, if you would but hearken to me, and suffer me
to carry you over to Jesus Christ!</p>
            <p>But, Lord, how insufficient am I for this work! I have
been many a year wooing for thee, but the Damsel would
not go with me. Lord, what a task hast thou set me to do!
Alas, wherewith shall I pierce the scales of Leviathan, or
make the heart to feel that is hard as a stone; hard as a
piece of the nether Milstone! Shall I go and lay my mouth
to the grave, and look when the dead will obey me and
come forth? Shall I make an Oration to the Rocks? or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
to the Mountains, and think to move them with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments?
Shall I give the blind to see? From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world was it not heard that a man opened the
eyes of the blind; But thou, O Lord, canst pierce the scales
and prick the heart of the Sinner. I can but shoot at ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and draw the bow at a venture, and do thou direct
the arrow between the joynts of the harness, and kill the
sin, and save the Soul of a sinner, that casts his eyes into
these labours.</p>
            <p>But I must apply my self to you, to whom I am
sent: yet I am at a great loss. Would to God I knew
how to go to work with you! would I stick at the
pains? God knoweth you your selves are my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
how I have followed you in private, as well
as in publick, and have brought the Gospel to your
doors, testifying to you the necessity of the new
birth, and persuading you to look in time after a
sound and thorough change. Beloved, I have not
acted a part among you, to serve my own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
your Gospel is not yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and nay. Have you not
heard the same truths, from the Pulpit, by publick
labours, and by private letters, by personal instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
Brethren, I am of the same mind as ever,
that holiness is the best choice, that there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Heaven, but by the streight passages of the
second birth, that without holiness you shall never
see God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Ah my beloved! refresh my
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44948:9"/>
bowels in the Lord. <hi>If there be any consolation in Christ,
any comfort of love, any fellowship of the Spirit, any bowels
and mercies, fulfil you my joy.</hi> Now give your selves
unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. Now set your selves to
seek him. Now set up the Lord Jesus in your heares,
and set him up in your houses: Now come in and
kiss the Son, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 12. and embrace the tenders of
mercy. Touch his Scepter and live; why will you
die? I beg not for my self; but fain I would have
you happy: This is the prize I run for, and the white
I aim at. My soul's desire and prayer for you is, that
you may be saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
            <p>The famous <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> having instituted most strict
and wholesom Laws for his people, told them he
was necessitated to go a Journey from them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and got
them to bind themselves in an Oath, that his Laws
should be observed till his return. This done, he
went into a voluntary banishment, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
more, that they might, by vertue of their
Oath, be engaged to the perpetual observing of his
Laws. Methinks I should be glad of the hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
which he endured (though I love you tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
so I might but hereby engage you throughly to
the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved, would you rejoyce the heart of
your Minister? Why then, embrace the Counsels of
the Lord by me: forgo your sins: set to prayer: up
with the Worship of God in your families: keep at
a distance from the corruptions of the times. What
greater joy to a Minister, than to hear of souls born
unto Christ by him, and that his Children walk in the
truth? 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Brethren, I beseech you suffer friendly plainness
and freedom with you in your deepest concernments.
I am not playing the Orator, to make a learned
speech to you, nor dressing my dish with eloquence,
wherewith to please you. These lines are upon a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44948:10"/>
weighty errand indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> to convince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
and to save you. I am not baiting my hook
with Rhetorick, nor fishing for your applause,
but for your souls. My work is not to please you,
but to save you; nor is my business with your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but your hearts. If I have not your hearts, I
have nothing. If I were to please your ears, I could
sing another song. If I were to preach my self, I
would steer another course; I could then tell you a
smoother tale: I would make you pillows, and
speak you peace; for how can <hi>Ahab</hi> love this <hi>Micaiah</hi>
that always prophesies evil concerning him? 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
22. 8. But how much better are the wounds of a
Friend, than the fair speeches of the Harlot, who
flattereth with her lips, till the Dart strike through
the liver, and hunteth for the precious life? <hi>Prov.</hi>
7. 21, 22, 23. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 26. If I were to quiet a
crying infant, I might sing him to a pleasant mood,
and rock him asleep. But when the Child is fallen
into the Fire, the parent takes another course; he
will not go to still him with a song or trifle. I know
if we speed not with you, you are lost. If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get your consent to arise, and come away, you
perish for ever. No Conversion, and no Salvation:
I must get your good will, or leave you miserable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here the difficulty of my work again recurs
upon me.</hi> Lord choose my stones out of the Rocks, <hi>1 Sam.
17. 40, 45.</hi> I come in the name of the Lord of Hosts,
the God of the Armies of <hi>Israel.</hi> I come forth like the
stripling <hi>Goliah,</hi> to wrestle, not with flesh and blood, but
with Principalities and Powers, and the Rulers of the
darkness of this world, <hi>Eph. 6. 12.</hi> This day let the Lord
smite the Philistine, and spoil the strong man of his Armour
and give me to fetch off the captives out of his hand. Lord
choose my words, choose my weapons for me, and when I put
my hand into the bag, and take thence a stone, and sling it,
do thou carry it to the mark and make it sink, not into
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44948:10"/>
the forehead, <hi>1 Sam. 17. 49.</hi> but the heart of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
sinner, and smite him to the ground, with <hi>Saul</hi> in
his so happy fall, <hi>Acts 9. 4.</hi> Thou hast sent me, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did <hi>Eliezer,</hi> to take a wife unto my master thy Son,
<hi>Gen. 24. 4.</hi> But my discouraged soul is ready to fear the
woman will not be willing to follow me. O Lord God of
my Master, I pray thee send me good speed this day, and
shew kindness to my Master, and send thine Angel before
me, and prosper my way, that I may take a wife unto thy
son, <hi>Gen. 24. 12.</hi> That as the servant rested not till he had
brought <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah</hi> together, so I may be success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to bring Christ and the souls of my people together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we part.</p>
            <p>But I turn me unto you. Some of you do not
know what I mean by conversion, and in vain shall
I persuade you to that which you do not understand,
and therefore for your sakes, I shall shew <hi>what this
Conversion is.</hi> Others do cherish secret hopes of
mercy, though they continue as they be; and for
them I must shew the <hi>necessity of Conversion.</hi> Others
are like to harden themselves with a vain conceit,
that they are converted already, unto them I must

or putting on the badge of Christ in baptism.
Many take the press-money, and wear the Livery
of Christ, that yet never stand to their colours,
nor follow their leader. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and
<hi>Magus</hi> were baptized as well as the rest. How fondly
do many mistake here, deceiving, and being deceived!
dreaming that effectual grace is necessarily tied to
the external administration of Baptism (which
what is it, but to revive the Popish Tenent, of the
Sacraments working grace, <hi>ex opere operato?)</hi> and so
every Infant should be regenerated not only (<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento
tenus</hi>) sacramentally, but really and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.
Hence men do fancy, that being regenerated
already, when baptized, they need no further work.</p>
               <p>But if this were so, then all that were baptized (in
their infancy) must necessarily be saved: because
the promise of pardon and salvation is made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and regeneration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acts 3. 19. 1 Pet. 3. 4. Mat.</hi> 19. 28. Our Calling,
Sanctification, (as to the beginnings of it) on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version

conceptions and expressions) is but a middle

link in the golden chain, fastned to election at the
one end, and glorification at the other, <hi>Rom. 8. 30.
2 Thes. 2. 13. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. The silver cord may not be
broken, nor the connexion between Sanctification
and Salvation, between grace and glory, impious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
violated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. if we were indeed begotten
again, it is to an inheritance incorruptible reserved
in heaven for us, and the divine power is engaged
to keep us for it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. And if the very rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
may perish at last in their sins, we will no
more say, that he that is born of God, his seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
in him, and that he cannot sin, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 9.
i. e.</hi> unto death, nor that it is impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the very elect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24.</p>
               <p>And indeed were this true, then we need look no
farther to see our names written in Heaven, than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to search the Register, and see whether we were
baptized: then I would keep the certificate of my
baptism, as my fairest evidence for Heaven, and
should come by assurance of my gracious state,
with a wet finger; then men should do well to carry
but a certificate of their baptism under the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
hand, when they died (as the Philosopher
would be buried with the Bishops Bond in his hand
which he had given him for receiving his alms in
another world,) and upon sight of this, there were
no doubt of their admission into Heaven.</p>
               <p>In short, if there be no more necessary to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or regeneration, than to be turned to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, or to be baptized in infancy, this will
flie directly in the face of that Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14.
as well as multitudes of others. For first we will
then no more say, <hi>strait is the gate and narrow is the
way;</hi> for if all that are baptized, and of true Religion
are saved, the door is become heavenly wide, and
we will henceforth say, wide is the gate, and broad
is the way that leadeth unto life; for if this be true,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44948:12"/>
whole Parishes, yea whole Countries, and whole
Kingdoms may go in a breast, and we will no more
teach, that the righteous is scarcely saved, or that
there is need of such a stir in taking the Kingdom of
Heaven by violence, and striving to enter in. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the way be so easie as many make it, that there
is little more necessary, than to be regenerated in
our baptism, and cry God mercy, and be absolved
by the Minister at our end; 'tis more ado than needs
to put our selves to such running, and seeking, and
knocking, and fighting, and wrestling, as the word
requires as necessary to Salvation. Secondly, if
this be true, we will no more say, <hi>Few there be that
find it;</hi> yea we will rather say, <hi>Few there be that miss
it:</hi> we will no more say, that of the many that are
called, <hi>but few are chosen, Mat.</hi> 22. 14. and that
even of the professing <hi>Israel, but a remnant shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Rom.</hi> 11. 5. If this Doctrine be true, we will
not say any more with the Disciples, <hi>Who then shall
be saved?</hi> but rather who then shall not be saved?
Then if a man be called a brother, (that is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian)
and be baptized, though he be a fornicator,
or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ailer, or covetous, or a drunkard, yet he
shall inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 11.
1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Arminian</hi> will reply; such as these though
they did receive regenerating grace in Baptism, are
since fallen away, and must be renewed again, or
else they cannot be saved.</p>
               <p>I answer, 1. That there is an infallible connexion
between regeneration and salvation, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewed, and I itch to be farther evidencing
but that 'tis against designed brevity. 2. Then men
must be born again, which carrys a great deal of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
in its very face. And why may not men be
twice born in nature, as well as in grace? Why not
as great an absurdity to be twice regenerated as to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44948:13"/>
twice generated? But 3. and above all, This grants
however the thing I contend for, that what ever
men do, or pretend to receive in baptism, if they
be sound afterwards to be grosly ignorant, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
or formal, without the power of godliness,
they must be born again, or else be shut out of the
Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gdom of God. So then they must have more
to plead for themselves, than their baptismal rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>Well, in this you see all are agreed, that be it
more or less that is received in baptism, if (when
men come to years) they are evidently unsanctified,
they must be renewed again by a through and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
change, or else they cannot escape the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hell. Friends and Brethren be not deceived
God is not mocked; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. Whether it be your
baptism, or what ever else that you pretend, I tell
you from the living God, that if any of you be a
prayerless person, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 14. or unclean, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
or covetous, or riotous, or a scoffer, or a
lover of evil company, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. in a word, if
you are not holy, strict and self-denying Christians,
<hi>Heb. 12. 14. Mat.</hi> 16. 24. you cannot be saved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you be transformed by a further work upon
you, and renewed again by repentance.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewed, that it is not enough to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
a man to be regenerate, that he hath been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
effectual grace not necessarily accompanying
baptism, as some have vainly asserted. But I must
answer one Objection before I pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Sacraments do certainly attain their
ends, where man doth not <hi>ponere obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>em,</hi> or lay some
obstruction, which infants do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, it is not the end of Baptism to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
1. Because then there would be no reason,
why it should be confined only to the seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
for both the Law of God and the nature of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44948:13"/>
Charity, requires us to use the means of conversion
for all, as far as we can have opportunity. Were
this true, no such Charity as to catch the children
of Turks and Heathens, and baptize them, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
them to Heaven out of hand; like the bloody
Wretches, that made the poor Protestants (to save
their lives) to swear they would come to Mass,
and that they would never depart from it, and then
put them forthwith to death, saying, <hi>They would
hang them while in a good mind.</hi> 2. Because it presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
regeneration, and therefore cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to confer it. In all the express instances
in Scripture, we find that baptism doth suppose
their repenting, believing, receiving the Holy
Ghost, <hi>Acts 8. 37. Acts. 2. 38. Acts. 10. 47. Mark</hi>
16. 16. And to imagine, that baptism was instituted
for an end of which not one of the first subjects was
capable (for they were all adult persons and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to have faith and repentance according as they
professed, and their Children were not baptized till
after them, in their right,) were no little absurdity.
Were this Doctrine true, baptism would make Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but we find it doth bespeak them such before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. 3. Because Baptism, being but a
Seal of the Covenant cannot convey the benefits,
but according to the tenour of the Covenant, to
which it is set.</p>
               <p>Now the Covenant is conditional, therefore the
Seal conveys conditionally. The Covenant requires
faith and repentance, as the condition of the grand
benefits, pardon, and life, <hi>Acts 16. 31. Acts</hi> 3. 19.
And what the Covenant doth not convey but upon
these conditions, the Seal cannot. So that Baptism
doth presuppose faith and repentance in the subject,
without which it neither doth, nor can convey the
saving benefits; otherwise the Seal should convey
contrary to the tenour of the Covenant to which it
is affixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44948:14"/>
3. <hi>It lies not in a moral righteousness.</hi> This exceeds
not the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,
and therefore cannot bring us to the Kingdom of
God, <hi>Mat. 5. 20. Paul,</hi> while unconverted touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the righteousness which is in the Law blameless,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. None could say black is thine eye. The
self-justiciary could say, <hi>I am no Extortioner, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
Unjust,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. Thou must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than all this to shew, or else (however
thou mayest justifie thy self) God will condemn
thee. I condemn not morality, but warn you not
to rest here. Piety includes morality, as Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
doth humanity, and Grace reason. But we must
not divide the tables.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>It consists not in an external conformity to the Rules
of Piety</hi> 'Tis too manifest, men may have a form
of godliness, without the power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. Men
may pray long, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 14. and fast often, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.
12. and heav gladly, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. and be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the service of God, though costly and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 11. and yet be strangers to Conversion.
They must have more to plead for themselves, than
that they keep their Church, and give alms, and
make use of prayer to prove themselves sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.
No outward service but an hypocrite may do
it; even to the giving all his goods to the poor, and
his members to the fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>It lies not in the chaining up of corruption, by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
humane laws, or the force of incumbent affliction.</hi>
'Tis too common and easie, to mistake education for
grace; but if this were enough, who a better man
than <hi>Iehoash:</hi> While <hi>Iehojadah</hi> his uncle lived he was
very forward in Gods service, and calls upon him to
repair the house of the Lord, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 2, 7. But
here was nothing more than good education all this
while: for when his good Tutor was taken out of
the way, he appears to have been but a wolf chained
up; and falls on to Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44948:14"/>
6. <hi>In short, it consists only in illumination, or convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in a superficial change, or partial reformation.</hi> An <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi>
may be a man enlightned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and a <hi>Felix</hi> tremble
under convictions, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. and a <hi>Herod</hi>
amend many things, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 20. 'Tis one thing to
have sin alarm'd only by convictions, and another
to have it captivated and crucified by converting
grace. Many because they have been troubled in
conscience for their sins, think well of their case;
miserably mistaking conviction for Conversion.
With these <hi>Cain</hi> might have passed for a Convert,
who ran up and down the world, like a man distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
under the rage of a guilty conscience, till with
building and business he had worn it away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.
13, 14. Others think, that because they have given,
off their riotous courses, and are broken off from
evil company, or some particular lust, and reduced
to sobriety and civility, they are now no other
than real Converts, forgetting that there is a vast
difference between being sanctified, and civilized:
and that many seek to enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. and are not far from it, <hi>Mark.</hi>
12. 34. and arrive to the <hi>almost</hi> of Christianity, <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 28. and yet fall short at last. While conscience
holds the whip over them, many will pray, hear,
read, and forbear their delightful sins: but no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is this Lyon asleep, but they are at their Vomit
again. Who more religious than the <hi>Iews,</hi> when
Gods hand was upon them? <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34, 35. but
no sooner was the affiction over, but they forgot
God, and shewed their Religion to be a fit, <hi>ver.</hi>
36, 37. Thou mayst have disgorged a troublesome
fin, that will not sit in thy stomach, and have escaped
those gross pollutions of the world, and yet not
have changed thy swinish nature all the while, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>

               <p>You may cast the lead out of the rude mass, into
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44948:15"/>
the more comely proportion of a plant, and then
into the shape of a beast, and thence into the form
and features of a man; but all the while it is but lead
still. So a man may pass thro' divers transmutations,
from ignorance to knowledge, from profaneness
to civility, thence to a form of Religion; and all
this while he is but carnal and unregenerate, while
his nature remains unchanged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Application. Hear then O sinners, hear as you would
live; so come and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ear; Isa.</hi> 55. 3. Why would you so
wilfully deceive your selves, or build your hopes
upon the sand? I know he shall find hard work of it
that goes to pluck away your hopes. It cannot but
be ungrateful to you, and truly it is not pleasing to
me. I set about it as a Surgeon, when to cut off a
putrified Member from his well Beloved friend;
which of force he must do, but with an aking heart,
a pitiful eye, a trembling hand. But understand
me, Brethren, I am only taking down the ruinous
house, (which will otherwise speedily fall of it self,
and bury you in the rubbish) that I may build fair,
and strong, and firm for ever. The hope of the
wicked shall perish, if God be true of his word
<hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 7. And wert not thou better, O sinner,
to let the word convince thee now in time, and let
go thy false and self-deluding hopes, than to have
death too late to open thine eyes, and find thy self
in hell, before thou art aware? I should be a false
and faithless Shepherd, if I should not tell you, that
you who have built your hopes upon no better
grounds, than these forementioned, are yet in
your sins. Let your conscience speak? what is it,
that you have to plead for your selves? Is it that
you wear Christ's livery? that you bear his name?
that you are of the visible Church? that you have
knowledge in the Points of Religion? are civilized,
perform religious duties, are just in your dealings;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44948:15"/>
have been troubled in conscience for your sins? I
tell you from the Lord, these pleas will never be
accepted at God's Bar. All this, though good in it
self, will not prove you converted, and so will not
suffice to your salvation. Oh look about you, and
bethink your selves of turning speedily and soundly.
Set to praying, and to reading, and studying your
own hearts; rest not, till God hath made thorough
work with you; for you must be other men, or
else you are lost men.</p>
               <p>But if these be short of Conversion, what shall I
say of the profane sinner? It may be, he will scarce
cast his Eyes, or lend his Fars to this discourse. But
if there be any such reading, or within hearing, he
must know from the Lord that made him, that he is
far from the Kingdom of God. May a man be civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
and not converted; where then shall the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
and Glutton appear? May a man keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with the wise Virgins, and yet be shut out? Shall
not a companion of fools much more be destroyed?
<hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. May a man be true and just in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and yet not be justified of God? What then will
become of thee, O wretched man, whose conscience
tells thee thou art false in thy trade, and false of thy
word, and makest thy advantage by a lying tongue?
If men may be enlightned, and brought to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of holy duties, and yet go down to perdition,
for resting in them, and sitting down on this side of
conversion; what will become of you, O miserable
families, that live as without God in the world? and
of you, O wretched sinners, with whom God is
scarce in all your thoughts: that are so ignorant,
that you cannot, or so careless, that you will not
pray? O repent and be converted? break off your
sins by righteousness; away to Christ for pardoning
and renewing grace: give up your selves to him, to
walk with him in holiness, or else you shall never

God! In his name I once more admonish you.

praising and admiring God, whatever you are.
How can you make a shift to forget such grace, or to
pass it over with a slight and seldom mention; What

enmity could do it, or deformity could do it, unless

               <p>More particularly, this change of conversion pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
throughout in the whole subject. A carnal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may have some Shreds of good morality, a
little near the list, but he is never good throughout
the whole cloth, the whole body of Holiness and
Christianity; Feel him a little further near the ridge,
and you shall see him to be but a deceitful piece.
Conversion is not repairing of the old building,
but it takes all down and erects a new structure:
it is not the putting in a patch, or sowing on a list
of holiness; but with the true convert, holiness
is woven into all his powers, principles, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
The sincere Christian is quite a new fabrick,
from the foundation to the Top-stone, all fire-new.
He is a new man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. a new creature. All
things are become new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Conversion is
a deep work; a heart work, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. and 6. 14.
it turns all upside down, and makes a man be in a
new <hi>world.</hi> It goes throughout with Men, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Mind, throughout the Members, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Motions of the whole Life.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Throughout the Mind.</hi> It makes an universal
change within. First, it turns the ballance of the
judgment, so that God and his Glory do weigh
down all carnal and worldly interest, <hi>Acts 20. 24.
Phil. 1. 20. Psal.</hi> 73. 25. It opens the eye of the
mind, and makes the Scales of its Native Ignorance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44948:19"/>
to fall off, and turns men from darkness to light, <hi>Acts
26. 18. Eph. 5. 8. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. The man that before
saw no danger in his condition, now concludes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
lost and for ever undone, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. except
renewed by the power of Grace. He that formerly
thought there was little hurt in sin, now comes to
see it to be the chief of evils; he sees the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness,
unrighteousness, the deformity and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is in sin, so that he is affrighted with it,
loaths it, dreads it, flies it, and even abhors himself
for it, <hi>Rom. 7. 15. Iob 42. 6. Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. He that
could see little sin in himself, and could find no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for confession (as it was said of that learned Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who it seems while he knew
so <hi>much</hi> abroad, was a miserable stranger to himself)
that when he was to be confessed by the Priest, could
not remember any thing to confess; but was fain to
run back to the sins of his youth: I say he that
could not find matter for confession, unless it were
some few gross and staring evils, now sin reviveth
with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. he sees the rottenness of his
heart, and desperate and deep pollution of his
whole nature: he cries, unclean, unclean, <hi>Lev.</hi>
13. 45. Lord purge me with Hyssop, wash me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
create in me a new heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 2, 7, 10. He
sees himself altogether become filthy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3.
corrupt, both root and tree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 17, 18. he writes
unclean upon all his parts and powers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
<hi>Isa. 64. 6. Rom.</hi> 7. 18. He discovers the
nasty corners that he was never aware of, and sees
the blasphemy, and theft, and murder, and adultery
that is in his heart, which before he was ignorant
of. Heretofore he saw no form, nor comliness in
Christ, no beauty that he should desire him; but
now he finds the hid treasure, and will sell all to buy
this field. Christ is the pearl he seeks, sin the pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
he loaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44948:20"/>
Now according to this new light, the man is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mind, another judgment, than before he was:
Now God is all with him, he hath none in Heaven
nor in Earth like him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. He prefers him
truly before all the World; his favour is his life; the
light of his Countenance is more than Corn, or Wine,
and Oyl, (the good that he formerly enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and set his heart upon, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.) Now let
all the world be set on one side, and God alone
on the other; Let the Harlot put on her paint, and
gallantry, and present her self to the soul (as when
Satan would have tempted our Saviour with her)
in all the glory of her Kingdoms, yet the soul will
not fall down and worship her; but will prefer a
naked, yea a crucified, persecuted Christ before her,
<hi>Phil. 3. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 2. Not but that a Hypocrite may
come to yield a general assent to this, that God is
the chief good: yea the wiser Heathens (some few
of them) have at last stumbled upon this, but there
is a difference between the absolute and comparative
judgment of the understanding. No hypocrite comes
so far as to look upon God, as the most desirable and
suitable good to him, and thereupon to acquiesce in
him. This was the Converts voice, <hi>The Lord is my
portion, saith my soul: Whom have I in Heaven but thee?
and there is none upon earth, that I desire besides thee. God
is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever, Psal.
73. 25, 26. Lam.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, it turns the byass of the Will, both as to means
and end. (1.) The intention of the Will is altered, Ezek.
36. 26. Ier. 31. 33. Esay</hi> 26. 8, 9. Now the man
hath new ends and designs. Now he intends God
above all, and desires and designs nothing in all the
world so much, as that Christ may be magnified in
him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. He accounts himself more happy
in this, than in all that the earth could yield, that he
may be serviceable to Christ, and bring him glory
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44948:20"/>
in his generation. This is the mark he aims a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
that the name of Jesus may be great in the world,
and that all the Sheaves of his Brethren may bow to
this Sheaf.</p>
               <p>Reader, dost thou view this, and never ask thy self,
whether it be thus with thee? Pause a while, and
breath on this great concernment.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Election also is changed,</hi> so that he chooses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 30. He pitches upon God,
as his blessedness, and upon Christ as the principal,
and holiness as the subordinate means to bring him
to <hi>God, Iohn 14. 6. Rom.</hi> 2. 7. He chooses Jesus for
his Lord, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. He is not meerly forced into
Christ by the storm, nor doth he take Christ for
bare necessity, as the man begged from the gallows,
when he takes the wife rather than the halter: but
he comes off freely in the choice. This match is
not made in a fright as with the terrified conscience
or dying sinner; that will seemingly do any thing

Hell: but he deliberately resolves, that Christ is his
best choice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. and would rather have him
to choose, than all the good of this world, might he
enjoy it while he would. Again, he takes holiness
for his path: He doth not out of meer necessity
submit to it: but he likes and loves it. <hi>I have chosen
the way of thy Precepts, Ps.</hi> 119. 173. He takes God's
testimonies not as his bondage, but as his heritage,
yea his heritage for ever, <hi>v.</hi> 111. He counts them
not his burden, but his Bliss, not his cords, but his
cordials, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 3. Psal.</hi> 119. 14, 16, 17. He doth
not only bear, but take up Christ's yoke: He takes
not holiness as the stomach doth the loathed potion,
(which it will down with rather than dye) but as
the hungry doth his beloved food: Now time passes
so sweetly with him (when he is himself) as that he
spends in the exercises of holiness; these are both his

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It turns the bent of the affection,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.
11. These run all in a new channel. The <hi>Iordan</hi> is now
driven back, and the water runs upward against its
natural course.</p>
               <p>Christ is his <hi>Hope, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 1. this is his prize,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. here his eye is, here his heart is. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to cast all over board (as the merchant in
the Storm, ready to perish) so he may but keep this
Jewel.</p>
               <p>The first of his <hi>Desires</hi> is, not after gold, but grace,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. He hungers after it, he seeks it as silver,
he digs for it as for hid treasure; He had rather be
gracious, than be great; he had rather be the holiest
man on earth, than the most learned, the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
most prosperous. While carnal, he said: Oh
if I were but in great esteem, and rolled in wealth,
and swim'd in pleasure, if my debts were paid, and
I and mine provided for, then I were a happy man;
but now the tune is changed. Oh, saith the convert,
if I had but my corruptions subdued, if I had such
measures of grace, such fellowship with God, tho' I
were poor and despised, I should not care, I should
account my self a blessed man. Reader, is this the
language of thy soul?</p>
               <p>His <hi>Ioys</hi> are changed. He rejoyceth in the ways of
God's Testimonies, as much as in all Riches, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 14. He delights in the Law of the Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
once he had little favour. He hath no such Joy, as
in the thoughts of Christ, the fruition of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the prosperity of his people.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Cares</hi> are quite altered. He was once set for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44948:21"/>
World, and any scraps of by time, nothing (too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
was enough for his soul. Now he gives over ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for the Asses, and sets his heart on the Kingdom.
Now all the cry is, <hi>What shall I do to be saved? Acts</hi>
16. 30. His great solicitude is, how to secure his soul.
Oh! how he would bless you, if you could but put
him out of doubt of this!</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fears</hi> are not so much of suffering, but of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 27. Once he was afraid of nothing
so much as the loss of his estate, or esteem, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of friends, the frowns of the great: Nothing
sounded so terrible to him as pain, or poverty, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
Now these are little to him, in comparison of
God's <hi>dishonour or displeasure.</hi> How warily doth he
walk, lest he should tread on a sn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

he looks before and behind; he hath his eye
upon his heart, and is often casting over his shoulder;
lest he should be overtaken with sin, <hi>Psal. 39. 1. Prov.
28. 14. Eccles.</hi> 2. 14. It kills his heart to think of losing
Gods favour; this he dreads as his only undoing,
<hi>Psal. 51. 11, 12. Psal.</hi> 119. 8. No thought in the
world doth pinch him, and pain him so much, as to
think of parting with Christ.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Love</hi> runs a new course. My love was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(said holy <hi>Ignatius</hi>) that is, my Christ. This is
my Beloved, saith the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 18. How doth
<hi>Augustine</hi> often pour his loves upon Christ. <hi>O Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Blessedness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He can find no words sweet enough.</hi> Let me see
thee, O light of mine eyes. Come, O thou joy of my spirit;
Let me behold thee, O the gladness of my heart. Let me
love thee, O life of my soul. Appear unto me, O my great
delight, my sweet comfort, O my God, my life, and the
whole glory of my soul. Let me find thee, O desire of my
heart. Let me hold thee, O love of my soul. Let me embrace
thee, O heavenly Bridegroom. Let me possess thee.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Sorrows</hi> have now a new vent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9, 10. The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44948:22"/>
view of his sins, the sight of a Christ crucified, that
would scarce stir him before, now how much do
they affect his heart?</p>
               <p>His Hatred boils, his Anger burns against sin,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 104. He hath no patience with himself;
he calls himself fool, and beast, and thinks any
Name too good for himself, when his indignation
is stirred up against sin, <hi>Psal. 73. 22. Prov.</hi> 30. 2.
He could once swill in it, with too much pleasure,
now he loaths the thought of returning to it, as
much as of licking up the filthiest vomit.</p>
               <p>Commune then with <hi>thine</hi> own heart, and attend
the common and general current of thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whether it be towards God in Christ above all
other concernments. Indeed sudden and strong
commotions of the affections and sensitive part, are
oft-times found in Hypocrites, especially where the
natural constitution leads thereunto, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the sanctified themselves are many times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sensible stirrings of the affections, where the
temper is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is, whether the judgment and will be stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
determined for God, above all other good,
real or apparent: and if the affections do sincerely
follow their choice, and conduct: though it be
not so strongly and sensibly, as is to be desired, there
is no doubt, but the change is saving.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Thorowout the Members.</hi> Those that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the instruments of sin, are now become the

               <p>The Head, that was the Shop of worldly designs,
is now filled with other matters, and set on the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of God's will, <hi>Psalm. 1. 2. Psal.</hi> 119. 97. and tho
Man beats his head, not so much about his gain, but
about his duty. The Thoughts and Cares that now
fill his head are principally, how he may please God,
and flie Sin.</p>
               <p>His Heart, that was a Sty of filthy lusts, is now
become an Altar of incense, where the fire of divine
Love is ever kept in, and whence the daily Sacrifice
of Prayer and Praises, and sweet Incense of holy
desires, Ejaculations, and Anhelations are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ascending, <hi>Psal. 108. 1. Psal. 119. 20. Psal.</hi> 139.

of God, and Christ, and the matters of another

Praise, his glory, and the best member that he hath.</p>
               <p>Now here you shall have the Hypocrite halting.
He speaks it may be like an Angel, but he hath a
covetous eye, or the gain of unrighteousness in his
hand. Or the hand is white, but his heart is full
of rottenness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27. full of unmortified cares,
a very Oven of Lust, a Shop of Pride, the Seat of
Malice. It may be with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, he
hath a Golden Head, a great deal of Knowledge: but
he hath Feet of Clay, his Affections are Worldly, he
minds earthly things, and his way and walk are
sensual, and carnal, you may trace him in his secret
haunts, and his footsteps will be found in some by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths
of sin. The work is not thorowout with him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thorowout the Motions, or the Life, and Practice.</hi>
The new Man takes a new course, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3. His
Conversation is in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. No sooner
doth Christ call by effectual grace, but he straightway
becomes a follower of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 20. When God
hath given the new heart and writ his Law in his
mind, he forthwith walks in his Statutes, and keeps
his Judgments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Though sin may dwell (God knows a wearisome
and unwelcome guest) in him, yet it hath no more
Dominion over him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7, 14. He hath his fruit
unto holiness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. and though he makes
many a blot, yet the Law and Life of Jesus is that
he eyes, as his copy, <hi>Psal. 119. 30. Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and
hath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n unfeigned respect to all God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. He makes Conscience even of
little sins and little duties, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 113. His very
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44948:23"/>
infirmities which he cannot help, though he would,
are his souls burden, and are like the dust in a man's
eye, which though but little, yet are not a little
troublesome. [O man dost thou read this, and
never turn in upon thy soul by self-examination?]
The sincere Convert is not one man at Church, and
another at home, he is not a Saint on his Knees, and
a Cheat in his Shop: he will not Tithe Mint and
Cummin, and neglect Mercy and Judgment, and
the weighty matters of the Law; he doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Piety, and neglect Morality, <hi>Mat</hi> 23. 14. but
he turns from all his sins, and keeps all Gods Statutes,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. though not perfectly. (except in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and endeavour) yet sincerely, not allowing
himself in the breach of any, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. Now he
delights in the word, and sets himself to Prayer,
and opens his Hand, (if able) and draws out his
Soul to the hungry, <hi>Rom. 7. 22. Psal. 109. 4. Isa.</hi>
58. 10. He breaketh off his Sins by Righteousness,
and his Iniquities by shewing Mercy, to the poor,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. and hath a good Conscience, willing in
all things to live honestly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. and to keep
without offence towards God and Men.</p>
               <p>Here again you shall find the unsoundness of many
Professors, that take themselves for good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
They are partial in the Law, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 9. and take
up with the cheap and easy duties of Religion, but
they go not thorow with the work. They are as a
Cake not turned, half toasted, and half raw; It
may be you shall have them exact in their words;
punctual in their dealings; but then they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
themselves unto Godliness; and for examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves, and governing their hearts, to this
they are strangers. You may have them duly at the
Church; but follow them to their Families, and there
you shall see little but the World minded; or if they
have a Road of Family Duties; follow them to their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44948:24"/>
Closets, and there you shall find their Souls are little
looked after; It may be they seem otherwise religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but bridle not their Tongues, and so all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is in vain, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 26. It may be they come up
to Closet and Family Prayer; but follow them to
their Shops, and there you shall find them in a Trade
of Lying, or some covert and cleanly way of deceit.
Thus the Hypocrite goes not thorowout in the course
of his Obedience.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the subject of Conversion.
6. <q>The Terms are either from which, or to
which.</q>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Terms from which we turn in this motion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
<hi>are</hi> Sin, Satan, <hi>the</hi> World <hi>and</hi> our own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Sin.</hi> When a Man is converted, he is for
ever out with Sin, yea with all sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 128.
but most of all with his own Sins, and especially
with his Bosom Sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. Sin is now the
Butt of his indignation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. he thirsts to
bathe his hands in the blood of his Sins. His Sins
set a broach in sorrows. It is Sin that pierces him
and wounds him, he feels it like a Thorn in his side,
like a prick in his Eyes, he groans and struggles
under it, and not formally, but feelingly cries out,
<hi>O wretched Man!</hi> he is not impatient of any burden
so much as of his sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12. If God should
give him his choice, he would choose any affliction,
so he might be rid of Sin. He feels it like the cutting
gravel in his Shoes, pricking and paining him as he
goes.</p>
               <p>Before Conversion he had light thoughts of Sin:
he cherished it in his Bosom, as <hi>Uriah</hi> his Lamb; he
nourished it up, and it grew up together with him;
it did eat as it were of his own Meat, and drank of
his own Cup, and lay in his Bosom, and was to
him as a Daughter: but when God opens his Eyes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44948:24"/>
by Conversion, he throws it away with abhorence,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 22. as a man would a loathsome Toad, <hi>Which</hi>
in the dark he had hugged fast in his Bosom, and
thought it had been some pretty and harmless bird.
When a man is savingly changed, he is not only deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced of the danger, but defilement of sin:
and O how earnest is he with God to be purified: He
loaths himself for his sins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. He runs to
Christ, and casts himself into the Fountain for sin and
for uncleanness, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. If he fall what a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir is
there to get all clean again? He flies to the Word and
washes, and rubs, and rinches; labouring to cleanse
himself from all filthiness both of Flesh and Spirit:
He abhors his once beloved sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. as a
cleanly nature doth the Trough and Mire, wherein
he sees the Swine delight.</p>
               <p>The sound Convert is heartily ingaged against sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
He wrestles with it, he wars against it. He is too
often foiled, but he never yields the Cause, nor
lays down the Weapons; but he will up and to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
while he hath breath in his body. He will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
give quiet possession, he will make no peace; he
will give no quarter, he falls upon it, and fires upon
it, and is still disquieting of it with continual alarms.
He can forgive his other Enemies, he can pitty them,
and pray for them, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 60. but here he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,
here is he set upon revenge: he hunteth, as
it were for the precious life; his Eye shall not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
his Hand shall not spare, though it be a right
Hand or a right Eye. Be it a gainful Sin most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to his Nature, or support to his Esteem with
carnal Friends, yet he will rather throw his gain
down the Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pleasure wither in his hand, than he will allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in any known way of sin, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 8. He will
grant no indulgence, he will give not toleration, but
he draws upon sin wherever he meets it, and frowns
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44948:25"/>
upon it with this unwelcome salute, <hi>Have I found thee,
O mine Enemy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, hath Conscience been at work, while thou
hast been looking over these Lines? Hast thou pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
these things in thine heart? Hast thou search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Book within, to see if these things be so? If
not, read it again, and make thy Conscience speak
whether or no it be thus with thee.</p>
               <p>Hast thou crucified thy Flesh with its affections
and lusts; and not only confessed, but forsaken thy
sins; all sin in thy fervent desires, and the ordinary
practice of every deliberate and wilful sin in thy life?
If not, thou art yet unconverted. Doth not Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
fly in thy Face, as thou readest, and tell thee that
thou livest in a way of lying for thy advantage, that
thou usest deceit in thy Calling, that there is some
way of secret wantonness that thou livest in? why
then, do not deceive thy self, thou art in the gall of
bitterness, and bond of iniquity.</p>
               <p>Doth not thy unbridled Tongue, thy brutish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
thy wicked Company, thy neglect of
Prayer, of hearing and reading the Word, now
witness against thee, and say, <hi>We are thy works, and
we will follow thee?</hi> Or if I have not hit thee right,
doth not the Bird within tell them, there is such or
such a way, that thou knowest to be evil, that yet
for some carnal respect thou dost tolerate thy self in,
and art willing to spare? If this be thy Case, thou
art to this day unregenerate, and must be changed
or condemned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Satan.</hi> Conversion binds the strong
man, spoils his Armour, casts out his Goods, turns
men from the power of Satan unto God, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26. 18.
Before, the Devil could no sooner hold up his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Sinner, to call him to his wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
sinful Games, filthy Delights, but presently
he followed, like an Ox to the Slaughter, and a Fool
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44948:25"/>
to the correction of the Stocks, as the Bird that hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the prey, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
No sooner could Satan bid him lie, but presently he
had it upon the top of his Tongue, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3. no
sooner could Satan offer a wanton Object, but he
was stung with lust. The Devil could do more with
him than God could. If the Devil say, Away with
these Family Duties, be sure they shall be rarely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
performed in his house. If the Devil say, Away
with this strictness, this preciseness, he will keep
far enough from it: If he tells him there's no need
of these Closet Duties, he shall go from day to day,
and scarce perform them. But now he is converted,
he serves another Master, and takes quite another
Course, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. he goes and comes at Christ's
beck, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. Satan may sometimes catch his foot
in a Trap; but he will no longer be a willing Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
He watches against the Snares and Baits of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and studies to be acquainted with his devices.

               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>World.</hi> Before a sound faith, a man
is overcome of the <hi>World.</hi> Either he bows down to
<hi>Mammon,</hi> or idolizes his reputation, or is a lover of
pleasure more than a lover of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4.
Here's the root of Mans misery by the fall; he is
turned aside to the Creature instead of God, and
gives that esteem, confidence and affection to the
Creature, that is due to him alone, <hi>Rom. 1. 25.

               <p>O miserable Man! What a deformed Monster

hath sin made thee? God made thee little lower than
the Angels, Sin little better than the Devils, <hi>Iohn</hi>
6. 70. and 8. 44. a Monster that hath his Head and
Heart, where his Feet should be; and his Feet kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against Heaven, and every thing out of place;
the World, that was formed to serve thee, is come
to rule thee; and the deceitful Harlot hath bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee with her enchantments, and made thee bow
down and serve her.</p>

there is no comliness that he should desire it, and he
tunes up with the sweet Psalmist of <hi>Israel, The Lord

gawdy Idol is become <hi>Nehushtan, 2 Kin.</hi> 18. 4. and he

by till the world were first served; but now all must
stand by; he hates father, and mother, and life,
and all in comparison of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 26.</p>
               <p>Well then, pause a little, and look within: Doth
not this nearly concern thee? Thou pretendest for
Christ; but doth not the world sway thee? Dost thou
not take more real delight and content in the world,
than in him? Dost not thou find thy self better at
ease when the World goes to thy mind and thou art
encompassed with carnal delights, than when reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to justifie his person, and justifie his performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he cannot live without him; he cannot pray
without him; Christ must go with him, or else
he cannot come into the presence of God; he
leans upon the hand of Christ and so he bows
himself in the house of his God. He sets himself
down for a lost, undone man without him. His
life is hid in Christ, as the life of man in the
heart. He is fixed in Christ, as the roots of the

Before the news of a Christ was a stale

<hi>Augustine</hi> could not relish his before so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired

               <p>The <hi>ultimate</hi> is God the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, whom the true Convert takes, as his All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
and eternal blessedness. A Man is never
truly sanctified, till his very heart be in truth set
upon God above all things, as his portion and
chief good. These are the natural breathings of a
believers heart: <hi>Thou art my portion,</hi> Psal. 119. 57. <hi>My
soul shall make her boast in the Lord,</hi> Psalm. 34. 2. <hi>My
expectation is from him, he only is my rock, and my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
he is my defence: in God is my salvation and my
glory, the Rock of my strength, and my Refuge is in God,</hi>
Psalm 62. 1. 2, 5, 6, 7. Psalm 18. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Would you put it to an issue whether you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
or not? Now then let thy soul and all that is
within thee attend.</p>
               <p>Hast thou taken God for thy happiness? Where
doth the content of thy heart lie? Whence doth thy
choicest comfort come in? Come then and with
<hi>Abraham</hi> lift up thine eyes Eastward, and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Northward, and Southward, and cast
about thee, what it is, that thou wouldst have in
Heaven or Earth to make thee happy. If God
should give thee thy choice as he did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> or
should say to thee, as <hi>Ahashuerus</hi> to <hi>Esther, What is

thy petition, and what is thy request?</hi> and it shall be
<hi>granted</hi> thee, <hi>Esther</hi> 5. 3. What wouldst thou ask?
go into the gardens of pleasure, and gather all the

go to the towers, to the trophies of honour: what
thinkest thou of being a man of renown, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

here I will live and dye?</hi> Wilt thou let all the world

and thee: Happy art thou, O man, happy art
thou that ever thou wast born. If a God can make

Dost thou say to Christ, as he to us, <hi>Thy Father shall
be my Father, and thy God my God?</hi> John 20. 17. Here
is the turning Point. An unsound professor never
takes up his rest in God; but converting grace does
the work and so cures the fatal misery of the fall,
by turning the heart from its idols, to the living
God, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. Now says the soul, <hi>Lord, whither

Why, then blessed art thou of the Lord. God hath
been at work with thee, he hath laid hold on thy
heart by the power of converting grace, or else thou

               <p>The <hi>Mediate</hi> term of Conversion is either <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi>
or <hi>less Principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Principal,</hi> is Christ, the only Mediator between
God and Man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. His work is to bring us

<hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. the only plank on which we may escape;
the only door by which we may enter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 9.
Conversion brings over the soul to Christ, to accept

him; nor in any other with him, but throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

               <p>Here <hi>(saith the convinced sinner)</hi> here I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

a whole Christ, and takes him for all intents and

without reserves. He is willing to have Christ, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Four things (I observe) God doth work in every

               <p>
                  <hi>His judgments are setledly determined, that 'tis
best to be holy, that 'tis best to be strict, that it is

him the wisest and most rational, and desireable
choice. Hear the godly mans judgment,</hi> I know

                  <hi>Psalm</hi>
119. 103, 127, 162. His consent is not extorted by
some extremity of anguish, nor is it only a sudden

119. 30. True, the Flesh will rebel, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing

2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 15. Fear hath its use; but this is not the
main Spring of Motion with a sanctified heart. Christ
keeps not his Subjects in by force, but is King of a
willing people. They are (through his grace) freely
resolved for his service, and do it out of choice,
not as slaves, but as the Sun or Spouse, from a Spring
of Love, and a Loyal Mind. In a Word, the Laws
of Christ are the Converts Love, <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. 159,

Psalm</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The bent of his course is directed to keep Gods Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
Psalm</hi> 119. 4, 8, 167, 168. 'Tis the daily care of
his life to walk with God. He seeks great things: he
hath noble designs, though he fall too short. He aims
at nothing less than perfection: he desires it, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
after it, he would not rest in any pitch of grace,
till he were quite rid of sin and had perfected holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Here the Hypocrites rottenness may be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He desires holiness (as one well) only as a
Bridge to Heaven, and enquires earnestly, what is
the least that will serve his turn; and if he can get
<hi>but</hi> so much as may just bring him to Heaven, this is
all he cares for. But the sound Convert desires holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for holiness sake, <hi>Psalm 119. 97. Mat.</hi> 5. 6. and
not only for Heaven's sake. He would not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with so much as might save him from Hell; but
desires the highest pitch. Yet desires are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
What is thy way and thy course? Is the
drift and scope of thy life altered? Is holiness thy
trade, and religion thy business? <hi>Rom. 8. 1. Mat.
25. 16. Phil.</hi> 1. 20. If not, thou art short of sound
Conversion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Application.</hi> And is this, that we have described,
the Conversion that is of absolute necessity to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Then be informed. 1. That strait is the gate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44948:31"/>
and narrow the way that leadeth unto life. 2. That
there be but few that find it. 3. That there is need
of a Divine power, savingly to convert a sinner to
Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Again, then be exhorted, O man that readest, to
turn in upon thine own self. What saith Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Doth it not begin to bite? Doth it not <hi>twitch</hi>
thee as thou goest? Is this thy Judgment, and this
thy Choice, and this thy way, that we have describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
If so, then 'tis well. But doth not thy heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thee, and tell thee, there is such a sin thou liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in against thy Conscience? Doth it not tell thee,
there is such and such a secret way of wickedness,
that thou makest no bones of? Such or such a Duty,
that thou makest no Conscience of?</p>
               <p>Doth not Conscience carry thee to thy Closet, and
tell thee how seldom prayer, and reading is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there? Doth it not carry thee to thy family, and
shew thee the charge of God, and the souls of thy
children and servants, that be neglected there? doth
not Conscience lead thee to thy Shop, thy Trade, and
tell thee of some mystery of iniquity there? Doth it
not <hi>carry thee</hi> to the Ale-Shop, or to the Sack-Shop,
and round thee in thine ear for the loose Company
thou keepest there, the precious time thou mis-spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
there, for the talents of God which thou throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
down this Sink, for thy gaming, and thy swilling,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doth it not carry thee into thy secret Chamber,
and read thee a Curtain Lecture?</p>
               <p>O Conscience do thy duty. In the name of the
living God I command thee discharge thine office.
Lay hold upon this sinner, fall upon him, arrest him
apprehend him, undeceive him. What, wilt thou
flatter and sooth him, while he lives in his sins?
Awake, O Conscience. What meanest thou, O
sleeper? What, hast thou never a reproof in thy
mouth? What, shall this soul die in his careless
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44948:32"/>
neglect of God and Eternity, and thou altogether
hold thy peace? What, shall he go on still in his
trespasses, and yet have peace? O rouse up thy self,
and do thy work. Now let the Preacher in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
speak. Cry aloud and spare not, lift up thy
voice like a Trumpet; let not the blood of this Soul
be required at thy hands.</p>

Acts</hi> 3. 19. But I must say unto you, as <hi>Ruth</hi>
to <hi>Naomi, Intreat me not to leave you, nor to turn aside
from following after you, Ruth</hi> 1. 16. Were it a matter
of indifferency, I would never keep so much ado.
Might you be saved as you be, I would gladly let
you alone. But would you not have me solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for you, when I see you ready to perish? As
the Lord liveth, before whom I am, I have not the
least hopes to see one of your faces in Heaven, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you be converted. I utterly despair of your
salvation, <hi>except</hi> you will be prevailed with to turn
throughly, and give up your selves to God in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and newness of life. Hath God said, <hi>Except you
be born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God, Iohn</hi>
3. 3. and yet do you wonder, why your Ministers
do so plainly travel in birth with you? Think it
not strange, that I am earnest with you to follow
after holiness, and long to see the Image of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you. Never did any, nor shall any enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Upon this one point depends thy making, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

<hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 11. Did not he make thee for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
<hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. Art thou a man, and hast thou
reason? Why then bethink thy self, why and whence
thy Being is. Behold God's workmanship in thy

shouldst please thy self, and gratifie thy senses? Did
God send men, like the Swallows, into the World,
only to gather a few sticks and dirt, and build their
Nests, and breed up their young, and then away?
The very Heathens could see farther than this.
Art thou so fearfully and wonderfully made, <hi>Psal.</hi>
139. 14. and dost thou not yet think with thy self,
surely it was for some noble and raised end?</p>
               <p>O man, set thy reason a little in the Chair. Is
it not pity such a goodly fabrick should be raised in
vain? Verily thou art in vain, except thou art for
God. Better thou hadst no Being, than not to be
for him. Wouldst thou serve thy end? Thou must
repent, and be converted. Without this thou art
<hi>to no purpose,</hi> yea, to <hi>bad purpose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, To <hi>No purpose.</hi> Man unconverted, is like a
choice instrument, that hath every string broke, or
out of tune. The Spirit of the living God must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
and tune it, by the grace of regeneration, and
sweetly move it by the power of actuating grace,
or else thy prayers will be but howlings, and all thy
services will make no Musick in the Ears of the most
Holy, <hi>Eph. 2. 10. Phil. 2. 13. Hos. 7. 14. Isa.</hi> 1. 15.
All thy powers and faculties are so corrupt in thy

nor materials for it.</hi> A man may as well hew
the Marble without Tools; or Limn without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
or Instruments, or build without Materials, as
perform any acceptable service without the graces
of the Spirit, which are both the Materials, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
in the work. Alms giving is not a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, but of vain glory, unless dealt forth
by the hand of divine love. What is the prayer
of the lips without grace in the heart, but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass
without the life? What are all our confessions,
unless they be the exercises of godly sorrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
repentance? What our petitions, unless
animated all along with holy desires, and faith in
divine attributes and promises? What our praises
and thanksgivings, unless from the Love of God, and
a holy grattiude, and sense of God's mercies in the
heart? So that a man may as well expect the trees
should speak, or look for Logick from the brutes, or
motion from the dead, as for any service holy and
acceptable to God, from the unconverted. When
the tree is evil, how can the fruit be good? <hi>Mat.</hi>

Dost thou not yet see a change to be needful? would
it not have grieved one, to have seen the golden
consecrated Vessels of God's Temple turned into
quaffing bowls for drunkenness, and polluted with
the Idols service? <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 2, 3. Was it such an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination

How much more abominable then would it have

served like the house of <hi>Baul;</hi> to have the Image

Theits, False witness, Blasphemies,</hi> &amp;c. This
black guard discovers what a Hell there is within.</p>
               <p>Oh abuse unsufferable! to see a Heaven-born soul
abased to the filthiest drudgery, to see the glory of
Gods creation, the chief of the ways of God, the
Lord of the Universe, a lapping with the prodigal
at the trough, or licking up with greediness the most
loathsom vomit. Was it such a lamentation, to
see those that did feed delicately, to sit desolate in
the streets? and the precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to fine gold, to be esteemed as earthen Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and those that were cloathed in Scarlet, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

more fearful, to see the only thing that hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality

of God, to become as a vessel wherein there is no

Oh indignity intolerable! Better thou wert dashed
in a <hi>thousand</hi> pieces, than continue to be abused to
so filthy a service.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Not only man, but the whole visible creation is in vain
without this.</hi> Beloved, God hath made all the visible
creatures in heaven and earth for the service of
man, and man only is the spokesman for all the
rest. Man is in the universe, like the tongue in the
body, which speaks for all the Members. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures cannot praise their Maker, but by
dumb signs and hints to man, that he should speak
for them. Man is, as it were, the high Priest of Gods
creation, to offer the Sacrifice of praise for all his
fellow creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. and 148. and 150. The
Lord God expecteth a tribute of praise from all his
works, <hi>Psalm</hi> 103. 2. now all the rest do bring in
their tribute to man, and pay it in by his hand. So
then, if man be false, and faithless, and selfish, God
is wronged of all, and sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from his works.</p>
               <p>O dreadful thought to think of! That God
should build such a world as this, and lay out such
infinite power, and wisdom, and goodness, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and all in vain, and man should be guilty at
last, of robbing, and Spoiling him of the glory of
all. O think of this, while thou art unconverted,
all the Offices of the creatures to thee are in vain;
thy meat nourishes thee in vain, the Sun holds forth
his light to thee in vain, the Stars, that serve thee in
their courses by their most powerful, though hidden
influence, <hi>Iudges 5. 20. Hos.</hi> 2. 21, 22. do it in vain;
thy Cloaths warm thee in vain; thy Beast carries
thee in vain: in a word, the unwearied labour, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44948:35"/>
continual travel of the whole Creation (as to thee)
is in vain. The service of all the creatures, that
drudge for thee, and yield forth their strength unto
thee (that therewith thou shouldst serve their
Maker) is all but lost labour. Hence the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
groaneth under the abuse of this unsanctified
world. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. that pervert them to the service
of their lusts, quite contrary to the very end of their
Being.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Without this, thy Religion is in vain.</hi> Jam. 1. 26.
All thy religious performances will be but lost; for
they can neither please God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. nor save thy

<hi>Isa. 66. 3. Prov.</hi> 28. 9. Many under
convictions think they will set upon mending, and
that a few prayers and alms will salve all again;

your duties will not pass. How punctual was

<hi>Isa. 58. 3. Mat.</hi> 7. 22. and set him down so much

               <p>O soul, do not think, when thy sins pursue thee,
a little praying and reforming thy course will pacify
God: thou must begin with thine heart. If that
be not renewed, thou canst no more please God,
than one that having unspeakably offended thee,
should bring thee his vomit in a dish to pacify
thee, or having fallen into the mire, should
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44948:35"/>
think with his loathed embraces to reconcile thee.</p>

great a misery to lose our common labours, to sow in

building, which when a man trusts to; it falls down
about his ears. 2. <hi>There is desperation in it. Where
is the Hope of the Hypocrite, when God takes away his soul?
Iob</hi> 27. 8. Then there is an end for ever of his <hi>hope.</hi>
Indeed, the hope of the righteous hath an end, but
then 'tis not a destructive, but a perfective end; his
hope ends in fruition, others in frustration, <hi>Prov.</hi>
10. 28. The godly must say at death, <hi>It is finished,</hi> but
the wicked, <hi>It is perished;</hi> and in too sad earnest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan
himself, (as <hi>Iob</hi> in a mistake) <hi>Where now is my
hope? He hath destroyed me, I am gone, and my hope is
removed like a tree,</hi> Job 19. 10. <hi>The righteous hath hope in
his death, Prov.</hi> 14. 32. When nature is dying, his
hopes are living, when his body is languishing,
his hopes are flourishing; his hope is a living hope,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> but others a dying,
yea a damning, soul-undoing hope. <hi>When a wicked
man dieth, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
men perisheth,</hi> Prov. 11. 7. <hi>It shall be cut off, and</hi>
prove like the <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> Job 8. 14. which he
spins out of his own bowels, but then comes death
with the broom, and takes down all, and so there is
an eternal end of his confidence, wherein he trusted.
<hi>For the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and their hope shall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44948:37"/>
be as the giving up of the Ghost,</hi> Job 11. 20. Wicked
men are setled in their carnal hope, and will not
be beaten out of it. They hold it fast, they will not
let it go. Yea but death will knock off their fingers.
Though we cannot undeceive them, death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will. When death strikes his dart through thy
liver, it will let out thy soul and thy hopes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The unsanctified have hope only in this life,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. and therefore are of all men most
miserable. When death comes, it lets them out into
the amazing gulf of endless desperation. 3. <hi>There is
blasphemy in it.</hi> To hope we shall be saved, though
continuing unconverted, is to hope we shall prove
God a liar. He hath told you, that so merciful and
pitiful as he is, he will never save you notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if you go on in ignorance, or a course of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes,
<hi>Isa. 27. 11. 1. Cor.</hi> 6. 9. In a word, he
he hath told you, that whatever you be or do, nothing
shall avail you to Salvation without you be new
creatures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. Now to say God is merciful,
and we hope he will save us nevertheless, is to say in
effect, we hope God will not do as he saith. We may
not set God's Attributes at variance. God is resolved
to glorifie mercy, but not with the prejudice of
truth, as the presumptuous sinner will find to his
everlasting sorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Why but we hope in Jesus Christ, we put
our whole trust in God, and therefore doubt not
but we shall be saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. 1. This is not to hope in Christ, but against Christ.</hi>
To hope to see the Kingdom of God, without being
born again, to hope to find eternal life in the broad
way, is to hope Christ will prove a false Prophet.
'Tis <hi>David's</hi> plea, <hi>I hope in thy word, Psalm</hi> 119. 81.
but this hope is against the word. Shew me a word
of Christ for thy hope, that he will save thee in thine
ignorance, or prophane neglects of his service,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44948:37"/>
and I will never go to shake thy confidence.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>God doth with abhorrence reject this hope:</hi> Those
condemned in the Prophet, went on in their sins, yet
(faith the Text) they will lean upon the Lord, <hi>Mic.</hi>
3. 11. God will not endure to be made a prop to men
in their sins: The Lord rejected those presumptuous
sinners, that went on still in their trespasses, and yet
would stay themselves upon the God of <hi>Israel, Isa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
48. 1, 2. as a man would shake off the briars (as one
said well) that cleaves to his garment.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>If thy hope be any thing worth, it will purifie thee
from thy sins, 1 Iohn</hi> 3. 3. but cursed is that hope,
which doth cherish men in their sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Would you have us to despair?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> You must despair of ever coming to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as you are, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. that is, while you remain
unconverted. You must despair ever to see the
face of God without holiness, but you must by no
means despair of finding mercy, upon your thorough
repentance and conversion; neither may you despair
of attaining to repentance and conversion, in the use
of Gods means.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Without this, all that Christ hath done and suffered
will be (as to you) in vain,</hi> John 13. 8. Tit. 2. 14.
that is, it will no way avail to your salvation. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
urge this as a sufficient ground for their hopes,
that Christ died for sinners: but I must tell you,
Christ never died to save impenitent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
sinners (so continuing) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. A
great Divine was wont, in his private dealings with
souls, to ask two questions, 1. What hath Christ
done for you? 2. What hath Christ wrought in you?

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44948:38"/>
of the Father, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 1. shews his commission
from him, acts in his name, and pleads his command
for his justification, <hi>Iohn 10. 18, 36. Iohn</hi> 6. 38, 40.
And God hath committed all things to him, entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own glory, and the salvation of his elect with
him, <hi>Mat. 11. 27. Iohn</hi> 17. 2. Accordingly, Christ
gives his Father an account of both parts of his trust,
before he leaves the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 4, 6, 12. Now
Christ should quite cross his Fathers glory, his greatest
trust, if he should save men in their sins; for this
were to overturn all his counsels, and to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to all his attributes.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>To overturn all his Councels;</hi> of which this is the
order, that men should be brought through sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to salvation, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. He hath chosen
them, that they should be holy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. They are
elected to pardon and life through sanctification,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. If thou canst repeal the Law of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
counsel, or corrupt him, whom the Father
hath sealed, to go directly against his Commission,
then and not otherwise, maist thou get to Heaven in
this condition. To hope that Christ will save thee
while unconverted, is to hope that Christ will falsify
his trust. He never did, nor will save one soul, but
whom the Father hath given him in election, and
drawn to him in effectual calling, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 34, 37. Be
assured, Christ will save none, in a way contrary to
his Fathers will, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 38.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To offer violence to all his attributes.
1. To his Iustice.</hi> For the righteousness of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lies, in rendring to all according to their works,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6. Now, should men sow to the flesh, and
yet of the Spirit reap everlasting life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8.
where were the glory of divine Justice, since it
should be given to the wicked according to the
work of the righteous? 2. <hi>To his holiness.</hi> If God
should not only save sinners, but save them in their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44948:38"/>
sins, his most pure and strict holiness would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
defaced. The unsanctified is in the eyes
of Gods holiness, worse than a Swine or Viper, <hi>Mat.
23. 33. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 23. Now what cleanly nature could
indure to have the filthy Swine Bed and Board with
him in his Parlour, or Bed-chamber? It would offer
the extreamest violence to the infinite purity of the
divine nature, to have such to dwell with him. They
cannot stand in his judgment, they cannot abide in
his presence, <hi>Psalm 1. 5. Psalm</hi> 5. 4, 5. If holy
<hi>David</hi> would not endure such in his house,
no nor in his sight, <hi>Psalm</hi> 101. 3, 7. shall we
think God will? Should he take men as they be
from the Trough to the Table, from the Harlots lips,
from the Stye and Draff, to the glory of Heaven,
the world would think God were at no such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from sin, nor had such dislike of it, as we are
told he hath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they would conclude, God were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
such a one as themselves (as they wickedly
did, but from the very forbearance of God, <hi>Psal. 50.
21.) 3. To his Veracity.</hi> For God hath declared from
Heaven. <hi>That if any shall say he shall have peace, tho'
he should go on in the imagination of his heart: his wrath
shall smoak against that man,</hi> Deut. 29. 19, 20. <hi>That they
(only) that confess, and forsake their sins, shall find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
Prov. 28. 13. <hi>That they that shall enter into his Hill,
must be of clean hands and a pure heart,</hi> Psal. 24. 3, 4.
Where were Gods truth, if notwithstanding all this,
he should bring men to Salvation without Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
O desperate sinner, that darest to hope, that
Christ will put the lye upon his Father, and nullifie
his word to save thee! 4. <hi>To his Wisdom.</hi> For this
were to throw away the choicest mercies, on them
that would not value them, nor were any way suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them. First, they would not value them. The
unsanctified sinner puts but little price upon God's
great Salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 5. He sets no more by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44948:39"/>
Christ than the whole by the Physician, <hi>Matthew</hi>
9. 12. he prizes not his balm, values not his cure,
tramples upon his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. Now would
it stand with wisdom, to force pardon and life, upon
them that would give him no thanks for them? Will
the all-wise God (when he hath forbidden us to
do it) throw his holy things to Dogs, and his
pearls to Swine, that would (as it were) but turn
again, and rend him? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 6. This would make
mercy to be despised indeed. Wisdom requires
that life be given, in a way suitable to God's honour,
and that God provide for the securing his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as well as Man's felicity. It would be dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God, to set his Jewels on the snouts of Swine
(continuing such) and to bestow his choicest riches
on them, that have more pleasure in their swill,
than the heavenly delights that he doth offer. God
should lose the praise and glory of his grace, if he
should cast it away on them, that were not only
unworthy, but unwilling. Secondly, They are no way
suited to them. The Divine Wisdom is seen in
suiting things each to other, the means to the end,
the object to the faculty, the quality of the gift to
the capacity of the receiver. Now, if Christ should
bring the unregenerate sinner to Heaven, he could
take no more felicity there, than a Beast if <hi>you should</hi>
bring him into a beautiful room, to the Society of
learned men, and a well-furnished Table: when
as the poor thing had much rather be grazing with
his fellow-brutes. Alas, what should an unsanctified
creature do in Heaven! He could take no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
there, because nothing suits him. The place doth
not suit him, he would be but <hi>piscis in arido,</hi> quite
out of his element, as a Swine in the parlour, or a
Fish out of water. The Company doth not suit him.
What communion hath darkness with light, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
with perfection? Filth and rottenness,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44948:39"/>
with glory and immortality? The imployment
doth not suit him: The Anthems of Heaven fit
not his mouth, suit not his ear. Canst thou charm
thy Beast with Musick? Or wilt thou bring him to
thy Organ, and expect that he should make thee
melody, or keep time with the skilful Quire? Or
had he skill, he would have no will, and so could
find no pleasure, no more than the nauseous stomach
in the meat, on which it hath newly surfeited.
Spread thy Table with delicates before a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Patient, and it will be but a very offence. Alas,
if the poor man think a Sermon long, and say of a
Sabbath, <hi>What a weariness is it? Mal.</hi> 1. 13. how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
would he think it, to be held to it to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
5. <hi>To his immutability, or else to his Omniscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Omnipotency.</hi> For this is enacted in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
of Heaven, and enrolled in the decrees of the
Court above, that none but <hi>the pure in heart shall
ever see God, Mat.</hi> 5. 8. This is laid up with him, and
sealed among his Treasures. Now if Christ, yet,
bring any to Heaven unconverted, either he must
get them in without his Fathers knowledge, and
then where is his Omnisciency? Or against his will,
and then where were his Omnipotency? Or he must
change his will, and then where were his Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?</p>
               <p>Sinner, wilt thou not yet give up thy vain hope
of being saved in this condition? Saith <hi>Bildad, Shall
the earth be forsaken for thee? Or the rocks moved out of
their place?</hi> Job 18. 4. May not I, much more reason so
with thee? Shall the Laws of Heaven be reversed
for thee? Shall the everlasting foundations be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned
for thee? Shall Christ put out the eye of
his Fathers Omnisciency, or shorten the arm of his
eternal power for thee? Shall divine Justice be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for thee? or the brightness of the glory of
his holiness be blemished for thee? Oh the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44948:40"/>
absurdity, blasphemy, that is in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence!
To think Christ will ever save thee in this
condition, is to make thy Saviour to become a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to do more wrong to the infinite Majesty,
than all the wicked on Earth, or Devils in Hell ever
did, or could. And yet wilt thou not give up such
a blasphemous hope?</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Against his word.</hi> We need not say, <hi>Who shall
ascend into Heaven, to bring down Christ from above? Or
who shall descend into the deep, to bring up Christ from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath?
The word is nigh us,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. Are
you agreed that Christ shall end the controversie?
Hear then his own words; <hi>Except you be converted you
shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat.
18. 3. <hi>You must be born again,</hi> John 3. 7. <hi>If I wash thee
not, thou hast no part in me,</hi> John 13. 8. <hi>Repent or perish,
Luke</hi> 13. 3. One word, one would think, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
from Christ; but how often and earnestly
doth he reiterate it, verily, verily, verily, verily,
except a man, be born again, he shall not see the
Kingdom of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3, 5. Yea, he doth not only
assert, but prove the necessity of the new birth, <hi>viz.</hi>
from the fleshliness and filthiness of man's first birth,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 6. by reason of which, man is no more fit for
Heaven than the Beast is for the Chamber of the
Kings presence. And wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thou yet believe thine own
presumptuous confidence, directly against Christs
words? He must go quite against the Law of his
Kingdom, and Rule of his Judgment, to <hi>save</hi> thee in
this estate.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Against his Oath.</hi> He hath lifted up his hand
to heaven, he hath sworn, that those that remain
in unbelief, and know not his ways (that is, are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of them, or disobedient to them) shall not
enter into his rest, <hi>Psalm 95. 11. Heb.</hi> 3. 18. and
wilt thou not yet believe, O sinner, that he is in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest?
Canst thou hope he will be forsworn for thee?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44948:40"/>
The Covenant of Grace is confirmed by an Oath,
and sealed by blood, <hi>Heb. 6. 17. Heb. 9. 16, 18, 19.
Mat.</hi> 26. 28. But all must be made void, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way to heaven found out, if thou be saved, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and dying unsanctified. God is come to his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and last terms with man, and hath condescended
as far as with honour he could, hath set up his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
with a <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi> Men cannot be saved,
while unconverted, except they could get another
Covenant made, and the whole frame of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
(which was established for ever, with such
dreadful solemnities) quite altered; and would not
this be a distracted hope?</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Against his honour.</hi> God will so shew his
love to the sinner as withal to shew his hatred to sin.
Therefore he that names the name of Jesus must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from iniquity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness;
and he that hath hope of life by Christ
must purifie himself as he is pure, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 3. Tit.</hi>
2. 12. otherwise Christ would be thought a favourer
of sin. The Lord Jesus would have all the world to
know, though he pardon sin, he will not protect it.
If holy <hi>David</hi> shall say, <hi>Depart from me all you workers of
iniquity,</hi> Psal. 6. 8. and shall shut the doors against
them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 7. shall not such much more expect
it from Christs holiness? Would it be for his honour,
to have the dogs to the table? or to lodge the swine
with his children? or to have <hi>Abraham's</hi> bosom
to be a nest of Vipers.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Against his Offices.</hi> God hath exalted him to
be a <hi>Prince and a Saviour,</hi> Acts 5. 31. he should act
against both, should he save men in their sins. It is
the Office of a King.</p>
               <q>Parcere subjectis, &amp; debellare superbos.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be a terrer to evil doers and a praise to them that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44948:41"/>
do well,</hi> Rom. 13. 3, 4. <hi>He is a Minister of God, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
to execute wrath on him that doth evil.</hi> Now
should Christ favour the ungodly (so continuing)
and take those to reign with him that would not
that he should reign over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. this
were quite against his Office: He therefore reigns,
that he may put his enemies under his feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 25. now should he lay them in his bosom he
should cross the end of his regal power. It belongs to
Christ, as a King to subdue the hearts, and slay the
lusts of his chosen, <hi>Psalm 45. 5. Psalm.</hi> 110. 3. What
King would take the rebels, in open hostility, into
his Court? What were this but to betra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King, he must have homage, honour, sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 1. 6. Now to save men while in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
enmity, were to obscure his Dignity, lose his
Authority, bring contempt on his Government, and
sell his dear-bought rights for nought.</p>
               <p>Again, as Christ should not be a Prince, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Saviour, if he should do this. For his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is spiritual, he is called Jesus, because he saves
his people from their sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. So that should
he save them in their sins, he should be neither Lord
nor Jesus. To save men from the punishment, and
not from the power of sin, were to do his work by
halves, and be an imperfect Saviour. His Office, as
the <hi>Deliverer, is to turn away ungodliness from</hi> Jacob,
<hi>Rom. 11. 26. He is sent to bless men in turning them
from their iniquities, Acts 3. 26. to make an end of sin,
Dan.</hi> 9. 24. so that he should destroy his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and nullifie his offices, to save men abiding
in their unconverted estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Application,</hi> Arise then, what meanest thou O
sleeper? Awake, O secure sinner, left thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
in thine iniquities, Say as the Lepers, <hi>If we sit
here we shall die, 2 Kings</hi> 7. 3, 4. Verily, it is not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44948:41"/>
more certain that thou art now out of hell, than
that thou shalt speedily be in it, except thou repent
and be converted, there is but this one door for thee
to escape by. Arise then, O sluggard, and shake off
thine excuses. How long wilt thou slumber, and
fold thine hands to sleep? <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10, 11. Wilt
thou lie down in the midst of the Sea, or sleep on
the top of the mast? <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 34. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
but thou must either turn or burn. There
is an unchangeable necessity of the change of thy
condition, except thou art resolved to abide the
worst of it, and try it out with the Almighty. If
thou lovest thy life, O man, arise and come away.

               <p>This must be premised, before we proceed to
the discovery, that it is most certain men may have
a confident perswasion, that their hearts and states
be good, and yet be unsound. Hear the Truth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who shews in <hi>Laodicea</hi>'s case, that men may be
wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
naked, and yet not know it, yea they may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they are rich and increased in grace, <hi>Rev. 3. 17.
There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, and
yet is not washed from their filthiness, Prov.</hi> 30. 12. who
better perswaded of his Case, than <hi>Paul,</hi> while yet
he remained unconverted? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. So that they
are miserably deceived, that take a strong confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for a sufficient evidence. They that have
no better proof, than barely a strong perswasion,
that they are converted, are certainly as yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to Conversion.</p>
               <p>But to come more close; as it was said of the
adherents of Antichrist, so here; some of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
carry their Marks in their foreheads, more
openly; and some in their hands, more covertly.
The Apostle reckons up some, upon whom he writes
the sentence of Death, as in these dreadful Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
which I beseech you to attend with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<hi>Eph. 5. 5, 6. For this you know, that no whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger,
nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44948:44"/>
hath an inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and
of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the
Children of disobedience.</hi> Rev. 21. 8. <hi>But the fearful
and unbelieving, and the abominable, and Murderers, and
whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and brimstone, which is the second death.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.
<hi>Know you not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
Kingdom of God? be not deceived, neither fornicators,
nor idolaters and adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
drunkards, nor revilers, or extortioners, shall inherit the
Kingdom of God?</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. Wo to them
that have their names written in these bed-rolls:
such may know, as certainly as if God had told it
them from Heaven, that they are unsanctified, and
under an impossibility of being saved in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>There are then these several sorts, that, past all

               <p>1. <hi>The unclean.</hi> These are ever reckoned among
the Goats, and have their Names, whoever be left

Rev. 21. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Covetous.</hi> These are ever branded for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,

strong for strong drink. The Lord fills his mouth
with woes against these, and declares them to have
no inheritance in the Kingdom of God, <hi>Isa. 5. 11,

Oh how little a number will be left, when these ten

Heaven declares against you, and pronounces you in
a state of damnation? I would reason with you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

God with them; <hi>How canst thou say, I am not polluted?</hi>
Jer. 2. 23. <hi>See thy way in the valley, know what thou
hast done.</hi> Man, is not thy conscience privy to thy
tricks of deceit, to thy chamber pranks, to thy way
of lying? Yea, are not thy friends, thy family, thy

Gods worship, to thy covetous practices, to thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

at thee, as thou goest, there goes a gaming Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;
there goes a drunken <hi>Nabal,</hi> a companion of

Sun-beam, in the book out of which you must be
judged, that these are not the spots of his Children,
and that none such (except renewed by converting
grace) shall ever escape the damnation of Hell.</p>
               <p>Oh that such of you would now be perswaded t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

repent and turn from all your transgressions; or else
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44948:46"/>
iniquity will be your ruin! <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30. Alas for poor
hard'ned sinners! Must I leave you at last where you
were? Must I leave the tipler still at the Ale-bench?
Must I leave the wanton still at his dalliance? Must
I leave the malicious still in his venom? And the
drunkard still at his vomit? However you must
know that you have been warned, and that I am
clear of your blood. And whether men will hear,
or whether they will forbear, I will leave these
Scriptures with them, either as thunderbolts to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
them, or as searing Irons to harden them to
a reprobate sence, <hi>Psal. 68. 21. God shall wound the
head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such a one, as
goeth on still in his trespasses.</hi> Prov. 29. 1. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often reproved hardneth his neck, shall suddenly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,

I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my
hand, and no man regarded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will mock at your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
—when your destruction cometh as a whirlwind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I imagine, many will begin to bless
themselves, and think all is well, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be spotted with the grosser evils above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But I must further tell you, that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sort of unsanctified persons, that carry not
their marks in their foreheads, but more secretly
and covertly in their hands. These do frequently
deceive themselves and others, and pass for good
Christians, when they are all the while unsound at
bottom. Many pass undiscovered, till death and
judgment bring all to light. Those self-deceivers
seem to come even to Heaven's gate with confidence
of their admission, and yet are turned off at last,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. Brethren, Beloved, I beseech you deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to lay to heart, and firmly to retain this awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consideration: <hi>That Multitudes miscarry by the hand
of some secret sin, that is not only hidden from others but
(for want of observing their own hearts) even from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44948:46"/>
A man may be free from open pollutions, and
yet die at last by the fatal hand of some unobserved
iniquity. And there be these twelve hidden sins, by
which souls go down by numbers into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of death. These you must search carefully for,
and take them as black marks (wherever they be
found) discovering a graceless and unconverted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
And as you love your lives, read carefully,
with a holy jealousie of your selves, lest you should
be the persons concerned.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Gross Ignorance.</hi> Ah how many poor souls doth
this sin kill in the dark, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 6. while they think
verily they have good hearts, and are in the ready
way to Heaven! This is the murderer that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
thousands in a silent manner, when (poor
hearts!) they suspect nothing, and see not the
hand that mischiefs them. You shall find whatever
excuses you have for ignorance, that 'tis a soul-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
evil, <hi>Isa. 27. 11. 2 Thes. 1. 8. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 3. Ah
would it not have pitted a man's heart to have
seen that woful spectacle, when the poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
were shut up a multitude together in a Barn,
and a Butcher comes with his inhumane hands warm
in humane blood, and leads them one by one blind-fold
to a Block, where he slew them (poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents!)
one after another by the scores in cold
blood? But how much more should our hearts
bleed, to think of the hundreds in great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that ignorance doth butcher in secret, and
lead them blind-fold to the Block? Beware this be
none of your case. Make no pleas for ignorance.
If you spare that sin, know that that will not spare
you. Will a man keep a Murderer in his Bosom?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secret reserves in closing with Christ.</hi> To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all for Christ, to hate father and mother, yea,
and a mans own life for him, this is a hard saying,
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. Some will do much, but they will not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44948:47"/>
be of the Religion that will undo them; they never
come to be entirely devoted to Christ, nor fully
to resign to him: They must have the sweet sin:
They mean to do themselves no harm: They have
secret exceptions, for Life, Liberty, or Estate. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
take Christ thus hand over head, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
his self denying terms, nor cast up the cost;
and this error in the foundation marrs all, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
ruins them for ever, <hi>Luke 14. 28. Mat.</hi> 13. 21.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Formality in Religion.</hi> Many stick in the bark,
and rest in the outside of Religion, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
performances of holy duties, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 25.
and this oft-times doth most effectually deceive
men, and doth more certainly undo them, than
open looseness; as it was in the Pharisees case, <hi>Mat.</hi>
23. 31. They hear, they fast, they pray, they give
alms, and therefore will not believe but their Case
is good, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. whereas resting in the work
done, and coming short of the heart-work, and the
inward power and vitals of Religion, they fall at
last into the burning, from the flattering hopes,
and confident persuasions of their being in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way to Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. Oh dreadful
case; when a man's Religion shall serve only to
harden him, and effectually to delude and deceive
his own Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>The prevalency of false ends in holy duties.</hi> Mat.
23. 25. This was the bane of the Pharisees. Oh
how many a poor soul is undone by this, and drops
into Hell, before he discerns his mistake! He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
good duties, and so thinks all is well, and
perceives not that he is <hi>actuated</hi> by carnal Motives all
the while. It is too true that even with the truly
sanctified, many carnal ends will oft-times creep
in; but they are the matter of his hatred and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and never come to be habitually prevalent
with him, and to bear the greatest sway, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 7.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44948:47"/>
But now when the main thing that doth ordinarily
carry a man out to religious duties, shall be some
carnal end, as to satisfie his conscience, to get the
repute of being religious, to be seen of men, to shew
his own gifts and parts, to avoid the reproach of a
prophane and irreligious person, or the like; this
discovers an unsound heart, <hi>Hos. 10. 1. Zech.</hi> 7. 5, 6.
O Christians, if you would avoid self-deceit, see that
you mind, not only your acts, but withal, yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, your ends.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Trusting in their own righteousness, Luk.</hi> 18. 9. This
is a soul undoing mischief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. When men
do trust in their own righteousness, they do indeed
reject Christ's. Beloved, you had need be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
on every hand, for, not only your sins, but your
duties, may undo you. It may be you never thought
of this, but so it is, that a man may as certainly
miscarry by his seeming righteousness, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
graces, as by gross sins; and that is when a
man doth trust to these as his righteousness before
God, for the satisfying his justice, appeasing his
wrath, procuring his favour, and obtaining of his
own pardon: for this is to put Christ out of office,
and make a Saviour of our own duties and graces.
Beware of this, O professors; you are much in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but this one fly will spoil all the Ointment.
When you have done most, and best, be sure to go
out of your selves to Christ, reckon your own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
but rags, <hi>Psalm 143. 2. Phil. 3. 8. Isa. 64. 6.
Neh.</hi> 13. 22.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>A secret enmity against the strictness of Religion.</hi>
Many moral persons, punctual in their formal devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have yet a bitter enmity against preciseness,
and hate the life and power of Religion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6.
compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 1. They like not this froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
nor that men should keep such a stir in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They condemn the strictness of Religion, as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44948:48"/>
indiscretion, and intemperate zeal, and
with them a lively Preacher, or lively Christian, is
but a heady fellow. These men love not holiness,
as holiness, (for then they would love the height of
holiness) and therefore are undoubtedly rotten at
heart, whatever good opinion they have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>The resting in a certain pitch of Religion.</hi> When
they have so much as will save them (as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
they look no further, and so shew themselves
short of true Grace, which will ever put men upon
aspiring to further perfection. <hi>Phil. 3. 13. Pro.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>The predominant love of the World.</hi> This is the
sure evidence of an unsanctified heart, <hi>Mar. 10. 37.
1 Iohn</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p>But how close doth this sin lurk oft-times under a
fair covert of forward profession? <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 14. Yea
such a power of deceit is there in this sin, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times when every body else can see the man's
worldliness, and <hi>covetousness,</hi> he cannot see it himself,
but hath so many colours, and excuses, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for his eagerness, on the world, that he doth
blind his own eyes, and perish in his self-deceit.
How many professors be here, with whom the
world hath more of their hearts and affections than
Christ? Who mind earthly things, and thereby are
evidently after the flesh, and like to end in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?
<hi>Rom. 8. 5. Phil.</hi> 3. 19. Yet ask these
men; and they will tell you confidently, they prize
Christ above all, God forbid else! and see not their
own earthly mindedness for want of a narrow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the workings of their own hearts. Did
they but carefully search, they would quickly find
that their greatest content is in the world, <hi>Luke</hi>
12. 19. and their greatest care and main endeavour
to get and secure the world, which are the certain
discovery of an unconverted sinner. May the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44948:48"/>
part of the world take earnest heed, that they
perish not by the hand of this sin unobserved. Men
may be, and often are kept off from Christ, as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
by the inordinate love of lawful comforts, as by
the most unlawful courses, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 5. Luke 14. 18,
19, 20, 24.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Reigning Malice and Envy against those that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect
them, or are injurious to them, 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 9, 11. O
how do many that seem to be religious remember
injuries, and carry grudges, and will return men as
good as they bring, rendring evil for evil, loving
to take revenge, wishing evil to them that wrong
them, directly against the rule of the Gospel, the
pattern of Christ, and the nature of God, <hi>Rom. 12.
14, 17. 1 Pet. 2. 21, 23. Neh.</hi> 9. 17. Doubtless where
this evil is kept boiling in the heart, and is not
hated, resisted, mortified, but doth habitually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
that person is in the very gall of bitterness, and
in a state of death, <hi>Mat. 18. 34, 35. 1 Iohn</hi> 3. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Reader, doth nothing of this touch thee? Art
thou in none of the forementioned Ranks? O search
and search again; take thy heart solemnly to task.
Woe unto thee, if after all thy profession thou
shouldst be found under the power of ignorance, lost
in formality, drowned in earthly mindedness, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed
with malice, exalted in an opinion of
thine own righteousness, levened with hypocrisie,
and carnal ends in Gods service, imbittered against
strictness: this would be a sad discovery that all thy

it is most certain they are yet in their sins,
and strangers to true conversion. <hi>Iohn 12. 43. Gal.</hi>

under the pride of their own hearts, it's a sign they

are stark dead in sin. O how secretly doth this sin

9. 40.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>The prevailing love of pleasure, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 4. This
is a black mark. When men give the flesh the liberty
that it craves, and pamper, and please it, and do not
deny and restrain it: when their great delight is in
gratifying their bellies, and pleasing their senses;
whatever appearance they may have of Religion, all
is unsound, <hi>Rom. 16. 18. Tit.</hi> 3. 3. A flesh-pleasing

do not dwell? Men are willing to cherish in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
upon never so slight grounds, a hope that
their condition is good, and so look not out after a
change, and by this means perish in their sins. Are
you at peace? Shew me upon what grounds your
peace is maintained. Is it a Scripture peace? Can
you shew the distinguishing marks of a sound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever?
Can you evidence that you have something
more than any Hypocrite in the world ever had? If
not, fear this peace more than any trouble; and

smiles and kisses, and speaks it fair, doth fatally smite
it, as it were under the fifth rib.</p>

Set out from among our Congregations all those

then besides, take out all these twelve sorts of close
and self-deceiving Hypocrites on the other hand,
and tell me then, whether it be not a remnant that
shall be saved. How few will be the Sheep that
shall be left, when all these shall be separated, and
set among the Goats? For my part, of all my nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous

there passed a thorough and mighty change upon
him, or not? when was the time, where was the place,
or what was the means, by which this thorough
change of the new birth was wrought in his Soul?
Speak Conscience: Or if thou canst not tell time and
place, canst thou shew Scripture Evidence, that the
work is done? Hath the man been ever taken off
from his false bottom, from the false hopes, and
false peace wherein once he trusted? Hath he been
deeply convinced of sin, and of his lost and undone
condition, and brought out of himself, and off from
his sins, to give up himself entirely to Jesus Christ;
Or dost thou not find him to this day under the
power of ignorance, or in the mire of prophaneness?
Hast thou not taken upon him the gains of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?
Dost not thou find him a stranger to
prayer, a neglecter of the word, a lover of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world? Dost not thou often catch him in a lie?
Dost not thou find his heart fermented with malice,
or burning with lust, or going after his covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Speak plainly to all the forementioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
Canst thou acquit this man, this woman,
from being any of the two and twenty sorts here
described? If he be found with any of them, set him
aside, his portion is not with the Saints. He must be
converted and made a new creature, or else he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 15. Can <hi>Mammon?</hi>
Riches profit not in the day of Wrath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 4.
Can Kings, or Warriors? <q>No, they shall cry to

               <p>Sinner, methinks this should go like a dagger to
thine heart, to know that God is thine enemy. Oh
whither wilt thou go, where wilt thou <hi>shelter</hi> thee?
There is no hope for thee, unless thou lay down
thy weapons, and sue out thy pardon, and get
Christ to stand thy friend, and make thy peace. If
it were not for this, thou mightest go into some
howling wilderness, and there pine in sorrow:
and run mad for anguish of heart and horrible
despair. But in Christ there is a possibility of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for thee, yea a proffer of mercy to thee, that
thou mayst have God to be more for thee, than he
is now against thee. But if thou wilt not forsake
thy sins, nor turn thoroughly and to purpose unto
God, by a sound Conversion, the wrath of God,
abideth on thee, and he proclaims himself to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, as in the Prophet, <hi>Ezek. 5. 8. Therefore, thus
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44948:54"/>
saith the Lord God, Behold, I, even I, am against thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>His face is against thee.</hi> Psal. 34. 16. <hi>The face of
the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them.</hi> Wo unto them whom God <hi>shall</hi>
set his face against. When he did but look upon
the host of the Egyptians, how terrible was the
consequence? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 8. <q>I will set my face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that man, and will make him a sign, and
proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of
my people, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
2. His heart is against thee: He hateth all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of iniquity. Man, doth not thine heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to think of thy being an object of God's hatred?
<hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 1. Though <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> stood before
me, yet my mind could not be towards this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
cast them out of my sight, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 8. My soul
loathed them, and their souls also abhorred me.
3. His hand is against thee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14, 15. All
his Attributes are against thee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, His Justice is like a flaming Sword un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheathed
against thee. If I whet my glittering
Sword, and my Hand take hold on Judgment, I
will render vengeance to mine adversaries, and
will reward them that hate me. I will make mine
arrows drunk with blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 40, 41.
So exact is Justice, that 'twill by no means clear the
guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. God will not discharge thee,
he will not hold thee guiltless, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7. but
will require the whole debt in person of thee;
unless thou canst make a Scripture claim to Christ
and his satisfaction. When the enlightned Sinner
looks on justice, and sees the ballance in which he
must be weighed, and the sword by which he must
be executed, he feels an earth-quake in his Breast.
But Satan keeps this out of sight, and perswades the
Soul while he can, that the Lord is all made up
of mercy, and so lulls it asleep in sin. Divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44948:55"/>
is very strict; it must have satisfaction to the
utmost farthing; it denounceth <hi>indignation and
wrath, tribulation and anguish, to every soul that doth
evil, Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. It curseth every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
not in every thing that is written in the
Law to do it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. The justice of God to the
unpardoned sinner, that hath a sense of his misery
is more terrible than the sight of the Bayliff or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
to the bankrupt debtor, or than the sight of
the Judge, and Bench to the Robber, or of the
Irons and Gibbet to the guilty Murderer. When
Justice sits upon life and death, Oh what dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dful
work doth it make with the wretched sinner? <hi>Bind
him hand and foot, cast him, into utter darkness, there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 22. 13. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,</hi> Mat. 25. 41.
This is the terrible sentence that Justice pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.
Why sinner, by this severe Justice must thou
be tryed; and as God liveth, this killing sentence
shalt thou hear, unless thou repent and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The holiness of God is full of antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5. He is not only angry with
thee (so he may be with his own Children) but he
hath a fixed, rooted, habitual displeasure against thee;
he loaths thee, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 8. and what is done by thee,
though for substance commanded by him, <hi>Isa. 1. 14.
Mal.</hi> 1. 10. As if a man should give his servant never
so good meat to dress: yet if he should mingle filth,
or poyson with it, he would not touch it. Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is infinitely contrary to sin, and so he cannot but
hate a sinner out of Christ.</p>
               <p>O what a misery is this, to be out of the favour, yea,
under the hatred of God! <hi>Eccles. 5. 4. Hos.</hi> 9. 15. that
God can as easily lay aside his Nature, and cease to be
God, as not be contrary to thee <hi>and detest thee,</hi> except
thou be changed and renewed by grace! O sinner,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44948:55"/>
how darest thou to think of the bright and radiant
Sun of purity, upon the beauties, the glory of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is in God! <hi>The Stars are not pure in his sight;</hi>
Job 25. 5. <hi>He humbleth himself to behold things that are
done in Heaven, Psal.</hi> 11. 3. 6. O those light and sparkling
eyes of his! what do they espy in thee? and thou hast
no interest in Christ neither, that he should plead for
thee. Methinks I should hear thee crying out astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with the Bethshemites, <hi>Who shall stand before this
holy Lord God? 1 Sam.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The power of God is mounted like a mighty
Cannon against thee.</hi> The glory of Gods power is
to be displayed, in the wonderful confusion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of them that obey not the Gospel, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.
8, 9. He will make his power known in them, <hi>Rom.</hi>
9. 22. How mightily he can torment them: For this
end he raiseth them up, <hi>that he might make his power
known,</hi> Rom. 9. 17. O man, art thou able to make thy
party good with thy Maker? No more than a silly
Reed, against the Cedars of God, or a little Cock-boat
against the tumbling Ocean; or the Childrens Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
against the blustring Winds.</p>
               <p>Sinner, the power of Gods anger is against thee,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 11. and power and anger together, make
fearful work. 'Twere better thou hadst all the
world in arms against thee, than to have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God against thee. There is no escaping his
hands, no breaking his prison: <q>The thunder of his
power who can understand? <hi>Iob</hi> 26. 14. Unhappy
man that shall understand it by feeling it! If he
will contend with him, he cannot answer him one
of a thousand. He is wise in heart, and mighty
in strength; who hath hardned himself against
him, and prospered? Which removeth the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and they know it not, which overturneth
them in his anger: Which shaketh the earth out of
her place, and the pillars thereof tremble: Which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44948:56"/>
commandeth the Sun, and it riseth not, and seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up the Stars. Behold he taketh away, who can
hinder him? who will say unto him, What dost
thou? If God will not withdraw his anger, the
proud helpers do stoop under him, <hi>Iob 9. 3, 4,
5, 6,</hi> &amp;c. And art thou a fit match for such an
antagonist? O consider, this you that forget God,
lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you,</q> 
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 22. Submit to mercy. Let not dust
and stubble stand it out against the Almighty. Set
not Briars and Thorns against him in Battle, lest he
go through them, and consume them together; <hi>but
tay</hi> hold on <hi>his strength, that you may make peace with
him,</hi> Isa. 27. 4, 5. <hi>Wo to him that striveth with his
Maker,</hi> Isa. 45. 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The wisdom of God is set to ruin thee.</hi> He
hath ordained his arrows, and prepared the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of death, and made all things ready, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.
12, 13. His counsels are against thee, to contrive
they destruction, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 11. He laughs in himself, to
see how thou wilt be taken and ensnared in the evil
day, <hi>Psal. 37. 13. The</hi> Lord <hi>shall laugh at him,</hi> for <hi>he
seeth that the day is</hi> coming. He sees how thou wilt
come down mightily in a moment; how thou wilt
wring thine hands, and tear thine hair, and eat thy
flesh, and gnash thy teeth for anguish and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of heart, when thou seest thou art fallen reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesly
into the pit of destruction.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The truth</hi> of God <hi>is</hi> sworn <hi>against thee, Psal.</hi>
95. 11. If he be true and faithful thou must perish,
if thou goest on, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3. Unless he be false of
his word, thou must die, except thou repent, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
33. 11. If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful,
he cannot deny himself, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. That is,
he is faithful to his threatnings, as well as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and will shew his faithfulness in our confusion,
if we believe not. God hath told thee, as plain as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44948:56"/>
it can be spoken, <hi>That if he wash thee not, thou hast
no part in him,</hi> John 13. 8. <hi>that if thou livest after the
flesh, thou shalt die,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. <hi>That except thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
thou shalt in no wise enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 18. 3. and he abideth faithful, he
cannot deny himself. Beloved, as the immutable
faithfulness of God in his promise and oath, afford
Believers strong consolation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. so they are
to <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> for strong consternation and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
O sinner, tell me, what shift dost thou make to
think of all the threatnings of Gods word, that stand
upon record against thee? Dost thou believe their
truth, or not? If not, thou art a wretched in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>idel,
and not a Christian; and therefore give over the
name and hopes of a Christian. But if thou dost
believe them, O heart of steel that thou hast, that
canst walk up and down in quiet, when the truth
and faithfulness of God is engaged to destroy thee!
That if God Almighty can do it, thou shalt surely
perish and be damned. Why man, the whole book
of God doth testifie against thee, while thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainest
unsanctified: It condemns thee in every
leaf, and is to thee, like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s roll, written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and without with lamentation and mourning and
woe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 10. and all this shall surely come
upon thee, and overtake thee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 15. except
thou repent. <hi>Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but
one jot, or tittle of this word shall never pass away,</hi>
Mat. 5. 18.</p>
               <p>Now put all this together, and tell me, if the case
of the unconverted be not deplorably miserable
As we read of some persons, that had bound them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves
in an oath, and in a curse to kill <hi>Paul:</hi> So
thou must know, O sinner, to thy terrer, that all
the Attributes of the Infinite God are bound in an
oath to destroy thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 28. O man, what
wilt thou do? Whither wilt thou fly? If Gods
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44948:57"/>
Omnisciency can find thee, thou shalt not escape.
If the true and faithful God will save his Oath, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
thou must, except thou believe and repent. If
the Almighty hath power to torment thee, thou
shalt be perfectly miserable in Soul and Body to all
eternity, unless it be prevented by thy speedy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>The</hi> whole Creation of God <hi>is against thee. The</hi>
whole Creation (<hi>saith</hi> Paul) <hi>groaneth and travelleth
in pain,</hi> Rom. 8. 22. But what is it that the Creation
groaneth under? Why, the fearful abuse that it is
subject to, in serving the lusts of unsanctified men.
And what is it that the Creation groaneth for? Why,
for freedom and liberty from this abuse; for <hi>the
creature is very unwillingly subject to this bondage,
Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 20, 21. If the unreasonable and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
creatures had speech and reason, they would
cry out under it, as bondage unsufferable, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
by the ungodly, contrary to their natures, and
the ends that the great Creator made them for. It
is a passage of an eminent Divine; <q>The liquor that
the drunkard drinketh, if it had reason as well as
a man, to know how shamefully 'tis abused and
spoiled, it would groan in the Barrels against him,
it would groan in the Cup against him, groan in
his Throat, in his Belly, against him. It would fly
in his Face, if it could speak. And if God should
open the mouths of the Creatures as he did the
mouth of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass, the proud mans garments
on his back would groan against him. There is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a creature but if it had reason to know how 'tis
abused, till a man be converted, it would groan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. The land would groan to bear him,
the air would groan to give him breathing, their
houses would groan to lodge them, their beds would
groan to ease them, their food to nourish them,
their clothes to cover them, and the creature would
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44948:57"/>
groan to give them any help and comfort, so long
as they live in sin against God.</q> Thus far he. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
this should be a terror to an unconverted
soul, to think that he is a burden to the Creation,
<hi>Luke 13. 7. Cut it</hi> down, <hi>why cumbreth it the</hi> ground?
If the poor inanimate creatures could but speak, they
would say to the ungodly, as <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Israel</hi> 
                  <q>Must
we fetch you water out of the Rock, ye rebe's?
<hi>Numb.</hi> 2. 10. Thy food would say, Lord, must I
nourish such a wretch as this, and yield forth my
strength for him, to dishonour thee withall? No. I
will choak him rather, if thou wilt give me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
The <hi>very air</hi> would say, Lord, must I
give this man breath, to set his tongue against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and scorn thy people, and vent his pride and
wrath, and filthy communication, and belch our
oaths and blasphemy against thee? No, if thou but
say the word, he shall be breathless for me. His
poor Beast would say, Lord, must I carry him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his wicked designs? No, I will break his bones,
I will end his days rather, if I may have but leave
from thee.</q> A wicked man, the earth groans under
him, and Hell groans for him, till death satisfies
both, and unburdens the earth, and stops the
mouth of Hell with him. While the Lord of Hosts
is against thee, be sure the Hosts of the Lord are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, and all the creatures as it were up in
arms, till upon a mans convertion, the controversie
being taken up between God and him, he makes a
convenant of peace with the creatures for him, <hi>Iob

he can no sooner offer a sinfull delight, or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

it's a fearful thing to be in debt, but above all
in God's debt: for there is no arrest so formidable
as his; no prison so horrible as his. Look upon an
enlightned sinner, who feels the weight of his own
guilt, oh how frightful are his looks, how fearful
are his complaints? His comforts are turned into
Wormwood, and his Moisture into Drought,
and his sleep departeth from his eyes. He is a
terror to himself and all that are about him, and
is ready to envy the very stones that lie in the
Street, because they are senseless, and feel not his
misery; and wishes he had been a Dog, or a Toad,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44948:59"/>
or a Serpent rather than a man, because then death,
had put an end to his misery, whereas now it will

that thou savourest nothing but gratifying the sense,

dost thou yet make light of being everlastingly

who would therefore shew thee thy present misery,

               <p>Now then attend. <hi>Set thine heart unto all that I
shall testifie unto thee in this day; for it is not a vain thing,
it is your life,</hi> Deut. 32. 46. This is the end of all that
hath been spoken hitherto, to bring you to set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
turning, and making use of Gods means for
your conversion. I would not trouble you, nor
torment you before the time with the forethoughts
of your eternal misery, but in order to your making
your escape. Were you shut up under your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
misery, without remedy, it were but mercy (as
one speaks) to let you alone, that you might take
in that little poor comfort, that you are capable of
here in this world. But you may yet be happy: If
you do not wilfully refuse the means of your recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Behold, I hold open the door unto you, arise take
your flight; I set the way of life before you, walk
in it, and you shall live and not die, <hi>Deut 30. 19. Ier.</hi>
9. 16. It pities me to think you should be your
own Murderers, and throw your selves headlong,
when God and men cry out to you, as <hi>Peter,</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Case, to his Master, <hi>Spare thy self.</hi> A noble
Virgin, that attended the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
ravished by the King and hereupon exciting
the Duke her Father to revenge, he called in the
Moors to his help, who when they had executed
his design, miserably wasted and spoiled the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which this Virgin laying so exceedingly to
heart, shut her self up in a Tower belonging to
her Father's house, and desired her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might be called forth; and bewailing to them
her own wretchedness, that she should have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
so much misery and desolation to her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44948:65"/>
for the satisfying of her revenge, she told them
she was resolved to be avenged upon her self. Her
Father and Mother besought her to pity her self and
them, but nothing could prevail, but she took her
leave of them, and threw her self off the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and so perished before their faces.</p>
               <p>Just thus is the wilful destruction of ungodly men.
The God that made them beseecheth them, and
cryeth out to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the distracted Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
when about to murder himself, <hi>Do thy self no
harm.</hi> The Ministers of Christ forewarn them and
follow them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but men will hurl themselves into perdition,
while pity it self looketh on.</p>
               <p>What shall I say? would it not grieve a person
of any humanity, if in the time of a reigning plague
he should have a receipt (as one said well) that would
infallibly cure all the Country, and recover the
most hopeless patients, and yet his friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
should die by the hundreds about him, because
they would not use it? Men and Brethren, though
you carry the certain Symptoms of death in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet I have a receipt that will cure you all, that
will cure infallibly. Follow but these few Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and if you do not then win Heaven, I will be
content to lose it.</p>
               <p>Hear then, Oh sinner, and as ever thou wouldst be
converted and saved, embrace this following counsel.</p>
               <p>Direct. I. <hi>Set it down with thy self, as an undoubted
truth, that it is impossible for thee ever to get to Heaven
in this thy unconverted state.</hi> Can any other but Christ
save thee? And he tells thee he will never do it,
except thou be regenerated and converted, <hi>Mat. 18. 3.
Iohn</hi> 3. 3. Doth he not keep the keys of Heaven?
And canst thou get in without his leave, as thou
must, if ever thou comest thither in thy natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44948:65"/>
without a sound and thorough renovation?</p>
               <p>Direct. II. <hi>Labour to get a thorough sight and lively
sense and feeling of thy sins.</hi> Till men are weary
and heavy laden, and pricked at the heart. and
stark sick of sin, they will not come to Christ in
his way for ease and cure, nor to purpose enquire,
<hi>What shall we do?</hi> Mat. 11. 28. <hi>Acts 2. 37. Mat.</hi> 9. 12.
They must set themselves down for dead men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will come unto Christ, that they may
have life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40. Labour therefore to set all thy
sins in order before thee. Never be afraid to look
upon them, but let thy spirit make diligent search,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 6. Enquire into thine heart and into thy
life, enter into a thorow examination of thy self,

make a full discovery, and call in the help of God's

Ezra</hi> 9. O the work that sin hath made in the world.
This is the enemy that hath brought in death, that
hath robbed and enslaved man, that hath blacked
the Devil, that hath digged Hell; <hi>Rom. 5. 12. 2 Pet.
2. 4. Iohn</hi> 8. 34. This is the enemy that hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Creation upside down, and sown dissention
between man and the creatures, between man and
man, yea between man and himself, setting the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
part against the rational, the will against the
judgment, lust against conscience, yea worst of all,
between God and man, making the lapsed sinner
both hateful to God, and a hater of him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 8.
O man, how canst thou make so light of sin? This
is the Traytor that sucked the blood of the Son of
God, that sold him, that mocked him, that scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, that spit in his face, that digged his hands,
that pierced his side, that pressed his soul, that
mangled his body, that never left, till it had bound
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44948:66"/>
him, condemned him, nailed him, crucified him,
and put him to open shame, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 4, 5, 6. This is
that deadly poyson, so powerful of operation, as
that one drop of it shed upon the root of mankind,
hath corrupted, spoiled, and poisoned, and undone
his whole race at once, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. This is the
common Butcher, the bloody Executioner, that hath
killed the Prophets, burnt the Martyrs, murdered all
the Apostles, all the Patriarchs, all the Kings and
Potentates, that hath destroyed Cities, swallowed
Empires, butchered and devoured whole Nations.
Whatever was the weapon that 'twas done by, sin
was it that did Execution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. dost thou
yet think it but a small thing? If <hi>Adam</hi> and all his
Children could be digged out of their Graves, and
their Bodies piled up to Heaven, and an inquest
were made, what matchless murderer were guilty
of all this blood; it would be all found in the skirts
of sin. Study the nature of sin, till thy heart be
brought to fear and loath it. And meditate on the
aggravations of thy particular sins, how thou hast
sinned against all God's warnings, against thine own
prayers, against mercies, against corrections, against
clearest light, against freest love, against thine own
resolutions, against promises, vows, covenants of
better obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> charge thy heart home with
these things, till it blush for shame, and be brought
out of all good opinion of it self, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6.</p>

                  <hi>Meditate upon the desert of sin:</hi> It cryeth up to
Heaven: It calls for vengeance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 21. Its due
wages is death, and damnation. It pulls the curse
of God upon the Soul and Body, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Deut.</hi> 28.
The least sinful word or thought, lays thee under
the infinite wrath of God Almighty, <hi>Rom. 2. 8, 9.

It would more affright thee, to see thy self in the

loathsome, no carcass or carrion so offensive, no
plague or leprosie so noisom as sin, in which thou

Therefore when thou goest to pray, or meditate,
or to do any of the duties, to which thou art here
directed, go out of thy self, call in the help of the
Spirit, as despairing to do any thing pleasing to God,
in thine own strength. Yet neglect not thy duty,
but lie at the pool, and wait in the way of the Spirit.

to meditate, strive an hundred and an hundred

Never make excuses, thy sins must die, or thou must

               <p>O sinner, hear and consider. If thou wilt part
with thy sins, God will give thee his Christ; Is
not this a fair exchange? I testifie unto thee this

his mercy, but yet love sin, hating holiness and
purity, or will take him for their Benefactor, but not
for their Soveraign; or for their Patron, but not
for their Portion, this is no thorow, and no sound
Conversion.</p>

This is the true Converts choice. But here remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44948:74"/>
these three rules. 1. <hi>You must chuse them all.</hi>
There's no coming to Heaven by a partial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
Read <hi>Psal. 119. 6, 128, 160. Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. None
may think it enough to take up with the cheap and
easie part of Religion, and let alone the duties that
are costly, and self-denying, and grate upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the flesh. You must take all or none. A
sincere Convert, though he makes most conscience
of the greatest sins and weightiest duties; yet he
makes true conscience of little sins, and of all duties,
<hi>Psal. 119. 6, 113. Mat. 23. 23. 2. For all times,</hi> for
prosperity, and for adversity, whether it rain or
shine. A true Convert is resolved in his way, he
will stand to his choice, and will not set his back to
the wind, and be of the religion of the times. <hi>I have
stuck to thy testimonies, I have enclined my heart to perform
thy statutes alway, even to the end. Thy testimonies have
I taken, as an heritage for ever,</hi> Psal. 119. 31, 111, 117,
44, 93. <hi>I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
3. This must not be done hand over head, but deliberately
and understandingly.</hi> That disobedient Son said, <hi>I go
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

promise? <hi>All that the Lord our God shall speak unto
thee, we will do it;</hi> and it's like they spake as they
meant, but when it came to tryal it was found that
there was not such a heart in them, as to do what
they had promised, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 27, 29. If you would be
sincere in closing with the laws and ways of Christ,
First, <hi>Study the meaning, and latitude and compass of
them.</hi> Remember, that they are very spiritual: they
reach the very thoughts and inclinations of the heart;
so that if you will walk by this rule, your very
thoughts and inward motions must be under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Again, that they are very strict and self-denying,
quite contrary to the grain of your natural ine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. You must take the strait gate, the
narrow way, and be content to have the flesh curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44948:75"/>
from the liberty it desires, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. In a word,
that they are very large: For <hi>thy Commandment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
broad,</hi> Psal. 119. 96. Secondly, <hi>rest not in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals</hi>
(for there's much deceit in that) <hi>but bring
down thy heart to the particular commands of Christ.</hi> Those
Jews in the Prophet seemed as well resolved as
any in the world, and call'd God to witness, that they
meant as they said: But they stuck in generals.
When Gods command crosses their inclination, they
will not obey, <hi>Ier.</hi> 42. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. compared
with <hi>Chap. 43. v.</hi> 2. Take the Assemblies larger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,
and see their excellent and most compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exposition of the Commandments, and put thy
heart to it. Art thou resolved in the strength of
Christ, to set upon the conscientious practice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
duty that thou findest to be there required of
thee, and to set against every sin that thou findest
there forbidden? This is the way to be found in
Gods statutes, that thou maist never be ashamed, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 80. Thirdly, <hi>Observe the special duties that thy heart
is most against, and the special sins that 'tis most inclin'd
unto, and see whether it be truly resolved to perform the
one, and forgo the other.</hi> What sayest thou to thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
sin, thy gainful sin? What sayest thou to costly
and hazardous, and flesh displeasing duties? If thou

to cross thy flesh, and put to it, thou art unsound,
<hi>Psal. 18. 23. Psal.</hi> 119. 6.</p>
               <p>Direct. X <hi>Let all this be compleated in a solemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
between God and thy soul,</hi> Psalm 119. 106. Neh,
10. 29. For thy better help therein, take these few
Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Set apart some time, more than once to be
spent in secret before the Lord.</p>

willing to for sake all thy sins, and to resign up thy self, body
and soul unto God, and his service, to serve him in holiness
and righteousness, all the days of thy life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Compose thy Spirit into the most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
frame possible, suitable to a transaction of so
high importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lay hold on the Covenant of God, and
rely upon his promise of giving grace and strength,
whereby thou may'st be enabled to perform thy
promise. Trust not to thine own strength, to the
strength of thine own resolutions, but take hold on
his strength</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Resolve to be faithful, having engaged
thine heart, opened thy mouth, and subscribed
with thy hand unto the Lord, resolve in his strength
never to go back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Being thus prepared, on some convenient
time set apart for the purpose, set upon the work,
and in the most solemn manner possible, as if the
Lord were visibly present before thine eyes, fall
down on thy knees, and spreading forth thine hands
toward Heaven, open thine heart to the Lord in
these, or the like words.</p>
               <p>O Most dreadful God, for the Passion of thy

               <p>O Blessed Jesus, I come to thee
hungry and hardly bested, poor and
wretched, and miserable, and blind,
and naked; a most loathsom, polluted
wretch, a guilty, condemned Malefactor, unworthy
for ever to wash the feet of the servants of my Lord,
much more to be solemnly married to the King of
Glory, but sith such is thine unparallel'd love, I do

love, honour, and obey thee before all others,
and this to the death; I embrace thee in all thine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
I renounce mine own worthiness, and do here
avow thee to be the Lord my Righteousness, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
mine own wisdom, and do here take thee

               <p>And since thou hast told me that I must suffer if
I will reign, I do here Covenant with thee to take
my Lot, as it falls, with thee, and by thy grace assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to run all hazards with thee, verily supposing
that neither life nor death shall part between thee
and me.</p>
               <p>And because thou hast been pleased
to give me thy holy laws,<note place="margin">The least prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal are the Laws of Christ which must be thus observed.</note> as the rule

Laws, as holy, iust, and good, I solemnly take
them as the rule of my words, thoughts and actions,
promising that though my flesh contradict and rebel,
yet I will endeavour to order and govern my whole

               <p>Only because through the frailty of my flesh, I
am subject to many failings; I am bold humbly to

set upon a speedy and present turning. I made haste, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
not, Psal.</hi> 119. 60. Remember, and tremble at the
sad instance of the foolish Virgins, that came not till

24. 25. O come in while it is called to day, lest thou
shouldst be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin;
lest thy day of grace should be over, and the things
that belong to thy peace should be hid from thine
eyes. Now mercy is wooing of thee. Now Christ is
waiting to be gracious to thee, and the Spirit of
God is striving with thee. Now Ministers are
calling, now Conscience is stirring; now the Market
is open, and Oyl may be had, thou hast opportunity
for the buying. Now Christ is to be had for the taking.
Oh! strike in with the offers of Grace. Oh! now or
never. If thou make light of this offer, God may

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. Attend, I say, not customarily, but
conscientiously; with this desire, design, hope and
expectation, that thou mayest be converted by it.
To every Sermon thou hearest, come with this
thought, <hi>Oh, I hope God will now come in. I hope this
day may be the time, this may be the man by whom God
will bring me home.</hi> When thou art coming to the
Ordinances, lift up thine heart thus to God. <hi>Lord
let this be the Subbath, let this be the Season, wherein I
may receive renewing Grace. Oh let it be said, that to

of the word, and yet it hath not been effectual to my
Conversion. <hi>Ans.</hi> Yea, but thou hast not attended
upon it in this manner, as a means of thy Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44948:78"/>
Quench not the Spirit; do not out-strive
him: do not resist him. Beware of putting out
convictions by evil company, or worldly business.
When thou findest any troubles for sin, and fears
about thine eternal State, beg of God that they
may never leave thee till they have wrought off
thy heart throughly from sin, and wrought it over
to Jesus Christ. Say to him, <hi>Strike home, Lord, leave
not the work in the midst. If thou seest that I am not

of serious and fervent Prayer.</hi> He that neglects pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

He that is not constant in prayer, is but an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
<hi>Iob</hi> 27. 10. (unless the Omission be contrary
to his ordinary course, under the force of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
temptation.) This is one of the first things
Conversion appears in, that it sets men on praying,
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. Therefore set to this duty. Let never
a day pass over thee, wherein thou hast not, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Evening, set apart some time for set and
solemn prayer in secret. Call thy family also to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
daily and duly, to worship God with thee.
Wo be unto thee if thine be found amongst the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
that call not on Gods name, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 25. But
cold and lifeless devotions will not reach half way to
Heaven. Be fervent, and importunate. Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
will carry it. But without violence the Kingdom
of Heaven will not be taken, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. Thou must
strive to enter, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. and wrestle with tears
and supplications, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> if thou meanest to carry
the blessing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. comp. with <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 4. Thou
art undone for ever without grace, and therefore
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44948:79"/>
thou must put to it, and resolve to take no denyal.
That man that is fixed in this resolution; <hi>Well I
must have grace, and I will never give over, till I have
grace, and I will never leave seeking and waiting, and
striving with God, and mine own heart, till he do renew
me by the power of his grace;</hi> this man is in the likeliest
way to win Grace.</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But God heareth not sinners, their prayer is
an abomination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Distinguish between sinners. 1. There are
<hi>resolved sinners:</hi> their prayers God abhors. 2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
sinners;</hi> these God will come forth to, and
meet with mercy, though yet afar off, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 20.
Though the prayers of the unsanctified cannot
have full acceptance; yet God hath done much at
the request of such, as at <hi>Ahab's</hi> humiliation, and
<hi>Ninevehs Fast, 1 Kings 21. 26. Ionah</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10.
Surely thou mayst go as far as these, though thou
hast no grace: and how dost thou know but thou
mayst speed in thy suit, as they did in theirs? Yea,
is he not far more likely to grant thee, than them;
since thou askest in the Name of Christ, and that
not for temporal blessings, as they, but for things
much more pleasing to him, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>Christ, Grace,
Pardon, that thou mayst be justified, sanctified, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>Mark</hi> 10 49. Doth he set thee on the use of means,
and dost thou think he will mock thee? Doubtless,
he will not fail thee, if thou be not wanting to thy

great Quality having offended the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
the Kings great Favourite, being admitted

himself at his feet, saying, I am resolved never to

rise more, till I have obtained your Grace's favour,
with which carriage he did overcome him. With
such a resolution, do thou throw thy self at the feet
of God. 'Tis for thy life, and therefore follow
him, and give not over. Resolve thou wilt not be
put off with bones, with common mercies. What
though God do not presently open to thee? Is not
grace worth the waiting for? Knock, and wait, and
no doubt but sooner or later, mercy will come.</p>
                  <p>And this know, that thou hast the very same en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to seek and wait, that the Saints now
in glory once had: for they were once in thy very
case. And have they sped so well? and wilt thou
not go to the same door, and wait upon God in the

<hi>and forbear the occasions of sin,</hi> Prov. 23. 31. Thou
wilt never be turned from sin till thou wilt decline
and forego the temptations of sin.</p>
                  <p>I never expect thy Conversion from sin, unless

occasions. If thou wilt be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

playing on the brink, and tampering and medling
with the snare, thy soul will surely be taken. Where
God doth expose men in his providence, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
to temptations, and the occasions are such as
we cannot remove, we may expect special assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the use of his means. But when we tempt
God by running into danger, he will not engage to
support us, when we are tempted. And of all
temptations one of the most fatal and pernicious,
is evil company. Oh what hopeful beginnings
have these often stifled! Oh the souls, the estates,
the families, the towns that these have ruined!
How many a poor sinner hath been enlightned, and
convinced, and hath been just ready to give the
Devil the slip, and hath even escaped his snare
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44948:80"/>
and yet wicked company have pull'd him back at
last, and made him seven fold more the Child of
Hell. In one word, I have no hopes of thee, except
thou wilt shake off thy evil company. Christ speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

fly this Gulf by which so many thousand souls have
been swallowed into perdition. It will be hard for
thee indeed, to make thine escape. Thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
will be mocking thee out of thy Religion, and
will study to fill thee with prejudices against strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as ridiculous and comfortless. They will be

unto thee, or have any part or portion in thee, who
am not worthy to lick up the dust of thy feet'
Yet since thou holdest forth the golden Scepter, I
am bold, to come and touch. To despair, would
be to disparage thy mercy; and to stand off when
thou biddest me come, would be at once to undo
my self, and rebel against thee, under the pretence
of humility. Therefore I bow my soul to thee,
and with all possible thankfulness accept thee, as
mine, and give up my self to thee, as thine. Thou
shalt be Soveraign over me, my King, and my God:
Thou shalt be in the Throne, and all my powers

proper goods. Set thy mark upon me, upon every
member of my body, and every faculty of my soul.
I have chosen thy precepts. Thy law will I lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to this rule do I resolve, by thy Grace, to walk:
After this law shall my whole man be governed.
And though I cannot perfectly keep one of thy
Commandments, yet I will allow my self in the

But I resolve, in the power of thy Grace, to cleave
to thee, and thy holy ways, what ever it cost me. I

I will be content to tarry till I come to

here, so I may but be admitted to live, and reign
with thee hereafter. Lord, thou hast my heart and
hand to this agreement. Be it as the laws of the

I will stand; In this resolution, by Grace I will
live and die. I have sworn and will perform it
that I will keep thy righteous judgments. I have

               <p>Oh! I am even lost and swallowed up in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of those arguments that I might suggest.
If there be any point of wisdom in all the world, it
is to repent and come in, if there be any thing
righteous, any thing reasonable, this is it. If there
be any thing in the world that may be called mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and folly, and any thing that may be counted
sottish, absurd, brutish, unreasonable, it is this, to
go on in thine unconverted estate. Let me beg thee,
as thou wouldst not wilfully destroy thy self, to sit
down and weigh, besides what hath been said, these
following Motives, and let conscience speak, if it be
not reason, that thou shouldst repent and turn.</p>
               <p>1. The God that made thee doth most graciously invite
thee.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>His most sweet and merciful nature doth invite
thee;</hi> Oh the kindness of God, his working bowels,
his tender mercies! they are infinitely above our
thoughts, higher than heaven, what can we do? Deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than hell, what can we know? <hi>Iob 11. 7, 8, 9.
He is full of compassion, and gracious; long suffering, and
plenteous in mercy,</hi> Psal. 86. 15. This is a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to perswade sinners to come in. <hi>Turn unto
the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>low to
anger, of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</hi> If
God would not repent of the evil, it were some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to us, why we should not repent. If
there were no hope of mercy, it were no such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if rebels should stand out; but never had Subjects
such a gracious Prince, such Piety, Patience, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
pity to deal with, as you have. <hi>Who is a
God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mic.</hi>
7. 18. Oh sinners: See what a God you have to deal
with; if you will but turn, <hi>He will turn again, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44948:86"/>
have compassion on you, he will subdue your iniquities, and
cast all your sins into the depth of the Sea,</hi> V. 19. <hi>Return
unto me, saith the Lord of Hosts, and I will return unto
you,</hi> Mal. 3. 7. Zech. 1. 3. Sinners do not fail in that
they have too high thoughts of Gods mercies, but in
that, 1. <hi>They overlook his Iustice. 2. They promise
themselves mercy out of Gods way.</hi> His mercy is beyond
all imagination, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 9. great mercies, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
21. 13. manifold mercies, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 19. tender mercies,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 6. sure mercies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. everlasting
mercies, <hi>Psal. 103. 17. Isa.</hi> 54. 8. and all thine
own, if thou wilt but turn. Art thou willing to come
in? Why the Lord hath laid aside his terror, erected
a Throne of Grace, holds forth the golden Scepter:
Touch and live. Would a merciful man slay his
enemy, when prostrate at his feet, acknowledging
his wrong, begging pardon, and offering to enter
with him into a Covenant of peace? Much less will
the merciful God. Study his Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7.
Read their experience, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>His Soul encouraging calls and promises do
invite thee.</hi> Ah what an earnest suiter is mercy to
thee! how lovingly, how instantly it calleth after
thee! how passionately it wooeth thee! <hi>Return, thou
back-sliding Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not cause
mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, saith the
Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever. Only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thine iniquity. Turn O back-sliding children, saith
the Lord, for I am married unto you: return and I will
heal your back-slidings. Thou hast plaid the Harlot with
many Lovers, yet return unto me, saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3.
11, 12, 13, 14, 22. <hi>As I live, saith the Lord God, I have
no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that he turn
from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil
ways, for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</hi> Ezek. 33. 11.
<hi>If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and keep all my statutes, and do that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44948:87"/>
and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his
transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done
shall he live. Repent and turn your selves from all your
transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away
from you all your transgressions, and make you a clean
heart, and a new spirit, for why will ye die, O house of
Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that
dieth, saith the Lord God, wherefore turn your selves, and
live ye,</hi> Ezek. 18. 21, 23, 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>Oh melting, gracious words! The voice of a God,
and not of a man! This is not the manner of men,
for the offending Sovereign to sue to the offending
traiterous varlet. Oh how doth mercy follow thee,
and plead with thee! Is not thy heart broken yet?
Oh that to day you would hear his voice!</p>

westward, northward, southward, and eastward,

that goodly mountain. Behold the Paradise of
God, watered with the streams of glory. Arise
and walk through the land, in the length of it, and
in the breadth of it, for all the land which thou seest,
the Lord will give it to thee for ever, if thou wilt
but return, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 14, 15, 17. Let me say to thee,
as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Agrippa, Believest thou the Prophets?</hi> If thou

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44948:87"/>
for ever thine, if thou wilt but throughly turn.</p>
               <p>Behold the City of pure transparent Gold, whose
foundations are garnished with all manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stones, whose gates are pearls, whose light is
glory, whose temple is God. Believest thou this?
if thou dost, art thou not worse than distracted that
wilt not take possession, when the gates are flung
open to thee, and thou art bid to enter? O ye sons
of folly, will ye embrace the dunghills, and refuse
the Kingdom? Behold, the Lord God taketh you up
into the mountain, shews you the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and all the glory thereof, and tells you, <hi>All
this will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me:</hi>
If you will submit to mercy, accept my Son, and
serve me in righteousness and holiness. <hi>O fools, and
slow of heart to believe!</hi> will you court the harlot, will
you seek and serve the world, and neglect the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
glory? What! not enter into Paradise, when the
flaming sword, that was once set to keep you out,
is now used to drive you in? But you will say, I
am uncharitable, to think you infidels and unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
Why, what shall I think you? either you are
desperate unbelievers that do not credit it, or
stark distracted, that you know and believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and eternity of his glory, and yet do so
fearfully neglect it. Surely you have no faith, or
no reason; and I had almost said, conscience should
tell you so, before I leave you.</p>
               <p>Do but attend what is offered you, Oh blessed
Kingdom! A Kingdom of glory, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 1. a
Kingdom of righteousness, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. a Kingdom
of peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. an everlasting Kingdom,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. Here thou shalt dwell, here thou shalt
reign for ever; and the Lord shall set thee in a throne
of glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. and with his own hand shall
set the Royal Diadem upon thine head, and give
thee a Crown not of thorns (for there shall be no
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44948:88"/>
sinning nor suffering there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. 22, 3, 4, 5.)
not of Gold (for this shall be viler than the dirt in
that day) but a Crown of Life, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 12. a
Crown of righteousness, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. a Crown of
glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. Yea thou shalt put on glory as a
robe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. 53. and shalt shine like the Sun
in the firmament in the glory of thy Father, <hi>Mat.</hi>
13. 43. Look now upon thy dirty flesh, thy clay, thy
worms meat: this very flesh, this lump, this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case
shall be brighter than the Stars, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. In

God, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 36. and behold his face in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 15. Look in now and tell me, dost
thou yet believe? If not, conscience must pronounce
thee an infidel, for it is the very word of God that
I speak.</p>
               <p>But if thou say, thou believest, let me next know
thy resolutions. Wilt thou embrace this for thy
happiness? Wilt thou forgo thy sinful gains, thy
forbidden pleasures? Wilt thou trample on the
worlds esteem, and spit in the harlots face, and stop
thine ears at her flatteries, and wrest thee out of
her embraces? Wilt thou be content to take up with
present reproach and poverty, if it lie in thy way
to Heaven, and follow the Lord with humble self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal,
in a mortified and flesh-displeasing life? If
so, all is thine, and that for ever. And art not thou
fairly offered? Is it not pity but he should be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that will needs go on and perish, when all
this may be had for the taking? In a word, wilt
thou now close with these proffers? Wilt thou take
God at his word? Wilt thou let go thy hold-fast of
the world, and rid thy hands of thy sins, and lay
hold on eternal life? If not, let conscience tell thee
whether thou art not distracted, or bewitched, that
thou shouldst neglect so happy a choice, by which
thou mightest be made for ever.</p>

that he will do. She that marries a Prince, expects
he should do for her like a Prince, that she may

the Kings and Monarchs of the Earth, so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

the rest of their kind, or the fair coloured
Palmer-worm amongst the rest of the worms, if
compared with God. As he doth infinitely exceed
the glory and power of his glittering dust, so he
will beyond all proportion exceed, in doing for his
Favourites, whatever Princes can do for theirs. He
will give you grace and glory, and withhold no

               <p>4. <hi>The Terms of mercy are brought as low, as possible,
to you.</hi> God hath stooped as low to sinners, as with
honour he can. He will not be thought a fautor
of sin, nor stain the glory of his holiness, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could he come lower than he hath, unless he
should do this? He hath abated the impossible
terms of the first Covenant, <hi>Ier. 3. 13. Mark 5. 36.
Acts 16. 31. Acts 3. 19. Prov.</hi> 28. 13. He doth not
impose any thing unreasonable, or impossible, as a
condition of life upon you. Two things were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be done, according to the Tenour of
the first Covenant by you. 1. <hi>That you should fully
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44948:89"/>
satisfie the demands of Iustice for past offences. 2. That
you should perform personally, perfectly, and perpetually the
whole Law for the time to come.</hi> Both these are to us
impossible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. But behold Gods gracious
abatement in both. He doth not stand upon satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
he is content to take off the surety (and he
of his own providing too) what he might have
exacted from you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. He declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to have received a ransom, <hi>Iob 33. 24. 1 Tim.</hi>
2. 6. and that he expects nothing but that you
should accept his Son, and he shall be righteousness
and redemption to you, <hi>Iohn 1. 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. And
for the future obedience, here he is content to
yield to your weakness, and remit the rigour. He
doth not stand upon perfection (as a condition of
life, though he still insists upon it as due) but is
content to accept of sincerity, <hi>Gen. 17. 1. Prov.</hi> 11. 20.
Though you cannot pay the full debt, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you according to that which you have, and take
willing for doing, and the purpose for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
2 <hi>Cor. 8. 12. 2 Chron. 6. 8. Heb.</hi> 11. 17. and
if you come in his Christ, and set your hearts to
please him, and make it the chief of your cares, he
will approve and reward you, though the vessel be
marred in your hands.</p>
               <p>Oh consider your Makers condescention. Let me
say to you, as <hi>Naaman</hi>'s servant to him: <hi>My Father,
if the Prophet had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then not have done it? how much rather, when he saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, wash and be clean?</hi> 2 Kings 5. 13. If God had
demanded some terrible, some severe and rigorous
thing of you, to escape eternal damnation, would
you not have done it? Suppose it had been to spend
all your days in sorrow in some howling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or pine your selves with famine, or to offer
the fruit of your bodies for the sin of your souls,
would you not have thankfully accepted eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44948:90"/>
though these had been the conditions?
Yea farther, if God should have told you, you should
have fryed in the fire for millions of ages, or been
so long tormented in Hell, would you not have
gladly accepted it? Alas, all these are not so much
as one sand in the glass of eternity. If your offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Creator should have held you but one year up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the rack, and then bid you come and forsake your
sins, accept Christ, and serve him a few years in
self-denial, or lie in this case for ever and ever: Do
you think you should have stuck at the offer, and
disputed the terms, and have been unresolved,
whether you were best to accept of the motion?
O sinner return and live; why shouldest thou
die, when life is to be had for the taking, and
mercy should be beholding to thee (as it were)
to be saved? Couldst thou say indeed, <hi>Lord, I
know that thou wast an hard man, Mat.</hi> 25. 24. thou
hadst some little excuse; but when the God of
Heaven hath stooped so low, and bated so far, if
now thou shouldst stand off, who shall plead for
thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Notwithstanding all these abatements, I am
no more able to perform those conditions, (in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so easie) of faith and repentance, and sincere
obedience; than to satisfy and fulfil the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> These you may perform by Gods grace
enabling, whereas the other are naturally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this state, even to believers themselves.
But let the next consideration serve for a fuiler an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Wherein you are impotent, God doth offer grace to
enable you. I have stretched out my hand, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
Prov.</hi> 1. 24. What though you are plunged into
the ditch of that misery, from which you can never
get out? Christ offereth to help you out; he
stretcheth his hand to you, and if you perish, it is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44948:90"/>
for refusing his help. <hi>Behold I stand at the door, and
knock: if any man open to me, I will come in, Rev.</hi>
3. 20. What though you are poor, and wretched, and
blind, and naked, Christ oftereth a cure for your
blindness, a cover for your nakedness, a remedy
for your poverty, he tendreth you his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his graces, <hi>I counsel thee to buy of me gold, that
thou mayst be rich, and white rayment, that thou mayst be
cloathed, and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou
mayst see,</hi> Rev. 3. 17, 18. Do you say the condition
is impossible, for I have not wherewith to buy? You

be made clean? when shall it once be?</hi> God doth wait
when you will be made clean, when you will yield
to his motions, and accept of his offers, and let him
do for and in you, what you cannot do for your
selves. You do not know how much God will do
upon your importunity, if you will but be restless
and instant with him, <hi>Luke 11. 8. and</hi> 18. 5.</p>
               <p>If God hath not bound himself by express pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to wicked men, to give them grace in the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
use of the means, yet he hath given them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
encouragement to expect it from him, if
they seek it earnestly in his way. His most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
nature is abundant encouragement. If a rich and
most bountiful man should see thee in misery, and
bid thee come to his door, wouldst thou not with
confidence expect, at thy coming to find some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief?
Thou art not able to believe, nor repent:
God appoints thee to use such and such means, in
order to thy obtaining faith and repentance: doth
not this argue that God will bestow these upon thee,
if thou doest ply him diligently in prayer, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
reading, hearing, self-examination, and the
rest of his means? Otherwise God should but
mock his poor creatures, to put them upon there
self-denying endeavours, and then when they have
put hard to it, and continued waiting upon him for
grace, deny them at last. Surely if a sweet natured
man would not deal thus, much less will the most
merciful and gracious God.</p>

What do you intend to do? Will you go on
and die, or will you set upon a thorow and
speedy conversion, and lay hold on eternal life?
how long will you linger in <hi>Sodom?</hi> how long will
you halt between two opinions? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 21.
Are you not yet resolved whether Christ or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas,</hi>
whether Bliss or Torment, whether the land
of <hi>Cabul, 1 Kings</hi> 9. 13. or the Paradise of God be
the better choice? Is it a disputable case, whether

all the streams of <hi>Eden?</hi> or whether the vile puddle
of sin, be to be preferred before the water of life,
clear as Cristal, proceeding, out of the throne of God
and of the Lamb? Can the world in good earnest
do that for you, that Christ can? Will it stand by
you to eternity? Will pleasures, titles, lands, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
descend with you? <hi>Psal. 49. 17. 1. Tim.</hi> 6. 7.
If not, had you not need look after somewhat that
will? What mean you to stand wavering, to be off
and on? Foolish Children! how long will you stick
between the womb and the world? Shall I leave you
at last no farther than <hi>Agrippa,</hi> but almost perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Why you are for ever lost, if left here. As
good not at all, as not altogether Christians. You
are half of the mind to give over your former neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
life, and to set to a strict and holy course: you
could wish you were as some others be, and could
do as they can do. How long will you rest in idle
wishes, and fruitless purposes? When will you
come to a fixed, full, and firm resolve? Do not
you see how Satan gulls you, by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mpting you to
delays? How long hath he toll'd you on in the way
of perdition? How many years have you been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44948:92"/>
posing to amend? What if God should have taken
you off this while?</p>
               <p>Well, put me not off with a dilatory answer:
Tell me not of hereafter. I must have your present
consent. If you be not now resolved, while the Lord
is treating with you, and wooing of you, much less
are you like to be hereafter, when these impressions
are worn out, and you are hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin. Will you give me your hands?
Will you set open the doors, and give the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
the full and present possession? Will you put
your names into his Covenant? Will you subscribe?
What do you resolve upon? If you are still upon
your delays, my labour is lost, and all is like to
come to nothing. Fain I would, that you should
now put in your adventures. Come, cast in your
Lot, make your choice: <hi>Now is the accepted time, now
is the day of thy salvation; to day if you will hear his voice.</hi>
Why should not this be the day from whence thou
shouldest be able to date thine happiness? Why
shouldest thou venture a day longer, in this danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and dreadful condition? What if God should
this night require thy soul? <hi>O that thou mightest know
in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be hid from thine eyes! Luke</hi> 19. 42. This is
thy day, and 'tis but a day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 4. Others have
had their day, and have received their doom; and
now art thou brought upon the stage of this world,
here to act thy part for a whole eternity. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
thou art now upon thy good behaviour for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting.
If thou make not a wise choice
now, thou art undone for ever. Look what
thy present choice is, such must thine eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be, <hi>Luke 10. 42. Luke 16. 25. Prov.</hi> 1. 27,
28, 29.</p>
               <p>And is it true indeed? is life and death at thy
choice? yea 'tis as true as truth is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44948:92"/>
why then, what hinders but that thou shouldest be
happy? Nothing doth or can hinder, but thine
own wilful neglect, or refusal. It was the passage
of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Philip; See here is water, what doth
hinder me to be baptized?</hi> So I may say to thee: see,
here is Christ, here is mercy, pardon, life, what
hinders but that thou shouldst be pardoned, and
saved? One of the Martyrs as he was praying at
the stake, had his pardon set by in a box (which
indeed he refused, deservedly, because upon unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
terms.) But here the terms are most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and easie. O sinner, wilt thou burn with thy
pardon by thee? Why do but forthwith give up thy
consent to Christ, to renounce thy sins, deny thy
self, take up the Yoak and the Cross, and thou carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
the day, Christ is thine, pardon, peace, life, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
all are thine: and is not this an offer worth
the embracing? Why shouldest thou hesitate, or
doubtfully dispute about the case? Is it not past con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
whether God be better <hi>than sin, and glory
better</hi> than vanity? Why shouldest thou forsake thine
own mercy, and sin against thine own life? When
wilt thou shake off thy sloth, and lay by thine excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?
<hi>Boast not thy self of to morrow,</hi> thou knowest not
where this night may lodge thee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 1.</p>
               <p>Beloved, now the holy Spirit is striving with <hi>you.</hi>
He will not always strive. Hast thou not selt thy
heart warmed by the word, and been almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to leave off thy sins, and come in to God?
Hast thou not felt some good motions in thy mind,
wherein thou hast been warned of thy danger, and
told what thy careless course would end in? It may
be thou art like young <hi>Samuel,</hi> who when the Lord
called once and again, he knew not the voice of the
Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 6, 7. but these motions and items are
the offers, and essays, and calls, and strivings of the
spirit. O take the advantage of the tide, and know
the day of thy visitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:44948:93"/>Now the Lord Jesus stretcheth wide his arms to
receive you. He beseecheth you by us. How mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly

he calleth! The Church is put into a

ear to his voice? It is not the voice that breaketh
the Cedars, and maketh the mountains to skip like
a Calf, that shaketh the Wilderness, and divideth
the flames of fire, it is not <hi>Sinai</hi>'s Thunder; but the
soft and still voice. It is not the voice of Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi>
a voice of cursing, and terror; but the voice of
Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> the voice of blessing, and of glad
tidings of good things. It is not the voice of the
Trumpet, nor the noise of War, but a message of
peace from the King of peace, <hi>Eph. 6. 15. 2 Cor.</hi>
5. 18, 20. Methinks it should be with thee as with
the Spouse; <hi>My soul failed when he spake, Cant.</hi> 5. 6.
I may say to thee, O sinner, as Martha to her Sister.
<hi>The Master is come, and he calleth for thee, Iohn</hi> 11. 28.
Oh now with <hi>Mary</hi> arise quickly, and come unto

none. <hi>Whosoever will let him come and take the water
of life freely.</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Whose is simple, let him turn

I have mingled. For sake the foolish, and live,</hi> Prov.

               <p>Behold, O ye sons of men, the Lord Jesus hath

and beseecheth you to come out. If it were from a

               <p>Beloved, I am loth to leave you. I cannot tell
how to give you over. I am now ready to shut up,
but fain I would drive this bargain between Christ
and you, before I end. What! shall I leave you as I
found you at last? Have you read hitherto, and are
not yet resolved upon a present abandoning all your
sins, and closing with Jesus Christ? Alas, what
shall I say? What shall I do? Will you turn off all

but thus much from you! Why should I be your
accuser, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14, 15. who thirst for your salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Why should the passionate pleadings and
wooings of mercy be turned into the horrid aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of your obstinacy and additions to your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery?
Judge in your selves. Do you not think
their condemnation will be doubly dreadful, that
shall still go on in their sins, after all endeavours to
recall them? Doubtless, <hi>it shall be more tolerable for</hi>
Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>yea for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>in the
day of Iudgment, than for you,</hi> Mat. 11. 22, 24.</p>
               <p>Beloved, if you have any pity for your perishing
souls, close with the present offers of mercy. If
you would not continue and increase the pains of
your travelling Ministers, do not stick in the birth.
If the God that made you have any Authority with
you, obey his command and come in. If you are not
the despisers of grace, and would not shut up the
doors of mercy against your selves, repent and be
converted. Let not Heaven stand open for you in
vain. Let not the Lord Jesus open his wares, and
bid you buy without money and without price, in
vain. Let not his Ministers and his Spirit, strive
with you in vain, and leave you now at last unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded;
lest the sentence go forth against you, <hi>The
Bellows are burnt, the Lead is consumed of the fire, the
Founder melteth in vain. Reprobate Silver shall men
call them, because the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6.
29, 30.</p>
               <p>Father of Spirits, take the heart in hand that is too hard
for my weakness. Do not thou have ended, though I have
done. Half a word from thine effectual power, will do the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44948:96"/>
work. O thou that hast the Key of <hi>David,</hi> that openest
when no man shutteth, open thou this heart as thou didst
<hi>Lydia's</hi> and let the King of glory enter in: And make
this soul thy captive. Let not the tempter harden him in
delays. Let him not stir from this place, nor take his eyes
from these lines till he be resolved to forgo his sins, and to
accept of life upon thy self-denying terms. In thy name,
O Lord God, did I go forth to these Labours, in thy name
do I shut them up. Let not all the time they have cost, be
but lost hours; let not all the thoughts of heart, and all the
pains that have been about them, be but lost labour. Lord
put in thine hand into the heart of this Reader, and send
thy Spirit as once thou didst <hi>Philip,</hi> to join himself to the
Chariot of the Eunuch, while he was reading the word.
And though I should never know it while I live, yet I
beseech thee, Lord God, let it be found at that day, that
some souls are converted by these labours, and let some

                  <head>Mr. Alleine's Counsel for Personal and Family-godliness.</head>
                  <p>BEloved, I despair of ever bringing you to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without sanctification: Or possessing you
of happiness, without perswading you to holiness.
God knows I have not the least hope ever to see one
of your faces in Heaven, except you be converted
and sanctified, and exercise your selves unto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I beseech you study personal godliness, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-godliness.</p>
                  <p>1. Personal godliness. Let it be your first care to
set up Christ in your hearts. See that you make all
your worldly interests to stoop to him, that you be
entirely and unreservedly devoted unto him. If you
wilfully, and deliberately, and ordinarily harbour
any sin, you are undone, <hi>Psal 68. 21. Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. See
that you unfeignedly take the Laws of Christ, as the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44948:96"/>
rule of your words, thoughts, and actions; and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
your whole man, members and mind faithfully
to him, <hi>Psal. 119. 34. Rom.</hi> 6. 13. If you have not a true
respect to all Gods Commandments, you are unsound
at heart. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. Oh study to get the Image and
impress of Christ upon you within. Begin with your
hearts, else you build without a foundation. Labour
to get a saving change within! or else all external
performances will be to no purpose. And then study
to shew forth the power of godliness in the life. Let
Piety be your first and great business. 'Tis the highest
point of Justice, to give God his due. Beware that
none of you be a Prayer-less person; for that is a most
certain discovery of a Christless and a graceless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of one that is a very Stranger to the fear of God.
<hi>Psal. 14. 4. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>b</hi> 15. 4. Suffer not your Bibles to gather
dust. See that you converse daily with the word, <hi>Iohn</hi>
5. 39. That man can never lay claim to blessedness,
whose delight is not in the Law of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 1, 2.
Let meditation and self-examination be your daily
exercise.</p>
                  <p>But Piety, without Charity, is but the half of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
or rather impious hypocrisie. We may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the <hi>Tables,</hi> See therefore that you do Justly, and
love mercy, and let Equity and Charity run like an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thread, throughout all your dealings. Be you tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in all things, and let Chastity and Sobriety be
your undivided companions. Let Truth and Purity,
Seriousness and Modesty, Heavenliness and Gravity,
be the constant ornaments of your speech. Let pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and humility, simplicity and sincerity, shine out
in all the parts of your conversations. See that you
forget and forgive wrongs, and require them with
kindness, as you would be found children of the most
High. Be merciful in your censures, and put the most
favourable construction upon your brethrens car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that their Actions will reasonably bear. Be slow
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44948:97"/>
in promising, punctual in fulfilling. Let meekness and innocency,
affableness, yieldingness and courtesie, commend your conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to all men. Let none of your relations want that love and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
that reverence and duty, that tenderness, care and vigilanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which their several places and capacities call for. This is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
godliness. I charge you before the most high God, that none
of you be fourd a swearer, or a lyar, a lover of evil company, or
a scoffer, or malicious, or covetous, or a drunkard, or a glutton,
unrighteous in his dealing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I will walk within my house with a perfect heart,</hi> Psal. 101. 2.
Let me press upon you a few duties. In general.</p>
                  <p>First, Let Religion be in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>r families, not as a matter by the
by (to be minded at leisure when the world will give you leave)
but the standing business of the house. Let them have your prayers
as duly as their meals. Is there any of your families, but have time
for their taking food? wretched man! canst thou find time to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at
in, and not find time to pray in?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Settle in upon your hearts, that your souls are bound
up in the souls of your family. They are committed unto you, and
(if they be lost through your neglect) will be required at your hands.
Sirs, if you do not, you shall know, that the charge of souls is a
heavy charge, and that the blood of souls is a heavy guilt. O man,
hast thou a charge of souls to answer for, and dost thou not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tir
thy self for them, that their blood be not found in thy skirts?
wilt thou do no more for immortal souls than thou wilt do for thy
beasts that perish? what dost thou do for thy children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?
thou providest meat and drink for them, agreeable to their
natures, and dost thou not the same for thy beasts? thou givest
them mediclnes, and cherishest them when they be sick, and dost
thou not as much for thy swine? More particularly.</p>
                  <p>1. Let the solemn reading of the word and singing of Psalms, be
your family exercises, <hi>Isa. 34. 16. Ioh. 5. 39. Psal.</hi> 118. 15. [See
Christ singing with his family, <hi>viz.</hi> his Disciples, <hi>Mat. 26. 30 Lu</hi> 9. 18.]</p>
                  <p>2. Let every person in your families be duly called to an account,
of their profiting by the word heard or read, as they be about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your own business. This is a duty of consequence unspeakable,
and would be a means to bring those under your charge, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44948:97"/>
and profit by what they receive. See Christs example in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his family to an account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16, 11, 13, 15.</p>
                  <p>3. Often take an account of the souls under your care, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Spiritual estates; [Herein you must be followers of Christ.
<hi>Mat. 13. 10, 36, 51. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ark</hi> 4 10, 11.] make inquiry into their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
insist much upon the sinfulness and misery of their natural
estate, and upon the necessity of regeneration and conversion, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their salvation. Admonish them gravely of their sins, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
beginnings. Follow them earnestly, and let them have no quiet
for you, till you see them in a saving change. This is a duty of high
consequence, but (I am afraid) fearfully neglected. Doth not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
say, thou art the Man?</p>
                  <p>4. Look to the strict sanctifying of the Sabbath by all your
housholds, <hi>Exod. 20. 19. Lev.</hi> 23. 3. Many poor families have little
time else. O improve but your Sabbath days as diligently in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
for knowledge, and doing your Makers work, as you do
the other days in doing your own work, and I doubt not but you
may come to some proficiency.</p>
                  <p>5. Let the Morning and Evening Sacrifice of solemn Prayer, be
daily offered up in all your families, <hi>Psal. 92. 1, 2. Exod. 30. 7, 8.
Luke</hi> 19, 10. Beware they be not found among the families that call
not upon Gods name, for why should there be wrath from the Lord
upon your families? <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 25. O miserable families, without God
in the world, that are without family Prayer! what! have you so
many family sins, family wants, family mercies, what! and yet no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
Prayer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? how do you pray with all prayer and supplication, if
you do not with family Prayer? <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. Say not, I have no time,
What, hast thou all thy time on purpose to serve God, and save thy
soul? and yet is this it for which thou canst find no time? find but a
heart, and I will find time. Pinch out of your meals, and sleep, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than want for Prayer. Say not My business will not give leave.
This is the greatest business to save thy self, and the souls committed
to thee. Besides, a whet will be no let. In a word the blessing of
all is to be got by prayer, <hi>Ier. 29. 11, 12. 2 Sam.</hi> 7. 29. and what is
thy business without Gods blessing? say not, I am not able. Use the
one talent, and God will increase, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 24. &amp;c. Helps are to be
had, till thou art better able. But if there be no other remedy, thou
must join with thine abler neighbour, God hath special regard to

                  <p>7. Set up Catechising in your families, at the least once every
week. Have you no dread of the Almighties charge, that you
