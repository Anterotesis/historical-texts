            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">_1. FIrſt, that the Magiſtrate have no Coerſive power whatſoever, in matters of Religion, Faith, or Worſhip; but that all perſons within the Dominions of this Common-wealth, profeſſing Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall have full and free Liberty of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his or their conſciences, in matters of Faith towards God, to all intents without any reſtriction whatſoever, though of different perſwaſions as aforeſaid; and that none be ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from peaceably inhabiting within the dominions of this Common-wealth, who believe in the Eternal, and Ever-living God. And that no perſon ſhall upon any pretence whatſoever be impriſoned, or undergoe any manner of puniſhment for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their conſcience towards God: And that all ſuch as are ſo impriſoned, be forthwith releaſed, and freely ſet at liberty; And that no perſon or perſons whatſoever, within this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, be forced or conſtrained by any Law made, or to be made, by any power, pretence, or pretences whatſoever, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, or pay towards the maintenance of any Miniſter, publick or private Preacher, in any kind whatſoever; but that every one be left to his own liberty therein, to do as ſeemeth him good, and not to be forced to pay to any perſon whom he neither hires, hears, nor ſets at work; knowing this to be equal in the ſight of God, and juſt men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, That none be compelled to ſwear, or take an Oath againſt their conſcience, it being contrary to the expreſſe command of Chriſt, who ſaith, ſwear not at all; but that the ſame puniſhment be inflicted on him that ſhall ſpeak falſely (co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,

cheat) or bear falſe witneſſe in any caſe whatſoever, as if he ſware falſely; proportioning his puniſhment that ſhall do ſo, as he thought to have puniſhed the other by his falſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Witneſſe, which is equal, the Law being for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and diſobedient.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That no perſon or perſons within the Dominions of this Common-wealth (who are not ſubſervient to a foreign State) nor have forfeited their Liberty by Delinquency, or having a hand in any of the late Plots, or Rebellions againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weealth, be ſecluded from any publick truſt, or place of truſt, either in Parliament, Councel, Army, or other Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or place of Truſt whatſoever, within the Dominions of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, That no perſon or perſons whatſoever, who have perſecuted any for their conſcience, or committed any to priſon for their conſcience, ſhall be capable of electing, or being elected into any place of Truſt within the dominions of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, till a farther manifeſtation be given of his or their good affection towards the people of God, and equall and juſt Liberty of every individual perſon, though of different perſwaſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Dominions of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, That all ſervile Tenures or Copy-holds within this Common-wealth, being the badge or yoke of the Conqueſt, be thorowly conſidered, and made conſiſtent with the well being of a firm Common-wealth; due regard being had to every mans juſt propriety.</p>
            <p n="7">
