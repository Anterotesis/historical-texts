            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Moreover (added the King) I have knowne thy hatred and malice towards me, not onely in the greatest things, but even in the smallest and in matters of least moment, in which by thy authority thou hast over-much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my patience; depriving my Clerkes in thy visitation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my Letters to the contrary, and their just ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales; both which thou hast contemned, together with my Royall Authority. The Arch-Bishop troubled and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in minde at these things, craved a Blessing from the King; who replyed, That his Blessing would rather become him, then his the Arch Bishop. The King hereupon complaines of him to the Pope, That he had troubled the peaceable and safe estate of the Kingdome in his absence, and stirred up the Nobles to a Rebellion and Conspiracy against him, &amp;c. And notwithstanding his submission, cited him to appeare at <hi>Rome,</hi> banished him the Realme, seized upon all his goods moveable and unmoveable, forbidding all his Subjects, under a great paine, to foster him: Yet the Monkes of <hi>Canterbury</hi> secretly harboured him for a time, furnished him with necessaries, and conveyed him beyond the Seas. Which the King afterwards understanding, seized on all their Goods and Lands, banished them the Monastery, turning fourescore Monkes a begging, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding any to harbour them; and kept them in that miserable estate, till afterwards he was pleased, upon their submission, to restore them. After which, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> interceded to the King for this Arch Traytor, calling him his Lord: with which the King being greatly offended, put this Bishop out of his protection, and confiscated his goods, because he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged another then the King to be his lord; even such a one, who being guilty of Treason &amp; manifest contempt against the King, had lost the very right of a Subject in his Kingdome. While the Arch-Bishop was thus in exile, before any hearing of this

His Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> the second succeeding him, out of an over-indulgent pitty, calls home this Arch-Traytor by his Letter, writes to the Pope to discontinue his Fathers Suite against him, and to send him over with all speed to Crowne him: Who glad with the newes, and unable to make haste home, as was requisite, by reason of his crazie body, sent a Commission to the King, with the names of three Bishops in it, giving him liberty to elect which of the three he desired, to Crowne him in his behalfe; who made choyse of the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who set the Crowne on his head. The King upon the Arch-Bishops returne, restored him all his goods, and every penny received of his Temporalties during his two yeares exile, (a good reward for a Traytor) whereby he became the richest Arch-Bishop of many before and after him. He was no sooner come home, but a new danger encountred him, by his owne wonted boldnesse.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58789:52"/>
This Arch-Bishop stiffely opposed this condition saying, That it ought not to be made, especially seeing the Church ought to be free, and no wayes to be taxed by Lay-men; adding, that he would rather endanger his head for this cause, then suffer the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved. Which Answer so moved the company of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that the Knights of the Counties, with certaine of the Nobles of the Kingdome, with great fury petitioned, that the Temporalties of the Ecclesiastickes might be taken away, saying, That the Clergy were growne to such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive pride, that it would be a worke of piety and charity, by the taking away of their Temporalties, which did puffe them up, to compell them to be more humbly wise. These things they cryed out, these things they presented to the King in short writings, thinking to bring this Petition to effect.

Wherefore if you will needes be faithfull, and sworne unto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> it must be in maintaining, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending spirituall things, as preaching of Christs Gospell pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely, ministring truely after the institution of our Master Christ, the blessed Sacraments of holy Church, and in vertuous living, giving example to the Holy Church of Christ. But now if this be your Oath, truely you are perjured, and worthy to weare Papers, for you doe reckon your selves too high and too honourable, to goe about such simple things as these be. And therefore you have applyed your selves to other greater matters, as to Christening of Bells, to hallowing of Churches,<note place="margin">The holy workes of Bishops.</note> to blessing of Candles, to consecrating of Holy Oyle, to hallowing of Chalices, vestments, and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore I doe reckon that after the true forme of your Oath, we have but few Bishops, but that be perjured or abjured (call it what you will) both against God, against S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and against their Prince. It followeth. And to the Holy Church of Rome. What needeth this? what good can you doe to the Church of Rome, or what profit is it to her that you sweare? thinke you that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in very deede the Popes meaning and yours was none other, but for to betray the King, and his Realme: and therefore as soone as there was any variance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and the Pope, then were you first of all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyled of your allegeance due unto our King, and that absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was blazen and blowne, preached and taught through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world, and all doores and postes must bee decked with papers and bulls for your discharge.

O Lord God how have we beene blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus trayterously to handle our naturall Prince? But how this Caterpiller is come to be Lord and hath brought Kings under his feete, I will speake (God willing) after this in a particular treatise It followeth, and to his successors, lawfully and regularly entring in. After what Law? I read in your owne <note n="*" place="margin">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reckon that your oath doth not meane this Law, nor yet the Law that blessed <note n="(y)" place="margin">Tim. 3. Tit. 1.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth of. For then I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon, that by the vertue of your Oath, you have not beene bound to one Pope this 400. yeares, so that it must follow, that you have other Lawes, than blessed S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58789:69"/>
or the Councell of <hi>Carthaginence</hi> to choose your Pope by, the which as farre as men can reckon, by common experience and practise be these. <hi>Inprimis,</hi> He that shall be able to be Pope,<note place="margin">Who is lawfull to be Pope.</note> must be a vengeable tyrant, never keeping peace but alwayes warring for the defence (as ye call it) of S. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony. To suffer no Prince to dwell in rest by him, but to snatch his possessiones to the unholy Church of Rome.

What neede you to sweare thus unto the Pope? doth not the order of Charity binde you thus to use your selfe toward all men, that is to say, neither to hurt them, nor to harme them, neither to intrappe them, nor betray them. But all men must be betray'd, and with craft and subtletie undone, for the maintenance of this one person. The truth is, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man spake against this Popet, but you destroy him, and betray'd him: but this Popet hath blasphemed, and betrayed all Protestants, and yet you were never against him. And why, because you be sworne to him. And you will keepe your Oath be it right or wrong.

Now are not you such, for you sweare an oath to the King, that you will immediately take your Bishopricke of him, and hold it all onely of his grace. Wherefore then doe you here sweare against your owne Law? And also against your Oath made to your Prince? Moreover, you know that there was an old custome, in the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, that no Bishop should goe out of the Realme, without the Kings Licence.<note place="margin">The Prelates will obey the Pope but not the Prince.</note> Are you not bound to keepe this custome: but answere, that the Pope hath dispensed with you, and that you are not bound to keepe any obedience toward the acts that your Prince ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Moreover, I marvaile sore, that you be all so straightly sworne of so long time, and never one of you that ever went in my dayes to discharge this Oath. And why? because you are dispensed with. But were it not as good to leave it out of your Oath at first, seeing you intend not to keepe it, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to dispence with you for it. No forsooth for then the Pope could not bind you to come to Rome at his pleasure, and betray your King, and all his Counsailes. But in your Oath that is newly made, and that you have sworne last, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if the Pope be on this side the mountaines, then you shall visite him every yeare: but if he be beyond the mountaines, then every three yeares.

If he be, you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Counsell, and that yearely: and why? because the Pope is on this side the Mountaines. But and if he be in Rome, and hath all Princes neckes under his girdle, yet is it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that you come every third yeare. For you can at once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming devise as much Treason, as Princes shall avoyd in five yeares. But what belongeth this unto a Bishop: that the Pope is on this side the mountaines, or beyond. If he be bound by Gods Law, yearely to visite the Pope,<note place="margin">The Bishops sweare to visit the Pope yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> then must you visite him wheresoever he be, though he were either with God or the Devill: and if you be not bound by Gods Law, what a presumption is it of him to bind you? yea what an over-sight is it of you, to let your selfe thus to be bound? and what a wickednesse is it of you so straightly to keepe this Oath: to the which you are not bound by Scripture, against your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience made to your Prince, which is commanded by Gods Word? But I pray you what example hath either he, or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to bind by vertue of an Oath, the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles yearely to visit him at Rome?

But the Temporall men stood still by their sayings, insomuch that the said Gentleman said to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that both the exaction of Probates of Testaments, and the taking of Mortuaries as they were used, were open Robbery and theft.

                     <p>As therefore the Bishops &amp; Popes Jurisdiction were suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed together before, so it is worth the observation, that they are both revived together by this Act, upon the restauration of Popery; And good reason, for <hi>Nicholas le Maistre</hi> in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of the Ancient Principality of Bishops,</hi> Dedicated to the great French <hi>Cardinall Richeleiu,</hi> Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1633. in his Dedicatory Epistle to this Cardinall informes us; That verily the Majestie of the Pontificall and Episcopall jurisdiction is so conjoyned and confederated together, that the enemies cannot so guide their hands, but with the same audacity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they assaulted the Popes Crowne, they likewise shaked the Bishops Miters, and as it were with one bloody wound pierced both their sides. Whence it came to passe, that the atrocity of the Bishops sorrowes increased so farre, that their patience suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to digest their owne domesticke injuries, was let loose to the dangers of the chiefe Pontise, the Pope, and brake forth into the most sharpe indignation and hatred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence we see it comes to passe by a certaine Divine assent and Counsell, that the Authority of Bishops should be expelled out of the same Provinces, out of which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy lust had thrust out the Papall Majestie.

Fifteene hundred of those bookes were printed, and dispersed, and being questioned for it, his answer was, that hee did set the Jesuites to write one against another, that hee might out of their writings picke matter against them.

                        </gap>. And the Cardinall lent the Emperour much money open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gave the French King more secretly. Hee plaid with both hands to serve their secret that all men know not as the Bish. of <hi>Durham</hi> said. But whatsoever the Frenchmen did they had ever the worse notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the secret working of our holy Prelates on their side. Finally, unto the siege of <hi>Pavia,</hi> came the French king personally with 60. thousand men of warre, of which 12. thousand were horse-men, and with monie enough. And the Emperours host was under 20. thousand, of which were but 3. thousand Horse-men, with no money at all: For hee trusted unto the Pope for aide of men, and unto our Cardinall for Money. But the Pope kept backe his men till the French-men had given them a field; and our Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall kept backe his money for the same purpose. And thus was the silly Emperour betrayed, as all his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours have beene this 8. hundred yeares. Howbeit there bee that say, that the Emperours Souldiers so threatned <hi>Stace</hi> the kings Graces Embassadour, that he was faine to make chevisance with Merchants for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the kings name, to pay the Souldiers withall; Wherefore the Cardinall tooke from him all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and played the Tormentor with him, when he came home, because hee presumed to doe one jot more then was in his Commission. But howsoever it was, the Emperours men in tarrying for helpe had spent all their Victualls: Whereupon <hi>Burbon</hi> the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58789:122"/>
chiefe Captaine of the Emperour, said unto his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Captaines; Yee see, helpe commeth not, and that our victuals are spent: wherefore there is no remedy but to fight, though wee bee une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually matched. If wee winne, wee shall finde meate enough; if wee lose, wee shall lose no more then wee must lose with hunger, though we fight not. And so they concluded to set upon the French-men by night. The King of <hi>France</hi> and his Lords supposing that the Moon would sooner have fallen out of the skie, then that the Emperours host durst have fought with them, were somewhat neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and went the same night a mumming that <hi>Burbon</hi> set upon them. The Emperours Hoste therefore, with their sodaine coming upon them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed the Frenchmen, and drave them upon heapes together, one on another, so that they never could come in array againe, and tooke the King,<note place="margin">

                        </note> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Lords, and slew many, and wanne the field. And there came out all the Cardinals privy treason. For in the French-Kings Tent (say men) were Letters found, and beside that in the French-kings Treasure, and in all the Hoast among the Souldiers were English Shippes found innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which had come sayling a thousand miles by Land. But what wonder? Shippes be made to sayle over the Sea, and wings to flye into farre Countries, and to mount to the toppe of High hills. When the French King was taken, wee sang, <hi>Te Deum.</hi> But for all that singing, wee made peace with French-men. And the Pope, the Venetians, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, least the Emperours Army should doe any hurt in <hi>France:</hi> whereby you may conjecture of what minde the Pope and the Cardinall were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Emperour, and with what heart our spiritualty with their invisible secrets, sang <hi>Te Deum.</hi>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:58789:123"/>
And from that time hitherto, the Emperour and our Cardinall have beene twaine, After that, when the King of <hi>France</hi> was delivered home againe, and his Sonnes left in pledge, many wayes were sought to bring home the sonnes also; but in vaine except the French King would make good that which hee had promised the Emperour. For the bringing home of these children no man more busied his wits then the Cardinall: Hee would in any wise the Emperour should have sent them home, and it had beene but for our Kings pleasure for the great kindnesse that he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in times past. Hee would have married the Kings Daughter our Princesse unto the Dolphine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or as the voyce went among many, unto the second Brother, and hee should have beene Prince in <hi>England,</hi> and King in time to come; so that he sought alwayes to plucke us from the Emperour, and joyne us unto <hi>France,</hi> to make <hi>France</hi> strong enough to match the Emperour, and to keepe him downe that the Pope might raigne a God alone and doe what pleaseth him, without controlling of any over-seer. And for the same purpose hee left nothing unprovided to bring the Mart from <hi>Anwerpe</hi> to <hi>Cales.</hi> But at that time, the Pope taking part with the French King had warre with the Emperour: And at the last the Pope was taken, which when the Cardinall heard, hee wrote unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that he should make him Pope: And when hee had gotten an answer that pleased him not, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto his deservings toward the Emperour, then hee waxed furious mad, and sough all meanes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the Emperour, and imagined the divorcement betweene the King and the Queene, and wrote sharply unto the Emperour with manacing Letters, that if hee would not make him Pope, hee would make such ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling betweene Christian Princes as was not this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, to make the Emperour repent; yea, though it should cost the whole Realme of <hi>England,</hi>

Since that he had a hand in dissolving other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, to the prejudice of the King and Kingdome. In the <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of the Commons House of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, presented to King <hi>Charles</hi> our Soveraigne in the 3. yeare of his Raigne; hee was by name complained against as one of the chiefe heads of the popish and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian Factions, which disquietted both our Church and State; and as a persecuter of good Ministers, and suppressour of Lectures. How many godly Ministers he prosecuted, silenced, suspended, deprived, both in the High Commission, and all the Diocesse under his Jurisdiction, whiles hee continued in favour at the Court, is so well knowne to all, that I need not relate it: And his disfavour at Court (as most conjecture) was the cause of his unexpected Clemencie to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the province of <hi>York</hi> some few years before his death. He was the first advancer of <hi>William Laud</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of Doctor <hi>Cousins,</hi> with sundry other Incendiaries and Innovators both in Church and State, who were entertained by him for his Chaplaines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee had a hand in ratifying the late Canons and Oath, in affront of his Majesties Prerogative, the Parliament, Lawes, and Liberties of the Subject; And no doubt he had a finger in the late <hi>Scottish</hi> Warres and Combustions; whereupon hee burnt all his Letters concerning Church and State-affaires, as soone as he heard the <hi>Scots</hi> had entred into <hi>England,</hi> for feare they should have beene surprized and his fellow-Prelates machinations against the <hi>Scots</hi> by their surprisall discovered.

This Bishop was a great man borne, and did beare such a stroake, that he was able to shoulder the Lord Protector. Well, it chanced that the Lord Protector and he fell out, and the Bishop would beare nothing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58789:159"/>
at all with him, but played the <hi>Sacrapha</hi>; so the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>France</hi> was faine to be sent for from beyond the seas, to set them at one; and goe betweene them, for the Bishop was as able and ready to buckle with the Lord Protector, as hee was with him. Was not this a good Prelate? he should have beene at home Preaching at his Diocesse with a wannion. This Protector was so noble and godly a man that he was called of every man, the good Duke <hi>Humfry</hi>; he kept such a house as was never since kept in England, without any inhaunsing, of rents (I warrant you) or any such matter. And the Bishop for standing so stiffely by the matter, and bearing up the order of our Mother the holy Church was made a Cardinall at <hi>Calis,</hi> and thither the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> sent him a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Hat: he should have had a <hi>Tiburne Tippit,</hi> a halfe penny halter, and all such proud Prelates. These <hi>Romish</hi> Hats never brought good into England. Vpon this the Bishop goeth to the Queene <hi>Katherine,</hi> the Kings wife, a proud woman and a stout, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, that if the Duke were in such authority still, and lived, the people would honour him more than the King, and the King should not be set by; and so betweene them, I cannot tell how, it came to passe, but at S. <hi>Edmundsberry</hi> in a Parliament, the good Duke <hi>Humfry</hi> was smothered.</p>

All this while the <hi>Kings</hi> good will was not sought, no nor (which was a greater oversight as the world then went) the <hi>Popes</hi> neither. The King therefore not onely refused to deliver possession of the Temporalties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this elect, but also laboured the Pope, <hi>ex plenitudine potestatis,</hi> to conferre the Bishopricke upon a Chaplaine of his named <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard de Bury,</hi> the Deane of <hi>Wells.</hi> Partly to pleasure the one that requested, partly to displeasure the other for not requesting, he did so, and commanded the Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> to consecrate him; which being performed at <hi>Chertsey</hi> soone after Christmasse, the King presently invested him in the temporalties belonging to that See. Now was the Monke a Bishop without a Bishopricke; having no other home, he was faine to returne to his Cloyster, and there for very griefe (as it is supposed) within a few dayes after dyed. This <hi>Richard dé Bury,</hi> at what time <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Windsor</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> fled into <hi>France</hi> with his Mother, was principall receiver of the Kings Revenewes in <hi>Gascoigne.</hi> Their mony failing, he ayded them secretly with a great summe of that he had received for the King. It had almost cost him his life, he was so narrowly pursued by some of the Kings friends that got understanding of it, as hee was glad to hide himselfe in a steeple in <hi>Paris</hi> the space of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes. The Queene we know was then contriving an open rebellion and plotting a mischeivous treason against her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, whom she shortly after seised upon in an hostile manner, and afterwards caused to be deprived and murthered, so that this Prelates furnishing of her thus with the Kings owne monies to further this her designe, was high Treason at the least.</p>

This Oath <hi>Roger</hi> not onely tooke himselfe, but likewise administred to all the other, being then Chancellour of <hi>England</hi>: yet notwithstanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all duties of Religion towards God, of thankfulnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his patron, and Loyalty towards his Prince, he was the first man who upon the death of the King fell to plotting for the advancement of <hi>Stephen</hi> unto the Kingdome (who likewise
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58789:173"/>
had taken the former Oath and swore homage and fealty unto <hi>Mawde</hi>) which by his perswasion he first attempted, and much deale by his ungracious counsell at last obtained. At the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> his death, it hapned that <hi>Mawde</hi> was in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> with her Father, wherefore <hi>Stephen</hi> Earle of <hi>Bologne</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this advantage, wrought so with this Bishop, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and they with him, as they were content to set the Crowne upon his head, who otherwise than by a kinde of election which they procured, had no colour of right unto the same. For if they regarded nearenesse of blood, not onely <hi>Mawde</hi> and her sonne were nearer, but <hi>Theobald</hi> also Earle of <hi>Bloyes, Stephens</hi> elder brother. Howbeit these Clergie men that bare all the sway in those times, desirous to continue their owne greatnesse, would needes make choyse of him, thinking by this meanes they should so farre obleige <hi>Stephen</hi> to them, as in all likelihood it must be a meanes not onely to continue, but likewise much to encrease their swaying power, greatnesse and authority. As for the Oath they had taken, this Bishop devised an excuse; that King <hi>Henry</hi> after the time they had sworne to his daughter, marrying her out of the Realme without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, had therein discharged them of that Oath. However, this allegation might bleare the eyes of men, it could not deceive God, that out of his justice turned this device to the destruction of many, and the infinite trouble of all them that had any finger in the same, especially of this Bishop. King <hi>Stephen</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his raigne, to secure himselfe the better against forraine invasions, as he thought, granted license unto all that would to build Castles in any part of the Realme; by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which grant in a short time after, there were erected no lesse than 1117. new Castles. This <hi>Bishop</hi> hereupon (<hi>cujus opera nunquam Episcopali a fuere,</hi> writes <hi>Neubrigensis</hi>) built a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, at the <hi>Devises</hi> (the goodliest, stateliest building in all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope) with the Castles of <hi>Shirborne</hi> and <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and new walled and repaired the Castle of <hi>Salisbury: Et quoniam hujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi extructio Episcopalem honestatem minus decere videbatur, ad tollendam illius structionis invidiam &amp; quasi expiandam maculam, totidem monasteria construens, collegis religiosis implevit,</hi> saith the same <hi>Neubrigensis.</hi> These antidotes were of so small force, as there wanted not many to buzze dayly into the Kings eares, that these Castles no doubt were intended to entertaine the

party of the Empresse his adversary, and that it much behooved him to take them from the Bishop, in whose hands to leave them was neither safe nor seemely. Wherefore partly out of feare and jealousie of the Bishops fidelity, and partly out of a desire of the Bishops wealth, as some conjecture, he summons a councell at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whither all the Bishops, and specially <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> are summoned. <hi>Roger</hi> would faine excuse himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At his first comming he summoned the Castle, enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to prove all meanes to get in rather than let this occasion slip.

                           <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> held a Councell of all the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> and of many Abbots in great state at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> wherein the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> made this speech; That by vertue of his Legatine power which he derived from the Pope, he had summoned the Clergie of <hi>England</hi> to this Councell, that they might consult in Common of the peace of the Country, which was in great danger of Shipwrack; that in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> his Uncle, <hi>England</hi> was a singular houshold of peace, &amp;c. Which King some yeares before his death caused all the Bishops and Barons to sweare to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his Daughter and onely Childe, that the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England,</hi> with the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> should descend to her if he had no issue male by the Duke of <hi>Loraines</hi> daughter.

In them you may behold the spirit and disposition of this Bishop, heare the groanes and cries of the people, see a shepheard scattering, (I had almost said) devouring his owne flocke; He that was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to paint <hi>Hercules,</hi> thought he had done enough, when he had made a resemblance of the Lyons skin, which he was wont to carry about him as a Trophee of his honour.</p>

                                    <p>This Dioces was the stage where the direfull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies of this warre were acted by the space of two yeares and upwards.</p>
                                    <p>Thus did he trouble Israel in the time of peace, nay by these he put some of the Chariots and Horsemen of Israel to flight, out of these he raiseth a farme of 500. pounds for his primary Visitation: if it be considered <hi>cum pertinentiis,</hi> it was not deere, yet well improved; for formerly but 40. pound in the time of some of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.</p>
                                    <p>Will it please your Lordships with patience to cast your eyes upon the modell of this Bishops zeale, piety, and Religion: Let his affection to prayer and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching speake for all the rest.</p>
                                    <p>First, for prayer. It was his hap to finde a prayer which is no prayer, pretended to be prescribed by a Canon which is no Canon, I meane the 55. Canon set forth in the yeare 1603. and no other prayer must be used in his Dioces before Sermons. That monster of conceived prayer (pardon the expression, its not my owne) seemed as bad to him as a spell or charme. It must not be used upon any occasion, without doubt he would never have beene so strait-laced, and severe in this particular, if hee had but dreamed of that strait which a minister a friend of his was put unto by this meanes; the story is short. A Butcher was gored in the belly by an Oxe, the wound was cured, the party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired publike thanksgiving in the Congregation, the Minister finding no forme for that purpose, reads the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58789:238"/>
Collects for Churching of women.</p>
                                    <p>Next for preaching. That hee is most able in this kinde is agreed by all. But that he ever preached him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this Diocesse saving once, I never heard affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any.</p>
                                    <p>His next care was that others should not preach too often; if they did, they must be put into his blacke Bill: He changed that golden sentence of (<hi>vae mihi si non praedicavero</hi>) into <hi>vae aliis si praedicaverint</hi>; he was so farre from the practise of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the great Preacher of the Gentiles, who (we reade) preached till midnight, that there must be no Sermons in the afternoone; there may be, nay there must be sports and pastimes then. And as if he had stood in feare of inarticulate language bells which might foretell a Sermon, hee cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to heare the noise of a Sermon in the toll of a Bell.</p>
                                    <p>In a word; he adorned Churches at the charge of other men, and spoyled Pulpits, which ought to have beene the greatest part of his owne charge.</p>
                                    <p>(My Lords) you have now presented to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships a brother, nay, one whose place ingaged him to be a father of the Clergy, yet one who like <hi>Iosephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren hath taken the coat from <hi>Ioseph,</hi> nay they were forced to fly from him as <hi>Ioseph</hi> from his Mistris, or else they must taste of his forbidden waters, but in their going away he rents their skirts, nay their whole garments and livelihoods from them, hee hath taken the locks from many <hi>Sampsons,</hi> and done what he could to put out their eyes, and to make them grinde in the mill of his pernicious and dangerous innovations.</p>
                                    <p>He should like <hi>Moses</hi> have led his flocke. <hi>Moses</hi> led the children of <hi>Israel</hi> through the red Sea, this man drives part of his flocke over the Sea, but went not himselfe.</p>
                                    <p>Like <hi>Nimrod</hi> he hath invaded the lawes and liberties of the subject, he hath beene as great a robber as ever

                        <p>TO passe by the first Bishops of this See, none of the best, there have beene three successions of Bishops in <hi>Oxford,</hi> since I left the University; <hi>Houson, Corbet,</hi> and <hi>Bancroft</hi>; all of them Patriots of Innovations, Erronious, Popish, Arminian Doctrines, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Ceremonies, prophane Sports, Revels, and Bacchanals on the Lords day, scandalous in their lives, notoriously given to the flesh, enemies to frequent preaching, and the true Practise of Piety. Of the two first of them I have given a touch in <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> page 519. to which I shall referre you, and for the last of them, a Non-preaching Prelate, who (for ought I can learne) never preached above one or two Sermons (if so many) all his life time; he had a finger in the late Canons, Oath, lone, in pressing whereof he was not negligent; and had not death arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him (with the other two) I doubt not but the Parliament had bin troubled with many complaints against them all, which now being buryed together with them, I will not revive.</p>

This is true, that I being taken as I returned from my journey made into the holy Land, and delivered into the Emperours hands, was in respect of my Kingly state, used according thereunto very friendly, and honorably, till your Master comming thither (for what purpose he himselfe best knoweth) had long conference with the Emperour. After which, I for my part,

Iudge you therefore what manner of imprisonment your Master deserved at my hands, that procured such ease for me at the Emperours hands.</hi> These two Chaplaines had their mouthes stopped with these words thus by the King uttered, and so departed their wayes. The Bishop being still detained in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, procured suite to be made to the Pope for his deliverance, writing a Letter to the Pope against the King for this hard u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, recorded by <hi>Hoveden</hi>; whereupon the Pope writ a Letter to the King in his behalfe, to importune his release.

But immediately after his consecration, the King prohibited him to stay within his kingdome: and <hi>Hugh</hi> carryed himselfe as Bishop, no lesse than he did before his deprivation; and taking with him the Episcopall Chaplet, Staffe, and Ring, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he unlawfully detaining them, and beginning his journey towards <hi>Rome,</hi> departed. And because he would not restore the things he carryed away, <hi>Allexis</hi> excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, interdicted his Bishopricke, and the Pope confirmed that sentence. Hereupon the Pope writes three Letters; one to the Bishops, Abbots, and Prelates of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Prior of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and the Clergy and people of that Diocesse, honourably to receive <hi>Iohn</hi> as their Bishop, within 8 dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the receipt of this Letter, and to submit unto him as their Bishop; and putting on the spirit of fortitude to labour wisely and manfully for the preservation of Ecclesiasticall Justice, and to endeavour to appease the Kings displeasure; But if the <hi>King</hi> were averse, or inclining to the Counsell of wicked men, then they ought to <hi>obey God</hi> and the holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more than

This Arch-bishop by the instigation of our English Prelates writ and Preached in defence of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as he afterwards confessed in the Synod of <hi>Fiffe,</hi> where he retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this his Doctrine as erronious, and being put from his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke, excommunicated and hated of the people, who put him to the horne for his debts, he fell into a great sicknesse, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Dogges appetite, and wanting meate to satisfie his hunger he was in manner starved to death, confessing in his sickenesse, that his sentence of excommunication was justly pronounced, and desired the Assembly to release him from it for Christs sake; whereupon he was afterwards absolved, after his forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned recantation.

                        <p>Besides this generall, there be some things more speciall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be adverted unto, for discovering his Spirit. 1. The fourth Canon of Cap. 8. forasmuch as no Reformation in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Discipline can be made perfect at once in any Church; therefore it shall, and may be lawfull for the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>any time</hi> to make remonstrance to his Majesty, or his successors, &amp;c. Because this Canon holdeth the doore open to more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, he writeth to the Prelate of <hi>Rosse</hi> his privy Agent in all this Worke, of his great gladnesse, that this Canon did <hi>stand behind the Curtaine,</hi> and his great desire that this Canon <hi>may be Printed fully, as one that was to be most usefull.</hi> Secondly, the title prefixed to these Canons by our Prelates.

But in <hi>Canterburies</hi> Edition, the name of Papists and Popery is not so much as mentioned. 5. Our Prelates have not the boldnesse to trouble us in their Canons, with Altars, Fonts, Chancels, reading of a long Liturgy before Sermon, &amp;c. But <hi>Canterbury</hi> is punctuall, and peremptory in all these. Although the words of the tenth Canon <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. be faire, yet the wicked intentions of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi> may be seene in the poynt of justification of a sinner before God, by comparing the Canon as it came from our Prelates, and as it wes returned from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and Printed; our Prelates say thus; <hi>It is manifest that the superstition of former ages, hath turned into a great prophanenesse, and that people are growne cold for the most part in doing any good, thinking there is no place to good workes, because they are excluded from justification. Therefore shall all Ministers, as their Text gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth occasion, urge the necessity of good workes, as they would be saved, and remember that they are</hi> Via Regni, <hi>the way to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, though not</hi> causa regnandi, <hi>howbeit they be not the cause of Salvation.</hi> Here Rosse giveth his judgement, <hi>That he would have this Canon simply commanding good workes to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As it was sent in writing from our Prelates, and as it is Printed at <hi>Canterburies</hi> command, may be also manifest, that he went about to establish auricular confession, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish absolution. 8. Our Prelates were not acquainted with Canons for afflicting of arbitrary penalties: But in <hi>Canterburies</hi> Booke, wheresoever there is no penalty expresly set downe, it is provided that it shall be arbitrary, as the Ordinary shall thinke f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By these and many other the like, it is apparent, what tyrannicall power he went about to establish in the hands of our Prelates, over the worship, and the soules and goods of men, overturning from the foundation, the whole order of our Kirke, what seeds of Poperie he did sow in our Kirke, and how large an entry he did make for the grossest novations after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which hath beene a maine cause of all their combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

These Popish innovations therefore have been surreptitiously inserted by him, without the Kings knowledge, and against his purpose. Our Scottish Prelates doe petition that something may be abated of the <hi>English</hi> ceremonies, as the Crosse in Baptisme, the Ring in marriage, and some other things. But <hi>Canterbury</hi> will not onely have these kept, but a great many more, and worse superadded, which wes nothing else, but the adding of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This Booke inverteth the order of the Communion in the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> as may be seene by the numbers, setting downe the orders of this new Communion, 1.5.2.6.7.3.4.8.9.10.15.

But it is enough for you, when you find any good Epistle, or any good Gospel, that setteth forth the Liberty of the holy Church, to Preach that, and let the rest be. <hi>Thomas</hi> answered, my Lord, I thinke that none of my Parishioners will complaine that I take not the

Cow, nor the uppermost cloath, but will gladly give me the same, together with any other thing that they have, and I will give and communicate with them any thing that I have, and so my Lord we agree right well, and there is no discord among us. And where your Lordship saith, It is too much to preach every Sunday; indeede I thinke it is too little, and also would wish that your lordship did the like. Nay, nay, Dean <hi>Thomas</hi> (saith my Lord) let that be, for we are not ordained to preach.

Then spake my Lord stoutly and sayd, I thanke God that I never knew what the old and New Testament was, (and of these words rose a Proverbe which is common in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ye are like the Bishop of <hi>Dunkelden</hi>

For the Archbishops and Bishops of England (and those of forraine Countrys too) have many times, not onely excommunicated their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes, but also interdicted their Kingdomes, enjoyned hard penances to them, absolved their Subjects from their allegiance, and oathes, armed their people and strangers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and deprived them of their Crownes; offering them more and greater affronts, and requiring more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from them, then all other their Subjects whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

upon them? or did they ever deal so with their Princes, as our Prelates did with King <hi>Iohn,</hi> or with <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the second? If yea, then prove it: If no, then this is no solid objection, but a malicious suggestion against the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall and Synodall Government. In a word, I would demand this question of the Objectors, whether Kings, and great men, when they scandalously offend, be subject to the censures of Excommunication by the law of God? If so, then why may not the Presbytery and Synode of Ministers anathematize them, as well as Lord Bishops and Popes? If not, then there is no feare of such a censure, to which they are not liable by Gods Law or mans.</p>

And further that all Christian Princes (if they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the malediction and blasphemy of the name of God) ought to take away their temporalities from that shaven generation which most of all doth nourish them in such malediction. And so in like wise the fat tithes from Churches appropriate to rich Monks, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, fained by manifest lying and other unlawfull meanes, likewise ought to debarre their gold to the proud Priest of <hi>Rome</hi> which doth poyson all Christendome with Simony and Heresie.

Apostles and Disciples never tooke upon them secular dominion, neither did they appropriate unto them Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as these men doe, but lead a poore life, and gave a good testimony of their Priesthood. And therefore all Christians ought to the uttermost of their power and strength, to sweare that they will reduce such shavelings to the humility and poverty of Christ and his Apostles; and whosoever doth not thus, consenteth to their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.

this is the nature of dogs; if any man goe about to take away the bone out of their mouth, by and by to snatch at him, and teare him with their teeth. It is out of all controversie, unto such as have any wit at all, that such men were very childish, that is to say, ignorant of all learning and judgement, which did so fat and feed with their possessions, these belly beasts; For who would not judge it more then childish, to bestow the Kings victuals or meate upon the bellies of the prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Iesabel?</hi> But all they which at this present doe endowe such filthy sinks (I will not call them dens of thieves) with such revenues, they doe follow the steps of <hi>Iesabel</hi>; for what other thing doe they, when as daily they are bleating and lowing before their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, burning of Incense, and fall flat downe before their Altars, but that which in times past the prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> did, when as they transported the worship of God unto an Idoll?

And that saying of our Lord to the Apostles, Ye cannot serve God and Mammon, did principally respect the Apostles Successors. For if a Bishop that he may please both the heavenly and earthly king, at once wil devide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to both Offices; Verily the heavenly King, who wils that men should serve him with all the heart, with all the soule, and with all the strength, doth neither approve, nor love, nor accept his divine mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. What then will he doe, if a Bishop doth not give peradventure not so much as halfe of himselfe, to execute the things which are of God, and become a Bishop, but commits his cures to unworthy and remisse Executioners, that he may wholly serve an earthly Court or Palace? For no halfe man can sufficiently administer the Offices of an earthly Prince.</hi> By which sentences and examples we verily are admonished, that assiduous care and study of Clergie men, in worldly and Civill affaires, which makes them prove slow and unfit to divine things, is by all meanes to be reproved, and that the complaint of those is very unjust, who taxe them for not intermeddling with temporall affaires, and studie to call them backe from divine things, to which they ought with all their might to apply themselves.

For the name Bishop, spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the unlearned, signified to them nothing lesse than a preacher of Gods Word, because there was not, nor is any thing more rare in any order of Ecclesiasticall persons, than to see a Bishop preach, whereof the doings of the Popish Bishops of <hi>England</hi> can this day witnesse; but the name Superintendent should make him ashamed of his negligence, and afraid of his idlenesse, knowing that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth call upon him, <hi>to attend to himselfe and to his whole flocke</hi>: of the which sentence our Bishops marke the first peece right well, that is, to take heede to themselves, but they be so deafe, they cannot hearken to the second, that is, to looke to their flocke.

cannot be denied, but that it was not amisse to joyne for a time another word with it in his place, whereby to restore that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed word to his right signification. And the name Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is such a name, that the Papists themselves (saving such as lacke both learning and wit) cannot finde fault withall. For <hi>Peresius</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and an Arch-papist (out of whom <hi>Martin</hi> hath stollen a great part of his booke) speaking of a Bishop saith; <hi>Primum Episcopi munus nomen ipsum prae se fert, quod est su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendere, Episcopus enim Superintendens interpretant, visitans aut supervidens, &amp;c.</hi> that is to say: the chiefe Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop by interpretation signifieth a Superintendent, a visitor, or an Over-seer.

Christ saith <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>Who made me a Iudge betweene you?</hi> as though hee would say, it belongeth not to my Office to determine matters of Policy and inheritance, that belongeth to the Civill Magistrate. If he had thought it had beene within the Compasse of his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, why and with what Conscience refused he to set them at one, who were at strife, and to put that out of doubt which was in suite? If he might doe it, and would not, he lacked Charity, and did not his duety. If it belonged not to him, how belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it to any of his Disciples or Successours? had he not as large a Commission as he gave? or could he give that he had not? But he knowing his Office, as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> had foretold; to preach the Gospell, would doe nothing without warrant.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:58789:366"/>
And therefore being asked if he were a King, answered simply and by a plaine negative, My Kingdome is not of this world. If his Kingdome was not here, neither the ordering of Policies; yea when they would have taken him up to have made him a King, as one that refused that belonged not to him,<note place="margin">Few of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates would now refuse such a proffer.</note> he conveyed himselfe from among them. If imperiall jurisdiction belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him, why refused he his calling? If it did not, where had <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> or any other, any authority to meddle with that which he refused: seeing he saith, <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you.</hi> In another place, Christ knowing the bounds of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, would not meddle with externe policy. Hence Bishops me thinkes by his example, should not give themselves too much the bridle, and too large a scope to meddle too farre with matters of policy. If these two Offices, I meane Ecclesiasticall and Civill be so jumbled in both functions, there can be no quiet or well ordered Common-wealth. Christ saith to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples: Princes of the Nations doe beare rule like Lords, it shall not be so with you. It falleth not into an Apostles or Church-mans Office, to meddle with such matters. For none going to warre, intangleth himselfe with the affaires of this life, it is enough for them to attend upon one Office; to attend as sole Priests nor as errant Bayliffes. (And elsewhere in that Booke he proceeds thus.) Come off ye Bishops, away with your superfluities, yeeld up your thousands, be content with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, as they be in other reformed Churches, where there be as great learned men as you are.

That a Bishop should not ordaine Clerkes without a Councell of his Presbyters. That a Bishop should heare no mans cause without the presence of his Clerkes, except the cause of confession, because a decree cannot be firme which shall not seeme to have the consent of many.</hi> All which considered, it is evident, that our Bishops in those dayes had no Lordly Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over other Ministers, no such sole power of Ordination and judicature as our present Lord Bishops now claime and exercise as their peculiar right.

                     <p>Fourthly, the Bishops in other reformed Churches, could and did plead as large Antiquity and prescription for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as our Prelates doe: yet that could not secure them from dissolution, but these Churches wholly suppressed them: therefore it is no good Plea for us to continue our Prelates; yea, in my weake judgement it is an argument not for, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Bishops continuance, that they have beene tolerated so long, since evils and grievances [as our Lordly Prelates have ever beene to our Church and Kingdome] are so much the more speedily and carefully to be suppressed, by how much the more
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:58789:397" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inveterate and lasting they have beene. In a word, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Church by a Presbytery hath beene more ancient, more profitable, and lesse prejudiciall to our State, Kings, Church, than the Government of our Lordly Prelacy: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is most reasonable that it should be revived, reestablished, and the Prelacy suppressed. All which I hope, may suffice in Answere to the first part of this grand objection, which hath stumbled many.</p>
                     <p>To the second branch of it, touching the danger and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of this change in suppressing Episcopacy.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer: First, that there can bee no danger or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at all therein, because the people generally most earnestly desire, pray for, expect it, and have preferred many Petitions to the High Court of Parliament to effect it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because all things are now prepared for this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, the wickednesse, misdemeanors, prophanenesse, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, oppression of our present Prelates, with the great troubles and combustions they have raised in our Church, our State, to their intolerable charge and molestation, deserve and call for this alteration; the present constitution of our Church, State, people: yea our correspondency with <hi>Scotland,</hi> with other reformed Churches requires it: the divisions and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in our Church (which in many wise mens apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot be reconciled, nor any unity or uniformity in Gods worship established among us without it;) call for it Episcopacy being now growne such a <hi>roote of bitternesse, and wall of partition,</hi> as there is little hope of any unity, peace, or harmony in our Church if it continue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, admit some petty inconveniences may arise by such an alteration and extirpation of Episcopacy, yet these are nothing comparable for weight or number to those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes which will certainely accrue by its continuance: Since therefore of two evils the lesse is ever to be elected, it will bee farre more expedient to our Church and State totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to suppresse, then to support our Lordly Prelacy. And thus much for this Capitall Objection.<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="505" facs="tcp:58789:397"/>To this I answere.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> First; that the tyranny, Lordlinesse, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse, Superstition and Innovations of our Prelates both in Ceremones, Doctrine, Worship, have beene the Originall, Principall, if not onely cause of all those Sects, divisions, and Separations lately sprung up in our Church; for proofe of which I appeale onely to every mans conscience and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it being a most knowne undubitable truth: the removing therefore of our Bishops (the <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sublata causa tollitur effectus,</hi> Kickerman.</note> cause of all our Schismes and devisions) must needes be a meanes of future peace and unity, not cause of Schismes, or divisions in Religion, as is vainely suggested.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Episcopacy it selfe is now a <note n="(c)" place="margin">See all the Seperatists late Pamplets and Bookes.</note> maine ground of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Separation from our Church, the great stumbling blocke which causeth many dayly to fall off from us, and hinders others from closing with us; all other grounds of Separation and division depending on, or arising from Episcopacy. And unlesse this be removed, in my poore apprehension, there can be no hopes at all of any reconciliation of those who are fallen off from us, or keeping others from separation, but the rent will still grow greater, what ever course else be taken to effect a Union. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore questionlesse the abolishing of Episcopacy cannot be a meanes of increasing Schismes or divisions, but the best, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest way to remedy and prevent them.</p>

                        <hi>Schismes and divisions that ever happened in the Church of God since its first institution,</hi> both at home and abroad, as is evident by all Ecclesiasticall Histories, by the severall Schismes of the Popes and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in forraigne parts; of <hi>Canterbury, Yorke,</hi> and other Lordly Prelates at home, which if God send life and opportunity, I shall irrefragably manifest in a peculiar Treatise of that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if there be occasion. It cannot be then, but that their suppression should rather remedy than procure Sects and Schismes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in the reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> where there are no Bishops, there are no Sects, or Schismes at all, or at least not so many as where there are Bishops. And though im <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> there bee many Sects,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:58789:398"/>
yet this is not through want of Bishops, but by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance of the temporall Magistrates who permit them, and wil neither suppresse them themselves, nor suffer their Presbyteries to doe it, out of I know not what State policy, permitting all Religions and Sects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, our Bishops ever since the Reformation, and before, have beene the greatest opposers and hinderers of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of those abuses and fooleries, the introducers and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of those Ceremonies and Superstitions which have beene the grand occasions of Schismes and Separation.

                     <p>Sixthly, I appeale to all indifferent men, whether Schismes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and diversities in matters of Religion may not be better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, suppressed by good Lawes, by godly Magistrates and Ministers, specially authorized to suppresse them, than by a company of corrupt Prelates and their Officers, who for their owne private Lucre (as experience manifests) will bee content to tolerate, and connive at any erronious doctrines, Sects and Schismes (especially <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> the chiefe patriots and supporters of their Hierarchy) but those who directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their Prelacy and corruptions, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> it is a most grosse mistake, for the Clergie ever grant their subsidies in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> not in the Lords house, and if the Major part of the Clerkes in <hi>Convocation</hi> grant subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without the Bishops, and then send their Bill by which they grant them, to the Commons and Lords House to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, (as they usually doe) if the Commons and Temporall Lords, without the Bishops passe it, this, with the Kings Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all assent, will binde all the Clergie and Bishops too.

                        </gap>nabling certaine Commissioners to execute all those Legall Acts which Bishops usually did, will prevent all this pretended confusion; so that this part of the Objection is scarce worthy answere.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For the fourth clause, that the King by his Coronation Oath, is sworne to preserve to the Bishops and their Churches all their Canonicall priviledges, and to protect and defend to his power the Bishops and Churches under his government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I answere, First, that this Oath was at first cunningly devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and imposed on our Kings by our Bishops themselves, out of a policy to engage our Princes to maintaine them in their usurped authority; possessions, and Jurisdictions, which had no foundation in the Scripture, and to captivate our Kings to their pleasures, as the Popes by such a kind of Oath enthralled the Emperours to their Vassallage.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that this Oath was first invented by Popish Prelates, and meant onely of them and their Popish Church and Priviledges, and so cannot properly extend to our Prelates if Protestants.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this Oath doth no way engage the King to defend and maintaine our Bishops, if the Parliament see good cause to extirpate them. For as the King and Judges who are obliged by their Oathes to maintaine and execute all the Lawes of the Realme, are not bound by their Oath to continue former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient Lawes from alteration, or repeale, or to execute them when repealed, for then all ill Lawes should be unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and irrepealeable: So the King by this his Oath, is no wayes obleiged to defend, protect, and preserve the Bishops, if there be good cause in point of piety and policy to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse them, especially when any of them prove delinquents: For as Bishops and other Subjects by their misdemeanours may <note n="(r)" place="margin">See <hi>Brooke Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither could the Secretary (who perswaded him to send a milder answere, and to sue to his Majestie for License to abide in Towne) obtaine any other resolution from this Cholericke Prelate. From him he repaired to Doctor <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> at <hi>Ely</hi> house in <hi>Holburne,</hi> acquainting him with this his Majesties Letter, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him by his Majesties Order upon his Canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to repaire forthwith to his Bishopricke, according to his Majesties command. But this dutifull Prelategrew more Cholericke than the former, answering him to this effect: <hi>Let who would obey this Command, yet he would not: what, sayd he, have I lately bestowed almost</hi> 500. l. <hi>in repairing and furnishing my house, here in London, to make it fit for my habitation, and must I now be Commanded to depart from it, and sent into the cold wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In conclusion, the Bishop told him plainely, <hi>he would obey neither the one nor other, and that he would not stirre out of London all the winter till the spring, if then.</hi> The Secretary wondring at these two Bishops strange disobedience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy both in words and deeds, departes from them to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Harsnet,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Field,</hi> with his Letter and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who gave him the like answers in effect, though in calmer Termes, not one of them stirring from <hi>London,</hi> either upon the Kings Letter, or Arch-bishops Command, for all their Oath of Allegiance to the King, and of Canonicall obedience to the Arch-Bishop. If then these late Prelates have beene so Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, so contumacious, both against his Majesties and their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitanes commands, when they required them onely to reside on their Bishoprickes, as the Law of God, the Statutes of the Realme, the Canons of the Church in all ages, yea the very Canon Law it selfe, enjoyne them to doe, <hi>under paine of mortall sinne</hi>; What Rebels, and disobedient Varlets would they have proved, thinke you, in matters and commands lesse reasonable?</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Eleventhly, our Prelates have beene strangely Rebellious, contumacious, and disloyall above all other Subjects, in sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vilifying, affronting the Kings owne Letters Patents, and frustrating his Subjects of the benefit of them. Thus Doctor <hi>Young</hi> Deane of <hi>Winchester</hi> was put by the Mastership of Saint <hi>Crosses,</hi> though granted him by Patent, that Doctor <hi>Lewis,</hi> who left his Provostship in <hi>Oriel</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> with other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and fled into <hi>France</hi> for buggery as was reported; might be thrust in. So Doctor <hi>Manwering,</hi> publickely censured in Parliament for a Seditious Sermon, and made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any preferment, by the sentence of the House, was

immediately after the Parliament ended, thrust into a living of three hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> by our Prelates; and hee who had the grant of the next advowson by Patent put by. Thus divers others have beene thrust by such places as the King himselfe hath granted them by Patent by our Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Prelates, to advance those of their own saction, yea one of them hath not stucke to say, <hi>that had the King himselfe granted a Patent for the Execution of Writs of Capias Excommunicatum to some who had long sued for it, that he would make the King recall it, or in case he would not, he would withstand and not obey it.</hi> Nay, we know, that though the Lord Majors of <hi>London,</hi> by Patent, and prescription time out of minde, as the Kings Leiutenants and Vicegerents, have used to carry up their swords before them in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard and Church, yet a proud ambitious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, not long since<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Since that the now Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath had contests with the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> touching their Charters and Priviledges which must all stop to adore his greatnesse, contesting even before the King and Lords with that Universitie and <hi>Oxford</hi> too, whether he as Arch-bishop, or his Majestie as King, should be their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor.
