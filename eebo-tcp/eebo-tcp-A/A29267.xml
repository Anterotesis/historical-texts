            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It will be admired at by ſome, that I ſhould contend againſt ſo great a Perſonage: But truly, Right Honourable, there is nothing that makes me willing to be ſilent now, but this, That I my ſelf am compaſſed about with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: But this is no argument why I ſhould not ſeek Juſtice; but be deſtroyed, (together with others) inſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and waſted time after time, by the wils of men, or of a man. It is true, I ſee the favour of my Enemy (he being great and potent) will make me many enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56758:3"/>
many gain honour and greatneſſe meerly by it: But there is a God that impartially judgeth the earth, and the ſmall and the great are all one with him, and with juſt men. It is true, I expoſe my ſelf by this to the power and ſtratagems of the Generall, and all his Polititians, to undo me, and to work their revenge upon me, if the Lord of righteouſneſſe and juſtice doth not reſtrain them: but in this conſideration (whatever my Enemies power and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies are) I ſhall give up my ſelf wholly to the great Judge of the Earth, and truſt him, come life, come death.</p>
            <p>It is true, He is great and potent by the bloud, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ruines of the people (the effects of War;) and to me this is a great argument againſt the ingroſſing of all power and authority into his breſt; and much more againſt the acting arbitrarily and unlimitedly againſt any member of the people or Common-weale: and to my reaſon, it is to make ſuch an end of War and bloud, as that it is not worth the blood of one man (as it may probably extend) much leſſe the bloud of ſo many thouſands as have been ſlain in the War,—Civill War.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Me thinks, I cannot but conſider the conteſt betwixt the King and this Honourable Houſe: and ſurely, I cannot beleeve, but that, had it not been for injuſtice, Monarchy had ſtill remained; and I do not think that any juſt man would have lift up his hand to engage in War—Civill War—, for my part, I ſhall profeſſe, I ſhould not: for I am not againſt Government, but can live with ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either in <hi>Monarchie, Ariſtocracie,</hi> or <hi>Democracie:</hi> for to me nothing is eſſentiall, but Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe in a Common-weal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I cannot but conſider the glorious expreſſions of Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe in the many Declarations of the Armie; by which the Penman thereof, and the chief heads did ſeem to be taken up conſcientiouſly with the power of Juſtice, in their engagement againſt the Parliament, and excluded many that had formerly appeared valiant and fighting men in the cauſe of the Nation, to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56758:3"/>
and infamy; with this pretence, That Juſtice and Reaſon did only juſtifie them, and an intention of a ſpeedy Settlement, of Juſtice, and Laws of reaſon to the people. But there was a declining of that ſolemn Engagement, which was like to have made all former Victories hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and to have totally endangered the A mie, and all the well-affected people in the whole Nation. And it was Mr. <hi>Edward Hide</hi>'s Speech at a Conference of both Houſes, 6. <hi>Julii,</hi> 1641. againſt the Lord chief Juſtice, Baron <hi>Davenport,</hi> Baron <hi>Trevor,</hi> and Baron <hi>Weſton,</hi> in the Caſe of Ship-money: <hi>Theſe are the men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that by doing, or not doing, have brought this War upon us: By this means,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Peace of this Iſland is ſhaked, and frighted into Tumults, Commotions, povertie and rage of War.</hi> And it had been an abuſe of Providence for theſe men to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended providence for their deſiſting from good, or their doing of evill: And I beleeve, it would not have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as an excuſe to ſave the King, to have uſed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of providence; which is much in uſe theſe times to countenance the Throne of arbitrary Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the People, by men that are now made great and potent by their blood, ruines, and adventures in War,—in Civil War—.</p>

            <p>The diſadvantages of Arbitrary power to reſide in any perſon over all or any of the people, may become at length to be ſo ſetled, as that it will be a perſonal Intereſt in him and his Creatures, and a pretended Prerogative againſt the Publick Intereſt of common right, peace and ſafetie; and at length this Maxime will be brought in in time, That the General can do no wrong; even as it was ſaid, that <hi>The King can do no wrong;</hi> which (as Mr. Solicitor <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith in <hi>King CHARLES</hi> his Caſe) is Blaſphemy againſt the great God of Truth and Love; for onely God cannot erre; becauſe, what he wils is right becauſe he wils it: <q>And it is a ſad thing, ſaith he, to conſider that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, for unworthy ends, ſhould uſe ſuch art to ſubdue the people, by tranſportation of their ſenſes, as to make them beleeve, that the Law is, <hi>That the King can do no wrong.</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56758:4"/>
with my ſelf what is the onely way to compoſe our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences amongſt our ſelves, and make a compleat recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: and I finde nothing ſo likely as a mutuall Agreement amongſt the People, by making of juſt Laws, agreeable to the Law of Nature; which is undemonſtrable, which needs no demonſtration, were it not for corruption and intereſts. <q>It is, as Mr. <hi>John Cook</hi> ſaith in his book againſt the King, the unanimous conſent of all rationall men in the world, written in every mans heart with the pen of a Diamond, in Capital Letters, and a Character ſo legible,</q> that he that runs may read. And it is nothing elſe but the policie of Polititians, to live honourably by the ruines and warrings of the people, to keep off an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon Laws of Settlement and Agreement; and to inſinuate into corruption and intereſts that are ſtrongeſt and moſt prevalent, that ſo they may keep themſelves in the power of the Sword without reaſon, in War, and after War: O ſad end of War to the People! But now every drop of blood and injuſtice will be recorded in mindes of juſt men. <hi>England</hi> hath eys; the people thereof will not be deluded after ſo much blood: And for my part, I cannot but think, that all impartiall men, whether Presbyterians or Independents, or any elſe under any other name, (that are not choaked by preferments from the preſent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or in expectation of Honour by favour and promiſe) would have impartial juſtice and an equall diſtribution according to principles amongſt the people: And I hope, there be many impartiall men that have places of Honour, who (for their Countries ſake) would willingly adventure; but it is not common: <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi> are the great gods of the world. But when Polititians do wave the <hi>Agreement of the People</hi> in the Laws of Nature and Reaſon, then we may juſtly fear a Deſigne; for it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not have the people ſee, nor underſtand: for then they know they could not do what they pleaſe, and continue in the Throne: they could not get Perſons to be eſteemed more then Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56758:5"/>
But I ſhall ſhew unto this Honourable Houſe, how his Excellency the General of the Engliſh peoples Armie, hath dealt with me, as well as with other of the people; and how ſuch actions are the paths of former Powers. And I ſhall ſhew of what a dangerous conſequence the actings of the Generall are, and how conſonant to the late Kings actings amongſt the people. And indeed, Mr. Solicitor <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, <q>That if any of thoſe that <hi>tried the King</hi> ſhall turn Tyrants, or conſent to ſet up any kinde of Tyrannie by a Law, or ſuffer any <hi>unmercifull</hi> domineering over the conſciences, perſons and eſtates of the free people of this Land, they have pronounced ſentence againſt themſelves.</q>

So the Generall, &amp;c. when he ſaw the ſpirit of Juſtice ſtirring in the Armie amongſt the free people and Souldiery of this Nation, that had adventured their bloud, he diſſolved their Generall Councell of two Officers and two Souldiers of every Regiment, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the people clamour for another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then there goes out another Summons; yet a way made to make all fruitleſſe, by a negative voyce that the people cannot ſave themſelves without him; and muſt cut their own throats, if commanded ſo to do. So if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56758:5"/>
any of the people in the Armie claim and clamour for their Rights, even for their indiſputable rights of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning; then preſently there is an Order from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and ſome other Officers, or a Command and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice, to hinder the ſame: Whereas they charged <hi>Hollis</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> for overthrowing the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subjects of this Nation, in arbitrary, violent, and oppreſſive wayes, and endeavoured by indirect and corrupt practices to delay and obſtruct Juſtice, to the great dammage and prejudice of divers of the poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners of <hi>England</hi> petitioning for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another means he had to put ſome others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Peoples hatred, by a pretended pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to be the ſole Judge of Chivalry; and to have the ſole power of conferring Honours; that ſo he might be ſure to have two againſt one to ſtand for his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt all right and reaſon. And ſo, What gaping and depending upon the Generall after Places of Honour and Profit; What undermining any one that is out of favour (though without cauſe;) and what ſnares there are and have been laid for the caſting out of thoſe that have appeared conſcientiouſly ſtedfaſt to their principles, for the Rights of the People, Let all rational men judge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another means he had to delude the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to make the People beleeve, That he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Juſtice to the Judges, and diſtributed the execution thereof into ſeverall Courts; and that the King cannot ſo much as impriſon a man without Law or reaſon. But ſee what a mockery this was to Juſtice: If the King have a minde to have any publick ſpirited men removed out of the way, this man is kill'd, the murtherer known, a Letter comes to the Judge, and it may be it ſhall be found but Man-ſlaughter. So, when the Lord did (though with much temperance, as I appeal to the world) make
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56758:6"/>
me to own things that are juſt, according to their own former words and actions (as after appears in my Caſe;) then I was preſently a mark to ſhoot at; and though this hath not extended to murther mee as yet: yet it hath extended (as much as in him lay) to diſ-repute mee, and undoe mee; ſnatch mee off by force from the common Cauſe of the Nation, and unmercifully make mee lyable to Inſurrections and Invaſiens, if any ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, For matter of Libertie; if the King, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Courtier ſends a man to Priſon, if the Judge ſet him at libertie, then he puts him out of his Place: which is (ſaith hee) a temptation too heavie for thoſe that love money and Honour more then God. So, if any one appears out of a reall affection to Juſtice, for any one that is extremely oppreſſed; then there is ſuſpicion and jealouſie; and as the new Colonell <hi>John Reynolds</hi> ſaid to one, If hee ſhould ſpeak for mee, he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The King pretended a Prerogative, That he might avoid any of his Grants; and ſo might cozen and cheat any man by a Law; and the ground thereof, That the Kings Grants ſhall be taken according to his intention: And by this means the Kings Grants have been like the Divels Oracles, taken in any contrary ſenſe for his own advantage. Whereas Maſter Solliciton <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, <hi>All the Judges in England cannot make one Caſe to be Law, that is not Reaſon.</hi> But the General (though he hath joyned in many good things) hath made void his own ſolemn Engagements to the Souldiers and People, hath impriſoned and caſhiered thoſe that have appeared conſciencious to their Principles; and uſed divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitary and oppreſſive wayes, to make himſelf and his Creatures abſolute and unlimited, tending to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56758:6"/>
prejudice of many of the Common-Weal; <hi>(viz.)</hi> Officers and Souldiers of this Nation, as appeared by his actions of Caſhierement, of Captain <hi>Ingram,</hi> and then the Life-guard, my ſelf, and divers others in the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equally concerned; and ſo he goes on to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will, divided intereſt, and conqueſt over many of thoſe that have engaged in <hi>England</hi>'s bloud, and appear for <hi>England</hi>'s Libertie, and at length may over all others; contrary to the Declarations of the Army in oppoſing the Parliament, in the Declaration of the fourteenth of <hi>June,</hi> 1647, in the Volume, <hi>pages</hi> 40, 41, 42. But <hi>Conqueſt or Power makes a Title amongſt Wolves and Bears, but not amongſt men,</hi> as Maſter Sollicitor <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith againſt the King. What a ſad thing is it, that after our Engagements, double and treble Engagements againſt Abſoluteneſſe, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, Conqueſt, Arbittarineſſe, the ſame things muſt be done amongſt our ſelves?</p>
               <p>And now I appeal to you for Judgement and Juſtice that may appear without partiality to the underſtandings of all unbiaſſed men.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely hint unto you the buſineſſe of Warre in a few words, <hi>(viz.)</hi> if I had deſerted the Regiment at the time of the <hi>Agreement of the People,</hi> I had been a perfidious fellow to my Principles, and the Nation, and Armie; and by that means the Nations intereſt in that Regiment had been the Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there were ſome Lords in the Quarters courted them to it. But this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe, and all rationall people may ſee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely I was uſed.</p>
               <p>After my being apprehended in the Field, I was ſix weeks in cuſtody at <hi>Windſor,</hi> or thereabouts: I was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable in my grounds and reaſons, which did relate to the Engagement of the Army, The Agreement of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Generals juſt Authority: And I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared juſtifiable by Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can witneſſe; and Commiſſary Generall <hi>Irevon</hi> told
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56758:7"/>
one in private <hi>(viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sexbye)</hi> that there was nothing againſt me. I was appointed my Command again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of an holy Faſt, and of their deſiring an union, and imbracing one another in love, (oh ſad hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie!) but it was to juggle me out of my right: (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice being for me, as doth after appear;) that what Reaſon and Juſtice could not do, Power ſhould. After that, the Generall ſeemed to be diſ-ſatisfied: though Commiſſary General <hi>Ireton</hi> ſaid, That God did incline the hearts of the Generall and Generall Councell to deſire a union, and embrace one another in love (his very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as many were witneſſe;) and ſo I had Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Comwels</hi> Letter to <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> But that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, my deadly enemy, <hi>Henry Lilburn</hi> (having influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Generall, when I came from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> two hundred and ten miles from <hi>London)</hi> got me preſently ſuſpended my Command: after ſome five or ſix weeks ſtay, ſuſpenſion or confinement there, a Commiſſion was ſent from the Generall for another to have my place. I had ſome loſſe alſo by the tedious journey: Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Henry Lilburn</hi> had alſo broken open my Trunk, and ſeized upon my Commiſſion, and kept it. I was fain after all this to return to <hi>London.</hi> I had been four or five months or thereabouts ſtrook out of the Muſter-Rols of the Armie without cauſe. When I came to <hi>London,</hi> I made my appeal to the General and his Counſell of War, and delivered it to himſelf to be heard, and for juſtice; but I ſpake to the air, I could not get it granted. After that I made many private Addreſſes by my ſelf and others: He told me, It was his pleaſure. I offered to refer it to ſome Parliament-men to hear the buſineſſe, I could not have that granted: I offered to refer it to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Officers of the Armie in private, I could not have that granted: Which actions were (under correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) contrary to the ſolemn Engagement of the Armie, the Articles and Diſcipline of War, and all manner of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56758:7"/>
Chriſtian Society and reaſon amongſt men.—Oh unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſſel—And at length, all that I could get from the Generall, was but twenty pound out of the contingent moneys. And the truth of it was, it was extreme grievous to me to bring <hi>Odum</hi> upon the Generall and others, with continuall hope: of his and others reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or ſtanding for Principles of Juſtice and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the People: But now I ſee it is of ſuch an extenſion, as a continued deſign to diſparage, diſhonor, and deſtroy me, and conſequently others; I hope I ſhall be excuſed in the eyes of all rationall men, that I now ſpeak: Though, for enemies to me, and Apoſtates, I care not what they ſay.</p>
               <p>After all this injuſtice and disſatisfaction, when others would have wrought upon theſe things, and uſed it, as an argument to me, to revenge my own wrongs, and publique injuries; another pretending for the King and Juſtice, inſinuatingly, politiquely, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, That if I would, I might be a Colonell againſt the Grandees. But the Lord made me to abhorr ſuch motions, and the Lord kept me firm, ſtedfaſt, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in the times of temptations, wrongs, apoſtaſies, and danger, to the Nation, the Army, and this Houſe; and ſo to their perſons, though my perſon have been toſſed like a Tennis-ball by them: And I raiſed a Troop againſt the bloody Inſurrections, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to my Principles, and by the Generals own privitie, unto whom I did in my affections and civility go for that end. And when I was diſmiſſed out of the County of <hi>Kent.</hi> I have ever ſince kept up my Troop, in order to the Freedom, Juſtice, and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſettlement of the Nation, in Colonell <hi>Reynold's</hi> Regiment, and upon the ſame Account that the Army and the well-affected of the Houſe have manifeſted themſelves, have been at moſt exceſſive charges and damages this Five months in order thereunto; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56758:8"/>
have been intruſted with the guard of the Kings own perſon, at <hi>Hurſt-Caſtle</hi> by the authority of the Army, and command of Col. <hi>John Reinolds,</hi> (voted a Col. of the Army by this Houſe.)</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding may it pleaſe this ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I being at the Generall-Councell of the Army, on, or about the firſt day of <hi>March</hi> laſt paſt, and there being a Letter preſented by ſome Sou ldiers, to the Generall, and the Councell; it was put to the queſtion and the Poll, whether the Letter ſhould be owned or not owned: And when I was demanded my Vote in the Councell, (which ſhould be free:) I told them, That though I could have wiſhed that many expreſſions that were taken offence at were left out; yet in my Judgment the ſubſtance of the Letter did relate to the right of petitioning, and to a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was preſented in Parliament, and therefore I thought the work of that Court was to conſider of it, and ſo I owned it, though I had ſome temptation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſpirit not to own it, becauſe I ſaw a deſigne upon me. A little after, I was ignominiouſly and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably caſt out of the Councell, and had not liberty (though I deſired it) to ſpeak, as if it were now grown a Capitall offence to ſpeak a mans judgement in a Councell, (which ſhould be free) and as capitall a ſin to ſpeak a word for a private Souldier (though with never ſo much temperance) if contrary to the judgment of ſome Officers; whereas it was offered by the Army, as a neceſſary expedient that there might be a liberty of diſſents in the Houſe of Commons, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might readily come to know, who they are that perform their truſt faithfully, and who not; and this was offered to render a Parliament leſs nocent, <hi>Remonſt.</hi> of 23 <hi>June,</hi> and in the Volume of <hi>Declar. page</hi> 143. <hi>We appeal to all men whether it be juſt or tolerable, that any priviledge of Parliament, ſhould contrary to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56758:8"/>
Law of Nature make a man judge in his own caſe on concernment.</hi> But the Generall would have that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable power and dominion which he would not give to Parliaments, amd will not give that libertie that he takes to himſelf: Unto what paſs will this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come to, unleſs this honorable Houſe juſtly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with their juſt Authority. But I humbly conceive, That this honorable Houſe, the wel-affected in Army and Nation, are bonnd in conſcience, to interpoſe in their dying Liberties; for what man in the earth knowes where ſuch practiſes and deſignes will end; for after I was caſt out of the Councell without juſt cauſe, my Troop was given away to another, and a Commiſſion given to another to be in the Regiment, and I could not have that indiſputable Juſtice from the Generall, to ſuſpend it till the buſineſs was determined in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though I deſired it in private of him.</p>
               <p>I ſhall deſire the honourable Houſe to conſider the two Caſes before laid down (not mentioning my former Arrears and loſſes in your ſervice, and for your ſakes) by which injuſtice and wrongs will appear, and by reaſon of which I am engaged in the world: and to conſider that the Generall would by vertue of his negative voice, (which the King ſo much ſtood upon under the ſpecious notion of the uſe of his reaſon) deprive me of my right, and give it to his creature; and pretend that he hath an unlimited power to give; and deny, to whom he pleaſe, which may extend as well to kill, and ſave alive, as to honour and dethrone, in an unreaſonable arbitrary manen; juſt like the Kings practiſe, as I have ſhewed before. He himſelf can receive a Commiſſion from Parliament, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, and after that withſtand the Parliament, again and again, and rend and tear in pieces all power, and break all the reins of government, as to former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and tell them, That it is not the me<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r punctilio
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56758:9"/>
of a Commiſſion? but impartiall Juſtice, and Freedom, principles of nature and right reaſon is his Commiſſion, (which actions are only juſtifiable before God and Man, in order to Juſtice and Freedom) but he can act arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, unreaſonably, and fly to his own Sword and power, without reaſon, when he pleaſes, to deſtroy the Nations friends, and his own too (though not flatterers) in their freedom and Juſtice. This corruption may deſtroy the wel-being of this Army and Common-weal; for if this Houſe, or any Officers or Souldiers in this Army, do walk and ſpeak never ſo reaſonably, yet power and Will may deſtroy and caſt out both, or doe both; for by it he may doe one as juſtifiably as the other. And if God in his appointments ſhould give a great part of this Army into the hands of future Enemies, by future Warr and Blood, then another part of the people of this Nation muſt be invited out with the names and expreſſions of Judgment and Conſcience; and after they have obtained Victory alſo with the loſs of many thouſands, and the hazards of many more; all their liberties, and equal good and right, ſhall be uſurped and ſwallowed up into the hands of one man, (or a few men) who may be partially ſwayed to deſtroy and ſave alive whom he pleaſe; if he prove corrupt and apoſtatize as former powers have, and ſo one corrupt man in power corrupts many more, untill at length they will come to call corruption Juſtice; and it muſt be ſo, becauſe they call it ſo; and then he is worthy of death and caſhierment, that will not ſay, The Crow is white.</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſhall profeſs my ſelf to the world to be for the Generals perſonall Authority, and power of Conduct (ſo long as this intruſted Authority thinks fit and juſt; and as may appear by an addreſs unto his Excellency written by my own hand, and conſented
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56758:9"/>
to by the Troops about two months laſt paſt) as much as any inſinuater or flatterer that hath interpoſed between the Generall and me, in order to the Rights of the People; and I ſhould be glad if the Generall did walk truly, juſtly, and honourably, ſutable to ſuch an Authority. But to have (as much as in him lay) my body, little eſtate, and more eſpecially, or above all, the Liberties of my Country, the liberty and freedom of my Conſcience, to be all enſlaved at once by him, I had rather be rack'd to death or deſtroyed by the General, or by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, mercenary-ſpirited, inſinuating Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer or Souldier, then ſubſcribe in that ſenſe. And I profeſſe impartially, I know not what ſenſe is expected from me elſe, by theſe and the like actings: juſt like the actings of <hi>Willam</hi> the <hi>Norman Conquerour,</hi> who deprived the Engliſh Natives of the comforts of Riches, and Places, and their ſmalleſt offences againſt his will and Norman Lawes, were made grants to entitle him to their Lands, and places of Truſt, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his luſt, ſatisfie his Creatures, and carry on his Tyrannous deſignes over the People. And I do finde it a very great evill, that when the People and the Souldiery claim juſt and undenyable things; then preſently ſome men commonly fly to a deceivable miſtaking of the Queſtion, and ſubvert the People and Souldiery in their Cauſe; and ſay that the men are againſt Authority, as the King did againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56758:10"/>
and ſo the People and Souldiery are jugled out of the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>But I deſire this Honourable Houſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That Injuſtice is the foundation of almoſt all evils in the world: and when Politique Murtherers (which are the greateſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers in the world) give continued occaſion, then they cry out againſt the evil, and rend and tear like unreaſonable beaſts of prey; and cry out upon the Lambe, if it ſeek but his juſt, righteous, naturall, and reaſonable ſafety; they extremely offend, and then they are offended if a man ſpeak in his juſt cauſe; like <hi>Tiberius</hi> the ſucceſſor of <hi>Octavius,</hi> who after a faigned clemency at the beginning of his Reign, ſuffered no day to paſſe without ſhedding the blood of poor innocents; and he prohibited on pain of death, that no one ſhould be ſo bold as to weep or to manifeſt ſorrow: They make occaſions; they cry out of paſſions, though they abundantly provoke.</p>
               <p>And therefore Right Honourable, ſithence Authority is meerly for that end, to doe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice impartially, that one might not oppreſſe another, that Might may not ovorcome Right; and ſince you have overturned the face of other perſonall Authorities, caſt out, and impriſoned divers Members of your own Houſe, to their ignominie and diſhonour, nulled the Houſe of Lords, impartially beheaded the King and ſome Lords, and Declared to the people, That it is out of an affection to impartiall Juſtice
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56758:10"/>
and Righteouſneſſe, according to the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of authority by Judges, according to the Scriptures, <hi>Deut.</hi> I. 16, 17. I ſhall deſire you would doe Juſtice for Juſtice ſake, that it may appear to the People, and to the Officers and Souldiers of the Nation, whom it juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and unto whom I am deeply engaged, whoſe Cauſe I make my own, and whoſe blood I eſteem as my own, and unto whom I have now diſcharged my Conſcience, and then you will juſtly oblige me to manifeſt my ſelf yours, and to employ my ſmall talent of reaſon and underſtanding for your ſervice, and in defence of your ſupreme Authority.</p>
