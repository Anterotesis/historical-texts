            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS there is no Science, Art, or Faculty, ſo much improved of late, as that of <hi>Phyſic;</hi> ſo I am certain there is no Prince in the World ever gave ſo great Incouragement to the Promoters of this Faculty, as your Sacred Majeſty. For what greater Reward can a
<pb facs="tcp:55444:3"/>dilligent Enquirer into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Myſteries be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of, than the Smiles and Candid Aſpect of ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Soveraign upon his painful Endeavours?</p>
            <p>Among the many Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers after ſome noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the Medic Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, whom your Majeſty hath graciouſly vouchaſafed to take notice of, I the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthieſt of your Majeſties Subjects do here (with all due Submiſſion and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to your Majeſty) reckon my ſelfone. For no ſooner did the rumour of my ſucceſs in Curing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Perſons</hi> by a new
<pb facs="tcp:55444:3"/>and differing Method, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to your Majeſties Ears, but your Majeſty reſolved to ſatisfie your Royal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in the truth of it: whereupon your Majeſty Ordered me to endeavour the Cure of Mr. <hi>Kenedy Obri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which was accordingly performed to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties great ſatisfaction; ſince which ſeveral other Cures have been Effected in Caſes of the like Nature. The deplorable Condition Mr. <hi>Obrian</hi> was in, when I firſt undertook him, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty well remembers.</p>
            <p>Now the ſenſe of your Majeſties Candor and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
<pb facs="tcp:55444:4"/>toward me in this thing, hath incouraged me to prefix your Majeſties Name to his ſmall unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Tract; Preſuming that I have already (tho un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly) obtained ſo great a meaſure of your Majeſties Favour, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore your Royal Patronage.</p>
            <p>Withal, I cannot but humbly acquaint your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that altho your Majeſties Candor towards me, next to that Divine Providence, which makes my Endeavours ſucceſsful, hath been my greateſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; yet my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies abroad have been
<pb facs="tcp:55444:4"/>almoſt indefatigable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me; Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence have ſo predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the hearts of ſome, that they have made a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz of all their Strength and Forces, thoſe miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Machines and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of <hi>Malice, Hatred, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy, Prejudice, Lies, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings,</hi> and uncharitable <hi>Cenſures</hi> to blaſt and ruin me. So that it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture how this Innocent <hi>Partus</hi> will be received by the hands of thoſe cruel <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuriſts,</hi> who ſo malign its Author: It is not hard to phanſie how it will be kick'd about and buffeted, hiſs'd at
<pb facs="tcp:55444:5"/>and derided, dam'd and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided by their deſperate <hi>Tongues.</hi> It is impoſſible ſuch a pitiful, helpleſs Infant ſhould ſurvive the ſucceſſive Clamours of thoſe whoſe Intereſts it is to hate and back-bite me; unleſs ſo Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Compaſſionate a Patron as your Majeſty, will deign to cheriſh it? It is juſt now going to run the <hi>Gantlet,</hi> and 'twill certainly periſh and be knock'd down to the ground by the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous thumps and blows of thoſe Malevolent Perſons that ſtand prepared to ſtrike it, unleſs it be cloathed and defended by the <hi>Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55444:5"/>of your Royal Favour.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, <hi>Great Sir,</hi> with all poſſible Submiſſion and Reverence, that I lay this Treatiſe at the Feet of your Gracious Majeſty, humbly aſſuring your Majeſty that altho it be already Printed, yet it ſhall never be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the Eyes of the World, unleſs your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty will firſt ſignifie your gracious Acceptance of it. The Copies that are now Printed ſhall either lie dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant till they are eaten by Worms, or elſe be given to the Flames, as unworthy of humance Inſpection, if your Majeſty refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

            <head>The <hi>Authors Apology</hi> for ſome Invectives in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>INvectives are ſometimes very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune, eſpecially when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe whoſe Malevolent Minds cauſe their extravagant Tongues to utter ſuch uncharitable cenſuring Expreſſions as juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them: That what ſharp Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Expreſſions may be let fall in the enſuing Diſcourſe, are nothing but what I have been highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to, any judicious perſon may eaſily determine; for whatſoever Reflections there may be upon any particular perſons, tho not therein nominated, they are only upon thoſe perſons who have railed againſt, calumniated, back-bited, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied me; tho what I have here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of them is the real truth.
<pb facs="tcp:55444:7"/>There are ſome Phyſicians in <hi>London,</hi> who becauſe ſome of their Patients have left them and conſulted me, have been ſo wickedly cenſorious, as to tell the World I was a meer Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and ſo far from being a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as that I could not write my own Name, or ſpeak a Word of <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin;</hi> when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves never diſcourſed with me in their lives. Others have made it their whole buſineſs to pry into my concerns, to find fault with my proceedings, and if a Patient hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die under my hands, that perhaps was almoſt reſigning when I was firſt call'd for, this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by them as a grand Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; when their Patients do all ſucceſſively retire into another World, and not the leaſt notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. So that the two grand Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they inſiſt upon in their Endeavours to make me odious, and ſo diſcourage their Patients from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, are to impoſe upon the Faith of People that I am illiterate and inſucceſsful; in anſwer to the firſt, it would be impertinence and
<pb facs="tcp:55444:7"/>immodeſly for me to tell the World that I am a Scholar; but thus much I am urged to declare in my own Defence, that my Education and Advantages have not come ſhort of theirs; and if I ſtill remain illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, I am a Fool and a Dunce for not improving them: beſides he that condemns me for an Illiterate Emperie, is impudent in reflecting upon the Honourable Colledg of Phyſicians in <hi>London;</hi> for I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the Preſident and Electors of that Colledg, and by them deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to be admitted to Practice <hi>Phyſic,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Diploma</hi> which they gave me with the Seal of the Colledg. In Anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Baſis or Foundation on which they build the Superſtructure of their Railery; I muſt likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that this alſo is groundleſs. For it is only the ſucceſs which attends my Labours, that makes them hate me. I can with a ſafe Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, that ſince I have Practiſed at <hi>London</hi> among the many Patients I have there had, there have not ten perſons died under my hands, and
<pb facs="tcp:55444:8"/>thoſe were deſperate when I firſt ſaw them; yet thoſe Induſtrious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mine, when they heard of but one Patient that was dead, did triumph, rejoyce and glory, as if the world was little enough to proclaim my ruin and downfal, which they ever inſatiably deſired: But God knows their Prayers remain yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered; theſe are thoſe that would put a ſtop to the improvement of Phyſic, becauſe they cannot improve it themſelves.</p>
            <p>Let the Impartial Reader therefore now judg if I have not been juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to vindicate myſelf, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectr the ridiculous Buffooneries of theſe Practice in this Diſtemper: I only deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> their Method and mine may be put together into a Ballance of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration, then we ſhall ſee which will preponderate, and which is moſt ſhallow and impertinent; or if they be both compared by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Experience, I am ſure ours will appear moſt ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>I hope now the Reader will not wonder at ſome paſſages in this Tract, which if I had not premiſed this, they
<pb facs="tcp:55444:8"/>might otherwiſe have ſeem'd a little uncouth. Let them perſiſt in their peremptory abuſive Cenſures. I hope out Care and Induſtry, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Succeſs attending our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, will manifeſtly contradict them; and in time make them as ridiculous as they would willingly render me: ſo that indeed when theſe Squint-eyed and Envious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners, have quite exonerated themſelves of thoſe Reproaches, which are nothing but the faetid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of a ſpiteful mind, they muſt either then hold their Tongues, or again lick up their own Ordure, and ſwallow it by mouthfuls; and tho their chief deſign and deſire is to be-ſmear me with theſe turpid and malicious Slanders, endeavouring hereby to deſtroy my Reputation, and to expunge and obliterate my Name out of the World, and if it were poſſible to extirpate the very thoughts of me out of the Minds of all Men; yet all the Detriment and Miſchief they can poſſibly do me, is only to excite and ſtimulate me to greater Diligence and Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:55444:9"/>which will at laſt render me appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently undeſerving of ſuch forged Impeachments.</p>
            <p>Let me alſo here premiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Readers miſapprehenſion of what I have expoſed to publick view in the following Diſcourſe, that I do not in the leaſt deſign to detract from the Renown, Learning, and Gravity of many Eminent Phyſicians in and about <hi>London;</hi> I own their Skill, acknowledg their Worth and Eminence, and honour their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But yet there are many who have attained to a competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Learning, and are become ſomewhat Famous and Popular, that abhor that any but themſelves ſhould have any Eſteem in the World; they cannot endure to be out-done by any, and if they hear of any whoſe ſucceſs in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſtemper goes beyond theirs, they are reſtleſs in ſeeking his Ruin; that there are ſuch among the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of <hi>London,</hi> their daily abuſing and inveighing againſt me, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently evince: It is againſt theſe that the Reflections in this Diſcourſe

I would not have the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der think me ſuch a <hi>Buffoon</hi> as to condemn the whole Tribe of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of Ignorance and Idleneſs: No, for how many Generous and Heroic Souls are there, who out of a meer Principle of being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in their Generations, have laid out good part of their Eſtates, ſpent much of their Time, and not a little impaired their Health in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripping the Bowels of Nature, to find out the Vertue of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Medicaments,</hi> which to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Induſtry, are only revealed to the diligent Enquirer? and theſe Men are of ſuch Noble Spirits, that they reſolve while their Eyes remain Suſceptive of Viſible Objects, and while their Ingenious Souls are cloiſtered in theſe Humane Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, to ſearch and pry into the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded
<pb facs="tcp:55444:10"/>Myſteries and private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of Nature, their Adored Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs. While they live among Men who are liable to Diſeaſes, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſundry Maladies, often vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in Symptomes and Critic Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they will think no time loſt or miſpent in ſearching out expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and effectual Remedies, and aſpiring after a more particular knowledg of that curious Structure, the <hi>Microcoſm</hi> of Mans Body. Theſe are they to whom the World knows not how much it ſtands engaged. It is no wonder that the <hi>Heathen World</hi> adored <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> when the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God was wanting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.

The World already rings of his Rare Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and choice Inventions; into how many Tongues are his Works tranſlated? We may read of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in his own <hi>Experimental Philoſophy,</hi> and in the Tranſactions of the Royal Society, and in the Catalogue and Deſcription of the Rarities belonging to the Royal Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
<pb facs="tcp:55444:11"/>lately publiſhed by the Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dr. <hi>Nehemiah Grew.</hi> Several of his Inventions are now to be ſeen in that <hi>Magazine</hi> of <hi>Rarities</hi> in <hi>Greſham Colledge:</hi> So that we do not queſtion but that there are ſome ſuch among us, that would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſacrifice their Strength, their Time, Eſtates and Health, and if need be, venture their own Lives for the good and benefit of their Fellow Creatures. Yet ſuch is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of ſome, that they will ſooner encourage Ignorance and Conceit in Illiterate Pretenders; than any way contributeto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the modeſt Naturaliſt: Such is the folly and precipitant raſhneſs of others, that they will ſooner venture their Lives in the hands of a bragging Emperie, then truſt the Veracity of a Faithful, Knowing, and Experienced Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and ſuch is the Credulity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that a practiſing <hi>Apothecary</hi> or an ignorant <hi>Quack-ſalving Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> that never read ſix lines, or at leaſt never underſtood two of any rational Phyſic Author, ſhall ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb facs="tcp:55444:11"/>upon their Judgments (I would ſay phanſies) as to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their favour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Eminent in their Eſteem, and all this while the confident Impoſtor is telling Stories of his rare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in Phyſic: And ſo the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Phyſician, that from his very Cradle endeavoured to improve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Noble Faculty of Phyſic; becauſe he will not bragg, muſt be contemned: But a true Phyſician muſt have other Ingredients in him then a good ſtock of Confidence, and a conſiderable quantity of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: Otherwiſe he can never become a true Hand-maid of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to watch her in every Motion, to aſſiſt her when ſhe is impotent and almoſt overcome by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of any Diſtemper, to put forth a helping hand in her greateſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, to refreſh her when weary with ſtruggling, by ſome Rich Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Spirits, to enlighten her when clouded, by ſome <hi>Irradiating Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> to renew Vigor in her by ſome choice <hi>Elixir</hi> of Life, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee dangers that may befal her, to

            <p>Having thus apologized for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in this Treatiſe may ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, there remains nothing more to add, only to begg the Readers Candour in the peruſal of it; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to excuſe the plainneſs of its Style, and overlook what may not be ſo congruouſly worded as it might be expected, for I wrote moſt of it ſince I returned from <hi>France,</hi> and that at ſeveral times, and in haſte; for when the former part of it was Printed, I was called into the Countrey before I had compoſed the latter; therefore the Method may not be ſo exact, nor Style ſo ſmooth, nor Words ſo pertinent, as they might otherwiſe have been. Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired this Favour of the Courteous Reader, I muſt aſſure him that I am.</p>

            <p>IT is not here neceſſary to entertain the Reader with a long Preliminary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or to perplex him with ſtrain'd far-fetcht A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies to uſher in this Tract; but I ſhall thruſt it naked into the open World, knowing its Deſign and Intention to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: Let the Critic Cenſuriſts of this Age carp and ſnarl at it, let the envious, malevolent Backbiter ſputter what he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt it, he may aſſure
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55444:15"/>himſelf, I imagin'd what he would ſay before I began to write it, knowing the Principle that actuates him to be nothing but ſpite. The impartial and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Reader will ſee, that I him at nothing but the Improvement of the noble Faculty of Phyſic, and the real benefit of Mankind, he will candidly paſs by the Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which may unwittingly be committed in it: So that the Cenſuriſt may as well ſurceaſs his Scoffs and Calumnies, and believe, that we are more incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Candor of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, by the daily Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which attends our Labours, and by his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Gracious Favour in taking notice of our Indeavours, that we can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by thoſe baſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he ſpues forth from his ſordid Mind, which are the products of nothing, but Hatred
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55444:15"/>and Malevolence. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here preſent the Reader with ſome Obſervations of my own upon Conſumptive Perſons; and by thoſe Obſervations, make it evident, that the trite vulgar Method will never reach the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this Diſeaſe, but that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of Method is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the <hi>Pectoral Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſo much uſed by Phyſicians, that will remove the Cauſe of this ſpreading Malady.

               <hi>Miniſter of Nature,</hi> content himſelf to go on in a trite beaten road, and preſcribe for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55444:16"/>weak emaciated Bodies, nothing but fulſome Hodge-podges, and loathſome Mixtures? Certainly the true genuine Sons of <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> are more diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious. Is it not a ſhame to our Profeſſion, for a Patient to languiſh under a Phyſician's hands, perhaps for a whole year, in a deep Conſumption, and have nothing preſcribed but mixtures of <hi>Oil of Almonds</hi> and clogging <hi>Syrups, Milk-water, Snail-water,</hi> the naſty <hi>Syrup of Garlick, Conſerve of Roſes,</hi> the <hi>Syrup</hi> or <hi>Juice of Turneps,</hi> the fulſome indigeſted <hi>Syrup of Brimſtone,</hi> and ſuch like Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines? Perhaps a ſtinking <hi>Iſſue</hi> may be preſcribed, or a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Seton,</hi> as if the Diſtemper would jump out at the Vent; ſometimes cruel tormenting <hi>Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and the Head muſt be ſhav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forſooth, becauſe we would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55444:17"/>not preſcribe out of the Faſhion; and <hi>Plaiſters</hi> muſt be applyed, which by a Magnetic Influence keep the Rheume from falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lungs. But will this cure a <hi>Conſumption?</hi> No ſure. I do here challenge any Phyſician that dares to ſay he ever cured one Patient of a confirmed <hi>Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> or <hi>Conſumption,</hi> by any of the above-mentioned things, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the are ſo much applauded and uſed. Now, what can the reaſon be, that thoſe Phyſicians, who pretend to be exactly Methodic and Dogmatic in their Practice, will ſtill perſiſt in their old thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare Method, notwithſtanding they find no ſucceſs in it? I am apt to fancy the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know no better Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and are very loth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the pains to find them out: and perhaps, they being ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55444:17"/>to ſearch into the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Myſteries of their Miſtriſs <hi>Nature,</hi> think it but in vain to begin, and ſo content themſelves with the Medicines of honeſt old <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and their followers; and ſo let them go on, we know better things. I can by my own particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience declare, that there are ſuch Medicines in the World, which by degrees will extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and deſtroy thoſe male-figur'd Particles, which are the Tormentors of Man's Body in this Diſtemper; provided the Body be not reduced to ſo infirm a condition, that Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſupported till ſuch Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have affected what they would otherwiſe undoubtedly do. There is a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which immediatly abates that Feaver which uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this Malady; which is no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55444:18"/>cooling Medicine, but is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with a Faculty of ſtopping the motion of thoſe Particles which create that fervour in the Blood, and in time, of freeing the Blood of them all. This is the Feaver which Phyſicians im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly call a <hi>Hectic Feaver,</hi> or an <hi>Habitual Feaver:</hi> They will tell you, it is a Feaver in the Fleſh and Muſcular Parts of the Body, and not at all in the Blood; though I cannot for my life but think, that there is no ſuch thing as an Habitual Feaver, nor a Feaver of the Fleſh; a Feaver being an actual Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, which in a <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hiſis</hi> is not conſtant, but ariſeth at ſome particular times, eſpecially an hour or two after eating, or in an evening; and this Ebullition of the Blood (I ſhould ſay of the Fleſh) is cauſed by the motion and agitation of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55444:18"/>ſome incongruous Particles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the little <hi>Logic</hi> that I have obtained, tells me, that an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Feaver, which is an much as an Habitual Motion, Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an Habitual Action, is no leſs than a contradiction.</p>
            <p>There are other ſafe and moſt potent Medicines, which I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exhibit in theſe difficult Caſes, that will abſorb thoſe tickling and pricking Particles which produce the Cough, and hereby great eaſe to the Patient is immediately procured. We have other penetrateing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which reduce the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body to their <hi>Eutaxy</hi> and regular Order; and ſo when the Cauſe of the Malady is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Functions regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Nutrition is again augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Body grows fatter and ſtronger every day, the whole <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Body is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55444:19"/>at laſt, all bad Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms ceaſe, and the wonted and deſired ſanity doth then enſue.</p>
            <p>Is it not moſt cenſentaneous to reaſon, that thoſe Medicines, whether Vegital, Animal, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, wherein the pure, balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, lively Parts, are ſeparated by Art from the more impure, groſſy and dreggy Feculencies, are moſt effectual Medicines to anſwer the Indications of this Malady? Certainly, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and depurate Medicines, the very Quinteſſences of Drugs, excel thoſe that retain in them their earthy and phlegmatic Parts, which are exhibited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Depuration, either by Digeſtion, in which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Fermentation, Solution, Extraction and Putrifaction, or Diſtillation: which Preparations are not eaſily perform'd, and therefore ſo much rejected.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55444:19"/>There is required no ſmall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Diligence to the true Preparation of any good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; but to find out Remedies which do exactly quadrate with the Symptomes of any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſtemper, is a work of extraordinary pains, ſtudy and ſcrutiny, and is to be indeavour'd by none, but ſuch as are reſolute, fix'd and indefatigable in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſecret Mines of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 'Tis reaſonable, that thoſe who ſeek Jems and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Minerals, ſhould dig to find them; and what Jewel is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to a duely prepared Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, effectual in the Cure of any one Diſtemper? The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Remedies which I exhibit in a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or <hi>Conſumption,</hi> are moſt refined and purified Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which indeed were not obtained without much labour and induſtry.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:55444:20"/>
            <p>Now in the ſequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it cannot be expected I ſhould divulge the Ingredients of which thoſe particular Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are compounded, and the manner of their Preparations, they being <hi>Elixirs, Tinctures, Powders, Extracts,</hi> &amp;c. adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every particular Symptome of this Malady, and not one particular Receipt or Medicine, as ſome have ignorantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd. Yet, thus far I ſhall gratifie the Reader, to acquaint him in what kind of Method I proceed in theſe caſes; which Method I eſteem moſt Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and I am ſure, it is moſt effectual and beneficial, how methodic ſoever the dull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun Method may ſeem to thoſe that dote upon it. I do likewiſe here declare, that the following Method hath cured ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when they have been given
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55444:20"/>over by eminent Phyſicians, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had uſed their utmoſt endeavours for their Recovery. I do alſo aver (that by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) where the Diſtemper hath not made too great a procedure, and ſo far vitiated the Functions of the Noble Parts, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Parts themſelves putrid, rotten and exulcerated; which doth not uſually happen, till the Patient hath laboured a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time under this Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or perhaps received preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice from the unprofitable and pernicious Medicines vulgarly exhibited; this Method will in a ſhort time perfectly reſtore them: and if they come in the beginning, the expected Succeſs will certainly enſue. To this purpoſe, as ſoon as I am ſent for to a Patient languiſhing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Diſtemper, or labouring under any particular Symptomes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55444:21"/>of it, I firſt inquire what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians he hath made uſe of, and what kind of Medicines he hath taken? I comunly find a whole train of <hi>Galenic</hi> Medicines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Table or Cupboards-head: I then adjure him, by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected future health, to meddle with none of them, but to throw away all thoſe ſtuffing <hi>Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Lohoch's, Eclegms</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s contained in the Gally-pots; and likewiſe whole Bottles of raw, cold, phlegmatic diſtilled Waters; alſo the thick, muddy, pectoral <hi>Decoction,</hi> and the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefying Narcotic <hi>Pills</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and all manner of crude indigeſted <hi>Drenches:</hi> for theſe are the only Medicines I ever find, where a <hi>Galeniſt</hi> had been tampering. I likewiſe forbid him the uſe of all ſalt Meats, all Food hard of Digeſtion; as Beef, Pork, Bacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all crude
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55444:21"/>Sallads, Herbs and Roots; all Beer and Ale, unleſs now and then one ſmall Draught to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him; all ſorts of Wine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſometimes a Glaſs of good old <hi>Malago,</hi> qualified with the Yolk of a raw new laid Egg, which I allow but to ſome, in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes. The Diet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him is Capons, Chickens, Veal, Lamb, Rabbits, Partridge, and ſuch like eaſily concocted Fleſh, but to be eaten in a ſmal quantity once a day; at other times Water-gruel, Milk-pottage, Rice-milk diluted with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate quantity of Water, and ſuch kind of Spoon-meat which is ſoon aſſimulated: and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a Patient, we permit him to eat Jellies of Trotters, Calfs-feet, Harts-horn and Ivory, tho they ſignifie little in reference to ſtrengthen or nouriſh, as is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly credited. His common
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55444:22"/>Drink is either Milk and Water boil'd, or a Ptiſan which we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for him to drink of conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if there be no looſeneſs, a Glaſs of <hi>Mead</hi> now and then is ſafely permitted.</p>
            <p>As for the Therapeutic and Medicinal Part, if we find the Veſicles of the Lungs obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which cauſeth difficulty of breathing, we then exhibit ſome Doſes of a curious fleſh-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Powder, diſſolved in a fit Vehicle; which Powder is ſo penetrating, that it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opens thoſe grand Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſoon removes that-ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Breaſt, and Aſtmatic ſhortneſs of Breath, which very much afflicts the Patient: and to qualifie that thin, ſalt, corroding Liquor, which creates a Catarrh, falling upon the Lungs, with a kind of tickling upon the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera Arteria</hi> and <hi>Larynx,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55444:22"/>fretting the Lungs, we give a few drops of a Golden Tincture, mixed in an appoſite and proper Vehicle; hereby that Juice or Liquor which is ſecerned by the Glandules of the Throat, and not diſtilled from the Brain, as the ſtubborn <hi>Galeniſt</hi> would have it, (the contrary being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrated by ſome late ingenuous Writers) is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and the Catarrh ſtopp'd: But if this hath already proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther, and fix'd upon the Lungs an inveterate Cough, very troubleſome and painful; we then give ſeveral Doſes of our grand Antiphthiſic <hi>Elixir,</hi> which being conſtantly taken, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to order, methodically with other Medicines ordered for other Symptomes, will gradually abate the Cough, and give ſpeedy eaſe to the Patient.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55444:23"/>
            <p>For the Feaver which uſually attends a Phthiſis, which is one grand and waſting Symptome, I preſcribe an Antifebrile <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Extract,</hi> which ſoon quells that ſpurious Fermentation or Ebullition in the Blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently takes off that heat which afflicts the Body, and more eſpecially predominates in the Palms of the Hands and Soles of the Feet. But when the Body is, by a continued accumulation of vitious Particles in the Blood and Juices, rendred lean, the Blood being fraught with them, becomes depauperate, and Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hindred, the Members of the whole Body impoveriſhed and emaciated; we then exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit our grand Antiphthiſic <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir,</hi> with a penetrating white alkaliſate Powder, and a reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive red tranſparent Liquor, of which we order the Patient to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55444:23"/>drink freely and frequently. By which Method, we ſeldom miſs of the expected iſſue and ſucceſs; for thoſe male-figur'd Corpuſeles are abforb'd and lick'd up by our white <hi>Powder;</hi> all manner of Obſtructions opened by our brisk ſprightly <hi>Elixir;</hi> and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment highly promoted and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by our reſtorative <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</hi> If a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> or looſeneſs attend the other Symptomes, which oftentimes proves very dangerous, and quickly reduceth the Patient into a weak condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we do not preſently bung it up with binding reſtringent Medicines, which are comun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but perniciouſly given; but we order ſuch Medicines as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly correct the ſharp fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humor, and the looſeneſs ceaſeth of it ſelf; we uſe a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or edulcorating Mixture, and a corrected red Powder. We
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55444:24"/>have ſeveral other ſafe and effectual Medicines, appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other ſmaller Symptomes and leſſer Accidents, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally happen in this Malady. But theſe being the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Symptomes, and the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Medicines the ſtrongeſt Hinges on which our Practice in this Diſtemper hangs; it is not now requiſite to nominate the leſſer Symptomes, or our leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Remedies. We ſhall therefore refer the Reader to our Obſervations, cited in the ſequel of this Tract, for a more full Narration of our Method, and a Confirmation of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of our Medicines. But this I have in ſhort to premiſe, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our Method, which is, that all our Medicines do more exactly anſwer the three grand Intentions of Phyſic, than any other Medicines in the World
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55444:24"/>ever yet found out. The three grand Intentions are, to cure <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, tuto &amp; jucunde,</hi> quickly, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pleaſantly. As to the firſt, I can ſafely ſay, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as conſumptive, Phthiſic and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciated Men and Women, have been kept under Cure a whole year, taking the cold, mortal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebs, the inſipid refrigerating Snail and Milk Waters, Medicines devoid of all Life, Spirit or Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; and the puddle Water, or thick Pectoral Decoction, or clogging, ſtuffing, obſtructing <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ohoch's and Electuaries. I ſay, when they have taken all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe kind of Slops that can be invented, and be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a whole year in ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, without the leaſt benefit or amendment; the very ſame perſons have, by our Method and Energetic Medicines, been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in leſs than one quarter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55444:25"/>of the time, to perfect Health<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> witneſs the ſubſequent Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond grand Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I dare upon my oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, that there is not one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine I uſe but what is ſo ſafe, that a Child of a month old may take it without any prejudice. And tho they are pure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, volatile, etherial, ſubtil and penetrating Medicines; yet they are as innocent as Mothers Milk: and to ſatisfie the incredulity of any, I will at any time take twice the quantity my ſelf, of any Medicine that I exhibit to any Patient. I likewiſe challenge the whole World to accuſe me, of having ever given one Grain of Phyſic to any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby there enſued any apparent prejudice. But that the trite comun Method is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſtructive to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55444:25"/>is a matter of no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to prove.</p>
            <p>As for the third Intention, I muſt needs declare, that no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in the World can poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be pleaſanter, than thoſe I mentioned. And altho in the vulgar Method, ſuch ſulſom, naſty Medicines are preſcribed, that the Patient loaths the very ſight and ſmell of them, and by taking them, his Appetite is quite obtunded, and a continual nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeating and averſion to all Food and Phyſic too attends him; nay, beſides vaſt quantities of filthy Potions which he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to guſle down, and the bitter-ſweet, maukiſh Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſtrong-ſcented Pills which he is forced to ſwallow frequently, at the very thoughts of which, his Stomach riſeth; yet beſides all this, he muſt, and that by all means, have a foetid
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55444:26"/>Iſſue running upon his Arm or Leg, whereby thoſe Members, eſpecially the Arm, are much weakned and emaciated, the Matter and Steam which reaks from it while dreſſing, is enough to give a Horſe a vomit, the Arm or Leg in the mean time is galled, ſore and inflamed; all which, if it would any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Patients recovery, might be diſpenſed with, but we never find any ſucceſs attend theſe formal Preſcription; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Doctor reſolves to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſomething for his Fee, hit or miſs; and thinks the moſt probable way to hit, is to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the comun Vogue of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians: whereby likewiſe he ſhall ſhew himſelf to be a Methodic and Dogmatic Phyſician, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Bills forſooth upon the Apothecaries file, do exactly agree with the faſhion and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55444:26"/>of other Preſcribers, and ſo he paſſeth for an Able Man, a Man of excellent Judgment; when all this while what he preſcribed is nothing but that which any one may read in <hi>Sennertus</hi> or <hi>Riverius</hi>'s <hi>Prax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is.</hi> Thus the Patient is to no purpoſe tormented, and that extenſive, noble, and improva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Faculty of Phyſic is imagin'd to have arrived at its <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> and theſe rare Doctors have hoarded up every inch and ſcrap of it in their profound Noddles, witneſs their learned Bills in the Apothecaries Shops. But on the contrary, our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are ſo pleaſant and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Stomach, that never any Patient complained of them, neither do we ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe thoſe unprofitable, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iſſues and Setons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which the next occurs to our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55444:27"/>Conſideration and Enquiry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we relate our Practic Obſervations in Conſumptions, is to examine the Cauſe of this Diſtemper; which if we a little explain, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Operation or our Medicines, will the better be underſtood.</p>
            <p>The immediate proxim Cauſe of thoſe Affects which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Conſumptions tending to Exulceration, ſaith <hi>Riverius,</hi> is a ſharp eroding Humour flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon the Lungs, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in them.</p>
            <p>The Renowned <hi>Franciſcus De Le Boe Sylvius</hi> in his <hi>Praxis Medicinae,</hi> tells us, That a Phthiſis or Conſumption pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome Vitiated Lympha falling down upon the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> and ſo in time Affecting the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Both which Op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nions are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55444:27"/>much what the ſame, and tho I am unwilling to thwart or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn the Sentiments of either of thoſe worthy Authors, yet I ſhall endeavour to ſearch more narrowly, and enquire whether the true original Cauſe of this Diſtemper may not more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſomewhat yet unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by the above-cited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. I am apt to believe that the cauſe of the ſharpneſs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Quality of this Humour is yet in the dark, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the true Cauſe of the Diſtemper as latent as before. It is an eaſie matter to ſay Pains in the Head, Belly, Limbs, and other Acute Dolours, proceed from a Humour, as Vulgar Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians expreſs it; but this is only to ſtop the Mouths of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Patient, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth after the Cauſe of his Malady.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55444:28"/>
            <p>That which I have to offer to the peruſal of the unbyaſſed Reader concerning the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe we are diſcourſing of, is this:</p>
            <p>When God firſt made Man, he gave him <hi>Temperamentum ad Pondus,</hi> or ſuch an exact Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, that his Body would have been perennial, and have remain'd as vigorous and ſprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the extenſive duration of perpetuity as it was at its firſt Creation, had he continued in that State, but when he by his folly had revolted from h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, he juſtly reduced him to a State of Mortality; not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately altering the Craſis or Conſtitution of his Body, but by mixing a variety of ill figur'd Particles inimical to the texture of a Humane Body, with that Air which he muſt neceſſarily receive into his Lung and Blood,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55444:28"/>and alſo with that Food from which he muſt expect his Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and thus theſe Particles find ſhelter in our Bodies, ſome of them being received from our Parents, and ſo hereditary; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afterward imbibed from the Air, and from our own Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment; theſe were ſome of the Effect, of Gods Curſe for our wilful Rebellion: It is from theſe Particles that our Juices are vitiated, the Veſſels of our Bodies obſtructed, its Organs impaired, the whole Craſis of the Microcoſm reduced to an Ataxy, and the Genuine Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nature diverted, and hereby a Thouſand Maladies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt a Humane Body. For as there are ſeveral ſorts of theſe Particles differing in Figure and Magnitude, ſome of which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the Air at ſome Seaſons in ſome places, and alſo inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55444:29"/>ſome kinds of Diet; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhaped Particles, either big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or leſſer ones, ſwim about in the fluid Air at other Seaſons in other Places, and are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in ſome other ſorts of Food: So variety of Diſeaſes are hereby created, the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes differing according to the Number, Shape, and Motion of theſe ſeveral ſorts of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, when they praedominate in the Humane Body. Thus from a great quantity of ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles heterogeneous to the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Humane Blood, or to the ſeveral Pores which Nature hath formed in the Body for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſeveral great Diſorders ariſe; when from few of the ſame, ſmaller Indiſpoſitions have their riſe and origin; ſharp pointed, pungent, crooked and hooky Particles vellicate the Membranes, cauſe Acute Pains,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55444:29"/>and are difficultly removed, while the ſmoother ones glide about with more eaſe, and are ſooner exterminated; ſome are bigger in magnitude, and apt to create Obſtructions, eſpecially when their ſhape is not adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the ſeveral pores of the Body deſtin'd for Secretion, and the ſmall Ductus's, ſome ſticking and glutinous Particles of the Blood are linck'd in with them, and ſo great Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made; while the leſſer Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles cannot ſo much injure the parts; likewiſe thoſe that are violently agitated in the Blood cauſe greater Ebullitions, and conſequently do more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, when thoſe that are more dull and ſlow in Motion cannot hurry the Juices about with that velocity, and conſequently not hurt ſo much: For inſtance, There are ſome Particles which

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55444:31"/>often affect our Bodies which are Tetrahedic or Pyramidal in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, ſomewhat large in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, but ſlow in Motion; theſe we call Frigorific or Cold Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: which when our Bodies are expoſed to a great company of them, they ſometimes enter the Pores of the Body, and joyn themſelves with the ſerous or phlegmatic Particles of the Blood, and are then ſecerned by ſome of the Glandules, and thrown off by the Emunctories of the Body, either upon the Pallat into the Noſtrils, or upon the Lungs, whence Catarrh's, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryza's and Bronchus's do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Sometimes the Particles quite cloſe the Pores, hinder Perſpiration, by not permitting Nature to expel other unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Particles which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Blood, and which ſhe continually thruſts out that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55444:31"/>way; which Particles when pent in by their pricking Points, corroding Angles, or Velocity of Motion forthwith cauſe Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; and end in Quinſies, Pleuriſies, Reumatiſms, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyems, Feavers, or other Acute Maladies. That there are ſuch Particles as theſe, and that Cold is no Negative, but a Poſitive Quality, is evidently enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> in his. <hi>Epicurean Phyloſophy,</hi> and by our own Countreyman Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi> in his <hi>Philoſophia E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picuro-Gaſſendo-Charletoniana,</hi> and likewiſe by the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> the Mirrour of this Age for Learning and Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: That theſe Particles do not always injure the Body by Obſtructing the Pores, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Perſpiration, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by entring the Body, and uniting themſelves with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55444:32"/>or thinner part of the Blood, is manifeſt, becauſe we often experience the Body to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by Cold, when onely one part hath been expoſed thereto, and the whole Body beſides en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a free Perſpiration; as for inſtance, let a Man put his Foot or any other Member into cold Water, where I am ſure a good number of theſe Frigorific Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles float, eſpecially in Winter, and continue it there for ſome, conſiderable ſpace, and in the mean time let the other parts of his Body perſpire, being kept as warm or warmer than at other times, yet he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive apparent prejudice from this Experiment. For either a Cough, Running at Noſe, Hoarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome other Symptomes, ſhall convince any one that he hath got a Cold, as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar expreſs it. There are other
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55444:32"/>Particles of a quire differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> ſphaeric or round in Figure, exile or ſmall in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and ſwift in Motion; theſe we call Calorific or Hot Particles. The chief Seminary of theſe Particles in Unctious Matter, as Oils, Greaſe, Fat, and Sulphureous Things. That Hot and Cold Particles are the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of ſeveral Diſeaſes is to me very demonſtrable, but beſides theſe there are certainly numerous forts of Particles of different Figures.</p>
            <p>Now this Hypotheſis is ſo far from being a fois;ted Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my own, that altho it was never yet proſecured with that ſtrict ſcrutiny and diligence as it might deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have been, yet it is that which many of our later Authors drive at: For what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can we give why one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is Epidemic at one time,

The Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of many more Diſtempers might be thus ſolved. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by all our Modern and Ingenious Philoſophers and Phyſicians, That all Smells are made by the ſmall Effluviums of Bodies, and diſtinguiſh't by their differing Figures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they affect the Olfactory or Smelling Nerves, and cauſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;<note place="margin">See <hi>Boyle</hi> of Colours.</note> That Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ariſe from nothing but the different Reflection of Light, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Poſition and Configuration of the Particles that are viſible on the ſuperfice

            <p>Thus an Acid or Sowre Taſte proceeds from exceeding ſharp Particles pricking upon the Nerves deſtin'd for Taſte, as in Vinegar, the Auſtere Taſte is when thoſe Acid Particles are blunted and made more obtuſe by the union of ſome groſſer Terreſtrial Particles with them; as in Claret, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is alſo granted by ſome of our beſt Authors, that the Spirits,<note place="margin">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55444:34"/>which they are extracted, but are onely the Particles of Bodies artificially reduced to that form and faſhion by the force of Fire: How do Pearl, Coral, Crabs Eyes and other Alkali's ſweeten the Blood, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tell the Vulgar they do? not from any intrinſic dulcify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property in them, but by their abſorbing and licking up thoſe ſowre and unwholeſome Particles mixed with the Blood and Juices; for we find by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experiment, that an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali will unite it ſelf with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and cloſing in with its hooks, it will obtund its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pungency; as may be ſeen by the mixing of Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> with Spirit of Vitriol, and likewiſe if you Diſtil Coral, Pearl, Crabs Eyes, or almoſt any Alkali with the ſowreſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, it will utterly deprive it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55444:35"/>of allits ſharpneſs, and make it an imſipid Liquor, meerly by lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Acid Particles that gave it that ſour Reliſh.</p>
            <p>Then if Colours, Taſtes, Smells, and other ſuppoſed Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which daily affect our Senſes, if the Operation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines on Humane Bodies, and the Cure of Diſtempers, be all performed by Particles of ſundry ſhapes, who will deny that the Baſis, Source, Fountain, and Minera of whatſoever Diſeaſes at any time inſult over the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely fabricated Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is to be attributed ſolely to the differing Figures, Mixtures, Motions, and Magnitudes of Particles?</p>
            <p>From hence it is evident that ſince the Fall Man is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obnoxious to ſome Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or other, and his Body ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver free from ſome or other of

Thus the Diſtempers which accoſt the tender Bodies of Infants proceed from ſome Male-figured Particles affecting them; for Infants are no more ſecured from the Influx of ſuch Corpuſcles, than Bodies of greater bulk and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
            <p>The very Seed whereof In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are generated, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all manner of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous Corpuſcles, neither

This therefore (by the way) may caution us how indiſcreetly thoſe perſons act, who permit young Children to lie with old or conſumptive perſons, and how dangerous and deſtructive it is to the Bodies of thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Creatures.

'Tis by theſe pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles that the Noble Ferment of the Stomach is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and turned into another ſpurious Ferment, and hereby
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55444:38"/>the Foundation of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is firſt laid; for no ſooner is this unparallelled Ferment of the Stomach vitiated, but the Nutritive Juice receives ſuch different Alterations from what it ſhould be, as that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its Balſamic Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty: For the Chyle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vitiated in the Stomach, becomes the Seminary of this Diſeaſe, which being tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thus corrupted and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, into the other Digeſtions, draws them likewiſe into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſo vitiates one Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion after another until the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe it ſelf appears in its full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions and latitude of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes. It is by theſe ſpurious Particles that the <hi>Succus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus,</hi> or Pancreatic Juice, is alſo vitiated, which is another ſtep to this Diſtemper; from hence likewiſe the Chyle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

               </gap> that Liqoor from its Foeces or Excrements: Hereby theſe Glandules become hard and knotty, as it is manifeſt in the Diffection of Bodies defunct of this Malady; ſo that now only the more thin and ſerous parts of the Chyle are tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Thoracic Duct, and thence to the Heart; hence the Blood in time muſt needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pauperated for want of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of better Chyle, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Maraſmus or Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs enſue. 'Tis from ſome of theſe Mortal Particles that all Rheums and Catarrhs have their origin, and that a continued Catarrh doth at laſt produce a Phthiſis and Tabid
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55444:39"/>Conſumption is confirmed by the woful Experience of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, who at firſt ſlighting this ſmall primary Symptome, it hath quickly terminated in a Cough difficult enough to Cure. That a Catarrh is created from the mixture of Frigorific or Cold Particles, which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are very deſtructive to Mans Health, is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon the taking of great Cold, a Rheum or Catarrh doth moſt uſually enſue, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Cough and Hoarſneſs; this may caution us to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid Cold, as very deſtructive to Humane Sanity; for theſe cold Pyramidal little Bodies, mixing themſelves with the more thin and ſerous parts of the Blood, are by the endeavours of Nature to free the Blood of what is Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous or Diſſimular to it,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55444:40"/>thrown off upon the Glandules of the Throat; this falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Larynx already alienated by the in jury of Cold, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turned into a copious Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Matter frequently expelled by Coughing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if the Layrnx happen to be debilitated thro a continual Defluxion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then it falls upon the Lungs <q>where it perverts the Alimenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Juice of that part, turns it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a putrelaginous corrupt Matter, which as wormed up by the force of Coughing, ſtill increaſeth as faſt; ſo that at length fretting upon the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſubſtance of the Lungs, it creates an Ulcer in the Lungs, and hereby renders the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper for ever Incurable.</q> Hence we gather how dangerous a thing it is to neglect to ſeek a preſent Remedy for a Catarrh or Defluxion of Rheum, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55444:40"/>being neglected, frequently throws the Patient e're he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware into the profound Lake of a confirmed Tabes: We may likewiſe hence take notice how ridiculous the Opinion of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> is concerning the Cauſe and Origin of a Catarrh, <hi>viz.</hi> That it proceeds from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours aſcending from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which being condenſed by the coldneſs of the Brain, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil thro the ſmall Channel of the Pallat down the Wind-pipe to the Lungs; for if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Anatomy, we ſall find that the ſtructure of thoſe parts is ſuch as can never admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Defluxion or Diſtillation of Rheum from the Brain, as is exquiſitely manifeſted by that Eminent Phyſician Dr. <hi>Richard Lower</hi> in his <hi>Diſſertatio de Origine Catarrhi,</hi> at the end of his Book, <hi>De Corde;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55444:41"/>we deny that Vapors ariſe from the Digeſtion of Meat in the Stomach, ſo as to reach the Brain; for as ſoon as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach hath received its Food or Pabulum, its upper Mouth or Orifice is immediately ſhut, and the <hi>Aeſophagus</hi> cloſeth it ſelf together, ſo that no Vapors can paſs it. Innumerable are the Abſurdities which attend this Opinion of Vapors; for then no ſooner would the Meat and Drink be taken into the Stomach, but the heat and moiſture would forthwith ſend up Vapors; we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be conſtantly troubled with Catarrhs; alſo the moſt ſound, ſtrong Stomachs, whoſe heat is lively, would certainly always breed Catarrhs, becauſe of ſending up moſt powerful Vapors from the Liquld Parts of Food: Alſo in Cold Winter,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55444:41"/>from the forcible injury of the cold Air working upon the Brain, and cauſing a cold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper there; we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be kept free from a Catarrh: <q>Not to ſay what a conſtant dropping would there be at the Pipe of the Alembick the Noſe, enough to fill a Receiver in a little time, and to make every one go with one hung at his Noſe.</q> Alſo it would follow that all Defluxions of Rheums ſhould have but one taſte, and that inſipid too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Vapors, from whatſoever things they may aſcend, yet when they are condenſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Elementary ſimple Water: Whence therefore according to their Doctrine ſhould the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Conſiſtence and Taſtes proceed; that one ſhould be ſalt, another ſharp and fretting; one thin, another more thick?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55444:42"/>So that this Doctrine of Vapors is on every ſide beſet with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Abſurdities.</p>
            <p>I might now at large expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate how and which way theſe Particles, Enemies to Mans Body, do predominate over, and oft-times conquer ſeveral noble Functions of the Body; but the neceſſity of contracting my Diſcourſe within the limits of a brief Tract will not permit ſo great a Digreſſion: The cauſe of this grand Evil being thus explicated, it follows that thoſe Medicines are moſt rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dogmatically uſed, which conſiſt of ſuch Particles as are moſt contrary and oppoſite in Figure to thoſe injurious Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which are the bane of this grief; or ſuch that are ſo figured as that they may abſorb and ſwallow up the Morbific <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> by linking their Hooks

            <p>Having proceeded thus far, it might be expected I ſhould treat more fully of the Secondary Cauſes of this Diſtemper, and likewiſe diſcourſe of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Symptomes of it; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the kinds and ſorts of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,</hi> and their particular

               <p>THe Caſe of Mr. <hi>Obrian</hi> being very Remarkable, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ways related, it will not he here amiſs to give the Reader a faithful account of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances of it, which was as follows:</p>
               <p>About the middle of <hi>April</hi> laſt, after I had Cured ſeveral perſons of <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> two of which had ſome Relation to the Court, His Majeſty came to be informed of this my ſucceſs by His Royal Highneſs, who had firſt had Intimation of it; whereupon his Majeſty being immediately willing to ſatisfie his Royal Curioſity in this thing, Ordered me to attend the Court, and deſired that Worthy and Deſerving Gentleman Collonel
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55444:44"/>
                  <hi>Oglethorp</hi> (then altogether a Stranger to me, tho ſince my very good Friend) to find out ſome perſon about the Court in a deep <hi>Conſumption,</hi> for me to make an Experiment upon; whereupon after ſome ſearch the Collonel heard of Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy Obrian</hi> a Gentleman of the Guards, who had been languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above a year, in no Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of performing his Duty, and was never expected to be ſeen upon the Guards again; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo impotent and infirm, that he could hardly ſtand or walk; extreamly waſted and emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, perplexed with an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Cough, and a conſtant Tickling Rheum, a continual Wheazing and Shortneſs of Breath; and cold, faint, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sweats, with a burning Feaver attending all theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes; his Vrine was high
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55444:44"/>Coloured, without any Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he conſtantly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a great ſtraitneſs and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at his Breaſt: While in this Condition he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted three Phyſicians ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively one after another, but received no apparent Relief or Benefit; in theſe direful Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and while attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all theſe diſcouraging Symptomes, he was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, his Majeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his Condition, and was ſoon ſatisfied that his Diſtemper was a deep <hi>Conſumption</hi> which Diſtemper was then legible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his Looks and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. I being then preſent, was ordered by his Majeſty to undertake him, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his Cure; the Nobility that were there looking upon him as a Dying Man, and deeming it utterly impoſſible,

Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55444:45"/>Powder, and made up into <hi>Pills,</hi> becauſe he choſe to take it in that Form; of theſe he took Six Night and Morning, whereby his Feaver, which is called the <hi>Hectic,</hi> in three days time very much abated; I ſtill continued to exhibit the ſame <hi>Medicine,</hi> becauſe I found his Strength and Spirits were moſt waſted by the continuance of this Feaver; and becauſe I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped when this troubleſome Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome was removed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would yield with leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy; in a Weeks time his Feaver was quite gone, his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per appearing to be as mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as a healthful Mans; by this I was encouraged to hope his other Symptomes would ſhortly diſappear as well as this; to which end I preſcribed him every Night ſome drops of our Grand <hi>Antiphthiſic Elixir</hi> in a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55444:46"/>proper Vehicle: likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him every Morning a Glaſs of good old <hi>Malago</hi> with a new laid Egg, without any ſuſpicion that this would occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a return of his Feaver, this Feaver not proceeding original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from heat, or the taking of hot things, but from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome putrid Particles with the Blood, whereby a ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fermentation or Ebulition of that Crimſon Liquor is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; the Diet I aſſign'd him was <hi>Chickens, Rabits, Veal, Lamb,</hi> and Meats of eaſie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; his ordinary Drink was our <hi>Reſtorative Liquor,</hi> now and then allowing him a Glaſs of Ale; by this means I perceived he gathered ſtrength, for by the help of our <hi>Grand Elixir</hi> his Cough gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the Tickling left him; his <hi>Muſcles</hi> now began to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55444:46"/>plump, and <hi>Calfs</hi> of his <hi>Leggs</hi> to riſe, and he was ſupply'd with a continual addition both of Strength and Fleſh every day: The ſhortneſs of his Breath, and ſtraitneſs of his Breaſt was now hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. To finiſh and perfect this Cure, I preſcribed him Three Doſes of our <hi>White Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate Powder</hi> every day, to be taken diſſolv'd in a Glaſs of our <hi>Reſtorative Liquor;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the reſidue of thoſe malign <hi>Particles,</hi> which remained in his Body, were abſorb'd and lick'd up; he continued ten days to take theſe <hi>Powders.</hi> So that in five Weeks by the Bleſſing of Almighty God he was perfectly reſtored to his former health; he was now able to walk and run, jump and ride, and was fit for any kind of Exerciſe; in ſo much that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55444:47"/>all that ſaw him admired at this ſo great and ſo ſudden Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; he being thus reſtored beyond expectation. I firſt brought him to <hi>Collonel Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>'s Houſe, who not a little ſurprized, rejoyced at his, ſpeedy Recovery: We then, went to <hi>Windſor</hi> (the Court being then there) to perſent him to the King, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuſpicion that he was only patch'd and not perfectly Cured, the Collonel reſolved to make this Experiment, he walkt a Mile or two in the Park at <hi>Windſor,</hi> as faſt as he could well go, after that to the <hi>Ferry,</hi> to wait on the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was then going to <hi>London,</hi> deſigning to take Coach on the other ſide the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; from the <hi>Ferry</hi> the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſent Mr. <hi>Obrian</hi> to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle on a Meſſage for the Duke;

I therefore refuſed to meddle with him, acquainting his Friends and Relations that I deemed his Caſe very deſperate; but yet no denial would ſatisfie their urgent deſires of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking him, earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching and intreating me, proteſting by all that was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and dear to them, that they would abundantly grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me whether he liv'd or dy'd, if I would but preſcribe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, and only try

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55444:56"/>the cauſe of his Looſeneſs in ten days; his Sweatings alſo ceaſed.

               <p>The Condition I found him in was this, He having accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed himſelf to lie upon the ground to watch Cattle, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by took an extraordinary Cold, the <hi>Frigorific Particles</hi> from the damp Earth penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Skin, and mixing themſelves with his Blood and Juices, occaſioned theſe dire Affects; for the endeavour of Nature to expel theſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous unwelcome Gueſts, was brought upon him a great Looſeneſs and Vomiting, a tedious Cough, attended with a deſperate <hi>Peri-Pneumonià,</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55444:81"/>I took her in hand, I found her very exact, ſtrict, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in taking what I order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her; and tho ſhe always had an Averſion to Medicines, tho never ſo pleaſant, yet now being ſenſible of her danger, and valuing the ſweetneſs of Life, ſhe relying on my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, became very punctual and obſerving, and accordingly both her expectation and mine were fully anſwered, for by the uſe of our <hi>Scarlet Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Confection,</hi> our <hi>Alkalizate Powder,</hi> our <hi>Balſamic Drops,</hi> and our <hi>Grand Elixir;</hi> ſhe was in ſix Weeks time reſtored to her wonted ſtate of Health, and is like ſo to continue, tho ſhe muſt expect her Cough in ſome meaſure every Winter during her Life, by reaſon it is <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</hi>

                        <hi>THe Perſon is between One and Two and Twenty years of Age: He was from his Cradle very Tender,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55444:83"/>and always ſubject to</hi> Catarrhs <hi>and</hi> Colds, <hi>and a Wheazing in his</hi> Wind-pipe <hi>uſually accompanied them when he lay in his Bed. He is of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and timerous Nature, reſerved and thoughtful, and his Mind ſeemeth to have prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Body, for this later was always lean and emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; the ſtraightneſs of his Breaſt contributeth naturally to his ſhortneſs of Breath, with which he is much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, eſpecially when he ſtirs. A Cold ſeized on him the laſt</hi> March, <hi>and with that, a great Cough, which hath continued ever ſince, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by any Medicines he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55444:83"/>hath made uſe of. This hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his ſleep in the Nights, together with the diſturbance of his Spirits by Melancholly Fumes. He is very Heavy and Dull in the day time, and yet he cannot improve this drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs into a Sleep. After Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this Heavineſs takes place chiefly, and he finds his Head loaded and clogged: Then likewiſe he feels Gripings and Gnawings in the hole of his Stomach, it is probable by reaſon of</hi> Wind; <hi>for upon</hi> Belching <hi>he findeth Eaſe, and ſo he doth when he breaks Wind downward: He can eat nothing but</hi> Fleſh-Meat, <hi>as</hi> Mutton, Veal,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55444:84"/>Chicken, <hi>&amp;c and he finds that other things, as</hi> Broaths, <hi>diſagree with him. He eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the former with a pretty good</hi> Appetite, <hi>but he is ill allt he Afternoon enſuing. The corners of his Mouth are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out and are ſore, and the skin of his Tongue hath been off, or his Tongue hath been ſore and tender, and very red ever ſince his</hi> Cough <hi>ſeized on him. He is Hectical, and burneth moſt towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, but ſome part of the day he is alſo Chill and Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. The other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Diſtemper are ſuch as theſe, his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine is high coloured; and comes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55444:84"/>from him always with a great Sediment. He is very</hi> Lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, <hi>and goes to Stool twice or thrice a day or more: He hath had a</hi> Hoarſneſs <hi>ever ſince his Illneſs, and of late it is increaſed: He is more lean and waſted in his Fleſh than he was before. The</hi> Flegm <hi>that he raiſeth is generally of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh colour: His Limbs are weak and feeble, and he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for ſtirring from the place where he ſitteth. About a Month ago his</hi> Ankles <hi>began to ſwell, and they continue to do ſo ſtill at Night, and the Flesh is ſoft and dented, but the Swelling goes down in the Morning.</hi>

               <p>I having read his Caſe, would not venture to preſcribe any thing for him at ſuch a diſtance; upon which they wrote again to me to deſire me to come down to <hi>Cambridge</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed; I immediately took <hi>Poſt,</hi> and when I came to him, I found him in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Condition that I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his Life three days; I acquainted his Father in Law and others with my Opinion, who were ſatisfi'd that it was in vain to preſcribe any thing for him; but the Mother whoſe Affections were more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary paſſionate towards this her only Child, deſired me to endeavour to give him ſome Relief: I being willing to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her, preſcribed for him ſome Drops of our <hi>Grand Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir</hi> at Night, and about half a Pint of our <hi>Red Strengthning
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55444:85"/>Gelly</hi> the next Morning and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; I ſtay'd two days with him, forbidding him to drink <hi>Beer</hi> or <hi>Ale,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining him to <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> Before I left him, I found ſome ſmall Amendment, his Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had in a great meaſure when I came to him, was abated, and he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſhed; but yet i had little or no hopes of his living many days: I returned to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> leaving the ſame things with them, which I ordered them to give him: At my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>London</hi> I wrote to his Father in Law acquainting him that I did diſpair of his Life, but for the ſatisfaction of his tender Mother, from whom I was forced to keep my Opinion, I deſired them to continue him in this Method.</p>
