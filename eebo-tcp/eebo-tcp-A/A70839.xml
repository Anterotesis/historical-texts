         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THou haſt here (gentle Reader)
brought to thy view, in the firſt
part of this Book, a <hi>Narrative</hi>
of the gracious dealings of
God with ſeveral Children, and what
they gained in an early looking Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
in which thou mayeſt ſee and behold
the condeſcention of the Lord to ſuch little
Ones, in opening their underſtanding, and
giving them a ſight and ſenſe of their undone
eſtate by nature, from whence they were made
to ſeek and enquire after a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and by
Grace helped to apply and improve his gracious
Calls and Invitations to a full ſatisfaction
in, and by Faith a cleaving to His underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
as the alone way and means to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to their great comfort here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and firm hope
of glory hereafter. All which was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
effected, to the praiſe of the free Grace
of God, and admiration of Relations and
Beholders; and now preſented to thee, being
firſt written by that faithful Servant of the
<pb facs="tcp:66173:3"/>
Lord, Mr. <hi>Henry Jeſſey;</hi> who in his life time
gave it me to tranſcribe, in order for the then
Printing: But it being ſmall, I waited to
have ſomewhat to adjoyn to it, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath lately brought to my hand as that
which is worthy of publication, being the
Fruit of ſome idle hours of that Servant of
the Lord Mr. <hi>Abraham Chear,</hi> whilſt in bonds
for the truth of Chriſt; wherein he expreſses
his well-wiſhes to the Souls of divers poor
Children, towards whom he then ſtood nearly
related, and dearly affected, as by the ſecond
Part hereof you may largely ſee: and if helped
of God to make improvement of it, ſo as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to mind, and heedfully to walk in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of what is ſeaſonably adviſed in the ſaid
Diſcourſe; you will have great cauſe to bleſs
the Lord for ſuch endeavours, now publiſhed
for your profit and advantage.</p>
            <p>The Motive provoking me thus to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this little Book, is chiefly from conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of my daily obſervation of Youths
great need of all endeavours to prompt them
to that which is good, they being naturally
addicted to be drawn away through their own
inclinations, and the powerful prevalency of
Satan to <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>diſobedience;</hi> by which
they wrong their precious Souls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.
36. thereby incurring Gods diſpleaſure to
their daily hardning their hearts from his

fear, and following the ſins and pleaſures of
this vain World, until they are prepared as
Veſſels of wrath fitted for Deſtruction and
Perdition; which is the certain effect of <hi>Sin</hi>

Though the Lord is pleaſed to let me lie under

Children; he hath enabled me, and will enable
me to bear them; and though he ſhould lay a
hundred times more upon me, yet will I wait
upon him, for he is my ſtay, and the hope of my
Salvation: My pains are nothing to the pains of
Hell, where they will never be at an end. And
Chriſt he ſuffered a great deal more for me then
all this is; he was bruiſed, buffeted, and ſpit
upon; and they platted a Crown of Thorns and
put upon his Head, and gave him Vinegar
to drink: But I have ſeveral things to take,
though I cannot reliſh them. And they came
out againſt Chriſt with Swords and Staves, and
Chriſt did not open his mouth againſt them;
but rebukes <hi>Peter</hi> for cutting the High Prieſts
Servants ear, and bid him put up his Sword
into the Scabbard, and ſaid, Shall not I drink
of the Cup that my Father hath prepared for
me; though my pains are very great, yet I am
ſo full of joy and comfort: I was very full of
comfort before, but I am fuller of joy this hour
than I have been yet. It is better to live <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s

though he ſtood at my left hand, and ſaid, I am

hand, and ſaith, I am but a fire-brand newly
plucked out of the fire, and he will put on me his

                  <hi>IN Auguſt</hi> laſt, this Child was ſick of a

being ſenſible, not only of actual ſins, but
of her loſt eſtate without Chriſt, in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,

was drawn out to pray many times in thoſe

words, (in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17.) <hi>Lord, thou wilt
prepare the heart, thou wilt cauſe thine ear to
