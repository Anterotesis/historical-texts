            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It will be to a row of as many, equal to the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st, in the first case, as</hi> 1 <hi>to</hi> 2; <hi>in the second case, as</hi> 1 <hi>to</hi> 3; <hi>in the third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as</hi> 1 <hi>to</hi> 4, &amp;c. (Where all that is affirmed, is but; <hi>If we SVPPOSE That, This will Follow.</hi> Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> doth not deny: and therefore all that he saith to it, is but Cavelling.)</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> moves these Questions, (and proposeth them to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> as not requiring any skil in <hi>Geometry, Logick,</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> to resolve them:) 1. <hi>Whether there can be understood</hi> (he should rather have said, <hi>supposed) an infinite row of Quantities, whereof the last can be given.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether a Finite Quantity can be divided into an Infinite Number of lesser Quantities, or a Finite quantity consist of an Infinite number of Parts.</hi> 3. <hi>Whether there be any Quantity greater than Infinite.</hi> 4. <hi>Whether there be any Finite Magnitude of which there is no Center of Gravity.</hi> 5. <hi>Whether there be any Number Infinite.</hi> 6. <hi>Whether the Arithmetick of Infinites be of any use, for the confirming or confuting any Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For answer.</hi> In general, I say, 1. Whether those things <hi>Be</hi> or <hi>Be not</hi>; yea, whether they <hi>Can</hi> or <hi>Cannot be</hi>; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is not at all concerned, (which affirms nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way;) but, whether they can be <hi>supposed,</hi> or made the <hi>supposition, in a conditional Proposition.</hi> As when I say, <hi>If</hi> Mr. Hobs <hi>were a Mathematician, he would argue otherwise</hi>: I do not affirm that either <hi>he is,</hi> or ever <hi>was,</hi> or <hi>will be</hi> such. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say (upon supposition) <hi>If he were,</hi> what he is not; he would not do as he doth. 2. Many of these <hi>Quaere's</hi> have nothing to do with the Proposition: For it hath not one word concerning <hi>Gravity,</hi> or <hi>Center of Gravity,</hi> or <hi>Greater than Infinite.</hi> 3. That usually in <hi>Euclide,</hi> and all after him, by <hi>Infinite</hi> is meant but, <hi>More than any assignable Finite,</hi> though not Absolutely Infinite, or the greatest possible. 4. Nor do they mean, when Infinites are proposed, that they should <hi>actually Be,</hi> or be <hi>possible to be performed</hi>; but only, that they be <hi>supposed.</hi> (It being usual with them, upon <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of things <hi>Impossible,</hi> to infer useful Truths.) And <hi>Euclide</hi> (in his second <hi>Postulate)</hi> requiring, <hi>the producing a streight line Infinitely, either way</hi>; did not mean, that it should be <hi>actually performed,</hi> (for it is not possible for any man to produce a streight line Infinitely;) but, that it be <hi>supposed.</hi> And if AB be <hi>supposed</hi> so produced, though but one way; its length must be <hi>supposed</hi> to become <hi>Infinite</hi> (or <hi>more than any Finite length assignable;)</hi> For, if but <hi>Finite,</hi> a Finite production would serve. But,
<figure/>
if so produced both ways; it will be yet <hi>Greater,</hi> that is, <hi>Greater than that Infinite,</hi> or Greater than was necessary to make it more than any Finite length assignable. (And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth thus <hi>suppose Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>; must consequently <hi>suppose, One Infinite greater than another.</hi>) Again, when (by <hi>Euclide's</hi> tenth Proposition) the same AB, may be <hi>Bisected</hi> in M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and each of the halves in <hi>m,</hi> and so onwards, <hi>Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> it is not his meaning when such continual section is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) that it should be <hi>actually done,</hi> (for, who can do it?) but that it be <hi>supposed.</hi> And upon such <hi>(supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly many</hi>; for no <hi>Finite</hi> number of parts would suffice for <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> sections. And if further, the same AB so divided, be <hi>supposed</hi> the side of a Triangle ABC; and, from each point of division, <hi>supposed</hi> lines (as me, Me, &amp;c.) parallel to BC: these parallels (reckoning downward from A to BC) must consequently be <hi>(supposed) infinitely many</hi>; and those, in <hi>Arithmetical progression,</hi> as 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. (each exceeding its Antecedent as much as that exceeds the next before it;) and, <hi>whereof the last</hi> (BC<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>is given.</hi> Nor is the <hi>supposition of Infinites</hi> (with these attendants) so new, or so <hi>Peculiar</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallerius</hi> or Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> but that <hi>Euclide</hi> admits it, and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians with him; as at least <hi>supposable,</hi> whether <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>In particular, therefore, to his <hi>Quaere's,</hi> I answer, 1. There may be <hi>supposed</hi> a row of Quantiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s <hi>Infinitely many,</hi> and <hi>continually increasing,</hi> (as the supposed parallels in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle ABC, reckoning downwards from A to BC,) <hi>whereof the last</hi> (BC) <hi>is given.</hi> 2. A Finite Quantity (as AB) may be <hi>supposed</hi> (by such continual Bisections) divisible into a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of parts <hi>Infinitely many</hi> (or, more than any Finite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber assignable:) For there is no stint beyond which such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision may not be <hi>supposed</hi> to be continued; (for still the last, how small soever, will have two halves;) And, all those Parts <hi>were in</hi> the Undivided whole; (else, where should they be had?) 3. Of <hi>supposed</hi> Infinites, one may be <hi>supposed</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than another. As a, <hi>supposed,</hi> infinite number of <hi>Men,</hi> may be <hi>supposed</hi> to have a <hi>Greater</hi> number of eyes. 4. A sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, or solid, may be <hi>supposed</hi> so constituted, as to be <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Long,</hi> but <hi>Finitely Great,</hi> (the Breadth continually De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in greater proportion than the Length Increaseth,) and so as to have <hi>no Center of Gravity.</hi> Such is <hi>Toricellio's Solidum Hyperbolicum acutum</hi>; and others innumerable, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Format,</hi> and others. But to determine this, requires more of <hi>Geometry, and Logick</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it do of the <hi>Latin Tongue)</hi> than Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> is Master of. 5. There may be <hi>supposed</hi> a number <hi>Infinite</hi>; that is, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any assignable Finite: As the <hi>supposed</hi> number of parts, arising from a <hi>supposed</hi> Section <hi>Infinitely continued.</hi> 6. There is therefore no reason, on this account, why the Doctrin of <hi>Euclide, Cavallerius,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as of no use.</p>
               <p>But having solved these <hi>Quaere's,</hi> I have some for Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> to answer, which will not so easily be dispatched by him. For though <hi>Supposed Infinites</hi> will serve the Mathematicians well enough: yet, howsoever he please to prevaricate (which, he saith, is <hi>for his Exercise,</hi>) Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> himself is more concerned than they, to solve such <hi>Quaere's.</hi> Let him ask himself therefore, if he be still of opinion, that <hi>there is no Argument in nature to prove, the World had a Beginning</hi>: 1. Whether, in case it had not, there must not have passed an <hi>Infinite number of years</hi> before Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was born. (For, if but <hi>Finite,</hi> how many soever, it must have begun so many years before.) 2. Whether, now, there have not passed <hi>more</hi>; that is, <hi>more than that infinite</hi> number. 3. Whether, in that <hi>Infinite</hi> (or <hi>more than infinite)</hi> number of <hi>Years,</hi> there have not been a <hi>Greater</hi> number of <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Hours</hi>: and, of which hitherto, <hi>the last is given.</hi> 4. Whether, if this be an Absurdity, we have not then (contrary to what Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> would perswade us) an <hi>Argument in nature</hi> to prove <hi>the world had a beginning:</hi> Nor are we beholden to Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> for this Argument; for it was an Argument in use before Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was born. Nor can he serve himself (as the Mathematicians do) with <hi>supposed Infinites</hi>; For his Infinites, and more than Infinites of Years, Days, and Hours, <hi>already past,</hi> must be <hi>Real Infinites,</hi> and which have <hi>actually existed,</hi> and whereof the <hi>last is given</hi>; (and yet there are more to follow.) Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> shall do well (for his Exercise) to solve <hi>these,</hi> before he propose more <hi>Quaere's</hi> of <hi>Infinites.</hi>

Let that proportion be <hi>what you will</hi>; suppose, as 1 to 2; and consequently, DC to CA being as 1 to 2, it will be to the Arc on CA, as 1 to 4: And by the same reason, DR to the Arc on RS, and DT to the Arc on TV, must also be as 1 to 4: And therefore the Arcs on TV, on RS, on CA; that is, 4 DT, 4 DR, 4 DC; will be in the same proportion to one another, as (their singles) DT, DR, DC: But these (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction) are in continual proportion; therefore those Arcs also, as they ought to be. Indeed, if (by changing some one of the terms) you destroy (contrary to the Hypothesis) the continual proportion of DT, DR, DC, you will destroy that of the Arcs also (which are still proportional to these:) but so long as DT, DR, DC, be in <hi>any</hi> continual proportion (whether that by him assigned or any other) those will be in the same continual proportion with them. As if for DT, DR, DC, be taken Dt, Dr, DC,

in any continual proportion (grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, less, or equal to his) the Arcs on <hi>tu,</hi> on <hi>rs,</hi> on CA, (extended) will be in the same continual proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.]</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For Answer</hi>; I say, that 'tis neither the opinion of Doctor <hi>Wallis,</hi> nor (that I know) of any other (so far is it from being a <hi>Received Opinion,</hi> which Master <hi>Hobs</hi> insinuates as such) that 10 is the Root of 100 <hi>Squares</hi> (For surely a <hi>Bare Number</hi> cannot be the side of a <hi>Square Figure:)</hi> Nor yet (as Master <hi>Hobs</hi> would have it) that 10 <hi>Squares</hi> is the Root of 100 <hi>Squares</hi>: But that 10 <hi>Lengths</hi> is the Root of 100 <hi>Squares.</hi> 'Tis true that the <hi>Number</hi> 10 is the Root of the <hi>Number</hi> 100, but not, of a 100 <hi>Squares</hi>: and, that 10 <hi>Squares</hi> is the Root (not of 100 <hi>Squares,</hi> but) of 100 <hi>Squared Squares</hi>: Like as 10 <hi>Dousen</hi> is the Root, not of 100 <hi>Dousen,</hi> but of 100 <hi>Dousen dousen,</hi> or <hi>Squares of a Dousen.</hi> And, as, there, you must multiply not only 10 <hi>into</hi> 10, but <hi>Dousen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Dousen,</hi> to have the Square of 10 <hi>Dousen</hi>; so here, 10 <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 10 (which makes 100) and <hi>Length into Length</hi> (which makes a <hi>Square)</hi> to obtain the Square of 10 <hi>Lengths,</hi> which is therefore 100 <hi>Squares,</hi> and 10 <hi>Lengths</hi> the Root or side of it. But, says he, the Root of 100 <hi>Soldiers,</hi> is 10 <hi>Soldiers. Answer.</hi> No such matter: For 100 <hi>Soldiers</hi> is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of 10 <hi>Soldiers into</hi> 10 <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but of 10 <hi>Soldiers into</hi> the <hi>Number</hi> 10: And therefore neither 10, nor 10 <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> the Root of it. So 10 <hi>Lengths</hi> into the <hi>Number</hi> 10, makes no Square, but 100 <hi>Lengths</hi>; but 10 <hi>Lengths</hi> into 10 <hi>Lengths</hi> makes (not 100 <hi>Lengths,</hi> but) 100 <hi>Squares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in all other proportions: As, if the number of <hi>Lengths</hi> in the <hi>Square side</hi> be 2; the number of <hi>Squares</hi> in the <hi>Plain</hi> will be <hi>twice two,</hi> (because there will be <hi>two</hi> rows of <hi>two</hi> in a row:) If the number of <hi>Lengths</hi> in the <hi>side,</hi> be 3; the number of <hi>Squares</hi> in the <hi>Plain,</hi> will be 3 times 3, or the Square of 3: If that be 4, this will be 4 times 4: And so in all other proportions. Of which, if any one doubt he may believe his own eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>And this Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> might have been taught by the next Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter (that knows but how to measure a Foot of Board) who could have told him, that because the <hi>side</hi> of a Square Foot, is 12 <hi>Inches in Length,</hi> the Plain of it will be 12 <hi>times</hi> 12 <hi>Inches in Squares</hi>: Because there will be 12 Rows of 12 in a Row.</p>

               <p>WHich came out just as the Answer to the two former was going to the Press, contains, for substance, the same with his Second, and the Latter part of the First: And so needs no farther Answer.</p>
               <p>Only I cannot but take notice of his usual trade of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himself. His second Paper says, <hi>The side of a Square is not a Superficies, but a Line</hi>: His Third says the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, (Prop. 1.) <hi>A Square root (speaking of Quantity) is not a Line, but a Rectangle.</hi> Other faults, falsities, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, there are a great many; which I omit, as too gross to need an Answer.</p>
