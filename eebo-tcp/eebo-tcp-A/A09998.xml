            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT EXCELLENT AND HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Lord, the Lord Robert Dudley, Earle of Leceſter, Baron of Denbigh, knight of the moſt noble order of the garter, Maſter of the Queenes Maieſties horſe, and one of her graces most Honorable priuy Counſell, Iohn Harmar wiſheth all godly felicitie, continuaunce of health, encreaſe of Honor, &amp; graces eternall.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WAS REQVESTED, RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, by manie of my friends, to emploie the time of this laſt vacation of mine from my publique readinges in the Vniuerſitie, in the tranſlating of Maſter Bezaes Sermons vpon the Canticle of Canticles, which I had a little before receaued from the Francfurt Mart in French, into our vulgare and Mother tongue. The deſire I had of aduancing and promoting the glorie of God, which is then eſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and farthered, when his word, the mirrour of his wil, is no longer a ſealed booke vnto the ſimple and ignorant, but a volume laid open in clear and capital letters, that he that runneth may read it: enforced mee princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to vndertake vpon my preſent leaſure, this more painful, then happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thankful work of tranſlating.</p>
            <p>Wherein, for the vtility and profite of manie, as wel the learned as the vnlettered who haue not the vnderſtanding of the French tongue, I did the more willingly emploie both my leaſure and my paine, becauſe I would haue ſomewhat to preſent your Lordſhippe withal for a token and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my thankful duety, and dutifull thankfulneſſe, vpon ſo manie, ſo memorable, ſo vtterly vndeſerued benefits of your Honor, not ſo much col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as congeſted, &amp; heaped from time to time vpon me. For extend I the cogitation of my mind to the fartheſt part of my infancy and childhoode, and drawe it foorth as in a continuall and euen threed vnto this preſent time, what part of my age hath not beene honored with the patronage of your Lordſhips fauor and goodwil towardes me? The ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my firſt ſtudies laid in Wincheſter by your honours onely meanes, in obtaining her highneſſe letters for my preferment vnto that ſchoole; the rearing of the farther frame of them in this Colledge, wherein placed by your Lordſhips fauor, I yet continu; my time ſpent to my great deſire &amp; contentment in the parts beyond the Seas by your Honours interceſſion; my roome and degree I doe nowe enioie in the Vniuerſitie beeing one of her Maieſties publique profeſſors, purchaſed by your Lordſhips fauourable mediation, doe euerie of them in particular deſerue a volume of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
<pb facs="tcp:1883:3"/>
in al thankfulnes and humble deuotion towards your honour. And therefore, that I might not ſeeme vnmindful of your Lordſhips grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſpect and fauour towards me, or drowne ſo manie benefites receaued in the flud of forgetfulnes and vtter obliuion, I was bould to aduenture the deliuerie of theſe my ſimple labours in this ſo ſmal a woorke of tranſlation vnto your Honors patronage.</p>
            <p>What common profit &amp; emolument the worke it ſelfe maie bring vnto the Church of God among vs, maie be eaſily eſteemed of them, who ſhall aright conſider both the argument it ſelfe deduced in this preſent treatiſe, as likewiſe the autor whoſe deduction and expoſition it is, and laſtlie both the manner hee hath vſed in the handling thereof, and the principall end whereunto he hath directed it.</p>
            <p>The Argument therefore or ſubiect thereof, I meane the Canticle it ſelfe, entituled by an eminency of ſpeach, the Song of Songes, that is the onely Song as it were in the holy Scripture, and of the moſt heauenlieſt &amp; excellenteſt ditty, concluded in termes and phraſes of ſpeach altogether enigmaticall and allegoricall, and containing the great myſterie as the Apoſtle calleth it of our ſaluation, the myſtical coniunction of Chriſt with the faithfull his members, and the whole order of the ſpirituall fraunſailes and marriadge match it pleaſeth Chriſt to contract with his Church, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies reputed ſo darke and obſcure, ſo hard and difficult, that many aſwell of the auncient as of the later Church haue thought this arme of the maine Ocean of holy ſcriptures, the waters of life, fitter for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant to ſwimme, then for the Lambe to wade in: that is, according to the phraſe of the Apoſtle, rather ſtrong meate for ſuch as are growen vnto a perfect man in Ieſus Chriſt, then milke for ſuch as are ſtill babes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in vnderſtanding: it can not be denied but that the ſound interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof according vnto the ſenſe &amp; meaning of the holy Ghoſt, the vniformitie and conſent of other ſcriptures, the proportion and analogie of chriſtian faith, muſt needes bee profitable and auaileable to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of God, the congregation of ſaintes. For what admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort, &amp; conſolation vtterly incomprehenſible, the reading of this part of Scripture may bring euery Chriſtian, what peace and tranquillity it may breede in the afflicted minde and conſcience, what incomparable ioy it may worke in the harts of the beleeuing, it is eaſie to conſider by the ſpouſe her ſelfe in this place repreſenting not onely the whole but euery part &amp; member of the Church of God. My beloued, ſaith ſhe, is mine, and I am his. Loe the ground of our holy aſſuraunce of the fauour and loue of God towardes vs. The which words making and plighting in moſt formal ſort a reciprocall donation of the Bride to her Bridegroome, of Chriſt to his Church, ſerueth as it were for the burden of this holy &amp; ſacred nuptial ſong. Now this ground being of it ſelfe ſo comfortable and ſo plaine, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoroughout by the way of mutuall ſpeach in many darke and allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall termes and ſimilitudes, implyeth a ſingular degree of conſolation in the reſt being ſoundly and perfectly vnderſtoode.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1883:3"/>And albeit many haue trauailed in the expoſition of this moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable part of holy ſcripture, among whom ſome of our own countrymen haue well deſerued of the Church of God for their painfull labours in this behalfe, notwithſtanding if I be not deceaued with the loue and affection I beare the authour, in whoſe tranſlation I haue laboured (a man to bee embraced and loued of all who loue the Lord &amp; embrace his truth, but in particular to bee honoured and reuerenced of my ſelfe, who found him no leſſe then a father vnto me in curteſie &amp; good will, when I liued as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Geneua, and enioyed the benefite of hearing of him in lectures and ſermons) there is none that hath ſo plainely, ſo perfitely, ſo diſtinctly ſette downe and expounded it, as hee hath done. Wherein let Mounſier Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard himſelfe be iudge, whether Maſter Beza vnderſtand this Canticle or no, and leaue to accuſe with ſuch ſhameleſſe impudencie his ignorance and impietie.</p>
            <p>Nowe for the profite and benefite of the Church of God in common, how could it be more plainly and familiarly, more largely and plentifully, more diſtinctly and particularly handled, then by this way which he tooke for the behoofe of his particular flocke and charge, the people of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, to expound the whole Canticle by particular ſermons, and ſo to drawe from thence for inſtruction and doctrine, rebuking and reproouing, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and exhortation, comforting and conſolation, what ground and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes ſoeuer might be offered? VVhich howe aptly and fitly it is done by Maſter Beza in theſe ſermons, there is no man ſo ignoraunt which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhall not perceiue: eſpecially obſeruing thoſe ſpeciall notes which containe the ſumme of all that which in the ſermons following he hath particularly deduced and handled, euery ſection aunſwering by the like fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure vnto that which is premitted in thoſe ſummary contentes, which may ſerue both in ſteede of marginal notes, and an exact table vnto the whole worke. And in theſe who ſo liſt may ſummarily and ſhortly ſee in what ſort the Authors whole diſcourſes are framed and directed, according vnto the naturall importance of the text it ſelfe, againſt the aduerſarie.</p>
            <p>And this is it whereat principally Maſter Beza hath in theſe ſermons of his aimed, namely, to the conuincing of the aduerſary in the chiefeſt &amp; moſt fundamentall pointes controuerſed betweene the Papiſtes &amp; vs, and eſpecially touching the principall points concerning the true Ieſus Chriſt (for there are falſe Chriſtes gone out into the world, and many ſay, here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt, but beleeue them not) and the true Church (for there is a falſe Catholique Church too, reſembling the true onely in name) and the certaine and infallible markes both of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are the queſtions eſpecially debated betweene our aduerſaries and vs at this day. As in deede this is the principall ende and ſcope which Salomon himſelfe reſpected in this ſong of his, namely, to paint forth vnto vs in moſt liuely coloures, aſwell the true and eſſentiall qualities of this Bridegrome, as alſo the natiue and liuely portraite of this ſpouſe, which is his Church. And therefore fiue of the ſermons of this volume, which goe
<pb facs="tcp:1883:4"/>
no farther then the thirde Chapter of the Canticles (for the reſt Maſter Beza hath promiſed if God wil hereafter, and my ſelfe by the aſſiſtance of the ſame God will according to my leaſure performe the tranſlation of them when I ſhall receiue them) concerning the deſcription of Salomons Coche, and the crowning of him with a crowne by his mother in the day of his fiaunſailes, are wholy touching the vſurped tiranny of the Church of Rome ouer all Chriſtendome, and the falſification, which the heade thereof, who nameth himſelfe the Lieutenaunt generall in earth vnto this king which is here crowned, vſeth, in all the ordinaunces and lawes of God. And firſt in the law morall, throughout euery commandement, firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fift, ſixt, ſeuenth, eight, ninth, and tenth: and then in the law ceremoniall, thirdly in confounding the law with the Goſpell, and cauſing men, to ſeeke after their ſaluation in that which inditeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them, ſhewing and proouing after this howe Chriſt is degraded from all his eſtates &amp; offices by this Apoſtaticall See. And firſt of his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity royall, then his ſtate propheticall, thirdly his Prieſthood. The ſame both touching theſe and other points debated betweene the Papiſtes and vs, is likewiſe performed throughout his whole ſermons, that the diligent reading of them may furniſh euery one of the ſimpler and ignoraunt ſort, with ſtore of weapons defenſiue &amp; offenſiue againſt the aduerſarie.</p>
            <p>Some fewe thinges, beeing perſonal matters, I muſt confeſſe vnto your Lordſhip, I haue omitted in the printed tranſlation, which are pointed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by a little ſtar, that who ſo liſt to ſee them maie by that meanes conſult the autor himſelfe. I thought it for my owne part not conuenient, as many good men alſo with me, to hinder the Church of ſo great a commoditie, as I doubt not this woorke will bring it, by occaſioning anie offence through ſome few wordes which might happily breede ſome grieuance. And herein as I doubt not, but the autor himſelfe, for his loue towards me, wil pardon me: ſo I hope al the godly wil hold me excuſed.</p>
            <p>It remaineth I beſeech your Lordſhip in all dutie and humility fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie to accept of this ſimple preſent of mine, no requital or recompence of your Honors bountie and liberality alwaies exhibited vnto me, but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie and ſignification of my grateful and thankful mind moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natelie deuoted vnto al ſeruiceable duty towardes your honour.</p>
            <closer>THE Lord of Lords and God almighty, guide you euer, and direct you in al your honourable actions with his holie ſpirite, and continue you long in al honour vnto his honour: for the welfare of his Church, the benefite of our common Weale, the patronage of our Vniuerſitie, the ioy of all ſuch as pray for your Lordſhips health and proſperity.

We haue therefore in this pſalme an excellent and moſt diuine treatie touching the moſt ſtrait and spirituall bonde and alliaunce which is betweene Ieſus Chriſt and his Church, euery point thereof being proſecuted and continued vnder ſuch formes and phraſes of speach as are cuſtomari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed in the treaty of the conditions of a naturall marriadge betweene ſuch perſons as are of an high degree and qualitie: as the Prophets alſo haue in many places retained the very ſame termes of Bridegrome and ſpouſe and of marriadge ſpeaking of Ieſus Chriſt and of his Church, as the Apoſtle hath likewiſe vſed the ſame, namely, <hi>Rom. 7.2.</hi> &amp; <hi>2. Cor. 11.</hi> and <hi>Ephſ. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are therefore to note in the firſt place that as in the matter of mariadge the fianſailes or betrothings are firſt ſolemnized &amp; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the marriadge, ſo Chriſt alſo as the bridegrome of the Church ought to bee in ſome ſort conſidered after two diuerſe manners, firſt according vnto his infirmitie, which may bee compared vnto the fian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes: and ſecondly according vnto his glory which he obtained after his reſurrection, beeing nowe the true huſband of his Church, repleniſhed himſelfe with glory, though ſhee bee yet remayning in part vpon earth.
<pb facs="tcp:1883:5"/>
Now as touching this pſalme Chriſt is therein propoſed vnto vs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already in his glory, and as he who hath begonne already to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh in deede this holy marriadge with his Church.</p>
            <p>Chriſt therefore as huſband is this true king of his Church, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in respect of himſelfe in all beautie, that there is nothing wanting, verſ. <hi>2.</hi> As touching the good grace he hath to winne all heartes vnto himſelfe, and euen to chaunge and turn them altogether, the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appeareth in the preaching of the gospell accompanied with a vertue &amp; power of the spirite which cannot be expreſſed. Himſelfe in aſmuch as hee hath taken vpon him the nature of man, hath receiued in the ſame nature the ſpirite of God without meaſure, in ſuch aboundaunt wiſe that he poured it as it were ouer in all his ſaintes.</p>
            <p>He is girded alſo with a ſword, and that not in ſhewe onely without effect, but which he draweth and vnſheatheth in deede, namely then when he maketh his worde to pearce vnto the diuiding of the ſoule &amp; of the ſpirite: verſ. <hi>3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is beſides deſcribed to bee furniſhed and prouided with arrowes with which he ſhooteth thorough &amp; transpearceth all his enemies, ver. <hi>5.</hi> which maketh alſo that al praiſe ought principally &amp; ſouerainly to be yeelded vnto him, who ſheweth himſelfe of ſo ready and mighty a power that hee is able to ſuccour and defende ſuch as are his, &amp; to breake in ſunder and ouerthrow the ſtrength of ſuch as rebell againſt him. ver. <hi>5.</hi> To this purpoſe he is introduced as being trained in his chariot by theſe three horſes, Truth, Meekenes, and Righteouſnes, which are condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the word as by him that guideth this Chariot, verſ. <hi>4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe to declare at large the ſenſe and meaning of euery of theſe things here propoſed, it would require a great volume. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we may as it were by the way obſerue ſomewhat out of them, if we make a compariſon on the contrarie ſide of the traine they kepe, and on what chariot they cauſe them-ſelues to be carried, I meane the kinges &amp; Princes who ſerue that maſter which is oppoſed altogether vnto this head of the Church, in whoſe whole furniture and prouiſion is nothing but Ambition, Pride, Inſolencie, Crueltie, Diſſolution, with an horrible tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pling vnder &amp; oppreſſing of them which are their ſubiects. We muſt alſo diligently note that which is added, that albeit the worlde will not accept this moſt iuſt and moſt milde gouernement of his, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:1883:5"/>
this ſo iuſt a king gouerneth alwaies moſt happily, &amp; that the more men oppoſe and ſet themſelues againſt him, the more hee maketh his power to appeare, whether it be in that ſo iuſt and aſſured defence which hee cauſeth thoſe who are his to feele, or whether he ſtrike his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies within vnto death by a moſt diuine power, namely when hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth them into a reprobate ſenſe to make them-ſelues the inſtruments of their own ruine &amp; deſtruction. Now albeit theſe things come to paſſe euery day, inaſmuch as this good king doth alwaies defend all his elect, to the end that none of them periſh, &amp; inaſmuch as he doth vengeance vpon their enemies according as it pleaſeth him to ſhewe the markes thereof: notwithſtanding this appeared moſt expreſlie in the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this marriage, as it ſeemeth to be here in ſome ſort touched, when he ſhewed ſuch vengeaunce on that vngrateful ſynagogue of the Iewes obſtinatly perſeuering in her incredulity, in which ſhe continueth vnto this date, reſeruing notwithſtanding the remnaunt of his elect according vnto his expreſſe mercy which he promiſed vnto the race of Abraham, howe rebellious ſo euer it doth ſhew it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now after this king hath obtained ſuch a victorie, hee is here ſeated on his ſeat of Iuſtice and Righteouſneſſe, which is called eternal and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, ver. <hi>6.</hi> to giue vs to vnderſtand that it is not of this woorld, and that not onely becauſe that Iuſtice eſtabliſheth the ſeat of the king in this world, as it is written, <hi>Prou. 27.28.</hi> but especially becauſe here the queſtion is of a king who is together both true God eternal, and true Son of Dauid according vnto the fleſhe, vnto whom alſo in aſmuch as he is man is giuen all power both in heauen and in earth, beeing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted aboue euerie name, as this place is alleaged, <hi>Heb. 1.8.</hi> in ſo much that the Church hath no more manie kinges, then one woman can haue manie huſbandes: neither is he whom ſhe hath for her huſband ſo God, that he is not alſo man, ſeeing otherwiſe the marriage would not agree betweene him &amp; the Church which is gathered from among men: as neither is hee man in ſuch ſort, that hee is not God too, becauſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Church ſhould not haue an head and huſband mighty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defend her.</p>
            <p>Afterwarde is declared the moſt righteous gouernment of this goodlie kingdome, to wit, of the Church, ver. <hi>7.</hi> for there is no kingdome but the Church which is gouerned by the true rule of a moſt iuſt and
<pb facs="tcp:1883:6"/>
moderate diſcretion, bee it in publicke charges or in priuate duties and particular charges, becauſe it is in it properlie that the spirite of God doth raign, which ordereth &amp; directeth indeed the ſenſes, &amp; gouerneth the affections of the true faithful &amp; beleeuing. And the reaſon of this point which is added is of great waight, namely, becauſe that this king of the Church both in respect of his perſon as alſo of his office, is annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue his companions, that is to ſaie, we muſt ſet him by himſelfe in another order &amp; degree then other kings are. For euen in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent kings, yea in Dauid himſelfe there haue beene many defects and imperfections, but in ſuch a king as this is there is nothing but all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>As for that which is added of the moſt exquiſite robes and veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this king, verſ. <hi>8.</hi> this is referred partly vnto that proper voice which the father cauſed to be heard when he was baptized, ſaying, This is my welbeloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which voice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs to vnderſtand the ful and perfect reconciliation with the father by that moſt ſweet odor aſwel of the integrity and righteouſneſſe reſiant in the parſon of Chriſt our Immanuel, as alſo his obedience vnto death euen the death of the croſſe. Theſe ſame veſtiments alſo and robes of his are referred vnto that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>2. Cor. 2.15.</hi> we are the ſweet odor of Chriſt as of him who hath beene made vnto vs Wiſdome, Righteouſnes, and Sanctification, &amp; Redemption, <hi>1. Cor. 1.30.</hi> which bleſſings hee powreth downe vpon vs from thoſe pallaces of Iuory, which are thoſe heauenly places where hee is ſeated, and from whence hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon vs, and from whence alſo he cauſeth theſe bleſsings &amp; graces of his, to flow downe vpon vs, yea his owne ſelfe (as we may ſo ſay) after a ſpiritual maner &amp; faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſuch as is vtterly inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible vnto vs.</p>
            <p>This king and Bridegrome being thus deſcribed vnto vs, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtate of the Church his spouſe, and of their whole marriage is moſt amply ſet downe and handled verſ. <hi>9.</hi> Nowe in the diſcourſe and handling heereof there are adioyned vnto the Iſraelites and faithfull Iewes which properly repreſent this spouſe, certaine others which are the kinges Daughters alſo to be her companions: al which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding appertaining but to one huſband repreſent vnto vs by this meanes the perſon of one onely Church truely Catholicke, that is to ſaie vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, but yet in ſuch ſort that they are as it were placed after this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb facs="tcp:1883:6"/>
spouſe of the people of Iſrael: becauſe the firſt right appertaineth firſt of al vnto the holie Prophets &amp; Apoſtles of the nation of the Iewes and to al the other which the Apoſtle calleth the natural braunches, by whoſe miniſterie alſo we haue been led and conducted into the chamber of this king, with whoſe gold and glittering ſhining we are made bright and ſhining. Wee are farther to note touching the ornamentes of theſe Queens which are the body of the Church, that it is not ſaid that they tooke them out of their own cabinets and ward-robes, but they receiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the king himſelfe, to the end it ſhould be acknowledged that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is faire &amp; goodly proceedeth not, as it is moſt true, but from his mere grace &amp; fauor who hath couered our pouerty &amp; nakednes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it foloweth that ſhe ought properly to be held &amp; taken for the true Catholicke Church whom wee ſee to come foorth in this place with her companions in al humilitie with that rich crowne of the onely righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of Chriſt her king and ſauiour, embraced by faith and freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted &amp; allowed her: although together with this righteouſnes of faith there muſt appeare beſides in the faithfull an actuall righteouſnes, but neuer perfect and entire, but onely begun and delineated forth by little and little, by which notwithſtanding a man maie alwaies diſtinguiſh the children of light from the children of darkenes, as it ſeemeth our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had alſo respect thereunto, <hi>Math. 22.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Al theſe things being thus handled, in which almoſt all the ſecretes of our ſaluation are compriſed, the Prophet addreſſeth his speache vnto the Church or rather vnto euery member thereof: ver. <hi>10.11.</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſtudy to pleaſe this Bridegroome who cheriſheth and fauoureth her ſo much, ſhewing withal how ſhe ſhall doe it, namely if in hearkening diligently vnto him (according as faith proceedeth of that which a man heareth of God himſelfe, and without which a man cannot pleaſe God) and ordering her ſelfe altogether vnto him (which is done if ſhee take narrow heede vnto his wil which is ſeene in the glaſſe of the Lawe) ſhee beginneth to rid her ſelfe in the whole traine and tenour of her life from al wicked spots and defilements of corruption which ſhe hath in herſelfe imprinted in her both from the originall and beginning of her nature &amp; being, and from the nouriture of her Parents as alſo of al ſuch as after by cuſtome &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance are growen according vnto the fleſh &amp; deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in her, that ſo ſhee maie learne the better to obey this onelie
<pb facs="tcp:1883:7"/>
Bridegroome of hers as her true head and Lord for euer.</p>
            <p>Afterward there is adioined an exhortation which is vſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the ſmall beginninges of the Chriſtian Church ſuch as it was when it began to take her firſt beginning in Ieruſalem, ver. <hi>12.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is eaſie to bee ſeene by the Actes of the Apoſtles what the Church might bee according vnto the fleſh when there were in the firſt aſſembly but threeſcore perſons and thoſe poore people and of no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or appearaunce, and therefore hee comforteth her and foretelleth that it ſhal come to paſſe, that they euen of Tyre it ſelfe, vnder whom he comprehendeth the ſtrange nations &amp; the very mightieſt of the world, ſhould ioine themſelues vnto her. And yet for al this he warneth her in good time that al this goodly beutiful ſhew and ſetting forth whereof he maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which he ſaith is to be priced aboue al the gold in the world without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon &amp; whatſoeuer ornament the greateſt Queens of this world might haue, ought to be within &amp; in the hart &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out to be apparant only vnto the eies according vnto the faſhion &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, ver. <hi>13.14.15.</hi> &amp; that yet a daie ſhoulde come when it ſhoulde appeare ſo high and magnificent in this Queene and in her Daughters, that it ſhould ſurmount and exceede all the magnificency the mind of man were able to conceiue, namely then when we ſhal meet Chriſt as the Apoſtle speaketh, and when beeing entred with him into his pallace we ſhall be and abide with him for euer.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude if any man demand what this Bride ſhal doe while ſhe waiteth &amp; expecteth the laſt acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhment of this ſouerain bliſſe &amp; happines which this blisfull Bridegroome ſhal in the end beſtow vpon the church his true ſpouſe: it is ſaid that this ſpouſe for the time ſhe waiteth for ſhal not ceaſe to bear or bring forth children vnto this huſband ver. <hi>16.</hi> yea &amp; thoſe excellent &amp; good children, &amp; ſuch as ſhal reſemble &amp; proue like vnto their true anceſtors, I meane the ancient Prophets &amp; Patriarches: &amp; ſuch as ſhal be kings to rule ouer al the coaſts &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, hauing therein by the vertue of the ſpirit of this great king ſubdued and ouercome ſatan, ſin, death and themſelues.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1883:8"/>
growne vp in the knowledge of God, and were of a more ſtable and conſtant iudgement. The cauſes whereof were, firſt becauſe the ſtile and phraſe thereof is altogether allegoricall and enigmatical, that is to ſay, deliuereth to our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding thinges heauenly and ſpirituall, by a ſimilitude and figure of things naturall and corporall, which euery man neyther of himſelfe can, nor by the help of an other is able, ſo to conceiue and vnderſtand, as thereby throughly to be profited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. Secondly becauſe this allegory is wholy grounded vpon the coniunction and coupling of man and wife in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adge: in the which, being humanely and carnally conſidered, we ſhall finde euen from the beginning thereof vnto the end, many great wantes and imperfections on mens behalfes, which defaultes as they haue bene euer rife ſince the entrance of ſinne into the world: ſo we know how they haue bin dayly encreaſed ſithence men haue for ſo long a time giuen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to all this vncleannes and wantonnes, which is no other thing then a polluting and defiling of the honeſt and chaſt careſſes, dilections, and embraſementes in marriadge. The which notwithſtanding it hath in it many defectes and blemiſhes, which the Lord of his great goodnes muſt ſupport and couer, hindereth not but that according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Marriadge is honorable amongſt all, and the bed thereof vndefiled.</hi> And thus you ſee how ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the miſchieuous maners of this world, and be cauſe there are in this Canticle many kinds of ſpeaches, according to the ſimplicity of that time in which this booke was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the world might eaſily abuſe, haue bene hardly induced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete it in the church, fearing leaſt it ſhould bring more harme thereunto, then profit and edification. Others there haue bene which haue gone farther, and haue beene ſo bold and hardy, or rather ſo ouerweening and headdy, as to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to raſe this booke out of the canonicall ſcriptures, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a writing altogeather profane, and compiled by Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the middeſt of his wanton and licencious diſſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. As touching the firſt ſort of theſe men, they are herein to bee

greatly commended, that they thinke it not good that euery one ſhould raſhly &amp; vnaduiſedly be carried or led to the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this booke: according vnto the ſaying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. <hi>that we muſt begin with milke, &amp; ſo proceed &amp; come to hard &amp; ſolid meate.</hi> Which thing hath bin carefully &amp; diligently obſerued both in this church and in others by the faythfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and miniſters. But as for thoſe which preſume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne this booke, they are no more to be harkened vnto or regarded then thoſe, who deſperatly and arrogantly addreſſe and oppoſe themſelues agaynſt the ſpirit of God. For beſides that the old and newe church hath from all times iudged the contrary, (this booke being diligently expounded by the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors both greeke and latin, yea euen in monaſteries amongſt the monkes vſed and handled, as a booke altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contemplatiue more then any beſides: albeit they then made ſolemne profeſſion of being farre from all thought of women and marriage) this very allegory of marriadge, is very amplie to the ſame end and purpoſe proſecuted in other bookes, which by a perpetual and common conſent haue bin alwayes held for holy &amp; diuine, as in the <hi>Pſalme</hi> 45, which is as it were a ſumme and abridgement of this whole Canticle, and in <hi>Eſay,</hi> 62.1.6. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. and 23. <hi>Oſeas</hi> 1.2. <hi>Math.</hi> 25. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and eſpecially <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. where the Apoſtle vſeth the very ſame words which Adam vſed in the firſt inſtitution of marriadge, to wit, <hi>that the church is made fleſh of the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt, and bone of his bones, which is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a great ſecret and myſtery:</hi> to be ſhort the holy Ghoſt in the <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17. is the expounder and interpreter of the beginning of this booke. Neyther is that to be regarded which ſome bring for an argument why this booke is not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, becauſe that no place of it is alleaged in the newe teſtament. For firſt, beſide that which I haue ſayd of the 45. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that it is an abridgment of this booke, the ſimilitudes which are taken from marriage in Saynt Paul, and in the laſt chapter of the Apocalyps are drawen from hence: and by the ſame reaſon we may condemne other bookes of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1883:9"/>
which are receiued without contradiction or gainſaying.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We muſt therfore vſe &amp; obſerue a mean in the expoſition of this booke, handling it then and in ſuch wiſe as it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, in the church of God. For God will not that any thing which he teacheth vs by his Prophets and Apoſtles ſhould be hidden or kept ſecret in ſuch ſort, as to content our ſelues to haue it enregiſtred onely in his word, without farther regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conſidering what it is: as the Paynimes were woont to deal in their falſe religions &amp; worſhips, who feared their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes ſhould be diſcouered, if their myſteries were knowen: or as we yet to this day ſee it practiſed in the falſe church, where the reading of the ſcriptures in the vulgar and common tong is forbidden: whereas the Apoſtles and Prophets ſince the beginning haue ſpoken and written in a common and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible language, to the end they might be vnderſtoode of all men. And yet is it very true, that the holy Ghoſt hath not vſed throughout the ſame ſtile and manner of writing, but hath ſpoken ſomtimes very plainly, ſometimes obſcurely, in ſuch ſort notwithſtanding, that (as one of the auncient fathers hath heretofore well obſerued) obſcurity and darknes is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and mixed with plainnes and clearnes, to the end to ſharpen and quicken our deſire to ſearch after that which we vnderſtoode not at the firſt, and to cauſe vs to eſteeme more higher of the ſecrets of his wiſdom, after that he hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on vs the gift of knowledge and vnderſtanding of them, vpon our carefull diligence of reading and conferring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the places of ſcripture. And this is that which we hope to doe, by Gods good aſſiſtaunce obtayned by your prayers, in the expounding of this booke: ſeing it is now about fifty years that God hath ſet vp, as it were anew, his holy Iubile amongſt vs, cauſing the holy light of his goſpell to ſhine in ſuch ſort in this place, that now nothing in this behalfe ought to ſeeme new and ſtrange vnto vs: as if we were yet yong infantes and babes in vnderſtanding: in ſteede of being aſhamed not to be of the nomber of thoſe, of whom it is ſpoken in the fift to the Hebrues, <hi>that they be exerciſed and practiſed in diſcerning betweene
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1883:9"/>
that which is good and that which is euill.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 Now for the vnderſtanding of this book, it is requiſit we learne and knowe, what moued the holy Ghoſt to chuſe and proſecute ſo farre this ſimilitude of marriadge: the which is not, as I ſayde before, if God would deal with rigour in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining euery poynt thereof, without many great wantes and imperfections. This was it therefore, to ſpeak in few wordes, becauſe there is not amongſt men, eyther in reſpect of the obligation, a more ſacred and diuine, or in regarde of the effect, a more ſtrait and firme bond to bee founde, then this of marriadge. For in all other contracts and bargaines wherein one man is obliged and bound vnto the other, the queſtion &amp; poynt is only of the goods and poſſeſſions of this world, and of ſuch things as are without the perſons which bargaine and contract together: or if the matter be touching the body, yet is not the obligation reciprocall, wherin the one party is as much intereſſed as the other: but may happily bee as far to the diſaduantage of the one, as the aduantage of the other: as for the contract of marriage, therein God himſelfe as principall author ſo dealeth, as that this bond continueth indiſſoluble, if himſelfe ſay not the word to the contrary, and breake this bond either by death or by any other his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. And agayne the obligation or bond of both parties is ſo mutuall and reciprocall, that neither of the parties is free and at his owne choyſe, and both of them become as it were one perſon by the coniunction of marriage. Now, which is more, the effect thereof is rather diuine then humane, to wit, the generation and procreation of mankind. For God by this contract vſeth men as his inſtruments to do that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to himſelfe, to wit, to the engendring of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, whereof his church is made and compoſed. For albeit this ordinaunce of God, <hi>Encreaſe and multiplie,</hi> be extended generally to all the creatures, compriſing man alſo in the number of them: yet notwithſtanding, as the creating of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both touching the male and touching the female, is other and different from that of the reſt of the creatures: euen ſo we muſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1883:10"/>
conclude that God hath led and conducted the race and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of mankinde from the father to the ſonne, to his effect by a ſpeciall and particular coniunction in wedlock, ſpecially ordayned and bleſſed by the inſpiration of his holy ſpirit and calling vpon of his name. The holy Ghoſt therefore mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to repreſent vnto vs, that which in it ſelfe is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, &amp; not to be conceiued, I mean that moſt ſtreit ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bond of Ieſus Chriſt, with euery faythfull ſoule, to the end to engender in the minds of the beleeuing (the aſſembly and congregation of whom is called the church) the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth, together with all other holy motions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, thereby to quicken and giue life to euery one of the faithfull wholy and entirely, and conſequently to his whole church and congregation in the true life which laſteth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, could not chuſe a more proper ſimilitude, nor a more liuely patterne and modell thereof then this coniunction of marriadge.</p>
            <p>And this is alſo the reaſon, why the word of God, which is receiued &amp; fructifieth by fayth, is by Saynt Peter called <hi>The incorruptible ſeede.</hi> Hereunto alſo tendeth that <hi>ſecond generation &amp; New-byrth,</hi> which is made by the ſpirit, whereof our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſo largely treateth with Nicodemus <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. which I will therefore declare vnto you and handle more at large, becauſe this ſecrete, whereof I now ſpeake, is the ground and foundation of our ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Euery one of vs then is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to confeſſe, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing commeth from God, whether we conſider the eſſence and being which all the creatures haue receiued of God, or the diuerſe qualities whereby they are mayntained. Which thing is ſignified vnto vs by the Apoſtle <hi>Act.</hi> 17. when he ſaieth, <hi>That in him we are, we liue and haue our mouing,</hi> as if God the Creatour did, as I may ſo ſay, inſinuate himſelfe within his creatures, to declare vnto vs the better, that diuine efficacie &amp; woorking of his, which is in them opened &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, according to that meaſure and durance it pleaſeth him: although to ſpeake properly, his diuine eſſence, bee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1883:10"/>
neither within, nor without the world, but comprehendeth all, it ſelfe being incomprehenſible. But there are two other manner of coniunctions, yea rather vnions of God with man, much different from that whereof I laſt ſpake, and of an effect of greater conſequence, to wit, firſt of all the vniting of the eternall ſonne of God with a true body and true humane ſoul in the wombe of the bleſſed Virgin Mary, by a perſonall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which to the Angels themſelues is incomprehenſible, by which, the word, which is the ſonne, eternall and coeſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the father, was made fleſh, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. in ſuch ſort that ſince, this perſon, which is called Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.16. is true God and true man, without any either ſeuering or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of the two natures: which is <hi>that great ſecret</hi> wherof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And vpon this dependeth a third coniunction of our <hi>Immanuel</hi> with the beleeuing, by the which euery faithfull perſon, and ſo conſequently the whole church which is compoſed of them, is ſpiritually as it were married with Ieſus Chriſt, and made fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones. Not that the body of Chriſt is really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our bodies, or his ſoule within our ſoule (which the truth and verity of his body and of his ſoule cannot ſuffer, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ſuch coniunction appertaineth any whit at all to this myſtery, which is altogether ſpirituall and tending to a ſpirituall life) but becauſe that as in an humane body, the ſoule, being naturally ioyned thereunto, quickneth and liueth all the members of the body, if ſo they be knit and ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether according to the frame and building of the body: ſo Ieſus Chriſt, as the ſpiritual bridegrome of his church, by the and vertue of his holy ſpirit, and by the meanes of his humane nature, by the which he ſymbolizeth, that is, agreeth in one part with vs, is ſo neare and ſo powerfully ioyned with vs, by the meanes of fayth which apprehendeth him, that he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to life eternall, working in our vnderſtanding and wil, to repaire in vs by little and little the image of God doone forth and defaced by ſinne, to make vs in the end perfit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his glorious immortality in the later day, vnto
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1883:11"/>
which the conſummation &amp; perfiting of this holy &amp; ſpirituall marriage is reſerued. Hence it is that the Apoſtle hath drawn theſe manners of ſpeaking, which he learned of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when he ſaith, <hi>That we are in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>and that Ieſus Chriſt is in vs.</hi> Rom. 8.10. <hi>That he liueth in vs, and wee in him.</hi> Gal. 2.20. and <hi>That he dwelleth in his ſayntes.</hi> Ioh. 14.23. And Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe to this end compareth himſelfe <hi>to a vine, and vs to the branches which fructifie and beare fruite.</hi> Ioh. 15. and <hi>his body is called our foode, and his blood our drinke.</hi> Ioh. 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as corporally by meate and drinke this preſent life is maintained in vs: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo by Ieſus Chriſt incorporating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in vs, in that maner I haue ſaid, and being as I may ſo ſay receiued, eaten, and digeſted by the inner man, we receiue and draw from him the true life euerlaſting. In the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore of this booke, there is no queſtion of bringing with vs vnto the vnderſtanding thereof a ſenſuall minde and carnall, but our ſoule muſt with Salomon conceiue this huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, this marriage, and whatſoeuer is ſayd thereof, after a ſpirituall faſhion, farre remoued from all carnall and filthy cogitations, remembring the ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>That hee which cleaueth vnto the lord is made one ſpirit with him.</hi> 1. Co. 6.17. &amp; that of Chriſt, <hi>That he which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit.</hi> Io. 3.6.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now to vnderſtand more particularly the order of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Canticle or ſong, we muſt know, that it is written in maner of a dialogue, many perſons being introduced in a moſt wonderfull and artificiall maner, ſpeaking and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one the other: to wit, a Bride addreſſing her ſpeach vnto her maidens, and a Bridegroome in like ſort accompanied with his friends: according to the manner vſed in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of ſuch fianſailes and eſpouſales as are honeſtly and orderly made. The ſpouſe or bride is the company of the faithful land beleeuing, which is called the Church, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it were in one only perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (as it is alſo ſaid that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haue but one hart, and one ſoule. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32) in the which company notwithſtanding Salomon bringeth one in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as it were in the name of the reſt of the train. But farther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1883:11"/>
ſeing he maketh a diſtinction between her, which ſpeaketh as the Queene &amp; miſtreſſe, and the other daughters &amp; maidens of Ieruſalem, (according to that which is written in the 45 <hi>Pſalme</hi>) we may vnderſtand by theſe other daughters, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well thoſe, which are in the church rather in name then in deede, as thoſe, which are the true faithfull, but are yet newe, and as it were litle children, which follow their mother, who is as it were a Queene accompanied and waited on with her damoyſels and maidens. On the other ſide the bridegrome is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whoſe friendes, in the treatiſe of this mariage, we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, firſt the bleſſed ſpirits, which haue at all times ſerued Ieſus Chriſt, and whoſe miniſtery he vſeth for the building of his church, as it is ſaide in the 34 <hi>Pſal.</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. as alſo the whole ſcripture ſheweth vs their effectes &amp; workings: ſecondly thoſe excellent archbuilders of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall temple of the church, I meane, the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. and <hi>Apocal.</hi> 21. thirdly the paſtors and teachers who painefully and faithfully trauaile <hi>for the preparing this holy Bride,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the company and aſſembly of the Sayntes,</hi> Ephe 4.12. We muſt farther note, that as in mariage there be three degrees, wherof the firſt is the ſtipulation and contracting, which we call fian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes or betrothings, during the which the parties are called the <hi>fiancer &amp; the fianced</hi>: afterward the ſolemne celebration of the mariage, at which day they are called <hi>the Bridegrome &amp; the Bride:</hi> &amp; laſtly the conſummation of the mariage, after which they are termed <hi>Man &amp; Wife:</hi> euen ſo in this ſpiritual mariage he hath as it were fianced &amp; betrothed to himſelf his church, by that promiſe of his made vnto Adam, concerning the ſeede of the woman, <hi>the which ſeede ſhould bruſe the head of the Serpent:</hi> which he afterward reconfirmed to Abraham, Iſaac and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. But he hath paſſed yet farther, when by eſtabliſhing of a Leuiticall prieſthoode and other types and ſhadowes of the promiſes of the goſpell, (<hi>the body and ſubſtance of which was in chriſt,</hi> Coloſ. 2.) he did as it were eſpouſe his Loue and fianced, howbeit in abſence, and as it were by ſubſtitutes. And this is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1883:12"/>
the cauſe why the Bride is firſt brought in by Salomon raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the deſire &amp; longing after of the reall &amp; perſonall preſence of this Bridegrome, who hauing in diuers ſorts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted &amp; ſtrengthened her by moſt certaine and aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his loue and goodwill, doth in the end preſent and yeelde himſelfe perſonally vnto her. Wherein Salomon doth prophetically foretel the manifeſtation of the ſonne of God in fleſh, and his real conuerſing among his owne: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but for a litle time, remitting the perfit and entire cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration &amp; conſummation of this holy &amp; more than holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, vntill the later day, in the heauens, <hi>when God ſhall bee all in all.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.28. and <hi>when it ſhall appeare, what the church is, which ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.2. This is it then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Bride aſpireth with a maruelous ardent deſire, to wit, vnto the firſt and ſecond actual comming of the Bridegrome: accordingly as it ſaide in S. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.17. and by S. Peter of the deſire of the ancient prophets. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. &amp; more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; expreſly by S. Paul <hi>deſiring to be diſlodged from this body, to be long agoe with Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 1.23. as all the true faithfull doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſire, &amp; that <hi>with vnſpeakable ſighings &amp; gronings,</hi> Rom. 8.26. demanding in their ordinary praier, the <hi>comming of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Neither doth Salomon in the meane while forget to ſpeake of the perſecutions which ſhould happen vnto the Church, euen by her owne, and the vocation of the gentiles, together with the moſt aſſured and excellent promiſes, with which the Bridegrome entertaining his Bride comforteth her by the often reiteration &amp; recitall of his moſt aſcerteined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, accompained with great ſpirituall bleſſing which are no leſſe than gages &amp; pledges vnto the Church of his ſecond moſt glorious and maieſticall comming.</p>
            <p n="6">6 This is then the ſumme and ſcope of this Canticle or ſong: which is therefore called the <hi>Canticle of Canticles, or Song of Songs</hi> either becauſe of the excellencie thereof aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſongs conteined in the ſcriptures (ſo far is it, that it ſhould be reiected) or for that it is compoſed of many Canticles or Songs, by reaſon of the perſons which anſwere one the other.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1883:12"/>
And becauſe no man ſhould doubt of the author or rather the pen-man of this treatiſe, it is ſaid expreſſely, <hi>that it is compoſed by Salomon:</hi> by Salomon, I ſay, when he was filled and repleniſhed with the wiſedome of God, and not then, when hee followed after his wantonneſſe and folly. In whoſe ſliding we muſt as it were in a looking-glaſſe beholde our ſelues, deſiring the Lord to grant vs his grace, ſo to profit in this Canticle, that we paſſe and ſurpaſſe herein Salomon himſelfe, keeping carefully in our harts, that which Salomon let ſlide out of his, except wee will ſay that in his olde age (which thing may in part be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the booke of the Preacher) hee had the gift of repentance, although the Scripture make no expreſſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, and that at the leaſt his Idolatries endured manie yeares after him.</p>
            <p n="7">7 How euer it be, not to ſtay long on this point, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the order of the three bookes of Salomon, we may ſay that <hi>in his Prouerbs</hi> hee teacheth men the true guiding &amp; direction of this life, in ſuch ſort, and after ſo familiar a maner, as if a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter were ſpeaking to his ſcholers in the ſchoole: Afterwarde in <hi>his Eccleſiaſtes, or the booke of the Preacher,</hi> hee leadeth vs as it were from the plain and champion country, vp to an high hill, cauſing vs thence, as from a more high and eminent place, to beholde the diuers turnings and windings, by the which men wander and goe aſtray, ſome after one faſhion, others after an other, declaring and ſhewing himſelfe, amidſt theſe waies &amp; laberinths, which is the true way, that we be not ſurpriſed and ouertaken with the vanitie of this worlde, but vſe and order our life in ſuch ſort, that it bee vnto vs the way, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto the true &amp; euer-during happines and felicity. Now laſtly in this Song or Canticle, thoſe whome hee hath in ſuch double wiſe inſtructed, he lifteth here aboue the cloudes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were rauiſhed with the conſideration &amp; contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe heauenly bleſſings, as if they were already dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, and inhabiting the heauens, or at the leaſt did alreadie knocke at the gates thereof. The which order of his booke, is by one of the auncient fathers reſembled, by way of allegory,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1883:13"/>
to the Temple of the Lorde built by the ſame Salomon: in the which was firſt, the vtter common court for the people, vnto which <hi>the booke of the Prouerbs</hi> may be compared: after that was the inner place, prouided for the Prieſtes: and laſtly the Sanctuarie called the holy of Holies. Euen ſo we may ſay, that the Church is as it were lead to enter into the Holy place by <hi>the booke of Eccleſiaſtes, called the Preacher,</hi> &amp; from thence by this Canticle or Song, brought euen to the entery in of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, or Holy of Holies, after hir bridegrome Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>who is firſt entered in thither, to dedicate vs the way,</hi> Heb. 9. <hi>&amp; there to prouide vs a place of abode,</hi> Ioh. 14. whereinto according to that praier and requeſt which he hath made to God the Father for this his bride, ſhe alſo might be receiued in hir time. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="8">8 It remaineth now that we come to the text of this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or Song, which we will not at this time beginne. Let vs in the mean time ſo heedefully conſider of theſe things which haue beene ſaid, that we make our profit by them, beſeeching him which hath ſhewed vs ſo great fauor, as to haue brought vs into his Church, out of the filthy pollutions of this world &amp; ſo many Idolatries and ſuperſtitions, that he will giue vs his ſpirite the better to conſider of, and to vnderſtand his holie Doctrine taught in his Church, that wee may profite thereby more and more in the knowledge and true feare of him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the bottomles depthes of his great mercies in this, that in ſteede of reiecting and caſting vs off, according to our merits, it hath pleaſed him to cleanſe vs from ſo many filthes and corruptions, to dedicate and conſecrate vs wholly vnto himſelfe, as a chaſt &amp; pure virgin. Wherefore let vs not grieue or make ſad the ſpirit of Sanctification, but contrary-wiſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to woorke mightily and power-fully in vs, waiting for his ſecond comming, which ſhall be the accompliſhment of that which we muſt preſently hope for.

It is then the <hi>Spouſe or Bride,</hi> which ſpeaketh to hir <hi>Bridegrome.</hi> For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of ſpeaking, whereas the ſpouſe ſaith not, <hi>Kiſſe me,</hi> but <hi>Let him kiſſe me,</hi> this is according to the vſe and cuſtome of that tongue wherein Salomon wrote, &amp; therefore letteth not, but that the ſpouſe addreſſeth hir ſpeach to hir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. But it may ſeeme ſtrange and litle ſeeming to this moſt chaſt and pure Virgine, that ſhee in this ſort beginneth firſt,

ſith honeſty it ſelfe preſcribeth &amp; commandeth in euery wel-ordered marriage, that the firſt words proceede from the man, and not from the maiden or woman which hee woeth. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that euen in deede ſo it is alſo in theſe ſpiritual fianſailes in reſpect of euery faithfull ſoule. For albeit the ſpouſe ſpake firſt in this place, as couering &amp; deſiring hir beloued, <hi>euen as the hinde brayeth after, and deſireth the refreſhing of the riuers of water.</hi> Pſal. 42.1. notwithſtanding we muſt take diligent heede how wee thinke, that this deſire of hers which opened the mouth, began from her. It is then the Bridegrome which hath ſpoken firſt vnto her, &amp; prepared her within to ſeeke and ſearch after him as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.10. <hi>I haue beleeued, &amp; therefore I haue spoken.</hi> And in an other place, <hi>With the heart a man beleeueth to righteouſnes, and afterward with the mouth he confeſſeth to ſaluation, Rom.</hi> 10.10.

Iohn. 4.10. and elected &amp; choſen vs, <hi>not in our ſelues</hi> (no more than hee hath made vs by our ſelues) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. <hi>but in his welbeloued:</hi> not that we were already holy, <hi>but that we ſhould be made holie,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4.

himſelfe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.11. The people is brought into the land of Chanaan, but it is being forced thither as it were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. The prophets haue ſpoken, but it was becauſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God was vpon them: the Apoſtles folowed Ieſus Chriſt, yea, but being then called, when they thought on naught elſe but their nets &amp; their fiſhing. Saint Paul was a choſen inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, but by a ſpecial &amp; ſingular grace, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was a blaſphemer &amp; perſecutor. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Briefly, to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, of euery one of vs which are here aſſembled, as it were out of al quarters of the world, euery man taking a view of himſelf, is there any one to be found, who can rightly and in conſcience ſay, that hee firſt knewe God, and hath firſt ſpoken vnto him? Nay let vs all on the contrary ſide proteſt and confeſſe before the face of the Lord, that which is ſpoken by Eſaie, namely, <hi>that hee hath made himſelfe to bee found of them which ſought him not.</hi> Eſay. 65.1. <hi>And who is he which hath giuen him firſt?</hi> Rom. 11.5. <hi>ſeeing we cannot of our ſelues, ſo much as think of the things of God.</hi> 2. Cor. 3.5. To return therefore to our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſpouſe ſpeaketh here, the Lord hauing firſt ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir in hir hart, according to that which is ſaid in the 51. <hi>Pſ. Open thou my lips, and they ſhal ſhew forth thy praiſe</hi>: to ſpeake in a woord, <hi>ſhe was drawen of God.</hi> Ioh. 6.44. to the end that euerie mouth ſhould be ſhut, to giue the glory only to God, as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beginning, midle, and end of our ſaluation. For howe could the ſpouſe ſigh after hir beloued, if ſhee were not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by faith of his loue towardes hir? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Now faith is not of our ſelues</hi>: Epheſ. 2.8. <hi>but it muſt bee giuen vs to beleeue.</hi> Phil. 1.29.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But let vs on the other ſide remember that which the ſpouſe teacheth vs by theſe words, namely, that the free loue of the Lord towardes vs, engender in vs that other loue, with which we loue God, and with which the faithfull loue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the Lord, things ſo linked &amp; knit togither, that they cannot bee ſeparated. For as this is a ſure teſtimony that wee are the ſonnes of God, if wee loue him: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.10. ſo againe the loue which we beare vnto God is ſhewed herein, that we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1883:15"/>
loue one another: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.20. as the Lord himſelfe ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aduertiſeth and warneth vs in that excellent laſt ſermon of his, which he made to his Diſciples going to his death: and which was afterward ſo many times reiterated by his welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Diſciple in his firſt general Epiſt. And the lord himſelfe ſaith in S. Luke. 7.47. of that poore woman which was ſuch a ſinner, <hi>that ſhe loued much:</hi> whence he would haue them to gather, <hi>that many ſinnes were pardoned hir.</hi> We alſo therefore on whom the Lord hath beſtowed ſo many tokens of his fauour and grace in this our time, let vs follow this aduertiſement, witneſſing by a true conuerſion vnto God, and as well by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of him, as mutual charity one to another, that we are in deed of the number of them whom he hath truly loued.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But now to come to the third point, let vs conſider what this ſpouſe demandeth. He vnto whom ſhe addreſſeth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth hir ſpeech, is exceeding rich, paſſing bountifull and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, hauing in his hand, al the goods and bleſſings both of this life which is preſent, and of that which is to come. Yet this ſpouſe deſireth and demandeth nothing elſe, but <hi>to be kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and kiſſed againe with the mouth of hir beloued:</hi> neither muſt we woonder at this familiar demand of hirs. For the ſpouſe, which is the Church of God, <hi>hath not receiued the ſpirite of feare by the condemnation of the Law,</hi> Rom. 8.15. but the aſſurance of that holy hardines and boldnes <hi>which doth thruſt vs forward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4.16. not for any opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſelues, but by an holy aſſurance grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on him which is our peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>as his ſpirit beareth vs witnes in our hearts,</hi> Gal. 4.6. yea ſo far as to verifie that which is ſaid, <hi>that the kingdome is euen as it were ſnatched &amp; caught away by violence,</hi> Mat. 11.12. the lord himſelfe yet ſuffering himſelfe to be as it were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in plaine wraſtling, <hi>by his Iſrael,</hi> according as it is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. Now touching <hi>this kiſſing</hi> which is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, wee haue to note that men by a certaine addreſſe and inſtinct of nature, to declare their mutual loue &amp; amity one towards an other, haue accuſtomably vſed certaine maners of outward actions, hauing ſome agreeablenes with the ſame
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1883:16"/>
thing which they would witnes to be within them, ſome after one faſhion, others after another. As for example, this cuſtome of putting off the cappe and vailing bonnet, this bending and bowing of the body, this kiſſing, in witnes of loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence one towards another, by which outward geſture a man maketh himſelfe inferiour to another to doe him curteſy. The like is that of giuing the hand one to another, to witneſſe that a man is ready to make mutual deliuery of his hart and al that he hath. But among all other geſtures kiſſing hath I know not how the moſt euident &amp; expreſſe repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which is within. For whereas the life conſiſteth in reſpiration and breathing, and that our breathing is by the mouth, kiſſing is a ſigne, that a man is ready to communicate and as it were to infuſe his own proper ſoul into his friend. And this hath beene vſed to be doone aboue all others amongſt the people of the Eaſt, and eſpecially among the people of God, yea in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtian Church both Eaſt and Weſt: witneſſe, that of Saint Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.16. and in many other his Epiſtles, as alſo in Saint Peter, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14. which thing as touching the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is yet obſerued among the Monkes, and in that which they cal <hi>the Pax</hi> in their great &amp; ſolemne maſſes in the popiſh Church, where in the mean while notwithſtanding, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the holy Supper, to the preparation whereof this kiſſing was vſed as a teſtimony of all true concord and mutual charity, is taken away and aboliſhed. But it is come to paſſe in this, as in many other auncient and laudable cuſtomes, which haue beene ſo villanouſly and filthily abuſed, that it is a very hard thing to vſe it holyly and ſincerely: for which cauſe alſo they may not be raſhly &amp; lightly brought in vſe again. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit notwithſtanding this holy ſpouſe in this place ſpeaketh of an holy and ſacred kinde of kiſſing and more chaſt a great deal without compariſon, than any kiſſe can be between any husband and wife, the chaſteſt that euer were, or poſſibly can be: vnderſtanding <hi>by this kiſſe</hi> a moſt certain and moſt euident teſtimony of hir hoped coniunction with hir beloued.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But wherefore <hi>will ſhe be kiſſed with the mouth of hir huſband,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1883:16"/>
ſeeing properly to ſpeake, there is no kiſſing but with the mouth? Let vs note here firſt of all, that hereby is ſhewen vs the ordinary meane by which God ioineth himſelfe vnto his Church, and his Church vnto him: which is by the preaching of his word acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with the vertue &amp; working of his holy ſpirit: which woord of his, is here vnderſtoode by the woorde <hi>Mouth,</hi> which is the inſtrument thereof: inſomuch that this word is called <hi>the power of God to ſaluation to euery one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth:</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>and the incorruptible ſeede of the Church.</hi> 1, Pet. 1.23. which is properly attributed vnto the holy ghoſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. but this is not all. For if we conſider very nearly of the whole matter, we ſhal finde that whereas the ſpouſe neuer wanted this word, without the which the church could be no church, it is euident that in this place ſhe dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ſome farther mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this. Therefore ſhe ſeemeth here thus to ſay, you haue ſaluted me hitherunto, and as it were kiſſed me with letters &amp; meſſages, but now I deſire and craue the preſence of your ſelfe in proper perſon, otherwiſe I cannot bee ſatisfied or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Although then the Lorde and Sauiour of the woorld hath from the beginning contracted himſelfe with his Church in the perſons of Adam and Eue, of and from whom he would haue it to be drawen and deſcended, and albeit he hath after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward renewed his fianſailes by other his promiſes reiterated, with Abraham, Iſaack, and Iacob, as with the fathers of the beleeuing, yet was this but a ſtipulation and contract of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by words of the future: and although afterward the fian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer Chriſt himſelfe, did as it were repreſent himſelfe in the ceremonial Lawe, by which he approched more nearer vnto his fianced, his Church, &amp; did as it were eſpouſe and marrie hir by words more plain and expreſſe, yet was it done (as ſaith the author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues) but after an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect maner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. &amp; by ſhadowes, <hi>the body and truth of which is Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe:</hi> Coloſ. 2.17. And this was ſufficient to ſaluation for the auncient fathers, by meanes of their faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the place of the bleſſed, is called <hi>the boſome of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> Luke 16.22. <hi>who ſaw the day of the Lord &amp; reioyced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at:</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1883:17"/>
Ioh. 5.56. yet neuertheleſſe this did not altogither ſatisfy &amp; content them, knowing that their hope reſpected that which was to be accompliſhed and fulfilled in his time, namely, then <hi>when the heire ſhoulde come himſelfe in perſon into his vineyearde,</hi> Mat. 21.38. And therefore our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10 24. <hi>Many kings and prophets haue deſired to ſee that which you haue ſeene, and haue not ſeene it, and to heare that which you heare, &amp; haue not heard it.</hi> The which thing is alſo witneſſed by Saint Peter, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. This is it then which the ſpouſe in this place mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as if ſhe ſhould ſay: O Lord my Sauiour &amp; my beloued, I haue receiued commendations inough, meſſages inough, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies inough, that thou wilt come in perſon, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh thy marriage: but when, when wil this bleſſed hour and time come, in the which thou wilt ioyne thy ſelfe really vnto me, with the chaſt &amp; holy kiſſes of thy own mouth? For in very truth it may and ought to be well ſaid, that the ſonne of God hath kiſſed vs, yea more than kiſſed vs, by ioining himſelfe in ſuch wiſe and ſo near vnto vs, that the man whom he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto himſelfe, is not only the image of God his Creator, as was the firſt Adam, but is true God &amp; true man in one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perſon: and that in ſuch ſort, that this ioining and vniting himſelfe with our nature neither is nor ſhall bee euer ſeuered or broken: by this means his mouth hath euer, &amp; doth yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, as it were glued vpon ours, by this holy kiſſe of his.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But yet this is not inough to vnderſtand this holie <hi>kiſſe</hi> which the ſpouſe doth ſo wiſh for and deſire. For albeit the ſon of God, which is this Bridegroome, hath taken vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe this nature common to al mankinde, yet hath he not kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed al men. No: but his church only, his only ſpouſe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not one fleſh with euery woman, nor eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry woman with euery man: but beſides the humane nature which is in general commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them both, there muſt be alſo a ſpeciall coniunction between them of bodies, to haue one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made one fleſh with one woman: ſo to haue Ieſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Bridegrome of his Church, and ſo <hi>to make her fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones,</hi> as it is ſpoken, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. there muſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1883:17"/>
be between him and his Church a matrimonial coniunction, whereof the ſpouſe ſpeaketh in this place.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now touching this ſpirituall contract, the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine teacheth vs two degrees thereof. The firſt in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, which is made by the promiſe of the Bridegroome, and receaued by faith of the ſpouſe: the inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the Goſpell, which is preached vnto vs, the ſeales are Baptiſme, and principally the Supper of the Lorde. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree whereunto we aſpire and contend, is this real &amp; entire actual vnion, whereunto we ſhal come in the later day, when that which we are already by hope neither vain nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine ſhalbe then perfitly effectuated: then, I ſay, <hi>When wee ſhall ſee him, as he is.</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.2. when <hi>God ſhalbe al in al,</hi> 1. Co. 15.28. when <hi>we ſhall know no longer in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>but ſhalbe eternally with him.</hi> 1. Theſſ. 4.17.</p>
            <p>Furthermore when the ſpouſe ſpeaketh here not ſimply of one <hi>kiſſe</hi> but <hi>of the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> ſhe declareth that ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth not this comming only of his in fleſh into the earth: albeit ſhee knewe that the bridegroome ſhould then come in perſon, but wiſheth and deſireth kiſſe vppon kiſſe, knowing that this corporall preſence of his here belowe, ſhould endure but a ſmall time, and that the place of the true conſummation of this marriage is not in earth, but in heauen, in which this king ſhould crowne his ſpouſe, making hir partaker of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, according to that petition and requeſt of his made vnto the father: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>that whither he went, thither we might alſo come.</hi> She knew, I ſay, that this her beloued ſhould come downe to the earth, not to ſtay here himſelfe, but <hi>to draw vs after him into heauen: Ioh.</hi> 12.32. <hi>being gone himſelfe before to prepare a place</hi> for this wedding: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.12. And therefore not content with one kiſſe, ſhe aſpireth and haſteth to this later day, ſtaying no whit in the mid-way: as the Lord himſelfe alſo teacheth vs to pray euery hour, &amp; euery moment, <hi>that his kingdom come,</hi> calling alſo this day <hi>the day of our deliuerance,</hi> at the approching &amp; drawing neare whereof, <hi>we are warned to lift vp our heades:</hi> Luk. 21.28. This is that deſire which made the Apoſtle to cry out, <hi>miſerable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1883:18"/>
man that I am, who ſhal deliuer me from this body of death?</hi> Rom. 7.24. &amp; in another place, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt:</hi> Phil. 1.23. confeſſing that <hi>hee had not yet obtained the price, but that he ſtil ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth after it,</hi> Phil. 3.13. yea which more is, the ſame Apoſtle is elſewhere accuſtomed to ſet downe three degrees, before he come to the higheſt of his deſire, put off and delaied to this latter day, <hi>vnto the which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the crown of righteouſnes is kept and reſerued for me:</hi> 2. Tim. 4.8. The firſt degree is when the Bridegrome chriſt ioyneth himſelfe vnto vs in this life by his holy ſpirit: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.23. the ſecond is at our departing out of this world, waiting for the later day. For albeit at their depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this world the ſpirits of the faithful are gathered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, &amp; as it were kiſſed in perſon by the ſonne of God their beloued, according to the ſaying of Ieſus to that poore theefe on the croſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. and the praier of Saint Stephen, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. yet notwithſtanding one part of vs, to witte, the body ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the duſt &amp; ignominy of death, theſe ful kiſſes are reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted &amp; delayed vntil this later day, when we ſhall meet him, &amp; he meet vs with this bleſſed ſpeach, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi> For then ſhal it be, when the bridegroome comming, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ſhal go to meete him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.6.</p>
            <p>Farther, though we reſpected onely this preſent ſtate here below, yet muſt we obſerue, that the ſpouſe, when ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and craueth not <hi>one kiſſe but many kiſſes of her beloued,</hi> ſhee deſireth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance &amp; encreaſe of faith, hope &amp; charity, &amp; al other graces neceſſary to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And for this cauſe is the life of a chriſtian compared to a race, in which we muſt run ſtil on forward to the end of the liſt where the crown is: as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in many places warneth vs, as elſewhere he alſo ſaith, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt muſt grow in vs, and we in him:</hi> Phil. 3.12. Eph. 4.13.</p>
            <p n="8">8 To go on, although the ſpouſe ſpeake not here of <hi>kiſſing,</hi> but of <hi>being kiſſed</hi>; notwithſtanding, whereas the one cannot be done without the other, we muſt know that it is our duety alſo to kiſſe the Bridegroome: but wee muſt kiſſe in being our ſelues kiſſed, otherwiſe our kiſſes would be foul and vncleane,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1883:18"/>
if they either ſhould begin, or ende in our ſelues, as are all the worſhippings &amp; ſeruices of God, which come out of the forge of mens braynes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 29.13. yea all thoſe morall and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall vertues which proceede from elſe-where, than from the ſpirit of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. ſeeing, which more is, euen the kiſſes of the Bride, kiſſed by hir Bridegrome, though they be reciprocal, are notwithſtanding very vnequal in quality vnto thoſe of hir Bridegrome. For the kiſſes of the ſpouſe are of no valewe in themſelues, and that it pleaſeth the Bridegrome to approue and like of them, proceedeth of his onely fauour and grace.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Now in kiſſing this bridegrome, to doe him that fealty &amp; homage (which the greateſt monarcks of the worlde, as it is in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. owe him) we may not be ſo preſumptuous &amp; malapert as to hoiſe our head vp at the firſt to kiſſe his mouth, but wee muſt beginne at his feete, after the example of that poore ſinnefull woman, who waſhed them with her teares, &amp; wiped them with the haire of hir head, &amp; annointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hir ſweete oyntment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.38. being hir ſelfe firſt inwardly annoynted by him. We muſt therefore begin our kiſſing with a true acknowledgement of our ſinnes, after the example of the poore Publicane (daring not to approch at the firſt, but ſtanding a farre off) <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. and thence bringing that <hi>contrite hart which is neuer deſpiſed of God, but is a ſacrifice vnto him of a ſweet ſmell.</hi> Pſalme 51.17. we muſt ſo come vnto his feete, and finally demaunde in faith with this ſpouſe, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs to the kiſſing of his holy mouth, from which we ſhall heare this moſt precious ſpeach, <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> to be brought in the end to the true conſummation of this holy coniunction.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Laſtly, to come vnto the fourth poynt, wee muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and note after what maner of faſhion theſe kiſſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, namely with a moſt full and liuely affection of a moſt aſſured faith, and with ſo ardent a zeale and deſire, as none can be greater. And this ſheweth the fruit which the ſpirit of God bringeth forth in vs, by this repentance of which I ſpake, I

meane a true aſſurance of conſcience throughly pacified and quieted, then, when by the grace &amp; fauor of god apprehended by a true and liuely faith, we are reſolued of the loue of God, by the teſtimony and witnes of his ſpirit of adoption, teaching vs what God hath determined of vs, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. the which gift of God is ſuch, that it is neuer altered or changed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22. ſo that we can neuer be ſeparated or remooued from this loue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.

Nether may we here alleage that we haue renounced our idolatry to kiſſe the Bridegroome, for the moſt dangerous kind of Idolatry, which is inuiſible, raigneth yet in the midſt of vs. Nowe it is nothing to haue renounced Sathan &amp; ſuperſtition, if we put not on Ieſus Chriſt. We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las a great part of vs of the number of them, of whom the lord ſpeaketh by <hi>Eſay,</hi> 29.13. <hi>This people honoureth me with their lippes, but their hart is far from me.</hi> And this is called the kiſſe of Ioab when he killed Abner, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.27. and the kiſſe of Iudas, not the kiſſes which are here deſired, and mutually giuen of the ſpouſe: agreeable with that of Dauid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. <hi>that his ſoul, like vnto the poore hinde which panteth after the waters, longeth after the liuing God.</hi> For, to attaine vnto this coniunction, we are not to keepe our ſelues from al ſuch thoughts, words, and deedes, by the which the holy ſpirite, which teacheth vs to ſigh after this Bridegroome, is manifeſtly made ſad and grieued, and in the end chaſed and driuen out of the midſt of vs, whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that the later eſtate is made worſe than the firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. as alas wee ſee too many examples thereof at this day before our eies: but wee muſt ſtand alſo diligently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our gard, to take heed that theſe kiſſes do follow one vpon another in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual tenour &amp; train, after that god of his grace hath begun once to be working in vs: for our enemy is crafty and ſubtil, and can, to ſurpriſe and ſnare vs, ſerue his turne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with thoſe graces and bleſſinges which God beſtoweth on vs, to make them ſo many inſtruments to our ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For who is he, which hauing ſayd or done any thing but ſome thing well, is not incontinently tempted with an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1883:20"/>
opinion of himſelfe? Ye ſee then how ſoone al is marred, if we ſtand not carefully vpon our gard. Abraham and Sara had a ſingular deſire of ſeeing the race and ſeede which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, neither were they without a true and liuely faith, without which they had not ſo carefully looked for it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Sathan in his ſcout watch, who beſtirreth himſelfe ſo wel, that amidſt this faith, he ſoweth ſo great impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that there is nothing wanting on the part of Abraham &amp; Sara, that they be not depriued of their longing, thorough their owne great fault and folly. For what doth Sara? Shee perſwadeth her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to take Agar the bond maid, to haue of her this iſſue and ſeede, of whom Iſmael is borne, the perſecutor of Iſaack the child of promiſe and only heire thereof. Look we likewiſe on Rebecca, who beleeued that which was tolde her of her two children, being yet in her womb, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. notwithſtanding being narrowly watched &amp; ſnared by Sathan, when ſhe ſaw Iſaacks intent and purpoſe was to bleſſe Eſau: it wanted not through her impatience, that al was not ouerthrown &amp; turned vpſide down, as it had indeed notoriouſly come to paſſe, had not God by his grace &amp; holy ſpirit gouerned Iſaak in the end &amp; iſſue of this matter. And among other cauſes we muſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally attribute the great afflictions, which after befell Iacob menaced by his brother, to this ſlie touch of hers, though God drew light out of darknes. Wee haue hereof alſo a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in Martha the Siſter of Marie, who not knowing how to gouern and rule in good ſort that good and holy deſire ſhe had of receiuing and well entertaining of Chriſt in her houſe, choſe not the better part, but that, for which ſhee was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.42. Let vs therefore all of vs little and great be careful, not only to demand of God his graces and bleſsinges, but alſo that principall grace which gouerneth all the reſt: as we here ſee that the ſpouſe ſpeaketh not ſimply of one kiſſe, but of <hi>kiſſes</hi> in the plural number, and addeth moreouer <hi>of his Mouth:</hi> to teach vs that to come vnto this ſo much deſired coniunction wee muſt demaund of God grace vpon grace, which graces doe truly part from his mouth, being not onely
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1883:20"/>
produced, but alſo entirely gouerned by his ſpirit, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie mixture of our leauen. As for example, conformably to that which I euen now alleadged of Martha, you the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful the magiſtrates are much buſied &amp; encombred in the diſpatch of ciuil cauſes and adminiſtring of Iuſtice vnto euery man (which is an holy vocation and calling, with which the Lord hath honoured you, wherein I beſeech him to graunt you his grace to beare your ſelues wel, &amp; vprightly, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.) But if you ſo imploy your ſelues herein, that the deſire you haue to doe iuſtice in ciuill cauſes, cauſe theſe roomes to be voide which ought to be filled with your perſons, to heare the woord of God, which ſhould rule and direct you in your charge: this is called vnder the colour of doing well, to forget the chiefe &amp; principal buſines. Again, behold a preacher which wil be diligent and painful at his ſtudy, to prouide wherewith to feede his ſheepe. This is a moſt holy &amp; neceſſary deſire: but if he giue himſelfe in ſuch ſort to his booke, that while he is at his ſtudy, Satan catcheth one of his ſheep, this is not to do the duty of a paſtor or ſheepheard, who ſhuld not only attend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reading, according to the admonition of Saint Paul: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. but alſo to watching ouer his flock, both in general &amp; in particular, according to the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of our Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.26. Behold likewiſe an houſholder &amp; houſwife, who is careful to trauel according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of god for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of hir family: look on an honeſt mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to folow his calling in a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, for the profit of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weal (which is a thing very rare &amp; ſeldom in this world) theſe are holy &amp; honeſt deſires: but if to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on theſe things, a man be then at his ſhoppe, when hee ſhould be at a ſermon, to doe better: this is nothing elſe but to do euil, when we think to do our duty. And therfore I ſay again, that we muſt be watchfull &amp; ſtand vpon our gard, to deſire aboue al things, <hi>the kiſſes of the mouth of the Lord:</hi> &amp; that with a pure, holy, &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered affection, after the example of this ſpouſe, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lord of his grace conforme vs: which thing we wil demaund of him ſaying,</p>

And therfore the faithful ſoule which is here brought in, to ſhewe vs what and how ardent the true affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faithful ſoule is towards God, began her ſpeech with the teſtimony of her extreme deſire ſhee hath to bee ioyned moſt neerely with Ieſus Chriſt her Bridegroome, to wit, to be vnited altogether vnto him, yea to be as it were with him, to ſerue &amp; to honor him with al her hart &amp; al her might. And this is alſo the true, the right and the laſt end and ſcope of not only all our actions, but alſo of our whole vnderſtanding and will, to the end that we may ſay with the Apoſtle, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt liueth in vs and we in him:</hi> Gal. 2.20. So then as among all the reſt of the affections, loue is the moſt ardent, ſo are the effects thereof moſt vehement, according to the ſaying of Chriſt:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1883:23"/>
               <hi>Where the treaſure is, there is the hart alſo,</hi> Luk. 12.34. but al lieth in this poynt, that a man loue that which he ought to loue, and ſo as he ought to loue. And this is it wherein men do ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiue them ſelues, louing that which they ſhould hate, &amp; hating that which they ſhould loue: or if happily they loue that which they ſhould loue, or hate that which they ſhoulde hate, yet not louing nor hating in ſuch ſort and ſo far as they ought, but euer either more or leſſe then they ought, or for ſome other end then they ought.</p>
            <p n="7">7 To correct therefore al theſe defaults, the ſpouſe teacheth vs here firſt by her own example, that it is God alone, to ſpeak properly, whom wee ought to loue, without giuing anie part of our hart to any other thing whatſoeuer. Which thing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelfe may in general teach vs, how corrupt and peruerſe ſo euer it be. For there are two things which naturally drawe men to loue, to wit, beuty and vertue: which if a man will not bee deceiued, muſt neuer bee ſeparated, witnes the common prouerb, That a fayre feature with foule conditions is nothing worth, beuty by it ſelfe being nothing elſe, but a vaine bayte and allurement, which draweth to an euil end. Now wee muſt of neceſſity confeſſe that God alone is properly beutifull and good, yea beuty and vertue or goodnes it ſelfe in infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſeeing whatſoeuer is good and beutifull among the creatures, is but a ſmall glimmering beame of that which is wholy entire and eſſential in the Creator.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But becauſe that God is incomprehenſible not onely to our outward ſenſes, ſo that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither ſee, nor hear, nor taſt, nor ſmell, nor touch him, but alſo to our vnderſtanding: it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that it may be thence concluded, that therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any way neither know, nor loue him, ſeing we muſt know him before we loue him, nor by conſequent ſerue him aright; whence it would follow, that our faith and hope are thinges vaine and friuolous, which would bee the ouerthrowing of all religion. You ſee then why this matter is to be vnderſtood yet more clearely. The Scripture therefore teacheth vs that the Creator hauing created al things for his glo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 16.4.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1883:24"/>
that is to ſay, to be thereby glorified (which could not be if he made not himſelfe to bee in ſome ſort knowen by them) hath not made notwithſtanding al creatures capable of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but only Angels and men. As for the Angels we wil not ſpeak of them in this place. But touching men, Moſes ſheweth vs by this word of image and likenes of God, according to the which he ſaith that God created man, that the Lord creating the ſoule of the firſt man engraued togither in his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a marueilous light and knowledge naturally infuſed, to know his Creator, and that in a very high degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and likewiſe a moſt excellent vprightnes and integrity in will, to haue no affection whatſoeuer which were not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the nature and will of God, perfectly iuſt and perfectly good. The which thing is expounded by the Apoſtle by the words of truth in vnderſtanding, and of righteouſneſſe in will, when hee declareth what was this image and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of god, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. &amp; al this that God might be known and glorified by him. Beſide theſe two graces the Creator had alſo engraued in all his creatures innumerable teſtimonies both of his infinit wiſedome and liberality, and of al other his perfections, in yealding the gouernment of them next vnder himſelf vnto man, as hauing made them for his vſe, as is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among other places in the eight Pſalme: to the ende that this knowledge of God, and vprightnes of affection might by the obiect of the creatures bee maintained and confirmed in man, hauing alwaies before his eies ſo many mirrours or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes to behold the perfections in God, as were creatures in the world: and ſo many teſtimonies of the goodness of God towardes him, as were creatures made for the vſe of man, and ſubiected to his gouernment. And of this it followeth, that man is not only bound to giue God thanks for that which he hath receiued from him, in himſelfe, but alſo for all the giftes which God hath beſtowed vpon all other creatures for man, which are as it were preachers of the glory of God vnto men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and if they had vnderſtanding and mouthes, woulde cry with a loud voice, both aboue and below ſaying, Yee men,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1883:24"/>
for whom we are made, thank God for vs, glorifie him in vs: Whereas ſince the fal of man, by the ſinne of whom they haue beene brought to this miſerable eſtate whereunto they haue been ſubiect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. they cry and demaund vengeaunce of god, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. The creatures therefore being faire &amp; good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one in his degree, as Moſes alſo diſtinctly ſpecifieth the ſame in the hiſtory of the creation, and as I haue ſaid, beautie and goodnes beeing the obiects of dilection, it followeth that man naturally before his fall (which was alſo requiſite for the right gouernment of al thoſe thinges which were committed vnto him, ſeeing none taketh pleaſure to maintaine and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne that which he hateth) bare an affection vnto al the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, but yet ſo, that in the beuty and goodneſſe of them, he did contemplate the author and giuer, and therefore by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent loued not, to ſpeake properly, the creatures, but the Creator in contemplating and beholding the creatures.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Now ſeeing that loue and hatred are ſo directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that the one putteth forth the other, it muſt needes bee that man before his fall hated that which was foule and ill, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee loued that which was fayre and good. But, howe can this be true, whereas before the fall of man all was faire and good in the worlde, as the Lord had made it? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. I anſwere, that truly ſeeing there was nothing foule or euill in the worlde, man before his fall hated nothing, but loued his Creator in all things. But ſeeing he was endewed with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to knowe wherein he ought to loue his Creator, hee had alſo in himſelfe the meane to know, that he ought to hate the contrary if he ſhould meete with it: as indeede alas he met it with a miſchiefe, when Satan (which remaining not in his firſt eſtate had made himſelfe moſt fowle and moſt wicked) diſcouered himſelfe inough vnto him for ſuch a one as he was, and moſt worthy to be hated and reiected, when in tempting of him, he accuſed the creator of enuy and lying. And behold here wherein Eue, and after her Adam did faile inexcuſably, to wit, that in ſteede of vſing that addreſſe and helpe which they had to know well enough and to hate this deceiuer, they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1883:25"/>
ſuffered themſelues to be perſwaded of him, &amp; ſo enthralled and captiuated themſelues with all their poſterity in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. which maketh that he is now moſt blinde and moſt bad together in louing and in hating.</p>
            <p n="10">10 For if we examine the whole courſe and traine of the worlde, what ſhall wee finde els, but ſome deceiued in the difference betweene good and faire, and euill and foule: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wittingly louing that which is worthy of hatred, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which they ought to loue? For example, if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion bee touching that which directly concerneth the loue and ſeruice of God, behold the ſuperſtitious and Idolaters ſo bewitched, that not only they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, nor wil not know &amp; loue the truth, but they ſtop their cares that they may not heare, &amp; their eyes that they may not ſee, and which more is, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute it with fire and ſword. Behold on the other ſide the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts and mockers of all religion, with which the whole world at this day ſtinketh, the earth it ſelfe demaunding ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God. If we ſpeake of the life of men towardes men, and conſider whereunto all apply and giue themſelues great and ſmall from morning to euening, we ſhall finde that ſome burſt with the plenty and abundance they haue, and would ſel paradiſe out of hand for a lickerous morſel, others trauaile not to ſerue God by their life, but only to maintaine this life, fearing they ſhould die for famine, and will not ſtick, ſo they may ſaue a farthing, to looſe their ſoul, &amp; the word of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: others poſſeſſe not their goods, but are poſſeſſed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in body &amp; in ſoul, others welter and walowe like hogs in their wanton luſtes, others are inſatiable in ſwallowing downe of honour to fil themſelues with wind, others giue themſelues to ten thouſand vanities, as this wiſe king Salomon himſelfe hath at large declared in his booke of the Preacher. In a word, ſee how by not louing and hating as they ought, euery man departeth out of this life, without knowing, or without well thinking thereon, what he came hither to do.</p>
            <p n="11">11 You ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what this euil is &amp; what is the original cauſe therof. But what remedy is there? To haue recourſe vnto him

Which ſeeing it is ſo, let vs conſider what this perfect loue and charitie of ours ought to be towardes God and our neighbour, the portraiture whereof, is ſet down in the two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Lawe, and hath too in ſome ſort beene knowen &amp; marked by a Painim, ſaying, (in ſpeaking of the mutuall frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of men,) that true and perfect loue and frindſhip is ſhewn in this, that the one deſireth that which the other deſireth, and wil not that which the other wil not, which is as much to ſay, that hee loueth that which the other loueth, and hateth that which the other hateth. This is an excellent rule to direct our whole life by, if we take the Lawe of God for the ground and foundation of that which wee ought to loue and to hate, and by conſequent preſuppoſe, that the will of the Bridegroome which is the head, whoſe wil is declared in his Lawe, giueth a Law vnto the wil of the ſpouſe, witnes that which we craue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day in our praier, ſaying, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi>

what meaneth this? Was there a ſtrife and rebellion betweene the wil of Ieſus Chriſt and the wil of God his Father? None at all. For were it ſo, hee coulde not haue beene either God, or ſo much as a good man, much leſſe our Sauiour, as indeede and truth he is. For as much then as the perſon of the father and of the holy Ghoſt, and his, are one and the ſame God, his wil alſo is one &amp; the ſame wil with the father &amp; the holy ghoſt. And in aſmuch as he is man he had another wil, as it were another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but without all repugnancy notwithſtanding againſt his diuine wil. Who is it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſpeaketh thus? Ieſus chriſt, God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but according to his humanity: againſt which diſtinctly this combat was addreſſed, becauſe it was in it, that he ſhould make his combat and ouercome as it were himſelfe, in aſmuch as he is God the iudge and reuenger of ſinne, in ſuch ſort that in one perſon alone, he is aſſailed and aſſaulted, and is alwaies conquerour. And what cauſed him ſo to ſpeak? Not any rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of his humane wil againſt his diuine wil, but only a diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity proceeding from the apprehenſion of that moſt frightfull and moſt horrible feeling of the curſe &amp; malediction of God, againſt al the ſinnes of the elect, which he had vpon himſelfe, although he had no blemiſh at al in himſelfe: an apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notwithſtanding entirely ſubiecting it ſelfe vnto the will of God, and in euery point wel ordered and gouerned. And if the Bridegroome ſpeake thus beeing altogither perfect, what muſt the Bride and ſpouſe doe, in whom this orderlineſſe and good regiment of wil is ſcarcely begun?</p>
            <p n="13">13 Behold therefore, I ſay, why this change, by which it is giuen vnto this Bride to loue that which her Bridegroome lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and to hate that which he hateth, is not a woorke of an hour, not of a day, not of a month, not of a year, but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all combat, ſo long as life laſteth betweene the ſpirit of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, and the fleſhe of him which remaineth ſtill in his old skin. And therefore this which the ſpouſe here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſhall tell vs heareafter of the affection which ſhe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto her Bridegroome, in whom ſhee ſeeketh her whole reſt and contentment, is not fainedly ſpoken or in hypocriſie,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1883:26"/>
for the Church is not the ſchoole of fainedneſſe &amp; hypocriſie, but of truth and ſyncerity. But this ought to bee vnderſtood, as of her in whom ſinne raighneth no more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. and yet leaueth not to be in her notwithſtanding, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17.18. &amp; to fight as much as it is able againſt the ſpirite, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle himſelf one of the moſt perfecteſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; chaſt ſpouſe may be more than a ſufficient witnes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto vs, crying out <hi>that hee doth yet the euil which hee would not doe, and doth not that good which he would doe</hi>: and againe crying forth, <hi>miſerable man that I am, who ſhal deliuer me from this mortall body,</hi> Rom. 7.19.24. Let vs therefore confeſſe, that through the grace of God, this ſpouſe, which is the company of the true faithful, is reformed, both in her vnderſtanding, to diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that which is good and that which is euill, and in her affections to loue &amp; folow after that which is good, &amp; to hate and fly that which is euil: but yet notwithſtanding ſhee muſt ſtil growe both in this knowledge from faith to faith <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.10. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and in the practiſe not onely of louing and of hating rightlie and ſoundlie, but alſo ſo far and in ſuch meaſure as ſhe ought, the which thing is eſpecially hard to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Yet is it an eaſie matter to know it, to wit, that ſeeing a man muſt loue God with al his hart, he may not diuide &amp; part this dilection to other things: and touching the loue due vnto a mans neighbour, being loued next after God, and for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience we owe vnto God, this dilection is nothing elſe, but a ſtreame flowing from the fountaine of that loue due entirely vnto God alone, and not, to ſpeak properly, another dilection, for which our heart is parted and diuided into two. For God which is iealous of his ſpouſe and of his glory, wil haue either all or none. That which I ſpeake of our neighbour, yea of all men, ought to be practiſed towards all the creatures made for our vſe, vnto the which we muſt take heede we transferre not our loue, as the couetous doe which make an idol of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. The riotous and gluttons which haue no other God but their belly, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.19. and in generall all

thoſe which make their ſoule &amp; their body to ſerue any other creature, according vnto their paſſions and luſts, in ſteede <hi>of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with giuing of thanks,</hi> praiſing and bleſſing the Lord in them: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. and keeping our ſelues from all diſorder and vnmeaſurablenes, be it in quantity, or in quality, or principally in the end &amp; ſcope of the right vſage of them, which is the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of god,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. as wee are warned by diuerſe aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſowed here and there, touching this point, throughout the Scriptures. Thus you ſee what this dilection is of the true ſpouſe, addreſſing and turning her hart thither, where her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, according to that meaſure of grace which is beſtowed vpon her.</p>
            <p n="15">15 But what ſhal we ſay of the hatred which is ioyntly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to loue &amp; dilection? It is eaſy to vnderſtand, that we muſt aſmuch hate that which is euil, as loue that which is good. But whereas euil is not a creature of God, but a vitious quality fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len on that which was created good, we muſt put a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the Creature and the vice, as much, I ſay, as may and can bee put. This I adde, becauſe of one creature, the which is ſo corrupted, and ſo far curſed of God, becauſe it hath beene the original and ſpring of al vice and of al euil, as wel in it ſelfe as in man, and conſequently of ſinne and of death: that it is, and ſhal euer be worthy of all hatred and execration, I meane the Diuel and his Angels. And behold my brethren, behold him which being perpetual enemy of this Bridegrome <hi>who hath bruſed his head</hi>: Gen. 13.15. and troden it vnder his owne feete and vnder the feete of his ſpouſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. and ſeeking nothing elſe but as a <hi>greedy Lion to</hi> deuour vs: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. this <hi>old red Dragon</hi> I ſay, purſuing this ſpouſe with al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of rage, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.3. this is he whom we muſt hate with an irreconciliable hatred, this is hee againſt whom wee muſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour our ſelues with al the pieces of our armour: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.13. and 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.8. in a word this is he whom wee muſt perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deteſt and abhor.</p>
            <p n="16">16 As for the other creatures there is choyce to be made. For firſt becauſe man alone amongeſt all the creatures is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

It is alſo true that the Law of frindſhip requireth, that a man be a frind of his frinds frinds, and an enemy of his frindes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But becauſe that God of his infinit goodneſſe would not adiudge euerie man particularly vnto euerlaſting deſtruction, as he hath done Satan &amp; the Angels his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe would draw his ſpouſe &amp; his Church out of this corrupt maſſe, in ſuch maner as I haue before ſpoken: &amp; thereupon we cannot (&amp; therefore conſequently we ought not) but by very vncertain preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s diſcern thoſe, which he hath deſtinated or not deſtinated vnto this fauour: therefore leauing vnto God his ſecret iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, we muſt indeed be frinds vnto the frinds, &amp; conſequently enimies vnto the enimies of our beloued, but indefinitely: that is to ſay, without giuing of ſentence of this man, or that man to ſet &amp; ſort him among the nomber of the reprobat.

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this holy ſpouſe hauing opened &amp; declared hir ſo ardent affection, addeth now, that it is not without iuſt cauſe that ſhe maketh no reckoning of whatſoeuer withholdeth men heere below, in compariſon of him, whom ſhe deſireth and longeth after, becauſe ſaith ſhe, there is nothing of ſo good and ſweete a ſmell as hee, whoſe <hi>perfume</hi> ſhee and hir companions ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whereupon we are before all other thinges to note that ſhe vſeth this woord of <hi>perfumes,</hi> hauing regard properly and ſpecially to the perfumes ordained and appointed in the Law. For albeit the vſe of theſe precious perfumes were fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al times vſuall and accuſtomable among the people of the Eaſt, which is to be ſeen aſwel by ſacred as profane hiſtories, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the ſpouſe had not properly reſpect vnto this, but to that ſacred perfume which was in ſuch ſort compoſed of earthlie ſweets, that notwithſtanding the receit &amp; compoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came not from man, but was expreſly preſcribed of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23. with an expreſſe forbiddall of applying it to anie vſe elſe ſaue <hi>to the holy &amp; ſacred ſeruice of God</hi>: Exod. 30.32. This <hi>perfume</hi> therefore was a ſacrament and diſtinguiſhed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfumes, as the water of Baptiſme is diſtinguiſhed from common water, and the Bread and Wine of the holy Supper of the Lord from common bread and wine, I meane in reſpect of the vſe: the ſignes alwaies remaining in reſpect of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſubſtance and matter entirely as before. This ſacrament, I ſay, as al other ſacraments, was compoſed of a ſigne and of a thing ſignified, ſacramentallie ioyned &amp; vnited, that is to ſay,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1883:29"/>
by a ſignification tending not onlie to repreſent and bring to our minde the thing ſignified, but alſo to aſſure vs, that that which was ſo ſignified to our external ſenſes, was certainly &amp; truly preſented and giuen vnto euery faithful ſoule. And this is the cauſe why the name &amp; effect of the thing ſignified are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attributed vnto the ſigne: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>outward Baptiſme,</hi> is called <hi>the waſhing away of our ſinnes,</hi> Act. 22.16. which is properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto <hi>the inwarde waſhing, which is made by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.2. and Mat. 3.11. as alſo the names <hi>of the body giuen for vs, and of the bloode ſhedde for vs,</hi> are attributed to the bread and wine of the holy Supper in the inſtitution thereof. So alſo in this place, he that was ſignified in Salomons time, by theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>perfumes,</hi> namely Ieſus Chriſt, is called by the name of <hi>perfume</hi> and that in the plurall number, for the reaſon which I ſhall tell you anon. It is then the Bridegroome of the Church and of euery faithful ſoul, of whoſe <hi>perfumes</hi> it is here ſpoken, and not of any other: according to that which is ſaid of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>that he is the body and ſubſtance of al the ſhadowes of the Law.</hi> Coloſ. 2.17. the perfections of whome beeing without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and moſt excellent in the ſoueraigne degree, are ment by theſe <hi>perfumes</hi> in the plural number.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now Ieſus Chriſt being true God and true man, this is a thing without all doubt, that in reſpect of his diuinity he is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, and of whatſoeuer we can imagin perfect and complet, wherewith all his creatures at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were <hi>perfumed,</hi> in aſmuch as he engraued in them ſuch teſtimonies of his goodnes and beuty. But the queſtion is here of a <hi>perfume</hi> communicated vnto his ſpouſe by this ſweete o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and ſmell, and not vnto the worlde remaining in his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe and filthineſſe. And therefore wee will conſider of theſe <hi>perfumes</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt both in his diuinity and in his humanity iointly conſidered, that we ſeparate not and diuide his two natures (as certaine heretikes called Neſtorians haue taught) but in ſuch ſort notwithſtanding, that wee knowe that theſe excellent ſmels proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diuinity &amp; godhead, are powred into the humanity and manhoode by which he is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1883:30"/>
vnited &amp; ioyned vnto his church, to make her as wel partaker of his gifts and graces, as of his glory and life euerlaſting. And this is alſo the cauſe why the Apoſtle ſaid not ſimply, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the onely mediatour between God and man,</hi> but alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely named him <hi>Man</hi>; not that he is not a mediatour alſo betweene the father and vs according to his diuine nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with that, which was wel ſaid by an auncient father, that <hi>his diuinitie is not a mediatrix without his humanitie, nor his humanitie without his diuinitie:</hi> but becauſe it is by the interuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his humanity by the which hee ioyneth himſelfe with vs, that we aſcend vp vnto God, and to eternall life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. The ſame then which is called by Saint Iohn the ſpirit which the ſonne hath receiued without meaſure, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.34. and which was repreſented by the doue in his Baptiſme, is that very ſame which the ſpouſe meaneth here by theſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,</hi> as alſo Eſay hath thereof ſpoken, vſing the very ſame figure, beeing as it were a commentator vpon this place, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 61.1.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Now in all ſacraments there muſt neceſſarily bee ſome conuenience and correſpondence betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified: for which cauſe vnder the newe couenant the Lorde minding to ſignifie the ſpirituall waſhing of our ſinnes and blots, tooke the ſigne of <hi>Water</hi>: and minding to ſhewe from whom we drawe eternal life, <hi>choſe bread and wine</hi> to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it. The ſame muſt therefore bee found in this ſacrament of <hi>Perfume.</hi> Therefore wee muſt note firſt of all, that as the receit and compoſition of this <hi>Perfume</hi> proceeded from God and not from men: ſo the graces of which it is here ſpoken, are in the humanity of Ieſus Chriſt, in aſmuch as the ſonne of God hath taken on him this humane nature of the ſubſtance of the virgin deſcended from Dauid, and conſequently from Adam, in whom this nature of man was depriued of the image of god and made the bondſlaue of ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. but hee is borne according to the fleſh without any ſinne, with his graces, in as much as the corporal maſſe of his body was ſo taken from the ſubſtaunce iſſued from Adam, that notwithſtanding it was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1883:30"/>
through the vertue of the holy Ghoſt, that the body of Chriſt was formed thereof, <hi>the power of the higheſt</hi> (that is to ſay the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt) hauing fully ſanctified it, to bee a moſt holy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pallace and perpetuall dwelling place of his moſt holie ſoul, endowed aboue euery other creature with al integrity &amp; perfection: &amp; eſpecially that this humanitie ſhould become the true and perpetual temple of the perſon of the eternal and onely ſonne of God his father, from the time it was conceiued in the womb of the Virgin, to the end that Ieſus Chriſt might become true God and true man, man I ſay moſt righteous, and iuſt, and the holy of holies.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Secondly as the mixtures of the diuine receit of this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <hi>perfume</hi> were earthly creatures of themſelues, ſo by theſe gifts and graces, of which the humanity is the ſubiect, and whereof the ſpouſe ſpeaketh in this place, we muſt vnderſtand not that which is eſſentiall in the diuinity of Ieſus Chriſt, in which thing the Eutychians abuſe and deceiue themſelues, but the qualities created by this diuinitie in the humanitie of Ieſus Chriſt, of whom wee which are his members coulde not otherwiſe draw them by any maner of participation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.21. Theſe things are verie high I confeſſe and ſurpaſſe al natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral knowledge: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. but hauing heard God ſpoken of ſo long in this Church, we ſhould and ought to haue our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vſed &amp; practiſed in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. When we ſay therfore that God is wiſe, righteous, good, wee ſpeake according vnto the capacity and conceit of our vnderſtanding: but to ſpeake more properly, and to come more nearer his nature, wee muſt ſaie that he is wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, goodnes it ſelfe, yea eſſentially, that is to ſay, conſidered in his owne eſſence and being, and not that he is ſo or ſo affected, to be ſuch or ſuch, as it is ſaid of the creatures. But by theſe <hi>perfumes</hi> wee wil vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the effectes and operations, of theſe perfections of the diuinity, poured vpon the head of <hi>our great &amp; perpetuall Aaron,</hi> according as it is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Thirdly the better to vnderſtand the conuenience and correſpondence of the ſigne and of this thing ſignified, we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1883:31"/>
muſt conſider wherefore theſe graces, with which the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perfumed his humanity, are called <hi>perfumes.</hi> It is therefore to ſhew vs firſt of al, that as a good perfume hindereth &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away the ſtench of any thing that is ſtincking &amp; infecteth: ſo the ſoueraigne perfection which is in the humanity of our mediatour mortifieth and putteth awaie from God all the ſtench of our corruption, and of whatſoeuer ariſeth thence, in ſuch ſort that in him, who is by good right moſt acceptable vnto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. we be alſo acceptable vnto him, <hi>Ephſe.</hi> 1.6. Farder as the odoriferous fume mounteth vp on high, albeit it be powred forth, and perfumeth all which come neare it: ſo the graces of Ieſus Chriſt which are powred forth vpon vs to perfume vs, as they came from aboue, ſo tend they vpward &amp; ſerue not to holde vs heere belowe: for which cauſe alſo Ieſus Chriſt, for either of theſe reaſons, is called <hi>the man from heauen</hi>: 1. Cor. 15.48. and wee are taught by him when wee praie and ſay <hi>Our father,</hi> to ad, <hi>which art in heauen,</hi> whither we lift vp our ſelues, as beeing already by God ſitting with him in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly places, whither this ſpouſe aſpireth and contendeth, and we with her if wee bee his true children, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.6. Ye ſee then what wee are to gather vpon theſe three points, I meane, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this ſigne, figured in the Lawe by thoſe corporall and ſenſible holy <hi>perfumes,</hi> &amp; the thing ſignified by them, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the perfections with which Ieſus Chriſt is endowed in all perfection, (in as much as he is our elder brother) and thirdlie touching the correſpondence, which is between this ſigne &amp; the thing ſignified.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Ieſus Chriſt therefore is the only veſſel in which all theſe moſt excellent and moſt perfect odors &amp; ſmels are contained: but this were but in vaine in reſpect of the ſpouſe, if they were ſo encloſed and ſhut vp there, that the veſſell only were perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with them. And this is the cauſe that the ſpouſe ſaith not, <hi>Becauſe of thy excellent perfumes,</hi> but <hi>becauſe of the odor of thy moſt excellent perfumes</hi>: &amp; not <hi>thy name is as it were a perfume:</hi> but <hi>thy name is as it were a perfume powred out.</hi> We are therefore now to conſider of the ſweete odour of this perfume, and towardes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1883:31"/>
whom it is powred forth. And that was, as we haue aboue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, firſt towards God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath taken ſuch a pleaſure in the ſmell thereof, that he is for euer appeaſed towards vs, for whom (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2.) the welbeloued ſonne <hi>hath offered vp himſelfe a ſacrifice of a ſweete ſmelling ſauour vnto God.</hi> Fot albeit in infinite many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this very ſame thing is attributed by Moſes to the ſacrifices of the lawe: yet notwithſtanding this muſt bee ſo taken, in as much as they were the true figure hereof, &amp; not that the blood of bulles and of goates had any ſuch force at al in themſelues, eyther in whole, or in part, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. And this is the cauſe why Saint Iohn calleth him <hi>the lambe which taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Ioh. 1.36. and Saint Peter ſaith that he hath borne our ſins in his body vpon the tree, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. to the end (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.) that <hi>as by the diſobedience of one man ſinne entred into the world and by ſinne death: ſo by the obedience of an other man righteouſnes and life were giuen vs,</hi> this obedience ſtretching it ſelfe vnto death, euen the death of the croſſe, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Secondly this odour was powred, and is powred forth from day to day, vpon euery member of his church, as al things were ſprinkled with blood vnder the lawe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18. which is expounded of the blood of Chriſt, by S. Peter, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. And this is the cauſe why the Angels announcing vnto the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards his birth, &amp; the reall and actuall powring forth of this perfume, whereunto this ſpouſe euen in the time of Salomon aſpired, ſaith not only <hi>a Sauiour is borne to day,</hi> but <hi>a Sauiour is borne vnto you to day,</hi> &amp; conſequently the Angels in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſong, ſung not only <hi>Glory to God on high,</hi> but added <hi>and in earth peace, goodwill towards men,</hi> Luk. 2.11.14. This is then that ſweet odour, which only bringeth vs that vnſpeakable peace vnto our conſciences, which the world cannot giue, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. &amp; <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.7. &amp; that not without cauſe, ſeeing Ieſus Chriſt is made vnto vs wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctification, and redemption, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. taking away by this meanes all that which maketh vs ſtinking before God, and inſteede of that vncleannes, perfuming vs with al that which may make
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1883:32"/>
vs acceptable vnto the father. For firſt of all, the whole and entire pure wiſdome of him, <hi>in whom are encloſed all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſedome and vnderſtanding,</hi> Coloſſ. 2.3. beeing commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated vnto vs and allowed vs by faith, our ignorance and blindenes, which infected our whole mind, are couered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: moreouer all our ſinnes being blotted cleane out by the ſatisfaction of him, who died, <hi>the Iuſt for the vniuſt,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.18. and which is more, the full and perfect accompliſhment of all the commaundements of God being found in him, which made himſelfe ſubiect vnto the law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. to the end to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh for vs al righteouſnes: <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. all this being rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned and allowed vs, and applied vnto vs by the inſtrument of faith, we are not onely deliuered from the ſtench of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, but alſo clothed with the odoriferous ſmell of the entire obedience of our elder brother, not onely to eſcape death, but which is more, to enter into life. Beſides this, this perfect reſtauration of our nature in his perſon, being alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vs, and becauſe it cannot bee, that he which hath giuen vs him, ſhuld not giue vs alſo al other things with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. it followeth, that inſteede of many moſt infected and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſoylings, which the Lord being altogither holie, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither pure, cannot ſuffer, hee findeth vs in the perſon of his ſonne, altogither pure and cleane without ſpot or blame, and conſequently of a moſt ſweete ſauor, as it is he in whom alone we are made acceptable, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4.6.</p>

is nothing in this world which hath not ſome ſpot of the curſe of God, as experience it ſelfe doth alſo ſhewe vs the ſame. But this is eſpecially declared by that pollution which conſiſteth in this, that men pollute and defile both themſelues and al the creatures of God, when neither they can, nor they wil, ſo long as they remaine in their owne nature, vſe them as it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that is to ſay, in good meaſure, with an vpright conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to the honour of the Creator. I ſpeak of thoſe which are otherwiſe lawfully to bee vſed, and of which the vſe were pure, if we vſed them well: as for example, trauail for to get our lyuing, eating, drinking, clothing, louing of father, of mother, of country, &amp; of other things, in which we ſhal euer find ſome default or exceſſe: and aboue al, this moſt infectious vice, of not referring al vnto the glory of God. And what ſhal wee ſay of thoſe things which are directly contrarie to the wil of God, with which the world is wholy infected both within &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? The Lord of his mercy giue vs grace to know throughlie indeede ſuch our filthy &amp; ſtinking vncleannes, &amp; contrariwiſe to ſeeke after this ſo precious and ſweete odour, with which this ſpouſe is ſaid to be perfumed, <hi>running downe from the Iuorie palaces,</hi> of which mention is made <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8. Learne therefore ye couetous, how infected and ſtinking this filthines of yours is before God: and inſteede of ſeeking after your pleaſure, and putting your truſt in vncertaine and tranſitorie riches, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. haue your hart &amp; your treaſure in the true and pure &amp; not periſhing riches. Ye ambitious, learn, what the vanity of thoſe honors &amp; falſe great ſtates, is, with which you are bewitched. Yee drunkards and gluttons, to whom nothing ſauoureth but wine and meates, the end whereof is ſtench and rottenneſſe, learne to ſeek after the liuing water which refreſheth to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and that true bread of life, and that wine which reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the hart of man, with a true and perfect ioy. Ye adulterers and vile vncleane perſons, very hogs and ſwine with two feete, how long wil you wallow in your abominable and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy infections? Contrariwiſe my brethren let vs harken, (if we wil haue any part in the true life and in theſe ſweetes whereof

            <p n="11">11 Let vs harken I ſaie, to that which the ſpouſe ſaith here in theſe woordes, <hi>And therefore the virgins loue thee.</hi> Let vs bee therefore, both men and women, young and old, theſe virgins, of whom it is here ſpoken, and in the <hi>Apocal.</hi> 14.4. or rather let al of vs be this pure ſpouſe as ſhe is named by the Apoſtle: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. which ſpeaketh here, and warneth vs with her ſelfe. For concerning corporal virginity, there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heere meant or imported: in the which ſimplie the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God doth no more conſiſt, then in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.36. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. as alſo no man is the holyer becauſe he is married: but al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in behauing a mans ſelfe holily, be hee married or vnmarried. This pertaineth then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at al, as I haue ſaid, vnto corporal virginity, oppoſed both to mariage and other vncleannes forbidden by God: but ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth here that chaſtitie and ſpirituall purity, oppoſed to all vncleane affections and actions of the fleſh, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth the old man: which if wee renounce not, &amp; which if we ſuffer not the ſpirit of god to deſtroy by litle &amp; litle in vs, but remaine in our old skin, we haue no part with Ieſus Chriſt, nor conſequently with the kingdome of God: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. They therfore who haue ſo highly praiſed &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended virginity, as to make it the ſum of Chriſtian perfection, haue gone too far &amp; exceeded in this poynt. Wherewith Sathan, contrary to their intent, hath ſo wel ſerued his turn, that bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the laſt their poore conſciences with the vow thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the meaning of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. he hath in the end made the world a Sodo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Gomorrha, both by the clergy of Rome to this day &amp; many ages heretofore, and ſpecially by theſe ſinks of ſtewes, &amp; brothelhouſes of men &amp; women, the ſtench &amp; infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which, aſcendeth vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that this is here very much beſide the purpoſe alleadged for virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it appeareth at leaſt by this, that in the time of Salomon,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1883:34"/>
there was no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion at all of ſuch virginity among the people of God, but he which married not his daughter, was thought to do wrong and iniury to his tribe &amp; family. But beſides this, if wee ſhould take the name of virgins thus in this place, wee muſt exclude out of this company, the chiefe &amp; principal men of it: I meane, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, the Patriarckes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all other the renoumed Godly before the comming of Chriſt. Nay which more is, Saint Peter himſelfe, whom they make the head of their Church, muſt be ſhut out <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.14. &amp; the other Apoſtles, and the brethren of the Lorde, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. yea Saint Paul himſelfe alſo, if a man will beleeue moſt of the ancient and renoumed expoſitors, vpon the place of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 2.20. To returne to our purpoſe, the ſpouſe teacheth vs here three moſt neceſſarie pointes: the firſt that to bee partakers of this coniunction with Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt be <hi>virgins,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>ſin muſt not raigne in vs any more, but as our God is holy, ſo wee muſt giue our ſelues vnto all holines, mortifying our members which are vppon earth, beeing followers of Chriſt, and walking as hee hath walked,</hi> Coloſ. 3.5. Epheſ. 5.1. and 1. Iohn 2.6. Secondlie by what meanes wee paſſe from our vncleanneſſe to this puritie, to wit, beeing perfumed with the graces of the Bridegroome, <hi>by whome it is giuen vs to beleeue:</hi> Philip. 1.29. Epheſ. 2.8. <hi>and to wil and to doe, according to his free goodwill:</hi> Philip. 2.13. And thirdlie what is the principall effect of this perfume, powred into our heartes, namelie, the loue of God oppoſed to the loue of the worlde, and which loue is as it were the light of the lamp of thoſe wiſe virgins, of whom mention is made, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. as alſo it is expreſlie reiterated by Ieſus Chriſt, in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and laſt ſermon which he made vnto his Diſciples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his death, and by Saint Iohn almoſt throughout his firſt canonical Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Wee haue therefore in this third verſe an excellent ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of al true Chriſtianity to diſcern it from the falſe, which leaneth to it ſelf in whole or in part, &amp; likewiſe the moſt certain &amp; perpetual mark of true Chriſtians: to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which, it ſufficeth not that the perſume of the goſpell

            <p n="2">2 We muſt therefore in this place take heede of two moſt falſe doctrines, whereof the one is of thoſe, who being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the effect of the fall of the firſt man in his whole poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, euen vnto the litle children which are yet in the womb of their mother, haue thought that man being prouided of ſome naturall vnderſtanding and iudgement, had no farther need of the law of God then to bee better and perfectlier informed of the will of God his Creator: as a childe that hath a good witte,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1883:35"/>
neede no more then a good maſter, or as a faire white paper, which is fit to receiue all that a man will write in it. The other of theſe falſe doctrines is of them, which compare our nature vnto a lame man, that hath no need but of one to ſtaie him vp, to go vpright. And this is the opinion of thoſe Sophiſts, which confeſſe indeed that we haue need of the grace of God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vs, and accompany vs, by reaſon of that natural infirmitie which is befallen vs by the hereditary corruption which wee drawe from our firſt father: but they will haue the grace of God to ſerue vs but for a payre of crutches, hereby afterward to eſtabliſh their owne merits. The firſt therefore vtterly take away the ſupernaturall grace of God, which is the firſt ground and foundation of our ſaluation: &amp; therefore haue they beene heretofore rightly condemned and deteſted: but the other, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to part ſtakes betweene that which they call <hi>Free-will</hi> &amp; the grace of God, fall by an other way into the ſame inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and miſchiefe. For towardes God, the former of theſe doctrines is as good as the later, whereas we ought to auouch &amp; confeſſe, that it is the mere &amp; only grace &amp; mercy of God, not which aideth our nature being weakned, but which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it altogether in quality, bringing vs <hi>out of darckeneſſe into light.</hi> Act. 26.18. &amp; Epheſ. 5.8. &amp; from <hi>death vnto life,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1.5. &amp; He which knoweth not this grace &amp; that ſo far too as this point reacheth, knoweth not what the goſpel meaneth, or the words of the Lord, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man commeth vnto me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the father drawe him.</hi> They reply hereupon that wee then transforme men into blocks &amp; ſtones, depriuing them vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of vnderſtanding &amp; will: which concluſion they falſly draw from our doctrine.

            <p n="3">3 And yet all this notwithſtanding, this manner of <hi>drawing</hi> cannot be applied to this ſpouſe, as appeareth by the wordes which went before, by which ſhee moſt plainly and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly declareth, that ſhee was already <hi>drawne,</hi> yea and as it were rauiſhed aboue the cloudes by this grace, witneſſed by a moſt vehement deſire of hers of paſſing yet farther.

The Apoſtle ſpeaketh far another language: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.25. who feeling in himſelfe the reſidue &amp; remnant of the corruption which was yet in him, how regenerate ſoeuer he was, and crying out <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man that I am, who ſhal deliuer me from this body of death,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to vaunt himſelfe of his trauailes, but <hi>giueth God thanks through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> proteſting elſewhere, (albeit he was wel aſſured of the crowne promiſed vnto them which run wel, and to loyal and faithful ſeruants: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>that he wil be found, hauing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not my owne righteouſneſſe which is of the law, but that which is by faith in Chriſt,</hi> Philip. 3.9. in ſuch ſort as that ſaying of Leo an auncient Biſhop of Rome, ouerthrowing the indulgences and pardons forged by his wicked ſucceſſours, is moſt true, namely, that <hi>the righteous gaue not crownes, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued crownes, and</hi> that <hi>from the conſtancie of the faithfull are procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded examples of patience and not the giftes of righteouſneſſe.</hi> It is not therefore inough that God forme in vs a deſire to know him, and to ſerue and walke after him, but he muſt ſuccour, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp; giue continual forces to this deſire, which otherwiſe would ſuddainely die and come to nothing, and our latter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition become worſe then the firſt.

at this daie but too manie examples of that which is written: <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. Our ſpouſe therefore when ſhee ſaith <hi>Draw mee,</hi> it is as much as if ſhe ſaid, Alas my beloued, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cry, yet I ſee not that thou commeſt any thing the nearer vnto me. This, this is the extreme deſire the fathers had, whereof Ieſus Chriſt ſpake <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.17. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. I muſt therefore (ſaith the ſpouſe) approch nearer thee. But alas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I doe that which thou giueſt mee power to doe, mee thinkes I haue no legs, ſo heauie, ſo benummed, and ſo aſleep they are. I would gladly flie vnto thee, but I trayle the wing, &amp; therefore <hi>draw me.</hi> The like ought wee to ſay euery daie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we may ſaie, that this Bridegrome or beloued, is come nearer vnto vs now, then hee was in Salomons time, and that he is as it were painted out before our eies.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And wee muſt note here that this prayer pertaineth not onely to euerie member of the Church in the feebleneſſe of his ſpirit and wil, but to the whole body of euerie Church, yea of the whole Church, Catholickly, that is vniuerſally conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo vexed and troubled as al auncient hiſtories do witneſſe, both by heretiques in matter of doctrine, and ſo defaced and disfigured with infinite ſcandales and offences in the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and gouernment thereof: which thing ſhould bee well conſidered, both of them which ſeeke here belowe a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in euerie member of the Church, as the Cathariſtes of old, and in our time the Anabaptiſts, and of them which forge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues an Idea of a Catholique Church, which ſhould be without ſpotte or wrinkle, which they afterwarde apply to their phantaſme of the Sea of Rome, without any either ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or reaſon. And yet for all this the true Church leaueth not to be the receptacle &amp; gardien of the truth of God, who neuer ſuffereth that this foundation ſhould not remaine and abide firme and ſure.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But in ſaying <hi>Draw me,</hi> we muſt withal take the cord in our hand by which we are craned vp and drawn vnto him: for to ſpeak thus, &amp; in the meane time to refuſe the meane which is preſented vs to draw vs, were but to mock God. That which I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1883:37"/>
call the corde is the preaching of the Goſpell, the ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the ſpirit of God, to open our heart, to the end to make it heedful and attentiue, and to pearce our eares to hear, &amp; to giue vs eies to ſee, in a word to lead vs into al truth, and to confirme and comfort vs vnto the ende: and this is it in which the ordinarie exerciſe of all Chriſtians conſiſteth. It is but in vaine therefore for ſuch as are ordinarie and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of Gods word to ſay <hi>Draw mee.</hi> For it is no more then if they ſhould ſaie vnto God, make me to liue without a ſoule, make me to ſee without light.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But to go on: a man maie demaund why the ſpouſe ſaith in the ſingular number <hi>Draw me</hi> and not <hi>Draw vs,</hi> ſeeing that anon after ſhe ſpeaketh alſo of her companions <hi>And wee will run after thee.</hi> Let vs therefore vnderſtand that this ſpouſe here repreſenteth not one onlie perſon, but the whole company &amp; aſſembly of the true faithful already inſtructed, and bringing forth euerie day as a fruitful mother children vnto God: which are here vnderſtoode by the companions of this ſpouſe. Shee ment not therefore to forget her companie in ſpeaking parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie of her ſelfe, but to ſhew by her owne example the reſt of her traine what they ought to doe. And thus muſt they doe which haue profited more then others in the Church of God, they muſt bee inſtruments of grace towardes others, and ſo take one another by the hand, and aſcend vp togither to this holy houſe of God whereunto we aſpire: <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.3. which thing is principally required in the paſtors and teachers which are ſent to this effect and purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The ſpouſe therefore addeth, ioyning her ſelfe with her companie, <hi>And we wil runne after thee.</hi> By which words is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vs the effect of that which ſhe required, when ſhe deſired to be drawne, to wit, to the end that ſhe might not only march forward and go on with more courage but rather runne. And this is oppoſed to that negligence and ſlownes which is in the greateſt part of them which are of others moſt enabled, and al for want of taking courage to themſelues and making the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God to bee powerfull in them, profiting from faith to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1883:38"/>
faith, &amp; from good to better, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7. without fainting and being weary in running well, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle exhorting vs, and propoſing himſelfe for an example, ſaith, <hi>That we muſt forget thoſe things which are behinde, and follow hard after thoſe things which are before, and draw to the marke, that is to the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Philip. 3.13.14. the life of man being elſewhere compared vnto a race, in the which, ſaith he, <hi>many do runne, but one only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the price,</hi> namely he which runneth to the liſtes end, &amp; ſeaſeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the price, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. And if they be to be reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which runne not ſwift enough, they are much leſſe to be excuſed which go not but pace by pace. But what ſhal become of them who recoile and go backward in ſteede of going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? what ſhall become of them which not only draw back but flatly turne the back, returning as ſwine vnto their mire, and as dogges vnto their vomit? 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.</p>
            <p n="7">7 And what may I ſay hereupon? euen thus much in fewe words, that albeit the Lord by a more then admirable conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of his graces and ſinguler patience to inuite, to drawe, to ſummon vs, vs, I ſay, of this Citty, yea crying ſo loude and ſo ſhril, that this voice of his hath beene hard in al corners and quarters of the world: yet notwithſtanding I dare not ſay that there are found any ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners amongſt vs, but too many idle, too many deaffe, too many lame, too many cold, yea too many which draw back. I ſpeake it to my great regret &amp; griefe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the time which I haue ſeen, in the which there was ſo great zeale to the word of God, that the paſtors and teachers were not ſufficient to furniſh men therewith, &amp; that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out goodly and great fruits, both in reſpect of the good order obſerued in the ſtate publick, &amp; in priuate families, which did ring of Pſalmes and praiſes of God: one neighbour warned &amp; inſtructed another, open ſcandals and offences were not hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and diſſembled, the ſtraungers forgate their othes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their euil maners, aſſoone as they entered but the gates of Geneua: to be ſhort in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of the time wherein we now are, men did not go, but did run vnto God, and God did bleſſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1883:38"/>
them, withholding &amp; ſtaying the furie &amp; rage of their greateſt enemies, during their greateſt fiery zeal &amp; courage. And now what? Hardly doe we retaine the name of that, of which before wee had the true ſubſtance, and our fire is a fire of chaffe. And therefore it is vnto vs, that that reprehenſion made by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the Galathians pertaineth, that <hi>hauing begun in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we end in the fleſh:</hi> Galat. 3.3. Euerie one is giuen vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, couetouſnes and diſtruſt haue poſſeſſed euerie mans hart, there are no lawes which can bridle our pompes and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, in ſuch a time, when wee ſhould bee rather clad in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes, as neither the gammings, fornications, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries of ſome amongſt vs. In a word in ſteed of going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wee goe backeward, euerie man doing ſo, as if a man to runne would charge himſelfe with a furred and heauie coate, inſteed of putting himſelfe into his dublet, yea into his ſhirt if our clothes did hinder vs. Euery man foldeth &amp; wrappeth him ſelfe in the cares and thoughts of this woorld, inſteede of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating and putting that in vre, which retireth and plucketh vs from the world, that we periſh not with it. Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is cold inſteede of beeing hote and feruent in zeale of knowledge. To be ſhort, euerie man fatteth himſelfe ſo groſſe, that it wilbe impoſſible hereafter to paſſe through the ſtrait gate: a thing lamentable, and whereof I warne you in the name of God: while hee yet ſaith <hi>Come vnto me,</hi> and whiles the dore is yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, or at the leaſt onlie halfe ſhut. If we wil not, God wil ſhew vs to our coſt (and we are verie blinde if wee perceiue not that he doth alreadie prepare himſelfe thereunto) that if we thinke not on it, he wil think on it, and when wee ſhall crie, it ſhall be aunſwered vs, as it was them which were inuited to the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.8. as the workers of iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. as the fooliſh Virgins: <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.12. from the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of which the Lord keepe vs. In ſumme therefore the faithfull as ſtraungers and wayfarers in the woorlde doe proteſt in this place, that they labour to come vnto that Cittie whereof God is the maker and builder, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10. not onelie to walke thither, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to runne thither with all their forces they haue receiued
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1883:39"/>
of him which draweth them thither.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But we may not forget theſe woords <hi>After thee.</hi> For it is not enough to run, but wee muſt firſt run in the right way, and ſecondlie wee muſt runne right, without ſtraying either to the right or to the left hand, and thirdlie we muſt tend &amp; go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vnto the mark vnto which we ought to tend, if we will not haue our paines to be fruſtrate and loſt. Al theſe things are giuen vs in Ieſus Chriſt ſolely and alone. For firſt, beſides that it is of his ſpirit that we receiue as well the deſire of running, as the power to runne, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>He is the waie, the truth and the life,</hi> and for to follow him without ſtraying, and to obtaine the price at the end of our race, he muſt alwaies run before and we muſt runne after him. They therefore, who to goe to eternall life deuiſe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues new waies, that is to ſay any ſeruing of God according to their owne pleaſure, or happilie followe the inuentions and deuiſes of other men whatſoeuer, although theſe waies be neuer ſo common and frequented, and as olde and ancient as a man can wiſh: how euer they replie that theſe are not other waies, but onely certaine pathes, which bring them into the high way, as thoſe men dreame which make themſelues beleeue, that the merits of works agree verie well with grace: and the inuocation of holy men departed with the office of mediation of Ieſus Chriſt alone: and his corporal and eſſential preſence in the maſſe with the verity and truth of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, and with the aſcenſion and ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of him, and other ſuch concluſions neceſſarilie contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie: yet notwithſtanding not holding the right way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, they ſhal not find him at their iourneyes end, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie they ſhall haue no other fruit of their trauaile, then that which <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh of 29.13. and the Apoſtle: <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.18. Yee ſee then al falſe worſhippes and religions condemned in one word, of which the Apoſtle in that place of the <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.18. handling this very matter ſetteth down three kindes. The firſt is of thoſe which are grounded vpon certaine vaine ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hauing an appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſome great wiſdom. As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day, men ground the <hi>Interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saints</hi> vpon this, that men go
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1883:39"/>
not to kings &amp; princes, but by mediators. <hi>Item</hi> that if holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages haue had credit with God being in this woorld, they haue a great deale more beeing receiued with him into para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. <hi>Item</hi> that we muſt ſatisfie God in this woorlde, or in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Item</hi> that becauſe the perfection of euerie eſtate conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in vnity, there muſt bee one generall head in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and gouernment of the catholique Church, or other like concluſions of theirs who forge and deuiſe a religion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own fanſie, taking their humane diſcourſe (a very bad rule and ſquire) to rule and ſquire out their building by. The ſecond kind conſiſteth in groſſe ſuperſtitions, and ſuch as are manifeſt vnto all, except it bee to them, which are altogither blinde and ſo will bee. Such haue beene from all time infinite maners of fancied things &amp; doings, by which men haue drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, firſt that their ſinnes were thereby done forth, and finally that God himſelfe was endebted vnto them for them, as are at this daie in the Church of Rome holy water, holy waxe, pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſters or beades, going on pilgrimage, certaine ſignes of the croſſe, certaine kinds of weeds &amp; attires &amp; other ſuch bables, in which there is neither ſenſe nor reaſon, neither with God nor with men.</p>
            <p>The third ſort was in the Apoſtles time of them, which yet held and retained the Iudaical ceremonies, willing to mingle them with Ieſus Chriſt. In the roume of this haue ſucceeded at this day the traditions of men, and an infinit number of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, by which not only the commaundements of God are taken away and aboliſhed, and Chriſtians brought into a moſt miſerable ſeruitude and bondage: but the grace alſo of Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe is vtterly made voyde and of none effect, and there is nether doctrine nor ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t remaining vncorrupted. Now al this is nothing els but to runne in vaine after ſtraunge Gods, although a man giue them not this name but that al this is diſguiſed vnder theſe faire woords <hi>of ſeruing of God, of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church,</hi> of <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> and of <hi>good Meaning.</hi> But in lieu of all this we are ſent here vnto Ieſus Chriſt alone, and conſequently to his holy and only woorde preached, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1883:40"/>
wholly put in writing, firſt by the Prophets according to the meaſure and diſpenſation of the times, &amp; finally by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, without being lawfull euen to the Angels themſelues, to chaunge any thing therein, to ad or diminiſh, the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded and grounded vpon this ground-plat &amp; founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no other whatſoeuer, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.14. the whole Scripture alſo giuing vs moſt certaine witnes hereof: which without this would not be ſufficient for the barring and ſhutting out of all falſe doctrines and hereſies: which thing cannot be ſaide without great blaſphemy. Ye ſee then what are our liſtes, what is our race and courſe, and what the price is which is ſet for vs at the end thereof. Neither doth this point concerne only the doctrine which is common to the whole true church, but this aduertiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt alſo guide vs in al our particular thoughts, deliberations and practiſes, in which wee muſt alwaies demaund of God the addreſſe and direction of his holy ſpirit, that we neuer go beyond him, but alwaies walk after him, hauing him and his commaundements before our eyes, as we are taught at large in that excellent <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. And herein committed Saint Peter a very great fault, by and by after he had made that excellent confeſſion of faith, by reaſon whereof he was called <hi>Cephas,</hi> that is a ſtone or rock: when hee would needes bee medling in counſailing his maiſter, for which cauſe hee was called Satan, and had it ſaid vnto him, <hi>Goe behind me, thou vnderſtandeſt not the thinges of God, but the things which are of men.</hi> Afterwarde Ieſus Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>If anie man wil come after me, let him renounce himſelfe, &amp; take vp his croſſe and follow me.</hi> And therefore to conclude, if we wil be Chriſtians we may not go before Ieſus Chriſt, but we muſt follow.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The ſpouſe addeth <hi>The king hauing brought vs into his priuy chambers, we wil be cheerful &amp; merrie.</hi> Declaring by theſe words that ſhe is indeed the true Church, cheering her ſelfe ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with that which notwithſtanding yet ſhee ſawe not but in part. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. but holding herſelfe ſo aſſured of the reſt, for which ſhe hath ſo ſure pleadges: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. that it ſeemeth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1883:40"/>
her, ſhe is as it were already placed in heauenly places: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. according to the example of the Prophet crying out <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>O eternal God of hoſtes, how are thy tabernacles to be deſired,</hi> as he alſo wiſheth and longeth after them moſt feruently. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 42. and reioyceth himſelfe herein: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. ſpeaking of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, the bodie and ſubſtaunce of which are in Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>The ſecret chambers</hi> therefore of him who is here called the king, and is ſo indeede, according to the ordinaunce of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which no man can breake or infringe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. are firſt of all the reuelations of the ſecrets of God touching our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Ieſus Chriſt, by the mouth of his Prophets: which wee may call the porch or fore-chamber vnto the pallace of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, into the which the Saintes and holy men beeing brought before the manifeſting of the Lorde in fleſhe, haue ſeene and as it were ſaluted the promiſes a farre off: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.13. looking in into the holie court thorough the vaile, for the which viſion and ſight, it is ſaid by the Lord, that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham reioyſed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.56. So doth the ſpouſe alſo in this place, declaring notwithſtanding that ſhee looketh for ſome better thing, namely that which is called <hi>The great ſecret of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Godlines,</hi> that her beloued would make himſelfe to bee <hi>ſeene in fleſh,</hi> would be <hi>iuſtified in the ſpirit, ſeene of Angels, preached vnto the Gentiles, beleeued on in the worlde, and receiued into glory.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. This was then the time when this ſpouſe was brought in into <hi>the Cabinets and ſecret chambers</hi> of her beloued, meaning thereby the more neere and plain opening of all the will of his heauenly father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.15. and himſelfe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibited, <hi>In whom are ratified all the promiſes of ſaluation.</hi> 2. Cor. 1.20. For which reaſon Eſay calleth the Goſpel <hi>the arme of God.</hi> Eſay 53.1. and Saint Paul ſaith that <hi>it is the power of God to ſaluation to all that beleeue.</hi> Rom. 1.16. And therefore it is not without cauſe that Simeon holding our Sauiour in his armes receaued a moſt ſingular and vnſpeakable contentment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.29. and that our Lord ſaid vnto the Apoſtles that they had a great aduantage aboue the auncient iuſt men and Prophets. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.17. But yet notwithſtanding wee ſee yet but as it

were through a cloude, and <hi>know not but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>not appearing as yet what we are,</hi> which is differred vnto his later comming: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2. We are therefore entred into <hi>the ſecret chambers,</hi> but beholding as it were from behind the dore the glory of the Lord, as it were in a glaſſe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.28. looking till hee bring vs into the innermoſt of theſe <hi>ſecret chambers,</hi> which he is gone to prepare for vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.3. to ſee him as hee is in his true kingdome, <hi>and to bee eternally with him,</hi> 1.

And thus you ſee <hi>what the cabinets &amp; ſecret chambers</hi> are, and the true place called the <hi>holie of holies,</hi> not earthly but heauenly, vnto which euery faithful ſoule aſpireth, as vnto the place of their true &amp; euerlaſting reſt, and their vnſpeakable ioy, euen to the Lord, as here it is ſaide: not only becauſe that all this glory proceedeth of his onely grace, but alſo becauſe he is the laſt end therof: the faithful deſiring to be ſaued for no other cauſe but to glorifie him, (not ſtaying ſo much on that which ſhall betide themſelues to ſing that goodly ſong vnto God with ful and perfect ioy, <hi>Not vnto vs O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue the glory for thy goodnes and faithfulnes ſake,</hi> Pſal. 155.</p>
            <p n="10">10 It is not then without iuſt and great cauſe (the which notwithſtanding no man vnderſtandeth but he which is born of the ſpirite, and which hath his ſenſes faſhioned thereunto and purified, to diſcerne rightly betwixt that which is good and that which is il: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. that this bleſſed company pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that <hi>ſhe wil forget the wine,</hi> that is to ſay, al the moſt allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring delicacies of this life, to take her whole pleaſure in the meditation of the dilections of this her beloued, vſing againe a woorde of the plurall number to ſignifie more expreſlie the plenty and aboundance of that which God hath reſerued in ſtore for his, as alſo before ſhe made mention not of one <hi>cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net and ſecret chamber,</hi> but of <hi>ſecret chambers,</hi> according to that which the beloued afterward ſaid, <hi>that there are many lodginges and chambers of abode for the elect in his fathers houſe:</hi> Ioh. 14.2.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1883:41"/>
and we maie not doubt but that by this word of <hi>Delicacies</hi> wee are to vnderſtand, not onelie that which is beſides the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is required to the entertainment of this life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that <hi>hauing foode &amp; raiment we be therewith content, ſeeing we brought nothing into this world nor ſhal carrie anie thing out of it:</hi> 1. Tim. 6.7. but alſo that wee muſt goe ſo farre, if we be true Chriſtians, that nothing, be it of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, middle or loweſt quality, no not our owne ſelues, which we ſhould not caſt far from vs, and to which we ſhould not ſay <hi>I know thee not</hi>: Deut. 33.9. ſo farre as it ſhould turne vs neuer ſo little from that dutie which we owe vnto God. And this is that which Ieſus Chriſt ſignifieth by thoſe formes of ſpeaking, <hi>of hating of father and mother for the loue of him:</hi> Luk. 14.26. <hi>of cutting off the hand and the foote, and putting out the eies</hi>: Matth. 18.8 and <hi>not ſeeking to ſaueour life</hi>: Mat. 16.25. For we may not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe ſpeeches according to the letter after the manner of certain fantaſtical men, ſo to become a murderer of a mans ſelfe: nor after the maner of hipocriticall monks, as if it were a woorke of perfection to forſake father and mother to retire a mans ſelfe into a deſert for contemplations ſake, vnprofitable both to ones ſelfe and to others: but according as the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Law, which ruleth the ſecond, teacheth vs, when we are commanded to loue God with al our heart: which cannot be done, if the things of this woorld haue neuer ſo little a part of it: for it is another thing ſo to vſe this world, as to referre all things thereof to the glorie of the Creator without ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anie thing elſe in it but the vſe, with giuing of God thanks. And this is that which Salomon himſelfe hath taught vs at large in that excellent booke of the Preacher, in the which he hath walked vs through the whole labyrinth &amp; mizmaze of this life, ſhewing vs the knowledge of vſing it wel without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of it, according as the Apoſtle doth alſo warn &amp; aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe vs: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and the pſalmiſt moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. Therefore although it be here ſaid, that a man muſt think more vpon <hi>the dilections of the beloued</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon <hi>wine,</hi> wee maie not ſo take it, as if wee might giue our heart ouer to

But afterwards conſidering the quality and not the quantity thereof, ſhee pronounceth cheerefully theſe wordes, <hi>The vpright loue thee,</hi> as if ſhe ſhould haue ſaid, wee are indeede a ſmall companie, but fayre and good: for I bring thee nothing which is not entire and vpright, and which beareth thee not a true and ſincere affection.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1883:44"/>
this world, there are alwayes to be found more fools then wiſe men. How is it then when the point concerneth ſupernaturall wiſdome and goodnes? If wee will not beleeue that which the Lord himſelfe hath ſaide in expreſſe termes, ſpeaking of <hi>the broade gate which leadeth to deſtruction, &amp; through which many doe paſſe, and of the ſtreit and narow gate leading vnto life, and which fewe doe finde,</hi> Mat. 7.13. let vs at leaſt beleeue that perpetual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which wee haue hereof. For what was I praie you the number and multitude of the true children of God, when the deluge came vpon the world, in the which only eight perſons were ſpared which periſhed not by the waters? And afterward what was Abrahams houſe, in reſpect of the Cananits onely? Yea what was the whole people of Iſraell, to compriſe therein the hipocrites and falſe Iſraelites, in compariſon of all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, ſhut out of the couenant of ſaluation? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Yea and then eſpecially when the Bridegroome came into the earth in perſon, to gather and to viſite his church, who reiected him but the builders? who cried <hi>away with him, away with him, crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> but the multitude? what mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was that firſt number of ſixſcore perſons, by which the the Chriſtian church began in Ieruſalem? To bee ſhort when our aduerſaries at this day, who oppoſe their great number to our ſmall companie, ſhall haue wel counted, what are they all together in compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reſt of the world which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not Ieſus Chriſt? The multitude therefore is ſo far from beeing a true marke of the Church of God, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſide the greateſt number ought rather to bee ſuſpected of vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Notwithſtanding we ſay not that euery ſmall companie ought alwaies to be followed: but it muſt be withall qualified with this name which is here giuen vnto it, to wit, the name of <hi>vpright</hi>: which wee ought well to waigh, to know not onlie where the true church is, but alſo thoſe which are the true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof. The <hi>true church</hi> therefore is that where the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and true veritie of God touching our ſaluation is purely taught, and <hi>they</hi> are indeede <hi>of the church,</hi> who embrace it in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1883:44"/>
their minde and hart, and by effect do declare the ſame. And what is this <hi>vprightnes,</hi> but the will of our God witneſſed in all perfection by the writings of his prophets &amp; Apoſtles? I mean in his law, in reſpect of our applying our ſelues to perfourme it, according to the meaſure of his grace, and in his goſpell in reſpect of that our beleeuing vnto ſaluation. Euery aſſemblie therefore, be it great or litle, which holdeth not it ſelfe to this <hi>vprightnes,</hi> cannot bee the church of God, nor he a member of the true church, who beleeueth or doth otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And we muſt note wel that this tru vprightnes &amp; the loue of God, are things altogether ioyned each to other, &amp; inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it foloweth that what doctrine ſoeuer withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs neuer ſo litle from the loue of God (as all falſe religions haue this in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, that they ſtay men either on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or vpon other creatures in whole or in part) cannot be the true &amp; right way, wherof me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is here made: &amp; likewiſe, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer witneſſeth not by his life, that he loueth &amp; feareth god, is no true vpright man nor a Chriſtian, though he haue all the knowledge of truth in his head. And becauſe the loue of God is declared by the loue of our neighbour, <hi>whoſoeuer loueth not his neighbour, is a lyar, if he ſaie that he loueth God,</hi> Ioh. 13.35. and 1. Ioh. 4.20.</p>
            <p n="5">5 There follow now after this, the words of the ſpouſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her ſelfe to the daughters of Ieruſalem: which wee muſt by name diſcerne &amp; diſtinguiſh as wel from thoſe which ſhee called <hi>the vpright,</hi> to wit, the ladies of her traine; as from them of whom ſhe complaineth afterward, and calleth <hi>the ſonnes of her mother.</hi> Seeing then that wee vnderſtand by this <hi>spouſe</hi> the true Church of the Lord, and by <hi>the Virgins</hi> which follow her, thoſe which from day to daie are borne and bred vp in her in the Lord, and by <hi>the ſonnes of her mother</hi> the domeſtical enimies of the Church, abuſing their authoritie to the ruining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of her: it followeth that in this place by <hi>the Daughters of Ieruſalem,</hi> wee muſt vnderſtand the common ſort, namelie them which are in ſuch ſort in the Church, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they care not greatlie for it, and referring themſelues to

the preſent eſtate of religion, ſuch as it falleth out to be, follow the courſe and rate of the market, as wee ſay, yea and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie adioyne themſelues rather to the perſecutors then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſpouſe therefore ſpeaking vnto theſe, and calling them <hi>Daughters of Ieruſalem,</hi> becauſe that Ieruſalem ſhould be eſpecially the Citie of God, ſetteth before them, firſt of all, the grace that God beſtowed on them, if they could vſe it wel, and ſecondly vpbraideth them, and that worthilie with their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, as if ſhe ſhould ſaie: And you the reſt which I ſee here about me, and yet are not of my traine, of whom is it long, that you are not, hauing receiued this grace of God to be born not Philiſtines, nor Edomites, but citizens of this city of God? I ſee what the matter is. You thinke me not fayre, becauſe my hew is Sun-burned and blacke, in compariſon of you who haue ſo freſh &amp; ſo fair an hew. Now I confeſſe that I am indeed black, but yet notwithſtanding, I haue a faire and pleaſaunt beuty, which you ſee not. For as, if you behold me outwardlie, <hi>I am as black</hi> &amp; as tanned, as if I had been brought vp vnder <hi>the skinnes and Cabbins of theſe Moores and Arabians:</hi> ſo if you conſider of my beuty through this blacknes, there is <hi>no pauillion or tente of Salomon</hi> that rich &amp; mightie king ſo faire, and ſo glittering as my ſelfe. Afterward ſhe addeth, that this tanned hew of hers is not natural, but that it hath happened vnto her, as vnto a yong maiden driuen by her naughty and wicked brethren out of her fathers houſe, where ſhee ſhould haue liued and continued at her eaſe, driuen I ſay, far and wide, and made to endure abroad the parching of the Sunne and other iniuries of the weather. Now for the vnderſtanding of this ſpeech which is altogither allegorical, as alſo this whole Canticle or Song, wee muſt firſt of al note, that whereas ordinarilie by the colour of <hi>black</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode euerie ſad and vnpleaſant thing, as contrariwiſe by <hi>white</hi> ioy and pleaſure is ſignified: notwithſtanding by <hi>blacknes</hi> in this place, which the ſpouſe confeſſeth to bee in her, is not meant our natural foulnes &amp; blacknes, which is indeed more then filthy &amp; deteſtable, in which this ſpouſe was found at the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1883:45"/>
beginning as Ezechiel hereof ſpeaketh <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. For, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this vncleannes the Bridegroome had alreadie waſhed this ſpouſe of his, <hi>with his moſt pure and cleane waters</hi> Eſay. 1.55. namelie by his bloode, and his ſpirit which maketh that euer ſithence, the Church, in as much as it is cleanſed by faith, and conſidered ſuch as it is in her Bridegroome her beloued, is without ſpot or blemiſh <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.22. &amp; as touching her perſon within, ſhee is alreadie ſo clenſed, that ſin raigneth no more in her, but decreaſeth by little and little, wayting ſtill for that later daie, in which beeing clothed anew with incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and made comformable to the glorious bodie of her Bridegroome: <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.10. ſhe ſhal bee truelie <hi>without spotte or wrinckle,</hi> Epheſ. 5.27. The ſpouſe therefore ſpeaketh not in this place of this naturall infection, neither in whole nor in part, but meaneth by this word the poore &amp; miſerable eſtate, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Church is ſometimes brought in two ſortes. The firſt in reſpect of her natiue beutie, which is giuen her in proper: the ſecond in regard of many and diuerſe calamities of this life, by which her beloued doth ſometimes proue her, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chaſtice her. Which thing requireth a more large and ample declaration. I cal therefore the <hi>proper beuty of this spouſe,</hi> and that whereby her Bridegroome maketh her indeede gracious and commendable, and cauſeth her to be known vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al thoſe, which are not vtterlie blinde, by her admirable ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beuty: firſt, this ineſtimable brightnes of the clearnes of truth, and of the fauour and good will of him, who hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſpouſe therewith: the <hi>which beuty is</hi> truely within, as it is ſaid in the 45. <hi>Pſalm, verſ.</hi> 13. &amp; in <hi>the inward and ſpirituall man.</hi> Secondly by <hi>the proper beutie of the Church,</hi> wee muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that goodlie order of the miniſterie, and outward ſeruice of God, which was truelie heretofore, ſuch as might rauiſh the whole world in admiration by the magnificencie and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, firſt of the Tabernacle, afterwardes of the Temple of Salomon, and of all that which was therein done by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and appointment of God. All this notwithſtanding, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs: <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.17. &amp; the whole Epiſtle to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1883:46"/>
Hebrues, was nothing but the figure and ſhadow, as wel of the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, as alſo of the excellencie of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Goſpell, ſo much the more precious and glorious to the eies of ſuch as ſee clearlie, the more ſimple and leſſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is. For euen that outwarde Leuitical pomp, how glorious and excellent ſo euer it were, had it not beene referred vnto this end, wherefore it was ordained, would haue been not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no faire or beutiful thing in the eies of the Lord: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, as he declareth by the mouth of al his prophets, all of it whatſoeuer would haue beene vnto him in this reſpect moſt ſtincking, foule, &amp; infected. Yee ſee then that the Church hath a double ornament, and that a moſt precious one, with which being clothed and decked, ſhe ſheweth paſſing faire &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as on the contrarie ſide, being ſpoiled thereof, ſhe is in ſuch ſort disfigured and groweth out of fauour, that he muſt haue very good eies which wil know her.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But we are to note that of theſe two ornamentes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is neuer taken from this ſpouſe, being as it were a coſtly iewel which he neuer looſeth, and without the which alſo ſhe ſhould bee no more taken and acknowledged for the ſpouſe. But as for the outwarde decking, togither with other markes which are likewiſe viſible, when it pleaſeth God, his poore Church is for a time as it were ſtript out of it, either becauſe the world is not worthie to haue in the midſt of it ſuch a beuty which it contemneth, or happily becauſe it is expedient and neceſſarie, that ſhe be for ſome fault of hers, depriued of it for a time, to wit, vntil <hi>the time of reconciliation,</hi> as Eſay hereof ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: 54.6. and 7. For that time therefore ſhee is in ſorrow and heauines, and without her gloſſe and glittering, which may be perceiued: faire ſtil notwithſtanding and beutiful in the eies of her beloued, who hath alwaies an eie vpon her, not to forſake her.</p>
            <p n="9">9 For example and proofe hereof let vs compare the time of the captiuity of Egypt, of the greateſt part vnder the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, vnder Saul, vnder the ten tribes after their reuolt, vnder a great part of the kings of Iuda, vnder the captiuity of Babylon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1883:46"/>
(vnder which there was no apparant form of ſtate, either tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or eccleſiaſticall) the time of the miſeries and horrible diſorders and confuſions which happened vnder the empire of the Greekes, and vnder the Romans, vntill the totall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Temple, and of the nation of the Iewes, let vs, I ſay but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare theſe times with the outward eſtate of the Church vnder Moſes, Aaron, Ioſua, Dauid, Salomon, ſo long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued wiſe, Aſa, Ioſaphat, Ezechias, Ioſias, Nehemias, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like kings, and gouerners, when there were any ſuch, and we ſhal neede no farther proofe of this which I haue ſaid. And therefore they are themſelues deceiued, and doe deceiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which iudge of the church according vnto this outward and viſible marke, as if it were eſſential and perpetual, beeing moſt commonly ſpoiled thereof, and yet not leauing therefore to be knowen by them, who haue had good eies to marke her natiue, and eſſential inſeparable beutie.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Now to come to the chriſtian Church, this point is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be noted, to wit, that whereas the auncient church for the obſcurity of the promiſes, which were as it were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of this marriage, waiting for the viſible comming of the Bridegroome, had need of theſe earthly &amp; material Iewels, as being pledges &amp; witneſſes of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: ſo the Bridegroome being come, as this marriage alſo is ſpiritual and tendeth vnto a ſpirituall life, hath made an ende of all this: eſtabliſhing the charges and callings of the officers of his houſe, and of all his outward ſeruice, after a moſt ſimple manner and faſhion, farre different from the former. Retaining therefore the ſoueraign and eternall Prieſthood vnto himſelfe, and likewiſe the rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in lieu of all the Leuitical Prieſthood and other charges &amp; offices ſeruing thereunto: he hath firſt of all ſet vp his ſpiritual Temple throughout the world, which is the Chriſtian church, by his maſter builders, I meane, by his Apoſtles, Prophets, and Euangeliſts: which being done, he hath withal eſtabliſhed for gouernours of this building, vnto the end and conſummation of the world, Paſtours and Doctours for the adminiſtration of the woorde and of the Sacraments: likewiſe Elders for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1883:47"/>
and ouer-ſight of manners and other Eccleſiaſticall cenſures: and finally Deacons for the adminiſtring &amp; diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Church-almes, and other reliefes of the poore: and hath alſo ordained but two Sacramentes, common vnto the whole Church and perpetual, the moſt ſimpleſt, that poſſiblie might be, whether we conſider the matter, or whether we reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the forme &amp; adminiſtring of them: &amp; al this, fearing leaſt wee ſhould ſtay our ſelues on earthly things, to ſeek after our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them, or any holines beſides. And therfore was the Chriſtian Church then in hir gloſſe and beutifull hew, when this ſimplicitie was diligently obſerued therein and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it was in the time of the Apoſtles, vnder whom verilie ſhe floriſhed in this natiue and ingenuous beuty, both inward and outward, which Eſay deſcribeth vnto vs, 54 and 60. But alas, we may well ſay that this glittering gloſſe of hirs, was but as a lightening which paſſeth from Eaſt to Weſt, and is ſoone vaniſhed away and gone, as the Lorde himſelfe foretolde it would be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.27. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.24. For behold alreadie euen in the Apoſtles time, they of the Circumciſion could not abide the taking awaie of the Iudaicall Ceremonies, which had bin ſometime the decking &amp; ſetting forth of this ſpouſe, but had an end at the comming of the bridegroome in perſon. Others began then to mingle, vnder the ſhadow of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their goodly friuolous and altogither ſuperſtitious inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: others, not conſidering that they went about to bee more wiſe then god himſelfe, inſteed of contenting themſelues with this natiue and ingenuous beutie, added thereunto the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their owne goodly humane wiſedome. And albeit the Apoſtle hath ſo often and ſo diuerſly cried out againſt all ſuch inuentions, and namely by a moſt ſingular diuine and cleare diſtinct ſetting downe of all theſe abuſes, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.16. and the verſes following, yet could he not hinder that this ſhould not come to paſſe. Hereupon is entered into the Church the moſt part of Ceremonies manifeſtly and notoriouſly taken from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme, as namely holy water, prieſtly veſtments, lights, deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of materiall temples, ſhining and glittering with gold and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1883:47"/>
ſiluer and precious ſtones, without ſparing of all maner coſtly apparell, &amp; brauerie that might be. Afterwards the ſimplicity of adminiſtring the Sacraments ſeemed ouer light, &amp; therfore there muſt be added to the conſecration of the water, chriſme, ſalt, ſpettle, chreme, &amp;c. As for the ſacrament of the Supper, it was in the end cleane taken away &amp; aboliſhed by Tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, &amp; by a reall and expiatory offering and oblation which men haue inuented. Beſides al this, this goodly humane wiſedome hath had that credit a long time to modell and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne forth eccleſiaſtical charges after the Romane policy, to the ende to fulfill and accompliſh that which was foretold by Saint Iohn, in the Apocalyps, of the Image of the beaſt. From hence inſteede of an Ariſtocraticall order of Biſhoppes, that is to ſay Paſtours, are come * the dignities of Patriarcks and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and laſt of all two Popes or Oecumenicall Biſhops, the one in the Eaſt, whoſe wings Mahomet hath clipped, and the other in the Weſt: ſeated the one and the other vpon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hils, and eſpecially hee of the Weſt, who doth yet make dronke the Kings and Nations of the earth, aſſiſted with his breethren, officers of the lateſt and neweſt forge, called Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals. I let paſſe ſo many ſuperſtitions, at which, a man may preſuppoſe that Sathan himſelfe laugheth. All this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if a man wil beleeue our aduerſaries, behold the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Chriſtian Church: yea verily, if a ſhameleſſe thing, painted and diapred by her louers, may be this chaſt and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt, which hath neither within her nor vpon her any thing ſaue that which it hath pleaſed hir Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome to giue hir, &amp; which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenteth hirſelfe altogither with the garmentes, which the true and faithful woorkmen of the Lorde, I meane his Apoſtles, haue cut forth and fitted for her. The more then the Church is decked after the Apoſtolicke faſhion, the more faire ſhee is, whatſoeuer the minians and bawdes of the falſe painted Church ſay to the contrary. And if the poore auncient Church brought in here by the holy ghoſt, hath had iuſt occaſion of complaining, that ſhee was as it were disfigured by them, either which plucked from her the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1883:48"/>
outward ornaments ſhee receiued of hir Bridegroome, or which loaded and diſguiſed hir with prophane trimmings &amp; tifflings vp of her, which darckened and obſcured hir ſhining beuty, according as the Prophets in many places ſpeake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: alas vpon how much more iuſt occaſion, maie and ought the Chriſtian Church to complaine of them, who vnder cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that they would deck and trimme her, and make hir more faire and beutifull then her ſpouſe had made hir, haue arrayed her ſo ill? And ſo hath ſhee indeede already made hir com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint hereof vnto her Bridegroome, who hath begun in our time to heare hir, and hath put it into the mindes of good Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates to disburden her of thoſe ſtincking and defiled gawdes to reſtore her vnto her natiue beuty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which thing, God of his goodneſſe inſpire them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and guide them with his fauour more and more, to the ende that wee maie ſoone ſee the accompliſhment of that which hath beene hereof foretold, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 21. It remaineth we now ſpeak of the ſecond kinde of <hi>blackneſſe,</hi> proceeding as hath been ſaid from the afflictions and incommodities which concerne the ſtate of this preſent life. This <hi>blackneſſe</hi> happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto the Church, according vnto the prouidence of God for diuerſe reaſons: namely, ſometimes for the chaſtening or rather awaking of her, when ſhee is as it were aſleepe, and ſometimes for the proouing of her, and for the glorifieng of God in the patience and conſtancy which hee giueth her: all this notwithſtanding, bee it hee chaſtiſe her, bee it hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe or prooue her (as it is ſayd <hi>Pſalme</hi> 44.) finallie tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to an happie and good ende for her. <hi>Romans</hi> 8.28. But amongeſt all theſe afflictions, thoſe which are vnderſtoode by the name of <hi>Croſſe</hi> in the Scripture, to witte, the ſufferinges for the name of the Bridegroome, and for righteouſneſſe, whether they proceede from within by domeſticall enemies, or whether they come from without by the perſecutions of the open enemies of the Church, are marked foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs throughout the whole Scripture as ſingular deckings vp and excellent ornamentes of the Church of God, and the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1883:48"/>
moſt glittering Iewels hee giueth his ſpouſe togither with fayth, according to that which is ſaid by the Apoſtle: <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.14. in ſuch ſort as this is the true reioycing of the ſpouſe: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.14. and elſewhere in infinite manie places of the Scripture. And indeede the Church was neuer more beutifull and ſhining then vnder the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> the ſaying of the Apoſtle being verified by experience, That the power of the Lord is made perfect in our infirmitie and weakeneſſe: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</p>
            <p n="11">11 But this letteth not but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſometimes the Church in reſpect of the viſible markes thereof, and the eyes of men, is as it were darckened, and that ſo farre, that it is not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to the moſt part of the woorlde for a time, as if it were no more at all in the world: whether a man regard the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant beauty of it, which is the publique exerciſe of preaching the woorde and of adminiſtring the Sacramentes: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man conſider this goodlie order of callinges, and of the diſcipline of the Church hindered and as it were broken off for a time by the violence of perſecutions, bee it within by the ſway of hereſies, or without by the open enemies of the Church, when both theſe kindes of <hi>blackneſſe</hi> of which wee haue ſpoken meete together. Such was the eſtate of the Church, both by them within it, and by them without, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the horrible perſecution of Pharao, then when Moſes was ſo ill knowen of his owne: and afterward vnder a great part of the Iudges, &amp; namely at the time of the warre againſt the tribe of Beniamin, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the Scripture ſaith) <hi>there was no gouernor nor king in Iſrael, but euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did what ſeemed him good in his owne eies.</hi> Iudg. 21.25. as alſo vnder Ely <hi>the word of God being a very precious &amp; dainty thing at that time</hi>: 1. Sam. 3.1. In the later time alſo of Saul, and after his death, vntil the ſecond election of Dauid, a man might ſee a terrible obſcuring &amp; darkening of the true viſible markes of the Church: yea as it were a totall defacing of them in the kingdome of Iſrael vnder the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Ieſabel, ſo farre that Elias was entered into this opinion, that hee was left alone to ſerue God, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.10.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1883:49"/>
And as for the kingdome of Iuda, the ſtate of the Church was brought there to that point, that euen Iuda iuſtified Iſrael, as Ezechiel vpbraideth her therewith, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.51. And what could the ſeruice and worſhippe of God bee vnder Achaz? 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. &amp; vnder Manaſſes: 2. <hi>King.</hi> 21. and 2. <hi>Chronic.</hi> 33. Finallie during the ſeuentie years of the captiuitie of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, whereunto was the name of the people of God brought? And vnder the perſecution of Antiochus, vntil the purging again of the Temple? And as for the Chriſtian Church, what was the deſolation thereof in the moſt part of the world, then when the Arrians for certain hundreds of yeares were a-flote &amp; bare ſway? But eſpecially &amp; aboue the reſt, that deſolation is to be marked, which happened after the Emperors Maurice and Phocas, both in the Eaſt, where Mahomet and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours haue ſo disfigured this ſpouſe, that yet to this preſent daie can ſhee with much adoe bee knowen, and in the Weſt, by the Childe of perdition, ſeated in the Temple of God, beeing by this meanes verified and yet dailie prooued true, that which the Lorde himſelfe hereof hath foretolde, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. and the Apoſtle after him. 2. <hi>Timot.</hi> 3.1. and 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2.3. and yet more clearly <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14.</p>
            <p n="12">12 But notwithſtanding it is to bee noted, that as the Sunne, beeing by the interpoſition of the Moone ecclipſed and darckened, or rather hindered to caſt his cleare beames vpon the earth by ſome miſtes of cloudes for a time, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of men, leaueth not for all this to remaine in his owne nature full of light, and of brightnes: yea and it maie bee that ſome ſharpe and cleare eies maie acknowledge and perceiue his beutie and brightnes amidſt theſe miſts: euen ſo this ſpouſe although ſuch perſecutions doe darken, and as I may ſo ſay, doe vtterly take away her natiue and ingenuous beautie, yea make her to looke like a Moore or Arabian, in reſpect of men, who by this meanes know her not: ſo is it notwithſtanding that thorough this <hi>blackeneſſe</hi> of hers remayne certaine tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of beautie: naie farther, as white ſheweth more white, being laide neare vnto blacke: ſo afflictions, which are meant

And this is the reaſon which mooued the ſpouſe to ſay, <hi>That ſhee is blacke and yet verie faire withall,</hi> and that on one ſide, <hi>ſhee is blacke as the Tabernacles of the Arabians,</hi> and on the other ſide, <hi>that ſhee is white and ſhining as the Tentes and Pauillions of Salomon.</hi> Neither is it without great cauſe, that ſhee ſpeaketh in this place of Salomon oppoſed and contrarie matched with them of <hi>Kedar.</hi> For all the ſhining bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this ſpouſe, commeth vnto her from the true Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is that true king of peace, on whome depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all her beeing and brightneſſe, as the moone hath no light but of the ſunne.

            <p n="13">13 Now by theſe matters which wee haue aboue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the times wherein we are, the Lord maketh vs to ſee if we haue any eies, and cauſeth vs feele and perceiue if we be not more then bereaued of ſenſe, how not onely expedient, but howe altogether neceſſarie it is that wee bee well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the knowledge of the true markes of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo manie places as yet wholly defaced, and in other places ſo counterfeited, that it is hard for a man not to bee deceaued among them, if hee looke not the nearer vnto them, &amp; examine all by this touchſtone, which is the worde of the Lorde enregiſtred by the Prophets and Apoſtles, the ſumme whereof wee haue in our Chriſtian Creede.

Whereupon the ſpouſe warned them, that for all this ſhee leaueth not to haue her true beuty, to be knowen thereby and followed. But now ſhee addeth a ſingular exhortation, which conſiſteth in three points: the firſt, that it is not the outward hew which men muſt ſtand vpon to iudge of her bewty: the ſecond, that men make her blacker then indeed ſhe is: the third, that this <hi>blackeneſſe</hi> of hers is not naturall, and therefore by conſequent will not alwaies continue to be ſuch, adding withall, through whoſe fault it is that ſhee is in this caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now touching the firſt of theſe points, ſhe warneth and aduertiſeth them, not to ſtand ſo much vpon conſidering of her in this hew, how ſun-burnt ſoeuer it be: a warning &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſment of al others moſt neceſſarie, ſeeing there is nothing ſo faire and perfect in nature, whereof a man groweth not out of taſt and liking, if letting paſſe to conſider the bewty and goodnes thereof, he ſettle his minde wholy to take a view of euery defect &amp; imperfection which may be found in it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as rightly to iudge of a thing, and to make our profit thereby, we muſt equally conſider of it, and vprightly ballance euerie thing in it. And as this meaſure is to be held in eſteeming al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, ſo is it eſpecially and aboue all to bee obſerued in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1883:51"/>
this matter, wherof we here ſpeak. They whom they called in ancient time Cathariſts, as alſo the Donatiſts, and of our time a certain ſort of Anabaptiſts make good proofe hereof: who imagining a perfect beuty of a church in this world, ſeuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from all others (as if in their particular aſſemblies this perfection were to be found) wherein they doe greatlie abuſe and deceiue themſelues. Firſt in this, that they ſtand only vpon the defects of the Church, thinking that therefore the Church is no Church. Secondly in this, that they eſpy a mote in the eie of an other, &amp; will not ſee the beame which is in their own eies. We are therefore to note, that there is a diuerſity &amp; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of defectes and imperfections which are found in the Church. The firſt are touching manners, which howe wicked and corrupt ſoeuer they bee, either in the paſtours and ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, or in the ſheep, ought not to caſt vs into ſuch a rage as therefore to thinke, that there is no Church in thoſe places where ſuch corruptions are found. I ſay ſo long as the truth is there taught, according to that which the Lord ſaid ſpeaking to the Scribes and Phariſies, <hi>ſo long as they ſate in the chaire of Moſes,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>ſo long as they taught the doctrine of Moſes: doe yee, ſaith he, that which they ſaie, but doe not that which they do:</hi> Mat. 23.2. Although this hinder not, but that a man may well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe himſelfe from the company of ſuch men, following the Apoſtles admonition, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. &amp; as the Prophet proteſteth himſelfe did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.4. and warneth vs to do the like, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1.1. nay letteth not, but that a man may retire himſelfe into purer and cleaner flocks (if there be any ſuch) and where he may be in leſſe danger of being corrupted by the contagion and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others. The other imperfection conſiſteth in doctrine. In which againe there are many circumſtances to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before we depriue any aſſembly, be it great or ſmall, of the name of the Church. And that this ſhould be ſo, we ſee by the firſt epiſtle of Saint Paul to the Corinthians, that in the church of Corinth, not only touching manners, the diſcipline of the church was very looſly obſerued, and the manner of teaching the word greatly prophaned by a vaine and affected kinde of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1883:51"/>
babling: but which more is that the <hi>pro</hi> and the <hi>con</hi> touching the article of the reſurrection of the dead was ſtoutly and ſtifly diſputed, an article notwithſtanding of ſuch ground &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the Church, that without it the preaching of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel would become vaine: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was ſo called and helde of the Apoſtle for the true and holy Church of God. Among the Galathians it was yet worſe, beeing for the moſt part of them turned aſide, by the falſe Apoſtles, from the principal ground-plat and foundation of the Chriſtian Church, namely, from the free iuſtification, by the only ſatisfaction of one onely Ieſus Chriſt: and yet all this notwithſtanding, Saint Paul giueth them the name of Church. The reaſon is, as touching the Corinthians, becauſe they ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed not themſelues incorrigible and paſt amendment, and that, though there were ſome but badlie inſtructed in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the reſurrection of the dead, notwithſtanding the bodie of the Church did ſtil retaine and hold the truth. The Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans alſo had not banded themſelues againſt the doctrin of the Apoſtle, but were only turned ſomewhat aſide by a light head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, and yet not al of them, as is to be preſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>The like is alſo to bee ſeene by that which the Apoſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto Timothy, and likewiſe by the ſecond of Saint Peter, and that of Saint Iude, that there were already falſe teachers, and wicked Diſciples euen in the boſome of the Churches, which notwithſtanding for all theſe imperfections, left not to be called true Churches: as a man leaueth not to bee a man, though he haue ſome wert or ſome vlcers &amp; biles in one part of his body. But the caſe is otherwiſe of a body altogether rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and corrupted in the nobleſt and principalleſt partes: whereunto the Synagogues of the Iewes may bee compared, after that they ſtubburnely reſiſted the preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, from which, for this cauſe, hee vtterly diuided and disioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Church of Epheſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. and 28.28. and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo hath giuen vs a rule hereof, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.2. Neither are we otherwiſe to beleeue or to doe, touching ſuch aſſemblies and congregations (be they great or little) which notoriouſly and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1883:52"/>
ſtubburnly oppoſe themſelues againſt the principall and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental articles of Chriſtian Religion, as that aſſembly doth at this daie which ſitteth vpon the ſeauen hils, and oppoſeth it ſelfe directlie againſt the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe name notwithſtanding it falſely borroweth, and therefore we haue it iuſtly in execration and hold it accurſed, following the doctrine of the Apoſtle: <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.8. To come therefore to our purpoſe, we muſt take heede in this caſe, how we ſtand in ſuch ſort vpon the defectes and imperfections of one Church or more as therefore not to take them for Churches: but we muſt vſe thoſe ordinarie means which God hath appointed, to bear with that which is to be borne withal, to remedie that which may be remedied, and to take heede to our ſelues we bee not ſmutted, as they ſaie, among colliers: applying all our ſtudie and endeuour to mutual edification, as the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles teach vs, both by their doctrine and by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is verie true notwithſtanding that the ſpouſe ſpeaketh here of another kind of <hi>blackneſſe,</hi> to wit, of the outward ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe and diſſipation of the Church by the vehemencie of perſecutions: which is the cauſe that many making no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the glittering beuty of the kingdomes of this world, and the ſpirituall beuty of that kingdome, which is not of this world: and ſuffering themſelues to be dazled and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with that which hath onely a certaine outward gloſſe: ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enter not at al into the Church, or if happily they bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, retire themſelues afterward out of it, to returne againe to their vomit, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. For fault of hearkening vnto this warning and aduertiſement, not to rely or ſtand vpon this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward black and hideous appearance of the croſſe; but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe to waigh and conſider well the true and natiue beutie of the Church, in the middeſt of her greateſt afflictions. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording hereunto the Lord hauing warned vs that <hi>his kingdom commeth not with ſuch obſeruation,</hi> Luk. 17.20. hath ſaid alſo, <hi>That he ſhal be happy which ſhal not be offended at him,</hi> who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is called <hi>a man of ſorrowes and griefes,</hi> and ſo disfigured,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1883:52"/>
               <hi>Eſaie</hi> 53.3. that hee is compared vnto <hi>a worme of the earth:</hi> Pſal. 22.6. to whom notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the church muſt be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to bee the true church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. in ſuch ſort, that ſo far it is that the croſſe maketh the Church not to be knowen, that on the contrarie it is the true mark thereof being giuen to none but to the true beleeuers, to ſuffer for the name of God, the Apoſtle crying out, <hi>That this is it whereof he wil boaſt himſelfe:</hi> Gal. 6.14. Mat. 5.10. Phil. 1.19. and elſewhere throughout the Scripture. Hereunto is referred the ſecond point which I haue touched, being contained in this, that the Church which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her ſelfe black, ſaith that ſhe is <hi>Browne,</hi> as if ſhe ſhould ſaie to theſe Daughters of Ieruſalem, Comparing my ſelfe with you, who are ſo freſh and ſo faire, it ſeemeth indeed that there is nothing more black then I: but yet if your eies be good, you ſhal find that albeit I be <hi>browne and ſunneburnt</hi> by the parching of the ſunne, yet am I not for al my tanned hew, an Arabian or Aethiopian. For ouer and beſides that which hath beene ſaid of the happie end &amp; iſſue of the afflictions of the Church, there is an exceeding difference, between the moſt miſerable eſtate of thoſe who are blatched before God, by his iuſt vengeances, or which are left remaining in their naturall blacknes: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the confidences and aſſurances of the children of god afflicted for righteouſnes, and for the glory of the Lorde, who beſtoweth this great fauor and grace vpon them to be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them. Farther if we conſider of the eſtate of the church in her greateſt afflictions, it is not ſo miſerable as men think it is. For as the Apoſtle teacheth vs, <hi>God is faithful, and neuer ſuffereth ſuch as are his to bee tryed aboue that which they are able to beare,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.13. And therefore verie true it is <hi>that wee are preſſed in euerie ſort, but not craſed or broken, beeing in want and penurie wee are not deſtitute and diſtreſſed, beeing perſecuted we are not forſaken, being beaten downe we periſh not,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.8. In a word if we ought to iudge of the nature of thinges, according to their laſt effect and working, this <hi>browne or tanned colour</hi> is the meanes to come vnto our true and perfect whitenes, the ſufferings of this world beeing in no point comparable vnto the glory which way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1883:53"/>
for vs, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. the waie vnto which is the croſſe, or ſufferings, I meane for righteouſnes and for Ieſus chriſt: <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.11. This is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort which we ought at this day to oppoſe againſt theſe Daughters of the terreſtriall and earthlie Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, who think vs ſo poore and miſerable, not knowing what our riches are, &amp; how yet at this day it is in Aegypt that there is darcknes, and light in the land of Goſen onelie. Let vs giue them leaue therefore to iudge of our coulour <hi>black or browne,</hi> as they liſt; it ſufficeth vs that the ſpirit of God iudgeth altogither otherwiſe, to whoſe iudgement we appeale, being aſſured we ſhal get and win our cauſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The third point of this aduertiſement or leſſon, namely, that which the ſpouſe addeth, <hi>That this browne colour of hers</hi> is hapned her not from her birth, but by the means of the ſonnes of her Mother, who droue her out of doores, and ſet her in the parching of the ſunne, <hi>beeing conſtrained to keepe her ſelfe among ſtrange vineyards, whereas ſhee ought to haue kept her owne vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard:</hi> this I ſaie, containeth alſo an excellent doctrine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For the vnderſtanding whereof, wee muſt firſt of all note, that by this <hi>natural beutie and fairenes,</hi> with which this <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſunne-burning</hi> is contrary matched, is not vnderſtoode or meant the qualitie or condition of the children of God in their firſt generation and birth, according to the which they are borne in themſelues the children of wrath as are others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and conſequentlie are moſt foule, vile, and filthy: by reaſon whereof, the Church, which is the aſſemblie of the faithfull, is compared, in reſpect of her firſt eſtate, vnto a foule and filthie maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> child comming out of the womb of her mother, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.6. but we muſt refer the original and beginning of this <hi>beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> vnto her free vocation and calling or ſpiritual newe-birth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6. and to that which foloweth in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.4. and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verſes following. Hereunto accordeth that which is ſaid of Abraham himſelfe, <hi>Ioſua</hi> 24.2. to that beuty, that is to ſay, to that happie eſtate compared to the marriage of the Lord and of his church, (of the fianſailes whereof the contract is already made &amp; paſſed in moſt excellent magnificencie in the mount
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1883:53"/>
of Sinai, then when the tabernacle with all the ſeruice thereof was eſtabliſhed, <hi>the bodie whereof is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.17. Heb. 9.) to that beauty, I ſay, and brightnes, which againe ſhewed it ſelfe yet greater, in the time of Dauid and Salomon, (ſo long as hee continued wiſe) this ſunne-burnt hew of hers, which is here ſpoken of, is oppoſed: which may bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode after two ſorts: namely, referring it either to the great and horrible confuſion, which hapned more then once after the death of Ioſua, vntil the time of Dauid (as is to bee ſeene in the hiſtory of the Iudges) or els ſpeaking of other moſt ſtrange deſolations, which happened both in Iuda, vnder the moſt part of the kings which were of the race of Dauid, as alſo eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the kingdome of Iſrael, vntill the time that the poore Church was exiled and baniſhed among the barbarous and ſauadge nations, yea and after the returne from out of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity of Babylon, aſwel vnder the empire of the Greekes as alſo the Romans, euen to the comming and departure of Ieſus Chriſt, which confuſions and deſolations of the church wee maie ſay to haue beene in this place prophetically foretold by Salomon. And as for that which might heere bee replied, that mention is heere by name made of that baniſhment and driuing forth of hers which befel her, not by ſtraungers, but by ſuch as were within, whom the ſpouſe calleth <hi>the ſonnes of her mother:</hi> I aunſwere firſt, that the moſt notorious deſolations of the church, are not thoſe which hapned vnto the church of the Iewes, both by the people bordering about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſowed and ſcattered among them (whom they ſhould haue rooted out and exterminated) and by thoſe which were farther remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I meane, the Aſſyrians, Chaldaeans, Aegyptians &amp; others, of whom the holy &amp; ſacred hiſtories make mention: but thoſe which hapned by the negligence &amp; wickednes of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners &amp; rulers, as is in the hiſtorie of the Iudges expreſlie to be ſeen, and in the ciuil war, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. yea vnder Sampſon himſelf, whoſe life doth verie well declare, the little regard which the Leuits then had of their duty. But this is eſpecially to be ſeene in the ſtorie of the ciuil war againſt the Beniamites. As for the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1883:54"/>
hiſtory of the wicked kings, this is yet more notably to be ſeen aſwel in the kingdome of Iſrael, where the whole publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God was ouerthrowen and ruined, and the Leuites themſelues driuen forth and expulſed, ſo far that the reſt of the poore Prophets were conſtrained to bee hidden in holes and dennes, and that by the ſingular bountie and goodnes of one man, there to be noriſhed and ſuſtained with bread and water: 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.13. as alſo in the kingdome of Iuda, in which the faithful ſeruants of God had no worſe nor no crueller enimies then the Kings and the Prieſtes, namely vnder Achaz: 2. <hi>King.</hi> 16.12. and vnder Manaſſes: 2. <hi>King.</hi> 21.9. Secondly it is to bee noted that when the Lord exerciſed his iuſt iudgements vpon his people by ſtraunge nations neare or far off, it was in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alwaies becauſe of the outrages and enormities commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within, both by the prieſts, and by other the gouernours and officers, ſo that this poore deſolate ſpouſe doth iuſtly and by good right impute al this miſchiefe and miſery which hath ſo disfigured and marred her fauour, to <hi>the ſonnes of her Mother,</hi> who draue her forth out of <hi>her owne vineyard,</hi> and ſet her foorth to the open parching of the ſunne, that is to al the iniuries and contumelies which might happen to a poore vagabound ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and made a ſlaue to ſtrangers her enemies.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To go on, we are to obſerue that it is not in this place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that the heritage and poſſeſſion aſſigned and allotted to the Church of the Iewes (I meane the land of Chanaan) is compared to a vineyard well planted, well husbanded, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned and compaſſed about with good ditches for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſafegard, and bleſſed moſt plentifully with al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bleſſings: but alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. by Aſaph in the time of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and Salomon, and afterward by <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Eze.</hi> 17. which was afterward moſt largely and amply expounded by the Lord himſelf: <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33. Neither is it without moſt great and waighty reaſon that the holy Ghoſt vſeth this ſimilitude as being marueilous apt &amp; conuenient, ſeeing there is no kind of poſſeſſion more profitable and fruitfull, or which requireth more care and diligence to bee husbanded and trimmed. And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1883:54"/>
becauſe that as there is but one god, ſo there is but one faith &amp; one Church, as alſo at that time there was but one onely land conſecrated and halowed vnto God, one onely people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the couenant, one onely place eſtabliſhed and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated in Ieruſalem for the outwarde ordinarie ſeruice of the Lord: therefore the ſpouſe ſpeaketh here but of one vineyard in the ſingular number, to the which the ſtraunge vineyards are contrary oppoſed in the plural number, becauſe falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes and religions, and falſe Churches are without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Shee complaineth therefore that <hi>the ſonnes of her mother,</hi> ſuffered her not to bee maintained in the poſſeſſion of <hi>her owne vineyard</hi> where ſhee might haue beene well brought vp and preſerued vnder couert, in her bewty. And if a man demaund the queſtion wherefore ſhee called not rather them of whom ſhee complaineth, ſonnes of her father or her bretheren, then <hi>ſonnes of her mother</hi>; I anſwere, that this was therefore, becauſe ſhe meant by this meanes ſo to ſpare her mother and her halfe brethren, by a modeſty verie ſitting and beſeeming the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vnder which the true Church is here repreſented vnto vs, that notwithſtanding ſhee would not keepe it ſilent, that her mother had forgotten herſelfe, I mean this very ſame Church conſidered as it were in an other perſon, the mother of her, which here complaineth, to wit, in aſmuch as ſhe ordered and ruled herſelfe well at the beginning, but after that ſhee had brought forth this we here ſpeake of vnto the Lorde, ſhee was turned aſide afterwardes after ſtraunge gods in all manner of outragious diſſolution, as the Prophets ſo oft and in ſo manie places vpbraide her. She confeſſeth therfore that thoſe of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee complaineth, that is to ſay, the wicked gouernours and falſe paſtours, are indeede iſſued and deſcended from her mother, but not in true and lawfull wedlocke, as is at large handled by Ezechiel in his 16. Chapter aboue alleadged, and vnder the names of two ſiſters repreſenting the two kingdomes of Iſraell and of Iuda, Chapter 23. and by the other Prophetes. This is then as much, as if ſhee called
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1883:55"/>
them in plaine termes baſtardes, as in the <hi>Pſalme</hi> 144.11. but that, as I ſaide before, this manner of ſpeaking is more milde and modeſt, which Dauid alſo in the perſon of Chriſt vſeth, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 69.8.</p>
            <p n="7">7 And we muſt note well theſe woordes, <hi>That the ſonnes of her mother were angrie againſt this spouſe.</hi> The cauſe hereof is elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where declared to be, becauſe <hi>he which doth euil hateth the light,</hi> for that his workes are by it reprooued, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19. and becauſe alſo the Church is not of the worlde, <hi>the amitie wherof is enmitie with God,</hi> Iames 4.4. Behold then how the world vſeth it ſelfe, which beeing in the middeſt of the church of God hateth it without cauſe; who is angry alſo, but after an other faſhion. For the Church is not angry with the perſons, but with the ſinnes of them who ſeeke their owne deſtruction, whom ſhe alſo ſeeketh to drawe thence by all meanes, requiting them with good for their euill. Beſides, it is well to bee noted, that theſe baſtard brethren vſe not onlie miſchieuous counſaile againſt their ſiſter, but when it ſo pleaſeth God, diſpoſſeſſe her for a time, and enioy the vineyarde themſelues vntill the Lord reſtore againe the heritage to the right owner and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. and <hi>Math.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p n="8">8 This place therefore containeth a moſt excellent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and ſuch, as is of all other moſt neceſſarie for vs in theſe daies, to bee a warning vnto them, who in our time think it ſo ſtrange a point of doctrine which we teach, and which is moſt cleare and euident, namely that the deſolation of the chriſtian church is proceeded from thoſe wicked vinekeepers, who haue laide it ſo waſt, that ſcarcely there remained any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>the vineyarde</hi> within theſe ſeuenty years. This ſeemeth I ſay ſo ſtrange a matter vnto them, that this is at this day the point, whereon many doe eſpecially ſtand, and will not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues acknowledge, or abide that others ſhould confeſſe the poore church was euer ſo <hi>blacke burnt,</hi> which recouereth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by litle and litle her bewtifull hew, and deſireth to be repoſſeſſed in her vineyard (which is not at this day one onely region and countrie, or one only city, but the whole v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1883:55"/>
worlde which ought to acknowledge his Lorde and redeemer, the ſonne of God) of all which countrie ſhee hath been by litle &amp; litle diſpoſſeſſed, by thoſe two Sees oppoſed to that of Ieſus Chriſt, the one in the Eaſt, the other in the Weſt. Wee ſee howe the ſame happened ſo oft in the church of the Iewes, that it may be ſaid that amongſt al thoſe which ruled &amp; gouerned it, we ſhall hardly find a douzen which were not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtroyers then builders (as the ſacred hiſtories can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) that being in the later times accompliſhed, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the proper perſon of the Lorde, which was foretolde <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 28.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33. the city of Hieruſalem being ſpecially called the murdering citie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. They muſt therefore now bring vs forth ſome propheſie or pomiſe, by which the priuilege may appear, which they ſay is granted vnto the city and See of Rome, to be not only the mother city of the vniuerſall Church, as ſhee was of the auncient Romane empire, but alſo to haue this prerogatiue, that ſhee can neuer erre. But ſo far ſhe is from being ſuch, that contrarywiſe ſhe is pointed out as it were by the finger to be the See of Apoſtaſie, both by Saint Paul, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. and by Saint Iohn in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps, and by many auncient fathers both Greeke and Latin, although they in their time ſawe not that which was alreadie before their eies. Neither is this come to paſſe onely in this See which is the Image of the beaſt, namely of the Romane Empire which it ſucceeded, but alſo in other Churches of all the foure corners and quarters of the worlde, being a thing eaſie to be ſhewen, that according to that which S. Paul fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. there is ſcant any hereſie riſen in the church, ſince the time of the Apoſtles, which was not either firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or afterward ſet forwarde and coloured, by falſe Biſhops, Prieſts, or Monckes. And yet in our time beholde thoſe which hinder the work of the Lord, and will not ſuffer that the <hi>vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde,</hi> which they haue ſo vnhappily and pittifully handeled, and as much as lay in them vtterly deſtroied and laid waſt, be reſtabliſhed in the handes of faithful paſtours, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Lorde of the <hi>vineyarde</hi> will doe in his good time,

               <hi>black and ſun-burnt</hi> ſoeuer ſhe be through this hard and il vſage and entertainement ſhe hath had, ſhe now beſeecheth him to tel her, <hi>where ſhe may find him,</hi> to bee not onelie reeſtabliſhed in her former eſtate, but which is more, to come nearer vnto him then euer ſhe was, to the end ſhe may be the more adorned &amp; beutified by him. This is the ſumme of that which is taught vs in this verſe, containing a moſt excellent and moſt neceſſarie doctrine, eſpeciallie for this time wherein wee now liue, in which the queſtion of the reſtabliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this poore ſpouſe ſo miſerablie disfigured by her paſtors, is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers moſt debated and handled. Now there is not a woord in this place which hath not in it a marueilous waight. Let vs therefore note, firſt of al, to whom ſhe ſpeaketh, and then with what a vehement affection ſhe ſpeaketh, and thirdly what ſhe meaneth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſaith, <hi>O thou who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſoule loueth</hi> &amp;c. She ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto her Bridegrome, her beloued, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſhe proteſteth that ſhe ſpeaketh vnfainedly and without hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, euen with the whole affection of her hart: and to induce him to aunſwer her, ſhe maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her entire amity &amp; loue which ſhe beareth him. Firſt of all therefore let vs learne heere this leſſon, that when the queſtion is of returning and bringing back againe the Church of God after theſe deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to hir true beuty &amp; brightnes, we may not talk of ſeeking the manner and means to doe this in our owne braine, but we muſt haue an eie vnto God, to whom alone it appertaineth, to cloth and trimme vp his ſpouſe after his owne liking: and if we doe otherwiſe, wee goe about nothing elſe but to diſguiſe and disfigure her, ſometime after one faſhion, ſometimes after another, as wee ſee it hath hapned heretofore in the Chriſtian church, and is much to be feared leaſt it alſo happen and come to paſſe in our time. For from whence came this transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the chriſtian church, but from this, that the ſucceſſours of the firſt paſtors eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, in ſteed of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping themſelues to theſe ſimple and natiue ornaments, which the true Apoſtles had cut out, &amp; prouided &amp; fitted this ſpouſe withal, would needes ſet vp a ſeruice of their owne, with ſuch
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1883:57"/>
faſhions and manners of doing, as are ſome of them manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie borrowed from Iudaiſme, others taken from Paganiſme it ſelfe, others forged and inuented according to the luſt &amp; fancy of certain biſhops: &amp; as ſome churches had authority &amp; credit aboue others, ſo theſe ceremonies were accordingly receiued either more or leſſe, vntil at the laſt they became <hi>catholick,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>vniuerſal.</hi> I ſpeake of nothing here which may not be ſhewn in particular, &amp; that by euident teſtimonies, if the time would ſuffer me. And how came theſe vp? Vnder a ſhadowe &amp; colour of deuotion forſooth, &amp; of making the ſeruice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians more goodly &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable. And what is come of this? Mary this, that our crafty &amp; ſuttle enimy ſeruing himſelfe by litle &amp; litle, euen by them who thought to doe the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is at length come vnto that he alwaies aimed &amp; ſhot at, which is to transforme &amp; change the pure and chaſt ſpouſe of the Lord into a painted &amp; diapred harlot. So fell it out in the church of the Iſraelites, when in lieu of conſidering what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had ſaid &amp; taught them, &amp; what himſelfe had diligently &amp; exactly obſerued, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5. namely <hi>that he did all things according to the model &amp; pattern which he had ſeen in the mount,</hi> Exod. 25.40. with an expreſſe commandement vnto the Iſraelits, <hi>not to ad or diminiſh any thing from that, which the Lord had expreſly ordained by his word,</hi> Deut. 4.2. they preſumed to mingle with it their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; inuentions, ſuch as were not only vaine &amp; fruſtratory, as the lord ſpeaketh of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 29.13. but finally ſuch as were abominable &amp; directly oppoſed againſt the commandement of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6. Behold how men turning themſelues aſide by litle &amp; litle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of god, do firſt build hay &amp; ſtubble, holding notwithſtanding the foundation, as the Apoſtle fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſawe &amp; foretold, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. &amp; from thence, proceede to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe God himſelfe a law, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the admonitions &amp; aduertiſements of the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. &amp; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.18. &amp; the verſes following. The queſtion therefore being at this day of reforming the church, the day of the Lord being appeared aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to conſume &amp; deſtroy this ſtubble &amp; hay by <hi>that fiery fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming two edged ſword,</hi> Apoc. 1.16, as alſo to deſtroy by ſpirituall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1883:57"/>
armes &amp; weapons euery high thing which lifteth it ſelfe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt god, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. We are taught in this place to haue our recourſe to the only wiſedome of God (which is ſo exactly ſet downe &amp; enregiſtred in his word) doing nothing of our owne head, for feare our ſelues offend in that which we would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And would to god many had had more regard hereunto at the beginning then they haue had, whereas in many places ſome would needes moderate that which they ſhould vtterly haue rooted out, retaining in churches &amp; holy places made for deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, images, croſſes, albes, copes, with like trumpery, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling al theſe things, things indifferent, not regarding the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which chriſt hath to the contrary in this behalfe, ſpeaking of the waſhing of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the Phariſies, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.2. although waſhing of the hands be a thing in it ſelfe not only indifferent, but ſuch as might wel couer it ſelfe with the cloake of honeſty &amp; cleanlineſſe. Others in lieu of contenting themſelues with the vocations and callings ordained by the holy ghoſt for the gouernment &amp; adminiſtration of the church of god, folowing heerein thoſe among the kings of Iuda, haue ſo reformed the church, that notwithſtanding they haue left the high places to ſtand vp ſtill: in ſuch ſort that in the end if God prouide not the better againſt it, they ſhal find they are fallen out of a cold ague into an hot feuer. The lord of his mercy remedy it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as this ſpouſe heere teacheth vs, &amp; the aunſwere which is made her afterwards by her bridegroome.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It pertaineth therfore to god alone to teach vs the forme of reforming his building, which is for this cauſe called <hi>the building of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. wherunto we are yet farder to adde, that it is belonging to him alone, euen then when he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned her, to giue vs eies to know her to be ſuch as ſhee is, that ſo we may adioin our ſelues vnto her. For otherwiſe, the ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is the ornament of the church which beutifieth it, &amp; diſcerneth &amp; ſeuereth it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world (the apparance &amp; ſhew whereof doth deceiue vs) 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. wil be vnto vs either an offence, or a mockery, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. He muſt therefore <hi>giue vs eies to ſee,</hi> Pſal. 146.8. <hi>eares vnto our hart to heare,</hi> Pſal. 40.8. in a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1883:58"/>
word, <hi>we muſt be taught of him</hi>: Eſay 54.13. <hi>of him</hi> I ſay, <hi>who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs into al truth</hi>: Ioh. 16.13. which the ſpouſe in this place deſireth, in this deſolation of hers, wherein we ſee her to be at this daie. For if this light is not then knowen of men, when it ſhineth moſt clearly, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. what might it be when God ſo long a time withdrew this light from the world? It is therefore to God that we muſt ſay, <hi>ſhew me where thou feedeſt thy flock.</hi> But this is not yet enough to deſire to learne this of him, but wee muſt demaund with a true &amp; ardent deſire, not bringing anie thing elſe but a true and vpright affection and deſire of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing of the glorie of God. And this is it which this ſpouſe teſtifieth by theſe words, <hi>O thou whom my ſoule loueth,</hi> that is to ſay, O my Bridegroome and Sauiour, vnto whom I haue dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and yeelded vp my whole affection. It is no maruaile therefore, if we ſee at this daie the woorke of God, inſteede of going forward to go backward; yea the darknes redoubled in manie places, in the which the ſunne of truth began to ſhine verie clearely: for experience hath prooued vnto vs that there are but too manie which haue ſpoiled the harlot of her trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and iewels, not to doe with them as Moſes did with the golden calfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.20. or as Ezechias with the brazen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. as neither is it requiſite wee ſhould alwaies doe the like, or that wee may not turne that to good and holie vſes which was before applied vnto ſuperſtition, but (dare I ſpeak it? Yea) but make their own ſtate the mightier by that of another, leauing Ieſus Chriſt as the ſoldiers did which crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him either ſtark naked, or at leaſt but badly &amp; ſoryly clad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the effects whereof we ſee already, giuing them occaſion which are culpable of this euil to think vpon it, &amp; to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue done better, to thank god therefore, &amp; to take heed of it. For ſo to doe is not to loue God, but the goods of God, more then God and without God: whereas the true ſpouſe prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth here that ſhee loueth and ſeeketh after her Bridegrome, with all the affection and deſire ſhe hath. That ſhee therefore maketh proteſtation of this loue of hers towards God, it is not to alleadge her own merit or deſeruing, as if God were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1883:58"/>
bound to graunt her her requeſt. For contrarywiſe ſith the loue which wee beare vnto our God is the free gift of him, <hi>who loued vs firſt,</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.10. <hi>then when we were his enemies,</hi> Rom. 5.10. it followeth that if wee loue him, we are therefore behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto him and not hee vnto vs; beſides that our loue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth him nought at all. It is therefore an abſurd thing and contrarie to the grace of God, to thinke that this dilection or loue is meritorious: but this letteth not but that wee may and ought to make mention vnto him of his own giftes, to the end it would pleaſe him to acknowledge vs for his, and bleſſe vs for thoſe markes wherewith it hath pleaſed him to marke vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let vs come now vnto that which the ſpouſe deſireth to know of him, which is in ſumme, that it would pleaſe him <hi>to tel her the place, where hee feedeth and cauſeth his flocke to reſt at noone:</hi> that is to ſay, in the heat of the day. This is a thing verie common and accuſtomable in the Scripture, to attribute the name of Paſtor or ſheepeheard to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the name of flock vnto his church. Hence it followeth that by the paſture or foode, wee muſt vnderſtand the worde of God, and by the paſturing places, thoſe places where this word is ſincerely taught and adminiſtred. This needeth no proofe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole ſcripture both of the old &amp; of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is full of proofes and teſtimonies hereof. Inſteede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſtanding vpon the reaſons &amp; grounds of this allegory, albeit they containe a goodly and excellent doctrine, we will firſt of all aunſwere and reſolue a doubt which may bee made in this place. For if the church which is but one, is brought in, ſpeaking in this place, and herſelfe is the flocke of Chriſt, what is this flocke which ſhe asketh and ſeeketh after? If here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome man reply and aunſwere that it is true indeede, there is but one Church of God, but that this church is parted and diuided as it were into two, namely, into that companie which is alreadie gathered vp on high, which we commonly call <hi>the triumphant Church,</hi> compoſed and made of the ſpirits and ſoules of the iuſt: whereof mention is made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. and that which is here belowe which we call <hi>the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1883:59"/>
as Saint Paul alſo diuideth this familie into two, whereof the one part is in heauen, &amp; the other in the earth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.16. and 20. if a man I ſay ſo aunſwere this doubt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be indeede in heauen that our true repoſe and reſt lieth, yet is this nothing to the matter. For there is no <hi>parching of the noone-day.</hi> Farther the verſe going before, and the anſwere of the Bridegroome contained in the verſe following ſheweth that the point in queſtion here is of the comforting &amp; reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of the Church deſolated and waſted by diſorders and perſecutions, as we haue before at large handled.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Albeit therefore there is but one Church, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this letteth not but that it may be conſidered in mo parts euen in this world, whereof ſome being disfigured by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſeeke after other which are in peace. So we ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience at this day that the Church of God being moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly perſecuted and depriued of the publique and pure exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of religion in ſome places of the world, is releeued elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where and comforted, &amp; inioyeth by an eſpecial grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God hir liberty, who reſerueth for his poore children ſome place of refuge and refreſhing.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But it ſeemeth that yet more properly to ſpeake &amp; more neere to the point, the church being as it were vniuerſally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and woonderfully disfigured demaundeth here of hir Bridegroome, how and by what meanes hee is accuſtomed to maintain and nouriſh his Church with this paſture, againſt all the afflictions, ſtormes and tempeſtes of this worlde. And therefore is as much as if ſhe ſhould ſay, that though ſhee bee brought into poore eſtate, yet hath ſhe not for all that loſt any whit of her courage, or changed her affection at al, as it is ſaide <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.18. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.39. but that amiddeſt them, amongſt whom ſhe is, &amp; in ſo troubleſom a time ſhe hath as it were loſt the footing of the right way, as beeing brought into a deſert &amp; wilderneſſe: which cauſeth her to deſire her Bridegroome it may pleaſe him to direct her and to point her out which way ſhee ſhall take to finde and to come vnto her true repoſe and reſt. In a word to vnderſtand this place aright, let vs ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1883:59"/>
vs the ſtate of the church of the Lord, in which it was but threeſcore or fourſcoure years ago: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if a man had dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what maner of booke the Bible was or the new Teſtament, he ſhould hardly haue found one among a thouſand of them which named themſelues chriſtians, which knew what it was, much leſſe which vnderſtood what was meant by the law &amp; the Goſpel. Neither doe wee doubt, but that ſuch as it pleaſed God to vouchſafe his grace to enquire after the right way, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſuch deſarts, &amp; to find it, to teach it vs &amp; to bring vs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their holy labor &amp; trauel, did ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make the ſame prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto God, which this ſpouſe beeing in the like eſtate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here, without which praier themſelues &amp; we ſhould haue periſhed with others, with the reſt of the world. And yet at this daie what doe all the true faithfull beleeuers in thoſe places and kingdomes where they mourne and languiſh, but praie vnto the Lord to teach them the right waie amidſt thoſe laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes in which they are, and to guide them to thoſe places where God doth feed his ſheep in al abundance and in excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ſafety.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Behold I ſay what the true children of God, hauing great want of that which we haue in all aboundance, deſire of God euery day with vnſpeakable ſighinges and teares, whileſt wee deſpiſe the bounty and liberality of the Lord, and turne vpon our heads into iuſt iudgement, the grace and mercy of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by our wicked and diſſolute liuing. And what ſhal we ſaie of them, who enioying the places of ſuch a reſt, ſeeke after So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Gomorra, departing as Lot did out of Abrahams houſe? <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10. by reaſon whereof he found himſelfe ſoone after in il caſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.12. yea with his whole family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. which was finally curſed of God and ſhut out and excluded from his people. I knowe what the replies of ſuch men are, that the goſpel is not encloſed &amp; ſhut vp within the walles of one city, which is verie true. But notwithſtanding the ſpouſe demaundeth in this place, where the place is that hee feedeth and repoſeth or reſteth his ſheep. Neither ſerueth the reply of ſuch men to any purpoſe, namely, that in what place ſoeuer
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1883:60"/>
they bee they wil ſerue God; and if they cannot haue the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exerciſe of the word of God, they wil read the Scripture, and wil pray in their houſes. I anſwere that Lot alſo when hee was in Sodom afflicted his ſoule, which they for the moſt keep themſelues wel from: 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. and yet we ſee that neither he nor his Daughters learned any thing there which was ought worth: <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.8.16.31.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The firſt point therefore of this demand is to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt retire our ſelues, not to periſh with the woorlde, but to be fed to eternal life. This is meant by theſe words <hi>where thou feedeſt</hi> In which we are alſo to note that it is not ſaid <hi>where men feede,</hi> but <hi>where thou feedeſt:</hi> whereby it is ſhewed vs that we muſt ſeek for this food elſewhere then in our ſelues, to wit, in him of whom onely it is ſaid, that he hath <hi>life in himſelfe,</hi> Ioh. 5.26. and who is the <hi>bread of life:</hi> Ioh. 6.35. and that we ſeeke it no where elſe but there where he feedeth vs, I meane, as Saint Peter teſtifieth, there where his word is announced and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, when he ſaith: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.68. <hi>to whom ſhall wee goe? Thou haſt the words of eternal life,</hi> after that he had heard a little before of him, the words which I ſpeake vnto you are <hi>ſpirit and life.</hi> For which cauſe alſo, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. he is called the <hi>word of life.</hi> This is then the onely great paſtor and ſhepheard of our ſoules, who feedeth his ſheepe, hauing ſpoken firſt of al vnto the fathers in diuerſe ſorts and at ſundry times, and laſt of all hauing declared vnto vs in perſon al the <hi>will of his father,</hi> Ioh. 15.15. and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hauing giuen and giuing euery daie paſtours and teachers: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. of whom it is ſaid <hi>As my father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you:</hi> Ioh. 20.21. not to ad notwithſtanding or to diminiſh any thing from the doctrine alreadie preached by the maſter, but according to the tenour of their commiſſion limited to that which they haue <hi>heard and receiued:</hi> Matth. 28.20. and Act. 4.20.</p>
            <p n="8">8 From thence alſo flow 2. other points of moſt neceſſary doctrin. Firſt that the Church is not there where men do feed, that is to ſay, doe teach their owne inuentions, whether they forge a doctrine altogither new, <hi>Eſay</hi> 29.13. or whether they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1883:60"/>
adde, change or diminiſh anie thing from the word firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and afterward regiſtred by the Prophets and Apoſtles, which the Lord calleth the <hi>leauen of the Phariſees</hi>: Mat. 16.11. &amp; whereof the Apoſtle diſtinctly and expreſly ſpeaketh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2 from the 16. verſ. vnto the end of the Chapter. Secondly that as little ought euery aſſembly to bee called the church, in the which there is no feeding, but foding of the poore people with ſongs and right maſquerades and mummeries, and that in an vnknowen language: among whom, euen thoſe which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp the names of paſtors are dumb dogs, deuouring the ſheep <hi>as it were bread,</hi> Pſal. 14.4. in ſteed of feeding them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.10. and not only ignoraunt, and vtterly vnable and vnfit for their calling, but euen vnworthy of the name of Chriſtians, hauing neuer learned, nay not ſo much as once thought vpon indeed what chriſtian religion meaneth, <hi>who neither enter in themſelues into the kingdome of heauen, nor ſuffer others to enter thereinto,</hi> Luk. 11.52. that beeing truelie fulfilled in them which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde by <hi>Eſai,</hi> 28.9. and ſo on. Now whether at this daie and heretofore, the clergie of Rome, who attribute vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the name of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> bee ſuch or no, the verie children themſelues can iudge and perceiue.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The ſpouſe addeth <hi>And where thou cauſeſt thy flock to reſt at noone.</hi> Which is added to declare by this effect, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which is betweene this paſture and foode, and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides. For if wee ſhall conſider in particular of all that which men haue euer inuented and forged to haue reſt in their minde and conſciences, wee ſhall find, that all is nought elſe but ſo manie dreames and doting fancies. For if we ſpeak of them whom men call and terme Philoſophers, they haue indeede by common conſent and accord ſaid, that man can finde no true repoſe or quiet but in that which is his ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good and happineſſe: wherein they ſaie moſt true: but themſelues neuer agreeing or according hereupon, what this ſoueraigne good or happines and felicity was, how could they ſhewe others the way to attaine vnto it? Some of them therefore (worthie rather to bee called hogges then men)
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1883:61"/>
haue ſought after this felicity, in the pleaſures of the body, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the perfection of the ſoule, ſuppoſing that it conſiſted in the knowledge, which man by himſelfe might attain vnto, of diuine and humane thinges, which they called wiſedome: others making a more exquiſite anatomie of the partes of the ſoule, added hereunto many other vertues concerning the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of this life, deliuering forth hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many goodly ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſayings: but vaniſhing away in the end, both becauſe they were ignorant of the true vertues indeed, which are no where elſe taught but in the ſchool of the lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo becauſe there was neuer yet found the man, in whom theſe vertues might bee found in ſuch ſort, as themſelues haue deſcribed them. Others haue gone yet farther, and babled ſomething of eternal life and of the coniunction of the ſoule of ſuch as are vertuous with God. But what? Being ignorant of the true god, and knowing as litle the way to come vnto him, &amp; farther, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much as thinking vpon the reſurrection of the body, the ſame is hapned vnto them which S. Paul declared &amp; ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Athens <hi>Act,</hi> 17.22. &amp; which he hereof writeth, <hi>Ro.</hi> 1.21.</p>

Saint Iohn anſwereth, that it is al that which is contrary to the lawe or the wil of god declared in his word, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.4. which may and muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto three points: the firſt comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth al our thoughts, words and actions diſagreeing neuer ſo little from the will of god, that is to ſay, which agree not with the entire and perfect reuerence and duety which we owe vnto our God and to our neighbors: the ſecond point conſiſteth in the root fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence al theſe ſtincking &amp; infected fruits do proceed, I meane al that pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; moſt ſtincking filthines of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both within &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: by reaſon wherof it is ſaid, that we are <hi>by nature the children of wrath:</hi> Eph. 2.3. that we are carrions <hi>dead in our ſins:</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. and 5. that we cannot ſo much as <hi>thinke of thoſe things which are of God,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.5. that the <hi>wiſedome of the fleſh is enmity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. nothing beeing left vnto vs but that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs altogether <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> Rom. 1.20. beſides infinite moe the like ſentences, ſcattered throughout the whole ſcripture, ſhewing that man without excepting any thing in him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, is altogether ſubiect &amp; enthrawled to this corruption, which we call original ſinne: which though it hath not aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in vs the ſubſtance of the ſoul or of the body (farder then that thereby the body is made ſubiect to corruption to return to duſt &amp; powder for a time) yet it hath chaunged the light of the vnderſtanding into darckneſſe, the integrity &amp; vprightnes thereof into al wicked qualities, and to ſpeake in a word, hath blotted out the Image of God, which ſhined before in the firſt creation of man. The third point lieth in this, that beeing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for reaſonable creatures, not only not to ſin, but which is more, to conforme our whole life to the wil of God, the rule of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1883:62"/>
all righteouſneſſe, wee find that this third point is wanting in vs with all the reſt, to wit, the accompliſhment of this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now there is no one of theſe three points which bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs not, without al manner of reply to the contrary, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condemnation, God the Creator beeing a reuenger of all ſinne, the <hi>wages of which ſinne is death:</hi> Rom. 6.23. who cannot ſuffer any manner of pollution, be it neuer ſo litle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. &amp; who cannot, nor wil not any way renounce his holineſſe &amp; righteouſneſſe. Now let men ſeeke how many remedies they will for theſe ineuitable miſeries of man, and they ſhall not finde them in any other thing whatſoeuer, ſaue only in Chriſt alone. For the queſtion being here neceſſarily of bearing the burden of the wrath of God without being quelled &amp; preſſed downe therewith, this force and power can be attributed to no creature, without it be made as ſtrong, yea as I may ſo ſay, more ſtrong then God, as was figured in the wraſtling of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. And whereas the Angels themſelues which remained in their firſt eſtate, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. could not bear this burden without being ruined &amp; ouerwhelmed therewith, &amp; that without any riſing vp again, <hi>Iud.</hi> 6. &amp; 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. how could men, being but men, and borne deteſtable ſinners, ſuſtain ſuch a waight? For want of which force, eternall fire is prepared for euer for the diuell &amp; the wicked, that is to ſay, for al them which are out of Ieſus Chriſt, being a thing vtterly vnpoſſible for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſound the depth of the infinit malediction of God who is infinit. To whom then ſhall we haue our recourſe? To him who cauſeth ſuch as be his to reſt ſafely &amp; ſurely <hi>at noone,</hi> to him I ſay, who being the eternal ſonne of god, hath taken vpon him the form of a ſeruant, to be wholy &amp; fully our righteouſnes, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and redemption, conceiued and borne of a virgine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the fleſh without ſin or ſpot at all: to the end that by his naturall and perfect integrity, our originall pollution and vncleanneſſe ſhould be couered, being made a woorthy prieſt without ſpot or blame, and an entire &amp; perfect oblation &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for vs, <hi>bearing our ſins vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe in his own body,</hi> 1.

with all rigor and ſeuerity al the paines due vnto al the ſinnes, of all the elect of God, from the beginning of the worlde, vntill the end thereof. For which cauſe Eſay witneſſeth that <hi>our chaſtiſement was laid vpon him,</hi> Eſay. 53.5. and 6. &amp;c. yea ſo farre as to bee made <hi>a curſe for vs,</hi> Gal. 3.13. to the end that wee might bee made bleſſed in him before God.

This is then againe in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alone, that wee finde this full and perfect obedience oppoſed to the imperfection euen of them which are moſt iuſt and holy. It is he alone who hath clothed himſelfe with our nature ſubiected to the Lawe to deliuer thoſe which are culpable from the tranſgreſſion thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. being fully obedient vnto God his father according to the firſt table of the Lawe, vnto death, euen to the death of the Croſſe. And touching the ſecond table, hee hath alſo giuen himſelfe to death <hi>for his enimies:</hi> Rom. 5.8. yea hauing loued vs aboue the commandement of the law, namely, not as much as himſelfe, but more then himſelfe: to the end that truely firſt of all wee ſhould be exempted from al conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being vnited &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. &amp; then, which more is, be found ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; bewtified <hi>with his true and perfect righteouſneſſe,</hi> Phil. 3.9. to haue a part in the life eternall.

            <p n="2">2 Nowe for the better vnderſtanding of what waight this reaſon is, wee muſt knowe what theſe companions are with their flockes. For may it be ſaid that Ieſus Chriſt hath any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions? No: if we ſpeake properly: which thing muſt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly handled, that we fall not into moſt great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous errors. We haue therefore to conſider in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt two principall points, namely his perſon and his office of mediation. As touching his diuinity there is no compariſon betwixt him and any creature: and we muſt hold this generall ſentence without exception, that God will neuer giue either in whole or in part, his honor vnto an other: which doth fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally ouerthrowe all kind of Idolatries whatſoeuer. As touching his humanity being diſtinctly and by it ſelfe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he is called indeed ſonne of man, that is to ſay, true ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all and through all, of like nature in ſubſtance of body and of ſoul with vs, being in this reſpect extracted &amp; brought from <hi>Adam</hi>; as Luke witneſſeth in his genealogie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.38. but as touching the qualities of the ſame nature, otherwiſe qualified altogether then they who are not regenerated by the ſpirite, betweene whom &amp; him there is no more agreeableneſſe then betweene <hi>light and darckneſſe,</hi> 2. Cor. 6.14. And as touching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are changed &amp; renewed by his ſpirit, there is truly a very great agreeableneſſe and accord, being guided and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1883:64"/>
by the ſame ſpirite, enlightening <hi>their vnderſtanding,</hi> Epheſ. 1.18. and creating in them both <hi>to will and to doe,</hi> Phil. 2.13. to be <hi>followers of him,</hi> Epheſ. 5.1. <hi>walking as hee hath walked:</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.6. by reaſon of which conformity they are alſo called the <hi>children of God,</hi> Ioh. 1.12. and <hi>light,</hi> Epheſ. 5.8. but the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality is very great: firſt, becauſe he is the eſſential fountaine and ſpring of all grace, in aſmuch as hee is God. Secondly becauſe hee is as it were the channell and baſon, touching his humanity, into which all graces in all perfection haue beene powred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean, out of his diuinity and Godhead, into his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity &amp; manhood: to the end that all of vs might draw from thence euery one <hi>his meaſure,</hi> Ioh. 1.16. and 1. Cor. 12.11. not that he hath the leſſe for al this, or that he hath one part, &amp; we an other, but that his plenteouſneſſe and aboundance ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floweth vpon vs, without diminiſhing of any whit thereof in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It remaineth we ſpeake of his office of mediatorſhippe, whereupon we ought generally to note, that the ſonne of god beeing come in fleſhe, to purchaſe this ſpouſe by the blood of himſelfe, he is ſo iealous of her, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer be brought to quit any one point of this amity and loue of his to an other, nay he hath often taken her againe vnto him, howe lewdly ſoeuer ſhee had behaued her ſelfe, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3.1. The better to vnderſtand this, and that in the quality of his mediatorſhip, and of that which hee hath doone for his ſpouſe, he hath no companion, we wil, as the author of the epiſtle to the Hebrues doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> referre the whole vnto three points, namely to his <hi>dignity Royall,</hi> his <hi>ſtate Propheticall,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Prieſthood:</hi> in reſpect of which three points wee may and ought truely to ſay, that hee hath, to ſpeake properly, no companion, albeit hee hath as it were his officers and ſeruants, with whom in certaine pointes and after a certaine ſort he ſerueth himſelfe. In which thing many verie great and pernicious abuſes are committed, as we wil by gods helpe afterwardes declare. Ieſus Chriſt therefore is only king, not only in that he is creator and gouernour of the worlde in ſoueraign degree with God his father &amp; with the holy ghoſt:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1883:64"/>
but ſpecially King of a Kingdoome, <hi>which is not of this woorlde,</hi> concerning the conſcience, beeing ſpirituall and eternal, in ſuch ſort, that vnto him alone it appertaineth, <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and to forbid,</hi> Ioh. 13.13. <hi>to iudge and to abſolue,</hi> 1. Cor. 5.4. hauing <hi>the keies to open and to ſhut,</hi> Apocalyps 3.7. So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it beene, nor is, nor maie bee lawfull at anie time for any beſides, no, not for the Angels themſelues, to make a Law to binde the conſcience, nor to eſtabliſh, in any point concerning the ſubſtance thereof, the gouernment of the Church. The reaſon hereof is moſt <hi>iuſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>euident.</hi> Moſt iuſt, becauſe ſith this gouernment ſurpaſſeth the order it ſelfe and nature of this woorlde, there is none capable thereof but he which is true God, and together alſo man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with a wiſedome and power ſurpaſſing euen that of the Angels. Moſt euident alſo, becauſe that if it bee forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>to adde to, or diminiſh anie thing from the commaundementes</hi> of this Lawe-giuer, <hi>Deutr.</hi> 4.2. and 12.32. much more is it inhibited to make newe ordinances. And therefore it is ſaide by Eſay, <hi>Who required theſe things at your handes?</hi> Eſay. 1.12. And al the commaundementes of man, in the matter of this ſpirituall kingdome are once for all declared to bee nullities, Eſay 29.13. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.8. and 22. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. As touching this point therefore let this ſtand for a ſure ground and agreed vpon, that Ieſus Chriſt hath no companion in what ſort ſoeuer in this kingdome, and that he alone in this reſpect is King and Lorde of the vniuerſall Church, euen <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ends of the world &amp; for euer.</hi> Pſal. 2.8. and 110. as it alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed the writing ſet ouer his head on the Croſſe ſhould bear, Pilate not knowing what he did, how euer the Iewes were angry with it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Let vs come now to the 2. point which we called his ſtate &amp; office of being a <hi>Prophet,</hi> taking this appellation not ſtrictly as being giuen to certaine perſonages to prophecy &amp; foretell ſuch things as ſhould come to paſſe touching our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; the particular application of the threats &amp; promiſes of the law (ſuch as were the 15. Prophets whoſe writings we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1883:65"/>
haue, &amp; many others mentioned in the holy ſcriptures) but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this word of prophet generally, for a declarer of the wil of god touching our ſaluation, in which ſenſe Ieſus Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Prophet whom we muſt heare vnder paine of extermination,</hi> Deut. 18.15. as the ſame is expounded, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. I ſay then that as Ieſus Chriſt alone is properly the <hi>foundation of the Church,</hi> 1. Cor. 3.11. <hi>And by the Lord himſelfe,</hi> Eſay. 28.16. as it is alſo in him alone, in whom the church was <hi>elected before the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world,</hi> Ephe, 1.4. ſo alſo it is he alone which hath beene ordained from euerlaſting by the father to declare his wil vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that this is ſo, behold S. Paul who witneſſeth in expreſſe termes, that it was he which guided the people in the deſart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. as alſo it was he <hi>whoſe glory Eſay ſaw,</hi> Ioh. 1.41. In a word S.

Pet. 3.19. finally it is hee which came in fleſh, <hi>to manifeſt the wil of the father,</hi> &amp; to make the world altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inexcuſable, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22. &amp; 18.37. yea ſo far as to bee called <hi>the miniſter of the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> Rom. 15.8. that is to ſay of the Iews.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Let vs come vnto the ſtate of his prieſthood, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two points, namely in the <hi>expiation of our ſins,</hi> &amp; in his <hi>interceſſion</hi> for vs towards God his father. As touching this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, we muſt firſt of al conſider that this word importeth a ful &amp; entire paiment of al which is due vnto god, to the end he be altogether appeaſed &amp; ſatisfied. Secondly that, that which is due is <hi>death</hi> according to the ſentence giuen by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Rom</hi> 5.12. and 6.23. vnderſtanding by this worde <hi>Death,</hi> not only the ſeparation of the body and of the ſoule, whence there foloweth in vs the putrefectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body in the graue, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. but alſo that which is called the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> which is the more then terrible &amp; frightful fire &amp; maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, reuenging with all perpetuity ſin in the body and in the ſoule of the ſinner, the which horrible eſtate is eternal &amp; euerlaſting in the Diuell and all the damned. Thirdly we muſt conſider in this matter, that the queſtion is not of paying for one ſinner, but for all ſinners: nor for a certaine number of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1883:65"/>
ſinnes, but for all ſinnes, none excepted; I meane of al the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God which euer haue beene, or which are, or which ſhall be to the end and conſummation of the world. Fourthly we are expreſly to note, that it was neceſſary that this paiment ſhould bee offered by one who in reſpect of himſelfe was no waie bound to this malediction, but ſhould be a <hi>pledge and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertie</hi> for al others, as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. The reaſon is, becauſe that if he had been culpable in his owne perſon, he had been a ſinner, and conſequentlie nothing could haue proceeded from him, nor been receiued comming from him, which had not been vncleane &amp; defiled, &amp; therefore had not appeaſed, but alwaies augmented and ſharpened the anger of God, which thing was figured in the Lawe, by forbidding to <hi>offer anie thing leauened vnto God:</hi> Leuit. 2.11. as the Apoſtle declareth the ſame: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. as alſo by forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them <hi>which were vncleane to enter into the houſe of God</hi>: Pſal. 26.6. And farther becauſe together with the paiment due vnto vs by reaſon of our vnrighteouſneſſe, it behoued, to make vs worthie of eternall life, according to the agreement of God with vs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17. that this reconciliator and prieſt, ſhould be man entirely pure, without ſpot or blot in him whatſoeuer. Now all men are borne in ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth the effect of ſinne, <hi>which is death,</hi> whereunto wee are all of vs ſubiect: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.27. yea without excepting the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt infantes, which haue notwithſtanding committed <hi>no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of actual ſinne:</hi> Rom. 5.14. There is none then but one alone Ieſus Chriſt man, to whom this right of eternall life, according to the couenant of the Law, doth properlie appertaine: ſeeing that in him alone among the ſonnes of men, there is found this perfect purity of the humane nature which the Lawe both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and preſuppoſeth, in commanding a perfect loue of God and our neighbour, beeing conceiued and borne man of a virgin <hi>by the ſole and only operation of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Luk. 1.35. and not as al other men without exception, of whom it is ſaid <hi>that that which is borne of fleſh is fleſh</hi>: Ioh. 3 6. but <hi>without ſinne,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.21. and which more is beſides this natural integritie
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1883:66"/>
in which there is not the leaſt point of imperfection, it is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone which hath accompliſhed the whole Law in al perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hauing obeyed God his father, as touching the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement vnto death, yea the death of the croſſe: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. and touching the loue of neighbour, hauing giuen his owne life euen <hi>for his enemies,</hi> which is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue his neighbor as himſelfe: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.11. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. Whence it followeth that according vnto the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Law promiſing life eternal vnto him which ſhal entirely obſerue it, <hi>curſing him which ſhall faile in one point thereof,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Ieſus Chriſt alone hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited for all ſuch as beleeue, eternal felicitie, which Prieſt was altogether neceſſarie for vs, for the auoiding of death and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of life: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. In this then more then in the reſt, whereof wee before ſpake, hee hath no companion. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to conſider of the ſecond point of his prieſthoode, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, his <hi>interceſsion</hi> towardes God his Father for vs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two poyntes. The firſt is the force and vertue of the death of him comming betweene God and vs: for if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation and purging of our ſinnes goe not before, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but reiected of him, who hath no fellowſhip or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with darckneſſe. The ſecond point conſiſteth in this, that as all our prayers ought to bee made in his name, that is to ſaie, deſiring to bee heard for the loue of him, in whome alone the father is well pleaſed, ſo doth hee appeare as our elder brother before his father, not after the manner of men, who fal on their knees when they deſire anie thing of an earthlie Prince, and bring their ſupplication in their hands: but as it were repreſenting of vs in his owne perſon, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying our prayers, for which cauſe hee is called our <hi>Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate:</hi> 1. Iohn. 2.1. and Hebr. 7.25. And we muſt take diligent heede in this matter, how we meaſure his interceſſion ſuch as it is now in the Heauens, hauing nowe after his victorie <hi>a name which is aboue euerie name:</hi> Philip. 2.9. <hi>with all power in Heauen and in earth:</hi> Matth. 28.18. with that which wee reade of his prayers in the daies of his infirmitie. For then not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to ſhewe vs an example, but alſo becauſe to ouercome
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1883:66"/>
his enimies &amp; ours, and not to yeelde vnder the burden of the paine due vnto our ſinnes, which were imputed vnto him, as vnto our <hi>pleadge and ſuertie,</hi> it behooued indeede that hee ſhould bee borne vppe and ſuſtained by the diuine vertue and power, which though hee had in himſelfe in as much as hee is God <hi>coeternal and coeſſential,</hi> he attributeth notwithſtanding &amp; demandeth it altogether of the perſon of the father, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto the office of his <hi>Mediatorſhip,</hi> ſo as he is ſuppliant &amp; that with teares, yea as it were altogether <hi>troubled and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both for himſelfe</hi>: Ioh. 12.27. Mat. 26.39. Heb. 5.7. and alſo <hi>for vs,</hi> as it is in ſpecial ſhewed vs throughout the whole <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Ioh. 17. and elſewhere. But now <hi>that hee hath ledde captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie captiue:</hi> Epheſ. 4.8. being ſate at the right hand of the father <hi>crowned with glory and honor:</hi> Heb. 2.9. it is true indeede, that hee yet ſuffereth, as we may ſo ſay, <hi>in his members:</hi> Act. 9.4. and Col. 1.24. <hi>as he will charge the wicked therewith at the latter daie:</hi> Mat. 25.45. It is verie true alſo, that hee hath yet <hi>compaſsion of thoſe which are his:</hi> Heb. 4.15. But al this muſt bee vnderſtoode of a celeſtial faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; maner altogether vnknown vnto vs, without imagining an interceſſion by praiers agreeable vnto the ſtate of this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according vnto which maner Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe ſaith that being receiued vp into heauen, he wil not pray vnto the father. I mean ſo, as before our reconciliation made &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, &amp; before the glorification of our mediator: not that the effect of his ſacrifice once made doth not alwaies come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween god &amp; vs, &amp; that the father ſhould not be called vpon in the name of this mediator, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone our praiers are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto him. Now by all this it appeareth that Ieſus Chriſt touching his prieſthood hath no more a companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his ſtate roial, &amp; ſtate prophetical, wherof the Apoſtle hath giuen the reſolution in expreſſe terms, ſaying <hi>that there is but one mediator between god &amp; man, the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus chriſt,</hi> 1. Tim. 2.5.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Such the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the verity of god, neither is ther any other fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our hope. But better yet to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neceſſary, we muſt mark 2. certain points which ſeeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary it, to the end that this being finally cleared &amp; made
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1883:67"/>
plaine, wee maie the better know and vnderſtand what theſe companions are of whom the Church here complaineth, and who are the true deſtroiers of it. Firſt of al therefore vnto al this aboue ſaid may bee oppoſed that which is written touching this verie matter, and by the ſelfe ſame allegory, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.7. where it is ſaid <hi>that this king is perfumed aboue al his fellow compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> named by the ſelfe ſame name, which Salomon in this place vſeth, as alſo in this verie book, Chap. 8.13. Touching the firſt of theſe two places, it is not in the worſer part or ſenſe, as in this place which we now handle, it is, but in very good part, that mention is made of <hi>fellowes and companions</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, being verie clearly and plainly declared vnto vs, in what ſenſe Ieſus Chriſt hath fellowes and companions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.14. to witte, in this reſpect, that hauing taken vpon him our nature (howbeit without ſinne) hee hath made vs his brethren. But notwithſtanding, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, perfumed aboue his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and not like to like. He calleth vs his brethren, but he is the elder, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. and ſo conſequently <hi>lord of the houſe,</hi> Gen. 27.39. he is the onelie natural ſonne of God, in aſmuch as the humanity ſubſiſteth in the perſon of the onlie ſonne coeternal with God, and we are <hi>ſonnes in him by adoption,</hi> Ioh. 1.12. he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in his degree the <hi>heire and vniuerſall Lorde of all theſe thinges:</hi> Heb. 1.2. and notwithſtanding by grace he wil make vs <hi>coheirs</hi> in this glorie with himſelfe, without clipping or rebating any thing thereof in himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.22. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. Nowe as touching the ſecond place drawen out of this booke, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.13. it is not there ſpoken of men as companions of Ieſus chriſt, but becauſe all the faithfull are vnited and ioyned together by vnity of faith and of hope, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4. and by <hi>the bond of charitie,</hi> Act. 4.32. as ſhal be ſpoken in his dew place. A man might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo alleadge that he called his Diſciples <hi>frinds,</hi> and not, ſaith he, <hi>his ſeruants.</hi> But this is in a certain reſpect namelie, as himſelfe expoundeth it, becauſe he would in familiar ſort declare vnto them <hi>the whole ſecrets of the Gospel,</hi> Ioh 15.15. keeping notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding vnto himſelfe the title of <hi>lord of the houſe,</hi> as pertaining onelie vnto himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.13. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. There is greater
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1883:67"/>
difficultie touching the <hi>ſoueraigne royalty</hi> which we attributed to the ſole perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, whereas it is ſaid that hee hath made vs <hi>kings,</hi> Apoc. 5.10. that we are a <hi>royall prieſthood,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.9. or a <hi>prieſtly kingdome,</hi> Exod. 9.6. that a <hi>crowne is prepared for vs in heauen:</hi> 2. Tim. 4.8. &amp; which is more then al this, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, I appoint vnto you a kingdome as my father hath appointed &amp; diſpoſed it vnto me: <hi>Lu.</hi> 22.29. but god forbid we ſhould vnderſtand theſe things as if this monarchy of Chriſts were diuided or parted for al this: for contrariwiſe, there is no other thing meant by this royal dignity of ours, then firſt, the vertue &amp; power of the holy ghoſt in vs to ouercome the diuel, the fleſh, the world, &amp; our ſelues: &amp; ſecondly the participation of eternal glory. And as touching the Apoſtles of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid, that as the father hath agreed with him of a kingdome, ſo hee diſpoſeth it &amp; couenanteth it with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that <hi>they ſhall ſit vpon thrones &amp; iudge the twelue tribes of Iſrael:</hi> this is ſpoken in reſpect of this, that they haue a meaſure of ſpirit fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; particular autority to found the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church, according to that which is written, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.14. But S. Paul expoundeth in what ſenſe this is to be taken and vnderſtood, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. namelie in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Apoſtles were as it were the hand of God, laying the foundation of the Church which is but one, to witte, Ieſus Chriſt. In reſpect of which doctrine, and not that this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appertaineth to anie ſaue vnto Ieſus Chriſt alone the onely ſonne of God <hi>adored by the Angels themſelues:</hi> Heb. 2.6. it is ſaid of al the true faithful beleeuers, that in the latter day <hi>they ſhall iudge the Angels,</hi> that is, the Diuel and his Angels, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. &amp; ſhal <hi>ſit on his right hand,</hi> Pſal. 45.9. and Epheſ. 2.6. A man might alſo alleadge touching this power and authority of making Lawes to bind the conſcience, &amp; of the ſpiritual gouernment, that it is ſaid, that the Law was giuen and deliuered <hi>by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> Gal. 3.19. and <hi>by Moſes:</hi> Ioh. 1.17. and Act. 7.38. But this difficulty or obiection is eaſily anſwered both by that formall text where it is ſaid that Ieſus Chriſt is the onely Law-giuer: <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.12. as alſo by that which is written of the autority of the Angels, &amp; that which Moſes &amp; other faithfull ſeruaunts of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1883:68"/>
Lord haue alwaies done and practiſed. It is therefore ſaid tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Angels, that they are not maſters, <hi>but miniſtring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi> Pſal. 103.21. Heb. 1.14. And as touching Moſes it was at the requeſt of the people, that hee was not a Law-giuer, but a meſſenger to referre and report what was giuen him in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement without adding to, or diminiſhing of any thing from it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.19. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. As himſelf alſo ſheweth how carefull he was in taking heede of doing anie thing at al vpon his owne head, in that himſelfe would ſet downe no Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the puniſhment of blaſphemers, and touching thoſe which brake and violated the ſabboth, but made his recourſe for theſe cauſes vnto the Lord, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 24.11. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.34. although the queſtion was but of a ciuill puniſhment: ſo far it is that Moſes or Aaron would take vpon them to make anie rules for the ſeruice of God, or impoſe a Law on the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people, contrarie to that commaundement which Moſes had of doing and making all thinges according to the model and patterne of that which he had ſeene in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.40. And therefore vnder Dauid alſo and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the whole ſtate of the Temple was ſet vp and perfected, not by the aduiſe of man, but according vnto propheticall reuelations, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.11. But yet a man might hereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, that one of the principalleſt rights of regalitie and royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is to ſhewe mercie and to pardon. Now the power of the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, which conſiſteth in binding and looſing, that is to ſay in condemning and abſoluing of ſin, was in the perſon of Saint Peter &amp; the other eleuen Apoſtles giuen vnto the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. &amp; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.23. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid elſewhere, that it pertaineth vnto <hi>God alone to remit ſinnes,</hi> Mar. 2.7. it is eaſie to be vnderſtoode, that there is a great difference firſt betweene making of Lawes and publiſhing or applying of them: and ſecondly betweene power to execute abſolutely, and a commiſſion limited and bounded. Therefore I ſaie touching the ſpirituall kingdome concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience &amp; ſaluation or damnation, that this power pertaineth to one onely God in the perſon of his ſonne, whom hee hath
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1883:68"/>
from all time eſtabliſhed and ordained head of this Empire. And as touching the execution of his Lawes according to the exigence of caſes, hee hath ſet vp and eſtabliſhed his holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie in his Church, with a commiſſion limited, that is to ſay with a charge to iudge according vnto the tenor of his Laws, and as it were repreſenting the chiefe Lord, and Lawe-giuer, and not otherwiſe vnder paine of nullity of their ſentence: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we muſt ſaie that Ieſus Chriſt was iuſtly condemned and excommunicated with his Diſciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.22. and 16.2. inſteede of that which the Lord himſelfe ſaid of them, <hi>let them alone, they are blind, leaders of the blind.</hi> And indeede Saint Paul ſpeaking in generall of his whole preaching, calleth it the counſaile of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.27. And to the ende that no man ſhould extend and ſtretch this to any inward and internall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation without the Scripture, that which I ordaine, ſaith he, (ſpeaking of the inſtitution of the holy Supper) <hi>that haue I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the Lord:</hi> and ſpeaking of being vnmarried hee prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth that he wil not tie and intangle their conſciences: as alſo Saint Peter admoniſheth al paſtors to take heede how they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe a lordlines ouer their flocks, which he calleth <hi>the portion or the heritage of the Lord,</hi> 1. Pet. 5.3. And therefore theſe words of Saint Paul, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12. But <hi>to the reſt I speake and not the Lord,</hi> ſpeaking of mariages contracted with an vnbeleeuing partie, ought not ſo to bee vnderſtoode as if the Apoſtle tooke vpon him to commaund anie thing of his owne head &amp; priuate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but he vſeth this maner of ſpeach to diſtinguiſh that, for which he had the expreſſe and regiſtred word of God, from that which was not in plaine termes expreſſed, but correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent notwithſtanding and agreeing with that which was written: beeing a thing impoſſible that the Lawes could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine euerie particular caſe which might happily fal out, as we haue at large declared and expounded the ſame in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Finallie there are which alleadge the authoritie which the Church had in the time of the Apoſtles to make eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Lawes and ordinances, and ring out as loud as they can
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1883:69"/>
this word of <hi>Apoſtolical traditions,</hi> Act. 15.28. and 16.4. 1. Cor. 11.2. and. 34. whereof they produce diuerſe examples ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſowen heere and there throughout Saint Paules Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, as of the vaile of weomen, of the order of ſpeaking and vttering the word of God in the aſſemblie, of collections and gatherings for the poore, and of almes. This matter would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whole ſermons, as we haue alſo often occaſion to ſpeak thereof. But for this preſent, this may thus bee aunſwered in a word. It is then another thing to make lawes to tie mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to ſay, looke yee, this is good and pleaſing vnto God, this he commaundeth you to doe or beleeue: or contrariwiſe to ſay, looke yee, this hath God forbidden, and this you may not doe or beleeue. And againe, ſee, theſe be the vocations and charges by which the ſonne of God wil haue his Church to be ruled and gouerned: this I ſay is farre another thing, then to haue a reſpect vnto that which is requiſite for the vſe and practiſe aſwell of the doctrine as alſo of the diſcipline which God the alone and onelie Law-giuer hath ordained: requiſite I ſaie according vnto the time, perſons, and place: which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubiect to infinit varieties, yea ſometimes contrarieties, the Lord vnder the new couenant hath not made, &amp; as I may ſo ſaie, could not make certaine ſpecial &amp; perpetual ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeeing this policie is accidentall, and not of the ſubſtaunce neither of doctrine nor of diſcipline. And therefore in reſpect of this point, hee was content to giue a generall commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that whatſoeuer he ordained ſhould be executed <hi>orderly and modeſtly</hi> in his houſe which the church, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. Yee ſee then the boundes which he is content to preſcribe vs. And that this is ſo, we ſee how theſe ordinaunces themſelues of the Apoſtles which wee haue aboue ſpecified vaniſhed awaie by little and little, the times being chaunged, and the cauſes why they were made ceaſing to be: which would not haue been if they had concerned the ſubſtance of diſcipline and doctrine, which are perpetual and inuiolablie to bee obſerued vnto the end &amp; conſummation of the world. Contrariwiſe the Scribes and Phariſees not contenting themſelues that they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1883:69"/>
in Moſes chaire, that is to ſay to declare the doctrine and diſcipline taught by the miniſtery of Moſes (in which caſe the people were to doe that which they taught, and not to follow their wicked life) would needes medle with making of Lawes to tie the conſciences of men, and ſo to adde ſomwhat of their owne vnto the ſeruice of God eſtabliſhed by his Lawe, where it is ſaide that the Lorde had rather ſcandalize and offend them, then ſubiect his Diſciples vnto them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.6. ſhewing that he held not or accounted the vſage of ſuch traditions for a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> but calleth them <hi>the aboliſhing and taking away of the commandements and ordinances of God,</hi> Mar. 7.13. and <hi>a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen which he commaundeth vs to take heede of,</hi> Mat. 16.12. Now I thought good expreſlie to ſpecifie in this matter the time of the new couenant, becauſe that vnder the old, the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encloſed within the limites of one people, of one country, of one holy place, and for a time onely, the Lord declared and ſet downe not onely the doctrine which he would haue to be taught, both of the ſeruice and gouernment of his houſe: but alſo ſpecified and particularized thoſe ordinances according to the times, places, and perſons, which he would haue to bee inuiolablie obſerued, <hi>without changing, adding, or diminiſhing anie thing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al,</hi> Deu. 4.2. Eſai. 1.12. &amp; 29.13. But vnder the new couenant which hee contracted with all people and nations, and for ſo long time as the world ſhould endure, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, hee ſhould leaue it in the liberty of the Churches to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and eſtabliſh whatſoeuer in ſpecial and particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the vſe and practiſe of the doctrine and diſcipline as touching order and edification according to the variety and difference of circumſtances. And thus far of the ſoueraintie of of him which hath written in his thigh, <hi>The King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Apoc.</hi> 19.16. We will defer the reſt which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth farther to be ſpoken, vnto our next ſermon: in the meane time let vs pray vnto the Lord that it wil pleaſe him to giue vs the grace wel to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this holy doctrine, ſo neceſſary for theſe times we now liue in, to diſcerne his true Churches from thoſe falſe maskes thereof which preſent themſelues to vs on

euerie ſide, to the end that hauing found it, wee may continue firme and conſtant in the true doctrine of ſaluation, vntill the enioying of the full coniunction of the members and the head together in the kingdom euerlaſting. And becauſe that on the contraryſide we haue beene hitherto and yet are ſo ſlothfull in this behalfe, and ſo vnthankful, we will humble our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of our good God and Father, to deſire his grace and mercie as followeth.</p>

Eternal life therefore is indeed prepared and giuen vnto them who teſtify their repentance by the true fruits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which are ſometimes put off and differred vnto the <hi>laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mans life,</hi> whereof we haue a ſingular example in that poore theefe crucified with Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo called, <hi>at the eleuenth houre,</hi> Matth. 20.9. but I adde that this is not that by their woorkes they haue ſatisfied for their ſinnes either in whole or in part, or that they deſerue by the value of deſert of them in anie ſort or manner whatſoeuer anie bleſſing temporall or ſpirituall: but onely becauſe that good workes beeing the teſtimonie and effectes inſeparablie follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of faith, and that faith witneſſing before God according vnto the couenant of the Goſpel, <hi>That whoſoeuer ſhall beleeue in the Sonne ſhall bee ſaued,</hi> That the true repentaunt haue a part in the merit of Ieſus Chriſt and his righteouſnes, it pleaſeth God of his great grace and onelie mercie to accept of them and to crowne them in Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, the onelie ſatisfier for our ſinnes, and ſole ſacrifice expiatorie, as the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and al the writinges of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles do moſt plainely witneſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As litle can we helpe our ſelues with the promiſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and expiation of our ſinnes which are added vnto the legal ceremonies, &amp; namely vnto the ſacrifices.

               <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. And therefore the promiſes of expiating or purging our ſinnes were not added to the Leuitical ſeruice, to attribute thereunto that which is proper to Ieſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but to diſtinguiſh theſe ſacramentall ceremonies from common things, and ſuch as had not any ſpiritual vſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 I ſaie the like of the Sacraments of the new couenant: as when the waſhing away of our ſinnes is attributed vnto the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and our incorporation in Ieſus Chriſt and vnion with him, from whence all thoſe benefits and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings proceede which we receiue from him is attributed vnto the holy Supper of the Lord. For the outward viſible water of Baptiſme doth no more waſh away our ſinnes nowe, then did heretofore the water of purification, or blood of beaſtes. But hereby is ſhewed vs the difference between the water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and common water, not in reſpect of the ſubſtance or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the water conſidered in his own nature: but in this that common water doth nothing concerne eternall life, and the water of Baptiſme is vſed and applied, to ſignifie vnto vs effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, if it be not long of our ſelues, that which the ſpirit doth within vs, defacing and putting foorth our ſinnes, and purging our natural corruption by the death and paſſion of Chriſt our Lord, being no other thing in the water but a power of ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng vnto the beleeuer that which faith is to apprehend, and which is applied by the force &amp; power of the holy ghoſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king within, according vnto the diſtinction of theſe two Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes ſpoken of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. The like muſt be vnderſtoode touching the other ſacrament of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, namely the Lords Supper, wherein wee ought to take diligent heed we attribute not vnto the bread or wine, or vnto the corporall receiuing of them, that which is proper vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and vnto the ſpiritual apprehenſion and application of him by faith.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Of as little force is that obiection of them who alleadge theſe woords of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. <hi>In doing this thou ſhalt ſaue both thy ſelfe and thoſe which heare thee.</hi> For there is but one <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>one Sauiour,</hi> Act. 4.12. who hath <hi>alone

principal part of this ſo great a benefit, which is the ſchoole of diuinitie, this is there where Satan hath ſerued his turne with ſuger to turn it into moſt bitter and deadly poyſon: hauing ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the ſchoole of diuinity that which was the only ſubiect thereof, I meane the reading and expounding of the text of holy Scripture, to thruſt thereinto an abominable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of dreaming ſophiſtications, ſome as vaine as curious, others abſurde, others full of impiety: in ſuch ſort, that to be a Doctor in ſuch a thing, is no more but to bee farther off from pure and ſound doctrine, as the Apoſtle ſo diligently warneth vs, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. and 4.7. while Satan goeth forward in the vtter ouerthrowe of all their Clergy hauing transformed them into ſhoppes &amp; brothels of Sodomitry and inſtrumentes vnto al ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege and ſimony.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Finally to ende and perfect the myſterie of iniquity, the great Biſhop hath parted the ſpoile with Kinges and Princes, whom he hath enchanted and bewitched in aboliſhing vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Lawful order of eccleſiaſtical elections and vocations. And thus ye ſee vnto what good paſſe the Church of the Lord hath bin brought by them, who of ſeruantes haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues trayterous companions, called no better <hi>then theeues</hi> by the Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.13. If anie man ſaie that the Bridegrome, of whom mention is here made, ſpake not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which came ſo long after: I anſwere that the ſpirit of prophecy in this place doth not onelie lead vs farther then vnto the time of Salomon, but that a long time agoe, after the time of Ioſua, as the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Iudges doth plainely witneſſe, horrible corruptions were already entred in among the people of god, which draue as it were this ſpouſe out of her vineyard and poſſeſſion. As for the reſt, this woord of Companion ſeemeth ouer gentle in this matter, the queſtion beeing here not in this which wee before ſaid of taking vnto a mans ſelf ſome part of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging vnto the Bridegroome, an outragious crime notwithſtanding of treaſon, but (that which is much worſe &amp; the capital poynt of this crime) is the taking to a mans ſelf the perſon of this Bridegroome, and to put him foorth to poſſeſſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1883:75"/>
and occupie his place, and in the place of this chaſt ſpouſe, to ſubſtitute this abominable ſtrumpet, which doth yet to this daie ſeduce and bewitch the kings and princes of the earth by the cup of her abominations: and that with extreme impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ſhameleſneſſe, in indeuoring to make men to beleeue that by ſuch inuentions he is honoured, from whom they hale and pul with al the maine and might they haue both the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the crowne.</p>
            <p n="14">14 In ſuch ſort deale they with the <hi>Propheticall dignitie</hi> of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, calling their owne dreames and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inſpirations of the holy ghoſt: as if that which hath bin declared by the Prophets and Apoſtles, touching our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were not ſufficient, or might happily be in ſome point cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and amenced. In a woord when they are come ſo farre as to ſay, write &amp; maintaine, that they, calling themſelues the Church, cannot erie in doctrine, that their Pope cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and that no man liuing may ſay vnto the Pope though he ſhould lead whole troupes of ſoules vnto hell, ſir what doe you? &amp; when hereupon they cut and clip the doctrine of God as pleaſeth them, is not this to ouerturne from the top to the bottome the Propheticall authoritie of the ſonne of God, as much as in them lieth?</p>
            <p n="15">15 As litle haue they left the <hi>Prieſthoode</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt whole and vntouched, hauing added &amp; annexed vnto his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation and ſatisfaction for our ſinnes whatſoeuer came into their own brainſicke fancy, as holy water chriſme, oyle, waxe, ſpettle, beades, pilgrimages, &amp; other ſuch bables they could thinke vpon or deuiſe. Briefely hauing gone ſo far as to forge a reall and ſubſtantiall oblation of Ieſus Chriſt by the handes of their Prieſts, for a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the quicke, &amp; the dead, adding thereto notwithſtanding the merits both of the liuing who are yet in the way, and of the dead compriſed in their Letanies and Proceſſions, vnto whom they haue attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſuch ſtore of merites, that there yet remaine an infinite number of them to be ſold and diſtributed for ready mony to all ſuch as haue need of them: things ſo ſtrange and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p n="16">16 Now what ſhal we ſay of the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto whom they haue added thouſands of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, though they place them in ſomewhat a lower and inferiour degree?

Rom. 14.23.) cannot but make all ſuch prayers vnprofitable, though there were no other fault in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.6. In a word whoſoeuer ſhall compare the auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of Paynims with theſe deuotions of the Church which calleth it ſelfe at this daie <hi>Catholique,</hi> ſhall finde from point to point no other difference betweene theſe two, ſaue onely the names, onely that theſe who haue ſo abuſed the ſeely worlde &amp; ſo nuſled it in their ſuperſtitions, calling darckneſſe light: in falſifieng the light of the Scripture, are a great deale more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable then the poore Paynims, hauing abuſed nothing

but the <hi>remnant of their natural light,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 14 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p n="17">17 And thus you ſee who theſe companions are of whom this poore ſpouſe in this place ſo bitterly complaineth, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be drawen out from among them and to bee brought vnto the true flock, diſtinguiſhed herein, from them which ſhe calleth flocks in the plurall number, becauſe that indeed there is but one true Church and vniuerſal, whereas theſe traiterous companions haue as many flockes as they haue ſects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the ſaying of the Lorde, <hi>That hee which gathereth not with him, doth nothing els but ſcatter,</hi> Mat. 12.30.</p>
            <p n="18">18 And as touching theſe words <hi>As ſhee which couereth or hideth her ſelfe,</hi> they are expounded in diuerſe ſortes. For there are ſome which refer it to the faſhion which Thamar vſed to deceiue Iuda her father in Lawe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.15. gathering from thence that the maner of harlots was to couer themſelues: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto which expoſition this ſhould bee taken, as if the ſpouſe did ſay, that keeping companie with ſuch kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhe ſhould be thought to be neuer a whit better then they, as it commonly commeth to paſſe and doth ſtil fall out, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the hiſtorie of the Daughters of Lot. For it fareth with them who ouer familiarly and ouer long time haunt the companie of the wicked and peruerſe, as with them who dwel among colliers and come too neare them, according vnto the leſſon which the Apoſtle teacheth vs, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. And this is the cauſe why the Lord vnder the Law was ſo careful to ſeuer his people in euerie reſpect, yea as touching their verie attire and apparel, from al other profane nations. We heare alſo the mones which Dauid maketh during his flight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. &amp; 120. and elſewhere: as alſo the Apoſtle exhorteth vs to take heede <hi>with whom wee companie,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. And I woulde to God that many had thought better vpon this point the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue done, who are at this day in a moſt wretched and miſerable eſtate, hauing throwen themſelues wittingly and willingly into the pawes of the rauening and deuouring lyon. This is then a moſt holeſome and neceſſarie doctrine, but notwithſtanding ſuch
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1883:76"/>
as hath no verie ſure ground &amp; foundation touching this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and forme of ſpeech, being a thing vnlikely that they who proſtitute their bodies, and conſequently ſeeke nothing elſe but to allure men to their deſtruction by their beutie, as ſuch weomen are deſcribed by this ſame Salomon, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 6.25. and 7.10. ſhould hide their faces: beſides that if they ſhould ſo doe, it were an harde thing to diſcerne an honeſt maried wife vayled, from an harlot. Neither meant Moſes in the hiſtorie of Thamar to ſay, that ſhe was therefore accounted an harlot, becauſe ſhee had couered her face, but that therefore Iuda knew her not to bee his daughter in lawe, becauſe ſhe was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired like a widowe, and had couered her face: whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee thought to bee an harlot, ſeeing her ſet out in that ſort and ſitting alone in the high way. There are others therefore which expound this woord <hi>As one which wandreth out of the waie,</hi> becauſe it is ſometimes taken in this ſenſe, in the toung which Salomon vſeth: as if the ſpouſe ſaide that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among ſuch lewde companie, ſhee muſt needes bee as a poor wanderer and vagabond. But it is better to take it ſimply in this ſenſe, that ſhee cannot bee among ſuch wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, but to her great ſorowe and griefe, ſeeking for corners where to hide her head that ſhe haue no felowſhip with them, or els being conſtrained to hide and couer her face, not to ſee ſuch deteſtable things and to conſent vnto them ſo much as with her countenaunce, as Dauid proteſteth that hee will not haue ſo much as in his mouth the <hi>names of ſtraunge Gods,</hi> Pſal. 16.4. The Apoſtle alſo warning vs to take heede <hi>not only of euil, but alſo of euery thing that hath ſo much as the appearance of euill,</hi> 1.

This is it which the falſe Paſtors would gladlie make men to beleeue can neuer come to paſſe, to the end to drawe men vnto themſelues, when it pleaſeth God ſo to chaſten and puniſh the contempt of his truth. Now that the marks of the Church bee not alwaies bright-ſhining and cleare, it is apparant and manifeſt not onely by the mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and threats which the Lord hath made in this behalf, both by the Prophets in infinite many places, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. and 79, &amp; 80. throughout, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.39. <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.14. &amp; elſe-where, as alſo vnder the new couenant the Lord foretold the ſame expreſly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. and after him the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.29. and 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. and 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.6. and 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.18. as it hath alſo beene confirmed by manie and ſundry experiences in al times as before we haue declared.

poore Church is propoſed vnto vs to be in the verſe going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not knowing in a maner on which ſide to turne it ſelfe in ſuch an vtter confuſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And therefore our duty is wel and narrowly to conſider the aunſwere made vnto the ſpouſe by him himſelfe, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to ſpeake properly, ſpeaketh in verity &amp; truth, ſeeing it is he who is truth it ſelfe, and who neuer forſaketh thoſe who are his in their neede. After a preface therefore firſt made, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and to comfort her, calling her the fayreſt among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, hee aunſwereth his ſpouſe in this ſenſe, It is true indeede that thou art a poore wandring ſtray, and therefore black and ſunne-burnt, but yet thou leaueſt not for all that to be fayr and beutifull in mine eye, yea adorned with ſuch a beuty as none beſides thy ſelfe can vaunt and boaſt of. This is the verie ſtile which the Lord himſelf vſeth by his Prophets, adding alwaies a conſolation and comfort after his threats and iudgementes, as is expreſlie ſpoken and in the ſame ſenſe by the Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie ſaying, <hi>Come my people, enter into thy chambers, and ſhutte the doores after thee, and hide thy ſelfe a little while vntil my anger bee paſſed ouer.</hi> Eſay 26.20. the Church hauing ſaid before vnto him in the eight verſe, <hi>ô Eternal we wait for thee in the way of thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</hi> Nowe the foundation of this comfort and conſolation conſiſteth in two pointes: both of them grounded vpon the ſingular mercie of God. The firſt is, that the Lord neuer ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ground Articles and points of true religion to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in his Church, though they be in diuers ſorts both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without diſguiſed and baſtardized: and that ſometimes this truth remaine but among a few, as we ſee it came to paſſe in Iſrael in the time of Elias, in Iuda in the time of the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Babylon, in Ieruſalem it ſelfe then when the Lord came in perſon. The other point is, that the Lord conſidereth not his Church ſimply according vnto his graces and bleſſings which ſhine in her, which are ſometimes moſt darke and obſcure in the eies of men, but reſpecteth her alwaies in the truth of his couenant, and in him in whom ſhee is indeede not onely <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot or wrinckle,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.22. but which is more, <hi>clothed with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1883:78"/>
the perfect righteouſneſſe of the reconciler,</hi> Phil. 3.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let vs therefore know that the church leaueth not to be a church, though the true doctrine touching certaine articles bee therein debated, yea though it bee touching the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall articles by ſome, as the weakneſſe of ſome, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of others is great, whereof the church of Corinth may be a witneſſe in which the article of the reſurrection was called by ſome into controuerſie, and the church of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians ſo ſhaken, that in reſpect of the greateſt part of the members thereof, it was vtterly reuolted, as the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe witneſſeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. who notwithſtanding leaueth not to cal them churches of Ieſus Chriſt which he alſo reformed &amp; reſtored, according vnto that leſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he taught others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. And therefore theſe fantaſticall <hi>Cathariſtes</hi> and <hi>Donatiſtes</hi> of olde, and thoſe of our time of the ſect of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts,</hi> who ſeeke after ſuch a church in this world as ſhould haue no fault nor any thing amiſſe in it, are vtterlie to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But it is far an other thing to diſpute and make a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which a man knoweth not, with a will and deſire to learne and know it: and ſtubburnly to oppoſe a mans ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, and finally to maintaine and authoriſe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine directly contrarie vnto the articles of our faith. And thus is it at length come to paſſe in the Romiſh church at this day, which for this cauſe doth no more deſerue the name of a church then the kingdome of the ten tribes reuolting with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam the ſonne of Nabath deſerued the name of the people of God: albeit there were for a long time ſome of Gods elect among thoſe reuolters, whom the Lorde according vnto his good pleaſure did miraculouſly preſerue, vntill the daie of the vtter diſſipation of them, which ſhall befall this Weſt Babylon in his time. And therefore we proteſt that in the times of our fathers there was a Church, that is to ſay, a number of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God as it were ſecret and ſhut vp, as may be proued by writinges from age to age, that there were alwaies ſome who oppoſed themſelues againſt thoſe ſuperſtitions and idolatries
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1883:79"/>
which by little and litle gotte the vpper hand in this Babylon, called three hundred yeares agoe by one of their owne Poets a Temple of hereſie, in the which the Lorde for this ſuffered not that Baptiſm ſhould be vtterly taken away and aboliſhed, but not that this Sea or any affected thereunto being directlie oppoſed vnto the Church of God, was at any time the Church. We proteſt &amp; confeſſe farther, that euen in our time, in which it hath pleaſed God to diſplay the banner of his truth, there doe ſtil remaine ſome of the elect, buried as it were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of this Babylon, who in reſpect of the eternal purpoſe and counſel of God appertain at this preſent vnto the true church: but by little and little as it pleaſeth God to drawe them out of this gulf, are actually made the members of this true Church, of which thing you to whom we ſpeak, and our ſelues who are by Gods mercie come forth thereof, are good witneſſes. This is then the comfort and conſolation whereof mention is made in this place, and that which we muſt learne to anſwere them, who ſo impudently and ſhameleſlie begin our churches, from thoſe great perſonages the faithful ſeruants of God, rayſed vp of his great mercy and grace about ſeuentie yeares agoe, not to build a new Church, as they falſely cal it, but to gather togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poore ſeelie ſheepe which were ſtrayed among the wolues, which the ſpouſe calleth here falſe companions of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as wee haue aboue expounded the ſame: the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome therefore paſſing farther, addeth <hi>If thou knoweſt it not,</hi> as if hee ſaid, is it poſſible my ſpouſe that thou haſt vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that which thou askeſt of me, namely where my paſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring place is, and where I cauſe my ſheep to reſt in the heate of the noon day? Which he ſpeaketh not ſo much vnto the ſpouſe in way of reproch or to greeue her or make her ſadde, as to awaken her and to make her bethink her ſelfe better: as if to warne him who ſeemeth to haue little courage, wee ſhoulde giue him to vnderſtand, that if he think wel on himſelfe, hee is ſtronger then he takes himſelfe to be. Wee ſee here therefore the ineſtimable and admirable goodneſſe of God towards his Church, teaching vs, that we muſt take heede of two contrary
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1883:79"/>
extremes, namely that we preſume not too much of our owne forces as Saint Peter did who after found himſelfe in verie bad caſe thereby, and on the other ſide alſo that we conſider well of the gifts we haue receiued of God, that we make them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to our ſelues and others by our couragious vſage of them, as the Apoſtle moſt diligently warneth his Diſciple Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. whereas it falleth out often, that for want of courage, which we thinke is not ſo, wee ſuffer that to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way which we haue receiued, making our ſelues in the end vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnworthy thereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5 After this preface the Bridegroome warneth his ſpouſe firſt <hi>to goe forth,</hi> as it was ſaid at the beginning vnto Abraham, <hi>get thee foorth out of thy countrie and out of the land where thou wert borne, and out of thy fathers houſe,</hi> Gen. 12.1. &amp; afterward by the mouth of the Prophets, <hi>get you out of Babylon, flie out of Chaldaea,</hi> Ier. 51.6. and afterward by the Angel, <hi>goe yee out of her my people,</hi> Apoc. 18.4. And indeede the meanes to find the right way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a man is gone aſtraie, is not to tarrie in the path in which he wandred, but a man muſt withdraw himſelfe from it and returne into the right aſſoone as he can. Now if hereupon a man demand, whether this retreat importeth alwaies a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of place, I anſwere that no. For the principal retire as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching doctrine lieth herein, to turne from falſehoode to return into the way of truth, and as touching manners to withdrawe our ſelues from al kind of iniquity to giue our ſelues vnto pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of liuing, <hi>Pſal</hi> 119.9. and .2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. which is meant in the Scripture by the word of <hi>conuerſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 But touching this the examples in Scriptures are not all of one ſort. For we ſee, that Ioſeph left not Egypt, neither did Daniel or his companions, as farre as wee read, depart out of Chaldea or Perſia. Contrariwiſe looke wee vpon Moſes, &amp; we ſhal ſee that he forſook Pharaoes court; &amp; as for the retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and careleſſe Iewes, who foreſlowed their departure out of the captiuity, the gate beeing thriſe ſet open vnto them, wee knowe how dearely they bought it. What ſhall we then ſaie hereupon? This doubt is eaſily reſolued by them, who haue a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1883:80"/>
regard, without flattering of themſelues any whit at all, aſwel vnto the glory of God as vnto their owne duty to diſcharge it well, as alſo to their own ability and meanes which they haue to ſerue God aright. The ſcope therefore and ground of ſuch a deliberation as this is, is, that what euer commeth, wee muſt ſerue God in ſuch ſort as hee hath appointed vs to ſerue him, without looking either backward, or on the right hande or on the left. Thus much is preſuppoſed, if a man liue in ſuch a place where he may heare the woorde of God ſyncerely preached, and may vſe the Sacraments ordained by God for an helpe &amp; remedie of our wretched weakeneſſe. Yet for all that a man muſt according to the aduertiſement of Chriſt <hi>accounting his coſt &amp; taking a reckoning of his ability before he build or wage battle:</hi> Luk. 14.28. conſider farther; firſt whether hee feele himſelfe ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g inough by the aide &amp; aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god both to ſuſtain the hot aſſaults which by al likelihood ſhalbe giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, in making a pure and vpright confeſſion of the true religion among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and ſuperſtitious liuers, and alſo not to ſuffer himſelfe to be ſeduced by ſuch wicked examples, as ſhalbe euery houre and euery moment preſented him in thoſe places. If any man therefore finde himſelfe in ſuch condition, I ſee not why hee ſhould lightly change the place he liueth in, but ought rather there to diſcharge his duty, and to ſhine as a cleare flaming torch in the middeſt of the kingdome of darckneſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. although it be not forbidden that hee which findeth himſelfe well inough touching the ſtate of his conſcience, in any place, may not ſeeke ſtill to be yet better if may be. And farther they who haue any charge and vocation of God, eſpecially an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical charge in any place, ought to take heede how they take into their mindes ſuch an impreſſion of dangers, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to leaue their charge, which ought to bee more precious vnto them then their owne life, according vnto the practiſe of all the faithfull ſeruantes of God, examples whereof wee haue in Ioſeph, &amp; in Daniel. Now they are ſaid to quit their charge who depart for the feare of men, or for their owne particular reſpect; not conſidering that an aſſured vocation is the voice
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1883:80"/>
of god, which who ſo willingly obeieth not, either to tarry, or to depart, is worthie to be diſcharged, or rather puniſhed by his Captaine. Abraham hauing receiued a commaundement of the Lorde, left forthwith his Country and his fathers houſe. Briefly a lawfull calling, and ſuch a one as wee are neceſſarilie tied vnto, is the voice of the Lord, whether it be to cauſe vs to ſtay where we are, or to depart. We read not that Moſes had any commaundement by viſion from God, as had Abraham, <hi>to depart out of Pharaoes court,</hi> Heb. 11.24. but beſides that hee had no eſtate or calling which tied him to ſtay, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was brought vp after the Aegyptian faſhion: his intent &amp; purpoſe approued by that which followed, ſheweth that hee was guided and conducted by a ſingular motion and inſtinct of the holy ghoſt, as S. Stephen likewiſe declareth the ſame. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.22. As we neede not alſo to doubt, but that Daniell, if he were not ſurpriſed by death in his old age, held himſelfe in Perſia by reaſon of his publicke vocation, in which he did god and his whole nation faithful ſeruice: as Eſdras alſo and Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias ſtaied there a while after the edict, through the ſingular prouidence of God, who would haue them left for a rere ward vnto the people who drew themſelues backe by litle and litle, as on the contrariſide thoſe who tarried and ſhrouded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in filthineſſe and vncleanneſſe of that prophane people are by no meanes to be excuſed. In ſumme who ſo rightly and ſyncerely ſeeketh after the glory of God and the quiet of his conſcience, ſhall ſoone knowe how to make in ſuch a caſe an holy and a good reſolution. Neither is this to tie the grace of God vnto any one Prouince, or the walles of any one Citty, whereas God muſt be ſerued <hi>in euery place with lifting vp of pure handes:</hi> 1. Tim. 2.8. but this is to teach men to ſet all thinges whatſoeuer without exception, after the dewty which they owe vnto the Lorde: whoſe promiſe is moſt liberall &amp; bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto them, who forſake for his ſake houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands &amp; poſſeſſions, howe euer the worlde take and account them for fooles and franticke.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1883:81"/>7 Neither ſerueth this leſſon to teach vs onely that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to depart out of thoſe places where ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſome what worſe then that is. For it is to little purpoſe to chaunge our place, if we chaunge not our old skinne: and if being come to another place to ſerue God better and with more freedome then before, we ſhew it not indeede and effect when wee are come thither. Which falleth not ſo truly out in al, as I muſt ſay it to my great griefe, beeing but too too manie found who in ſteede of changing themſelues and their manners or profiting themſelues better when they are come hither amongſt vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe then before, ſo that being nothing elſe but an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſtumbling block vnto others, it were better both for vs and them they had either neuer come here, or had returned ſtrait way thither againe from whence they came.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And as this doctrine ſerueth not to this purpoſe, ſo ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tendeth it to the fauoring of theſe hypocriticall Moonkes who boaſt and brag they haue forſaken the woorlde, becauſe they would faine be reckned among the number of them <hi>who haue left and forſaken al things for Chriſts ſake:</hi> which thing I ſhall then confeſſe to bee true, when they ſhal haue proued Ieſus Chriſt to be the patron and founder of their order, and that to enter into a monaſterie, there to liue at the coſt and charges of another, and ſome of them to bee chaunged into wild aſſes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to get them fat paunches, others to grow vppe to miters and cardinals hattes, others to be the props and arch-pillers of falſhoode and error, ſuch as theſe of the latter crue are, who cal themſelues Capuchins &amp; Ieſuits, falſe vſurpers of the name of Ieſus, others to be ſauiours and meriters for themſelues and for others who hire them for their imaginarie workes, in ſuch ſort as to heare them ſpeake, it ſhould ſeeme that God oweth them ſomewhat vpon a reckning when they haue paſt a clear account with him: when I ſay they ſhal haue ſhewed that this doctrine is Propheticall and Apoſtolicall, I wil then confeſſe their ſaying to be true and not before: no diſpleaſure to one of the ancient fathers (a man otherwiſe endued with moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts, &amp; who neuer heard of ſuch, not monks, but monkeis
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1883:81"/>
as they afterward became to bee) but ſo bewitched notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with the opinion of a monaſtical and ſolitarie life, as that he ſticked not to giue one this counſell to runne ouer the verie belly of his owne father, to enter into a monaſterie: ſo blinde was the world euen in thoſe daies.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In a word therefore, the firſt point of returning vnto the Church of God, is a reſolution of quitting and forſaking the falſe Church, without any either chaffering and merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing or <hi>looking behinde vs,</hi> as we are warned, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.62. &amp; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. as this ſpouſe alſo is expreſly warned <hi>to forget her owne people and her fathers houſe, before the King can take pleaſure in her beautie,</hi> Pſal. 45.11. And this is a point which they aboue all others ought well to thinke vpon, who at this day, when this point is handled and debated among vs, mince out their way on both ſides, thinking to agree fire and water together: calling them transformers of the Church, who would reforme it exactly according vnto the paterne of the woorde of God: men a great deale more daungerous then thoſe who declare themſelues vtter enimies of the truth.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But becauſe to goe out of a bad way to enter into an other as bad or els worſe, doth litle better the caſe of him who is wandred: therefore the ſpouſe is here warned in going out of the ill way to followe the tracke of the flocke, that is to ſaie, of this true flock of ſheep with whom they are to ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For the vnderſtanding and practiſe of which leſſon we are to note, that there is a difference betweene the opening of a new way, and the acknowledging of a way made long ſince, but for lacke of vſing and frequenting growen waſt and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. The queſtion being therefore in this place, not of taking or making a newe way, as if the Church had then tooke her beginning, but of finding againe the true way laid in ſome ſort waſt &amp; deſert: for this cauſe the ſpouſe is ſent backe as it were to finde the trackes and footings of the olde way. And this is it which the Prophets themſelues haue preached amidſt the deſolations of the Church in their times, ſending backe ſuch as are wandered and gone aſtray <hi>vnto the Law and vnto the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1883:82"/>
teſtimonie,</hi> Eſai. 8.20. and elſewhere as Abraham alſo ſpeaketh <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29. <hi>They haue,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Moſes and the Prophets, let them heare them:</hi> whereunto agreeth that of Saint Peter, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. not forgetting the woordes of his maiſter, who directed thoſe which were blind &amp; knew him not, vnto the Scriptures. <hi>Sound ye,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſearch the Scriptures, for they are they which ſpeak of me,</hi> Ioh. 5.39. yea although then when the Lord ſpake thus, <hi>the track and footing</hi> of the true ſheepe of the former time was ſo cleane put foorth, amongeſt thoſe who called themſelues the people of God, that there needed miracles and other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes to make it knowen vnto the ſeely wandering ſheepe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.36.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Therefore when our aduerſaries would ſerue their turn with this place to teach vs that without al diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we muſt keep vs vnto the way of the fathers: we muſt put them in mind of this word of <hi>Flock</hi> namely of the true flocke of the true ſheep. For there are two ſorts of fathers. The one ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers &amp; ſeduced, of whom the lord complaining in Ieremy, <hi>they haue forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my law, which I ſet before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; haue not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened vnto my voice, neither walked thereafter, but haue followed their own harts luſt, &amp; the Baalims which their fathers taught them,</hi> Ier. 9.13. and 14 and in Ezechiel 20.24 <hi>their eyes are gone after the moulten gods of their fathers.</hi> Such are the fathers from which wee muſt turne, that wee periſh not with them, not deſeruing the name of auncetors, that is to ſaie, <hi>of ſuch ſheepe as hear and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the voice of their ſheepheard,</hi> Ioh. 10.27. But as for true fathers, that is to ſaie true auncetours, thoſe are they indeede whoſe track and footing we muſt know, that we turne not therefrom neither to the right hand nor to the left. As for example. There are in our time a great number of falſe ſects &amp; religions which al ſaie they are the true Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Behold on one ſide the Iewes, on another ſide the Turkes who vaunt themſelues, that they haue the true religion. As for the Turkes their Alcoran beeing newly forged, it cannot be the <hi>track of this flock.</hi> The Iewes now and ſince the deſtruction of their Temple &amp; policy haue ſome fayrer ſhewe, but it is on a falſe title they vaunt themſelues to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1883:82"/>
haue on their ſide the God which Moſes and the Prophets taught, ſeing they acknowlege not but blaſpheme him whom the Law and the Prophets lead vs vnto.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Wee ſee on the other ſide howe they of the Romiſh Church do at this daie vaunt themſelues &amp; make great crakes of their <hi>antiquity and ſucceſſion of Biſhoppes,</hi> and of the Scriptures themſelues, the booke of the one and the other couenant. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom we aunſwere that the foundation of their hierarchie being in part forged vpon an humane inuention which finally degenerated into an open tyranny: and their doctrine beeing directly and diametrally repugnant vnto the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles, this cannot be the way trodden out by the auncient Church Apoſtolique, what continuance of years ſoeuer and names of ſucceſſours they alleadge. Aſmuch is to bee ſaid concerning the <hi>Anabaptiſts and Libertines,</hi> placing in ſteede of the Scripture their <hi>reuelations</hi> and dreames, as alſo all both old and new or renued hereticks haue this in common, that they hold not themſelues within the limites and bounds of the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the holy and canonicall Scriptures, which ought to ſerue for the text and commentary of his wil.</p>
            <p n="13">13 And this is the cauſe why the Bridegrome addeth that the ſpouſe to finde the tracke of the true ſheep after which ſhe is ſent, muſt ſeeke after the <hi>cabbins or tents of the ſheepheards:</hi> meaning by theſe woordes, the true Paſtours of the Church whom we muſt diſcerne from the falſe, by their woordes and writings, and by their <hi>cabbins</hi> and <hi>tentes,</hi> that is to ſay, the rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and reſting place of this true flocke. For indeede there is but one <hi>catholickeflocke,</hi> that is, vniuerſally conſidered, bee it great or litle. But there are ſo many cabbins for the retyring vnto, and paſturing of it, as there are places in the which the voice of theſe true ſheepheards, Prophets and Apoſtles, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, and ſhall reſound vnto the end of the woorlde, by the mouthes of their faithfull ſucceſſors, to gather together and to conduct vnto the onely Paſtour and ſheepheard which is this Bridegrome, the whole number and multitude of the ſheepe.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1883:83"/>14 And it may alſo be that Salomon had a particular reſpect to <hi>Abraham, Iſaacke, and Iacob,</hi> who were indeed ſheepheards, as the moſt part of the ancient Patriarckes, yea <hi>Moſes himſelfe among the Madianites, and Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 77.20. &amp; 78.72. to the doctrine and family of whom the ſpouſe in this place is ſent backe, being a thing without all doubt that they were indeed true Paſtours &amp; ſheepheards, their doctrine the true doctrine, &amp; their houſe (excepting ſuch as behaued themſelues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, and which were rather in the houſe then of the houſe, as Iſmael and Eſaw) the true Church of God. And we may not forget that here is expreſſe mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of cabbins of ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, according vnto the purport of the hiſtory it ſelfe, namely that theſe Patriarckes did indeed <hi>dwell in tents,</hi> as way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farers in this worlde, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9. We are therefore giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by this word that we may not ſeeke after the Church in the outward ſhining of Towers &amp; Steepls, nor other pomps and braueries of the worlde: the Church of God being rather compoſed of the <hi>ſmal &amp; contemptible things of the world,</hi> Luk. 14.21. and 1. Cor 1.26. as the head alſo thereof would bee borne in a ſtable, and liue poorely and ſlenderly. If on the contrarie ſide any man obiect the rich ornamentes of the <hi>tabernacle,</hi> the magnificence of the <hi>temple of Salomon,</hi> and the riches both of it as alſo of the people during his kingdome, in whoſe raigne it is ſaid, <hi>that men made no more reckoning of ſiluer then of ſtones in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> 2. Chron. 9.27. I anſwere, as touching the ornaments of the Leuiticall Prieſthoode and the riches of the Temple, that al this was a figure of the ſpiritual riches of the true Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, namely of our lord Ieſus Chriſt vnder the paedago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and <hi>A. B. C.</hi> of the Lawe, which is now ceaſed togither with al that which depended thereon: and as for the other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I denie not but that the Lord honoured his people when it ſo pleaſed him, with the bleſſinges and commodities of this life, <hi>Godlines hauing the promiſes both of the preſent life and of the life to come,</hi> 1. Tim. 4.8. I deny not alſo but that God hath called vnto his Church, both rich and poore, ſuch and ſo many as it pleaſeth him, as the example of Abraham who was rich, in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1883:83"/>
whoſe <hi>Boſome poore Lazarus was,</hi> may declare and witnes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.23. but I ſaie that in al times the hall where the banquet is kept, whereof mention is made in <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.13. hath alwaies beene filled rather <hi>with impotent folcke, lame, and blind taken out of the midſt of the ſtreet,</hi> then with the rich and pompous <hi>which are in kings houſes,</hi> Mat. 11.8. I ſaie farther that albeit neither riches nor pouerty are proper and eſſential marks of the Church, yet ſo is it notwithſtanding that ſmalnes &amp; baſeneſſe of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according vnto the woorld, yea the croſſe it ſelfe, (not the croſſe of golde or ſiluer transformed into a moſt deteſtable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol,) but the croſſe which burdeneth the ſhoulders, &amp; which is an enemie vnto the fleſh, is the ordinarie companion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But I ſaie alſo that the riche which were in the church, were not of the church in the quality of men rich with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corruptible riches, but in the quality of poore, in aſmuch as they <hi>vſed their goods ſo as if they vſed them not at al,</hi> according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. and 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. and became leane and thinne <hi>to paſſe thorough the eie of the needle,</hi> Mat. 19.24. <hi>laying up their treaſure in heauen,</hi> Mat. 6.20. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the example of Dauid that good and truly rich king <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. Finally I ſaie that the buildinges and veſſels of the Church ought to be agreeable with the doctrine taught in the true Chriſtian Church, which condemneth all ſuperfluity and worldlie pompes, and applieth the goods of the Church to <hi>the liuing ſtones</hi> thereof, as the practiſe was in the Apoſtles times, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.35. and in thoſe times when the Paſtors were of golde, and the Churches and the veſſels thereof were of wood.</p>
            <p n="15">15 This then hath been and yet is an enormous fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the auncient fathers ſince the time of Conſtantine to ſuffer, and much greater to exhort Kinges and Princes to found and build Churches with ſuch exceſſiue coſt, ſeruing for no other thing but to condemne both the doners and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders, poynting out as it were with the finger, the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one, and the couetouſnes of the other: whereupon hath entred this notorious transformation of the ſpiritual beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Chriſtian Church into a vanity and pomp not ſimply
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1883:84"/>
carnal and worldly, but truely Epicurian, how euer it be hidde and couered vnder the cloke of deuotion. Heereby appeareth the more then deſperat impudencie and ſhameleſnes of them who by their goodly legends ſo falſe &amp; ſottiſh, as nothing can bee more, in lieu of keeping themſelues vnto the hiſtory and doctrine contained in the ſecond booke of Saint Luke called the Actes of the Apoſtles expreſlie vttered to the pen by the holy Ghoſt, haue not ſhamed to chaunge and transforme the holy Apoſtles of the Lord, into builders of Churches, deuiſers of croſſes, forgers of holy water ſprinckles &amp;c. And what ſhall ſay of that moſt groſſe and enormous an impudent boldnes of forging of Saint Peters patrimonie? Of that monſter crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with three crownes, caried and adored vpon mens ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Of ſuch ſtore of glittering pomps ſhining in euery place, which are ſo manie ſpoiles of ſuch Kings and Princes, as haue beene bewitched, and ſacrilegious robberies of ſuch goods as were vowed to the ſpirituall mainteinance of the Church of the Lord? As it was ſo long agoe foretold, yea painted out by the holy Ghoſt in the Apocalypſe, ſo far as to name the place and the name of ſuch a confuſion. And who hath ſo expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it? The auncient Greeks and Latins, whom the Pope himſelfe liketh of and alloweth. What ſhall wee ſaie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of theſe goodly votaries of pouerty, theſe honeſt wallet brethren, theſe good fathers beſotted with the verie ſtones and ſumptuoſities of their pallaces wherein they dwell?

            <p n="3">3 As for the firſt, ſeeing they reſemble the Phariſees and Scribes, naie are more out of the way then they, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if they cannot abide to haue their profanenes diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: wherein they do their maſter faithful ſeruice, who by their meanes defendeth his hold and fortreſſe, with all the might he maie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.22. True it is they are conſtrayned to auouch that there are many very great corruptions &amp; abuſes in their Church, and of this the preface vnto their councels alwaies ringeth, yea ſometimes their ſermons alſo, and thereupon alſo ye ſhal haue them make ſome ſtatutes and ordinaunces of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

For ſome haue yet left the high places ſtanding, others haue ſet vp Gedeons Ephod, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8.27. others haue ordered the rules of Eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, not according vnto the true pattern of the ancient ſheepe, <hi>and cabbins of the Paſtors,</hi> in which we haue heard howe the Spouſe is in this place commanded <hi>to feede her young kiddes,</hi> but according vnto their own opinion or rather fancy: ſo that if God of his goodnes remedie it not, it cannot be, but that by little and litle <hi>the later ſtate wil come to be woorſe then the firſt,</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. and as is already come to paſſe in too many Churches and countries.</p>
            <p n="6">6 God grant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue the charge hereof his grace, to thinke better on it &amp; to prouide for it, that this ſpouſe maie be reſtored vnto her perfect bewty, whereof the Bridegroome in this place ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>that he compareth her vnto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of horſes of one of the coches of Pharao.</hi> Which ſimilitude &amp; compariſon may ſeem very ſtrange &amp; yet notwithſtanding is very ſignificant &amp; proper, if wee conſider the ſenſe whereunto
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1883:88"/>
it is to be referred, without wreſting or drawing it any farder. So is it ſaid by a ſimilitude (to ſhew that the true Church kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth herſelf to her head, in what place ſoeuer he be) <hi>that where a dead bodie is, there doe the eagles gather themſelues together.</hi> And yet this wold be thought a thing very abſurd, if a man therfore conſequently would liken the children of God vnto foule rauening birds, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt, who is the holy of holies, vnto a carrion. Semblably if a man would make Ieſus Chriſt like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a theefe, vnder this colour, that it is ſaide, <hi>that he ſhal come as a theefe,</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5.2. or vnto a <hi>Iudge fearing neither God nor men,</hi> Luk. 18.2. So likewiſe in this place the ſpirite meaneth not to compare his church vnto an horſe or a mare. But becauſe one of the principall bewties of a woman is this tall and ſtreight feature of body, with a comely countenance, as it is alſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.12. where the daughters are compared to <hi>high &amp; ſtraight pillers of great Pallaces:</hi> the holy ghoſt meaning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent vnto vs by theſe corporall thinges, the excellency of the church of the Lord when ſhee keepeth herſelfe to her true Paſtours, hath choſen this ſimilitude, in oppoſing it vnto the former deſolation, in the which the ſpouſe went as it were hanging downe her head. For as touching the mentioning of <hi>Pharao</hi> in this place, there is no farder reaſon or allegory to be ſought therof, but this, that among al the horſes of thoſe times they of Aegypt were accounted the braueſt and the beſt, as in manie places of the Scripture it is witneſſed vnto vs, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the hiſtorie of Salomon, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 10.28. as at this daie men account of the horſes of Spaine and of Turkie.</p>
            <p n="7">7 But aboue all other things this is eſpecially to be noted, that the Bridegrome calling his ſpouſe with his owne mouth <hi>his loue,</hi> teſtifieth vnto vs, that which the vnderſtanding of man is not able to conceaue, I meane the vnſpeakable loue and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection which hee beareth vnto his Church, to the end wee ſhould learn, the moſt neceſſarie point of our ſaluation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that whatſoeuer ſhe hath, proceedeth from the mere libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie and bounty of her Bridegroome, and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the whole world, either ſo faire, or ſo good, to ſpeake
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1883:89"/>
properlie, as are thoſe iewels wherewith hee adorneth his Church, waiting for the daie of the full and perfect conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this marriage: a doctrine ſo ill knowen as nothing worſe, whereby it is impoſſible that the iudgement of God ſhould be far off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. For the greateſt vnthankfulnes that can be found amongeſt men is this, to be perſuaded that the friend to whom wee owe both our ſelues and whatſoeuer wee haue, hath found I know not what in vs, which hath moued him to chuſe vs, or happily hauing found vs ſo ſo, hath preuented vs by his grace, to the end, that how euer it be, ſome thing might bee found in vs which meriteth and deſerueth his grace and fauor. To this we muſt oppoſe this word ſo often reiterated &amp; repeated in this booke, to wit, <hi>My welbeloued,</hi> or as wee ſaie in our common ſpeach <hi>My loue:</hi> which was after declared in his time by the Bridegroome himſelfe comming in perſon to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate and couenant this marriage in more nearer maner: <hi>I cal you not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my ſeruantes, but I cal you my frindes,</hi> (namely the frinds of this Bridegroome, as is ſpoken, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.29. and 15.15) And wherefore frinds &amp; beloued? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I haue loued you firſt,</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.10. &amp; what ſhal we ſaie? O Lord who are thus thy beloued? They are thy naturall enemies, yea enemies by race and kinde, and from father vnto ſonne. And wherefore then haſt thou loued them? <hi>To cauſe mercie to abound aboue the exceſſiuenes of ſinne.</hi> Rom. 5.20. finding the cauſe thereof no where elſe but in thy meere and onely goodnes and bountie. And how far haſt thou loued them? Euen ſo far <hi>as to lay downe thy life for them,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.16. Behold then a marueilous precious word and which diſcouereth vnto vs ſuch a ſecret as none can ſufficiently comprehend <hi>the length, the bredth, the depth thereof,</hi> Eph. 3.18. and 19. Let this word therefore my brethren, of <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued,</hi> be indeed ſo precious vnto vs, that <hi>the loue of this woorld which is enmity with God,</hi> Iam. 4.4. bewitch vs not, that the loue of deciueable and periſhing riches poſſeſſe not our harts, that the falſe opinion and ſelfe-loue of our ſelues, make vs not to loſe this goodly treaſure, that we depriue not our ſelues of our bleſſing <hi>for a ſoupe as did Eſau,</hi> Heb. 12.16. but that this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1883:89"/>
precious ſur-name of <hi>wel-beloued</hi> ring alwaies in our eares and in our heartes by the holy Ghoſt <hi>who ſoundeth the verie depths of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 2.10. namely the thinges which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs of God: to the end that our whole life be a reciprocall &amp; interchaungeable loue towardes him who hath loued vs ſo much.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But let vs ſpeak now of the port and comelie tall feature of this ſo goodly and faire a ſpouſe. When the vigor and force of the ſoule lighteth on a bodie wel diſpoſed and ordered in al his members, without anie either obſtruction or other defect which hindereth the faculties and powers thereof from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſpredding themſelues throughout the whole body, then truly the effectes thereof ſhew themſelues moſt euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, from the verie heade vnto the feete. Euen ſo fareth it with this ſpouſe, quickned, nouriſhed and ſuſtained by the ſpirit of her Bridegrome, &amp; therefore ſheweth ſhe herſelfe moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and gallant through out: lifting vp her head vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, treading vnder her feete <hi>Satan, the world, and ſinne, yea defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death it ſelfe and hell,</hi> Oſe. 13.14. &amp; 1.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſhe compared elſewhere vnto goodly great &amp; tall trees planted along the waters, from whom no ſtormie time or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon taketh awaie either greennes or fruit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. and 92.12. and 13. True it is notwithſtanding that this vineyard is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brouſed and marred by the vineyarders fault and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence (as is at large declared, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.) nay beaten with hayle and tempeſt from aboue, as if the bridegroome had laide it as low as hee had raiſed it high, and al by the ſpouſes owne fault. But therefore hee beateth her downe to raiſe and lift her vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and to ſhew her how dearly he loueth her, and is iealous in chaſtiſing of her, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 49.21. making alwaies a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene <hi>the deſtruction of Sodome, and the viſitation of Sion,</hi> Eſai. 1.9. And though hee correct vs ſome-times in his great wrath, <hi>yet doth he limit his diſpleaſure,</hi> Pſal.. 125.3. In a word the ſpouſe is ſometimes <hi>diuorced for a time,</hi> as ſhe was, ſcarſe ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares ago, <hi>but is afterward receiued againe,</hi> Ierem. 3.1. <hi>We are preſſed on eueryſide, but not crazed &amp; broke: in need, but not diſtreſſed:

            <p n="9">9 But when was this ſpouſe in this port and ſtate? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhee was neuer more triumphant and glittering then in the time of the Apoſtles, the doctrine of ſaluation beeing neuer better taught, neuer better harkened vnto, neuer better pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. But, wil ſome man ſay, the Church was neuer more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable then it was then as the Apoſtle writeth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. &amp; the whole hiſtory of the Apoſtles in the Acts declareth. True; &amp; this is the ſame which I meant to ſay, namely that the croſſe, is the charriot of triumph in which the Church the ſpouſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth and reioiceth in the Lorde, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. &amp; 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. And indeed when can we ſay for our own time that the word of God had his forth and courſe and ſhewed his powerfull force, but during the great fires? For then death it ſelfe was bidden defiance, men went an hundred miles to haue a little crumme of this heauenly bread: the world and life it ſelfe were made no account of, <hi>men preſſed and thronged to ſnatch the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen by violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10 And now what? Edicts and Lawes being eſtabl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhed to this purpoſe, and ſome libertie and freedome offered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, men contemn that which is euerie day at their doore. If we ſhould be ſent into the ſuburbs or fields after it, that were too farre; if ſome monie muſt be made for the relieuing of the poore woorke-men, this coſts too deare: in a word the Manna which was at the firſt ſo ſweete in our mouthes, hath nowe no reliſh: the Lorde of his mercy remedy it, and giue vs a better mind. We deſire peace and quietneſſe, but it is for nothing els, but to be at our eaſe: and that is the cauſe that this benefit fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from vs, &amp; God knoweth alſo that if wee had it we would abuſe it.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Let vs therefore relie our ſelues on him who giueth vs &amp; our poore brethren peace, after ſo long &amp; ſo rough ſtorms, let vs take heed we be not like horſes fatted on the litter, &amp; wil afterwarde abide neither bridle nor ſaddle, but fling out with all foure, and ſpecially againſt their maſter: <hi>Deutr.</hi> 32.15.

In a word let thoſe combats which are giuen vs, whet and ſharpen the power which is giuen vs from aboue. The world in the meane while will laugh vs to ſcorne and will cal vs fooles &amp; fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke monarkes, but it ſhall weepe in his time, and wee ſhall laugh in the Lord in that our ſeaſon, <hi>when that which is giuen vs alreadie to bee, ſhalbe reuealed,</hi> 1.

            <p n="12">12 Moreouer let vs note that this ſpouſe is compared vnto a goodly horſe, &amp; to couples linked together, which is ſpoken by a moſt proper and fine ſimilitude. For the church repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this name of ſpouſe (in aſmuch as according vnto the lords petition &amp; requeſt <hi>we are al of vs one in him,</hi> Ioh. 17.11. <hi>and all members compoſing one and the ſame bodie,</hi> 1. Cor. 12.12.) what thing is it elſe but a company coupled and yoked, as a man would ſay, two by two vnder the yoake, ſaying one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſwell by wordes as alſo by example, <hi>Come let vs aſcend vp vnto the mount of the Lord,</hi> Eſay. 2.3. and with Dauid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.2. <hi>I reioiced when they ſaid vnto me, we wil go into the houſe of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 122.1. Briefly the whole Scripture is full of ſuch exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that wee ſhould al iointly together tend vnto the ſame marke, yea &amp; that not only in going but in running, as I tould you on the 4. verſe, <hi>the ſtronger ſupporting the weaker</hi> which is coupled with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. and 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.14.

And thus you ſee what this holy aſſembly is whereof we haue here a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler patterne, whereunto the holy ghoſt had reſpect <hi>in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering of the Apoſtles by ſix couples,</hi> Mat. 10.2. &amp; <hi>in ſending them forth two and two,</hi> Mark. 6.7. not at auentures, but as it is likely, according as they were wont to follow their maſter by order &amp; not by any degree, the one had aboue the other, as after it happened they diſputed thereof more then once.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1883:91"/>13 But in lieu of holding themſelues to the deciſion their maſter and ours hath made in this behalfe, they who cal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the Apoſtles ſucceſſours (as a wicked man may well ſucceed a good man in what title ſoeuer) haue changed this order into ſuperiorities and prelateſhips, nay which more is, are gotten themſelues vp into the charriot, inſteed of drawing coupled in it, in which the chiefe conductour of this charriot being ſitten, vaunteth himſelfe &amp; ſaith, that though he ſhould driue it full of ſoules vnto hell, yet is it not for any liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay vnto him, Why doeſt thou ſo?

            <p n="2">2 But for the vnderſtanding of all theſe thinges wee muſt conſider three degrees in this holy marriage, namely the fian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes made by woordes of the future time vnder the auncient couenant: the eſpouſailes by wordes of the preſent, which we muſt referre vnto the comming of Ieſus Chriſt in perſon, and preaching of the Goſpel, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and the full conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this marriage which we looke for, whereof mention is made in the parable of the virgins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. I ſaie the full conſummation, for wee muſt alwaies vnderſtand, that during the time of theſe fianſailes, and ſince, the ſpiritual vertue of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is effectually powred into this ſpouſe, to engender in her <hi>the fruits of righteouſneſſe,</hi> whereunto we ought to referre that which is ſaid, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.8. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. but God is not yet <hi>all in all,</hi> nor ſhal be vntil the ſecond comming, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28.

And if hereupon anie man replie that then the Lord hath not alwaies giuen one and the ſame rule, it is eaſily aunſwered that we ſhal find the cleane contrary, if we conſider of things aright, namely that the holy Ghoſt is neuer contrary vnto himſelfe. Gold and ſiluer are the good creatures of God, and wee finde by moſt certaine examples of the holie fathers, that of a long time the vſe thereof hath beene not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in buying and ſelling, but alſo in ſome ſortes of ornamentes and iewels. But firſt of al let vs not think that curious woorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip and ſuperfluities in this point were therefore rife and

And when mention is made of the Daughters of that mighty and exceeding rich king Dauid, it is ſaid onely that they were clad with garments of diuerſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.18. it may bee like vnto the Almaine Maidens in theſe daies.

of like nature. But who can excuſe this broydered and frizled haire, this painting and ſliking of faces, with other ſuch filth? And therefore we neede not maruaile that the Apoſtles made the like reckoning of gold and ſiluer and broydered haire, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them al in one rancke. For in truth albeit the diſtinction which I haue ſet downe haue his place, notwithſtanding it is a marueilous harde thing to keepe a meaſure.

            <p n="5">5 To vnderſtand therefore the better the excellencie of the Euangelicall banquet, aboue the Leuitical, I meane of the

banquet vnder the goſpell aboue the banquet vnder the lawe (whereunto this place is firſt of all referred) we may ſay that albeit the fathers, as they had one and the ſame faith with vs, ſo conſequently <hi>they did eate of the ſame meate, and drunke of the ſame drink with vs, to wit of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> without whom there is no life eternall, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. Yet notwithſtanding conſidering the manner of banqueting, wee may ſay that in the Leuiticall banquet the ſpouſe ſate not ſo neare her bridegroome: but in the Euangelical banquet the Bridegroome looketh nearer on his ſpouſe, and the ſpouſe on her Bridegroome, inſinuating themſelues one in the other ſpiritually, that is to ſay, in a more power-full efficacie, by the moſt mighty working of the holie ſpirit and vnto a ſpiritual end, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2.

            <p n="6">6 But let vs note that the ſpouſe addeth, that being placed ſo neare the Bridegroome in this banquet, <hi>her ſpike-narde gaue his ſmell.</hi> The hearb which we cal <hi>ſpike-nard</hi> was had in ſingular recommendation in former time among the people of the eaſt in the matter of their perfumes and ointmentes which ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they vſed in their banquets, as is expreſly to be ſeen in the hiſtory of the goſpell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.3.

            <p n="7">7 But this being more ſubtil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſure, we muſt vnderſtand this after an other ſort to make our profit thereby.

22.7, 8. Again it ſufficeth not to enter in and ſit downe, but our perfume alſo muſt giue his ſmel.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Yea but will ſome man ſaie, wee ſhould rather eate and drink to be ſatisfied; &amp; heere is no mention of meate or drink. Let vs therefore note that in this banquet there is no ſpeech of refreſhing and filling the bellie which requireth meate and drinke, but the queſtion is here of ſpirituall life: and therefore mention is of the odor and ſmel of the <hi>spike-nard of the ſpouſe, of Mirrhe and cluſters of Copher,</hi> namely becauſe there is no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or materiall thing more fit or proper to ſignifie vnto vs a ſpiritual thing, then the ſmel of ſweet thinges, which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the brain after ſo ſuttle a maner as nothing more. And this expoſition is neither farre ſet or leſſe certaine: for this is the verie ſtile of the Scripture as we will anon declare. But by this reckoning the ſpouſe ſhould ſeeme rather to haue giuen the Bridegrome ſomewhat then to haue receiued ought of him, obiecting her ſmel of <hi>spike-nard.</hi> The anſwere is that it is cleane contrarie: for the ſpouſe hauing declared at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſhee deſired to be kiſſed and not vaunting of kiſſing of him, and demanding to be drawn of him to come vnto him, with her companions, and to enioy the odour of his perfumes, ſheweth ſufficientlie that ſhe confeſſeth ſhe bringeth nothing to her Bridegroome which ſmelleth ſweete vnto him, but that which ſhee hath receiued of him to preſent him withall. And yet it is not to be ſaid, that in the auncient ſacrifices wee ſpake of before, there was neither bread, nor wine, nor fleſh offered, or that men did not really and corporally eate or drinke, as yet at this day wee are really waſhed and ſprinkled with water in Baptiſme, in the ſupper we do truly eate bread and drink wine which are there made ſacramentes, that is dedicated and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated vnto an holie and ſacred vſe. But we muſt vnderſtand that in the ancient ſacrifices, that which appeaſed Gods wrath <hi>was not the fleſh and the blood of goats and buls which men brent.</hi> Heb. 10.4. but hee which was ſacramentallie repreſented by the beaſt which was ſacrificed I meane Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhoulde in his time deliuer vp himſelfe for vs in oblation and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1883:99"/>
vnto God his father, in an odour of a ſweete ſmel, and that which the faithfull ſacrificer receiued vnto ſaluation was not that which he ate with the teeth of his mouth, wherewith the bodie was nouriſhed, <hi>but the remiſſion of his ſinnes by the bloode of him who blotteth them out,</hi> Rom. 3.24. and 1. Pet. 1.19. as the lord alſo looked not properlie vnto the beaſt which was ſacrificed, or vnto other ſpiritual oblations, <hi>but to the right intent &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart of the ſacrificer,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.8. and 14. and 51. and. 19. which is the <hi>spike-nard</hi> whereof the ſpouſe heere ſpeaketh. Likewiſe in the ſacramentes of the chriſtian Church the corporall and viſible water is not that which waſheth our conſciences: but doth indeede ſignifie and repreſent vnto our outward ſenſes that which waſheth awaie our ſinnes &amp; which ſanctifieth vs beeing apprehended and receiued by faith, I meane <hi>the ſpiritual and inuiſible ſprinkling of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.2. and 3.21. So likewiſe in the Supper of the lord, that which we ſee, touch, eate, and drink, is not that which feedeth and nouriſheth vs vnto eternal life, but that verily which is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentallie repreſented vnto our ſpirit and vnto our faith by the bread and wine, namelie the bodie which was deliuered for vs, and the blood which was ſhed for vs: briefly Ieſus chriſt whole and entire, true God and true man, from whom beeing ſpiritually applied vnto our ſoule by the vertue of the holie Ghoſt, by means of our faith, we draw remiſſion of our ſinnes, encreaſe of our ſanctification; and finally the iuyce of eternall life, both for our ſoule and alſo for our bodie.

               </gap>eſtament the appeaſing of the wrath of God is attributed vnto the ſacrifices, as alſo in the writinges of the Apoſtles, theſe woords of waſhing, and of communicating of the bodie and of the bloode of the Lord, and of putting on of Ieſus Chriſt are attributed and giuen vnto the viſible and corporal ſignes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is not to yeeld vnto the ſignes that which is incommunicably proper &amp; belonging vnto the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (for we know that water waſheth not the ſoule, &amp; that the ſoule neither eateth nor drinketh) but this is to ſhew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe things conſidered in the common vſage

of this life, and the ſelf ſame things conſidered as ſacraments, that is to ſaie, as viſible ſignes of that which the Lord there giueth vs, and which hee worketh inuiſibly in our ſoule: if the fault be not in our ſelues, that is to ſay, if in ſteede of receiuing by faith we reiect them not by our incredulity.</p>
            <p n="9">9 What is then the <hi>spike-nard</hi> whereof the ſpouſe ſpeaketh in this place, and the ſmel whereof is moſt liking and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the Bridegroome?

Gen. 8.21. In a woorde, it is truly the whole life of a chriſtian, in which we ſeeke according vnto the meaſure of the ſpirite <hi>to pleaſe him in all things,</hi> Col. 1.10. <hi>conſecrating vnto him both our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and mindes in all our actions,</hi> Rom. 12.1. <hi>and as a ſweete ſmelling ſauour vnto the Lord, euerie one following his vocation,</hi> 2.

Loe this is, this is the odour and perfume which we muſt bring vnto this banquet, which is alſo ſignified <hi>by the marriage gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Mat. 22.11. <hi>on paine of beeing caſt, handes and feete bound, into vtward darkneſſe, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>

            <p n="10">10 Theſe things being well conſidered, what may I ſay or hope for of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who appeare at this holy banquet at the ſound of the bell, and in the meane time come and depart, alas not with this <hi>ſpike-nard,</hi> but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe with al maner of ſtinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infection, who are the cauſe that in ſteede that the world ſhould be drawen to glorifie God, <hi>ſeeing the fruits of his spirit in them</hi> as they bee deſcribed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. men become ſtincking before God and man, beeing the cauſe <hi>that his holy name which is called vpon of vs is blasphemed among the vnbeleeuing,</hi> Rom. 2.24.

Cor. 6.7. for the breach is made on both ſides: and if it bee not ramperd vp, we cannot but be ſurpriſed and deſtroied. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted on the left hand, by our naturall luſts and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences, that if we giue grounde, the fire can no ſooner take the powder of the Canon, but al wil down without reſiſtance. For as the water goeth naturally downward without any dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, ſo fareth it with vs, by reaſon of our corruption, in ſuch ſort that the moſt regenerat can hardly reſiſt the leaſt aſſaults. This thing requireth no proofe. For thoſe who are beſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed doe know by euery daies experience, that they neede a wrench and pully to drawe them to think well, much more to doe well. Thus you ſee the mighty aſſault of Satan which wee muſt withſtand, by which hee laboureth to induce vs not to care for being garniſhed and prouided of the ſpikenard, as if wee had the mercie of God in our ſleeue, and as if euerlaſting life were prepared for mockers and hart hardned miſcreants who ſay, <hi>Let vs ſin that mercy may abound,</hi> Rom. 6.1. vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the great mercie and fauor which God hath ſhewed vnto whom it pleaſed him.</p>

               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1883:101"/>12 The other aſſault is no leſſe eaſie vnto our aduerſarie ayding himſelfe with our owne diſpoſition, by which we are naturally giuen to an opinion and ouer-weening of ourſelues, eſpecially when it is made againſt them who haue receiued ſome ſpeciall graces of God, either within or without his church. So we ſee the beſt wittes to come to nothing, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt hurtfull of all others, as al hiſtories aſwel ſacred as profane, contain moſt heauy examples therof, &amp; we yet ſee it come to paſſe in our time. But aboue al the reſt, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is proceeded this moſt falſe, moſt wicked, and moſt diueliſh doctrine of merites and ſatisfactions, but from this curſed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that our nature, ſuch as it is at this day, is ſomthing worth before god? Hence it is the Pelagians are come, ſetting on foot againe the ſect of the Phariſies, called of Saint Paul, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great cauſe, enemies of the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, nothing being more contrarie vnto the grace of God, then the opinion of beeing able to doe any thing which by the valewe thereof meriteth and deſerueth any thing at Gods handes.

For beſides that our conſcience ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth and reproueth the holieſt and beſt, that is to ſay, the leaſt wickedſt workes we doe of negligence, ignorance and great defect, witnes that great and holy perſonage Saint Paul, who crieth with a lowde and ſhrill voice ſaying, <hi>Alas the good which I would doe, I doe not: but that euill which I would not doe, that doe I,</hi> what madneſſe is it to thinke (were wee as holy as the Angels themſelues) that any thing can part from vs which of his own valewe can merite that God loue vs, and doe ſomewhat for vs? Nowe then this opinon of the heretickes called Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, denying original corruption in man ſince the fal of Adam beeing moſt egerly condemned, Satan hath not left for al that or quitted his aſſault, but is onlie turned a toe-ſide, giuing vs to vnderſtand that indeede our naturall light is darkened, and our wil enclined to falſhood and wickedneſſe, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſoule hath need of grace, firſt to aide our weakenes, &amp; correct our defect, &amp; conſequently which may make a ſupply to our good workes, that they be not too neerely examined &amp;

ſifted, the Lorde contenting himſelfe, and taking in paiment of recompence and ſatisfaction, that which we preſent him of our indeuours, according as his grace hath preuented and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied vs. Behold a goodly faire cloke of coſinage. For if this be true, what ſhall become of Ieſus Chriſt, he ſhall giue vs onely the meane to become ſauiours of our ſelues, if not in whole, yet in part, his bloodſhed mingled with our woorkes ſhal make them auailable vnto ſaluation, being himſelfe alone no more ſufficient, then our workes by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues without him.

The firſt of theſe two queſtions enquireth after the cauſe, &amp; the ſecond ſpeaketh of the effectes. The onely meere grace and fauour of God therefore hath elected vs, called vs to ſaluation, and is the cauſe of our ſaluation, from the beginning vnto the ending. For, that faith created in vs by grace, apprehendeth and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth holde of Ieſus Chriſt, and of life in him, it is becauſe it hath pleaſed God ſo to ordaine and appoint the cauſes, by the which he executeth his eternal counſel touching our election and ſaluation. But hereby a man knoweth the faithfull and by conſequent the elect to bee glorified, that beeing by the free grace of God chaunged into newnes of life, they depart from iniquity to follow after righteouſnes, according as it pleaſeth God to woork in them ſooner or latter and in diuerſe meaſure. The faithful therefore are thoſe who are known by their good workes, and God crowneth them both in this world and in the other. But how? Of his meere gratuity and ſole mercy, and not that there is in them any value which meriteth, or that they are accepted for ſatisfaction (ſeeing the onely oblation of Ieſus Chriſt once made is more then ſufficient in this behalfe) or for that they are correſpondent and aunſwering vnto the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe required by the Law, and which onelie meriteth and deſerueth, according vnto the tenour of the couenant, life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting; agreeable to this reſolution, <hi>Doe all theſe thinges and thou ſhalt liue, and curſed is he which accompl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſheth not al theſe things.</hi> In ſumme therefore it is in Ieſus Chriſt alone who hath perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly accompliſhed and fulfilled al righteouſneſſe, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Law are auaileable vnto vs. Farther albeit we bee neither ſtones nor blockes in wel doing, notwithſtanding ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to will wel or to doe wel are not any way of our owne nature, but created in vs by grace onelie, the good workes we doe are rather his then ours, and therefore to ſpeake properlie indeed, he crowneth his works in vs his vnprofitable ſeruants
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1883:102"/>
rather then ours, as if they proceeded from vs. In a woord that he accepteth of and crowneth the beſt woorkes of the holyeſt as rightlie good, and ſmelleth vnto the odor of our ſpike-nard as ſauoring him and ſmelling wel, proceedeth not of any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quality of them which they haue in themſelues, but of this, that of his meere mercie hee conſidereth them not rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, ſuch as they are in themſelues, but regardeth and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them in him in whom it hath pleaſed him to elect vs, &amp; in whom it pleaſeth him ſo to looke on vs as to like both of vs, and whatſoeuer is preſented him by vs. For examining in rigor of the Law the greateſt godlineſſe and charitie which can bee found in anie of his Saintes, it ſhall bee found that in all of this there is ſo much ſoile and filth intermingled with that which is cleane and neate, and ſo much bad among the good, ſuch as it is, that not onely it is without al value to be able to moue the Lord to crown vs with his glorie, but contrariewiſe being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a polluting and defiling of his graces, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing but condemnation if he iudge of it according vnto the merit thereof.</p>
            <p n="14">14 And this is the cauſe why the ſpouſe reſteth not on her own <hi>spike-nard,</hi> but on her Bridegrome whom ſhe compareth vnto two ſweete plantes or young trees (for theſe names are not very welknown vnto vs) bearing a gum of moſt excellent ſweete odour, namely to the Myrrhe, and vnto that which is called Copher, bearing a certaine fruite or a flowre in forme of a cluſter, whereof was great aboundance in the vineplattes of Engaddi, a place renowned in ſacred hiſtorie by reaſon of his plenty and fertility. Let vs therefore note in this place firſt the manner of ſpeech, which ſheweth that the ſpouſe and her ſpike-nard are two diſtinct thinges. But the Bridegroome is himſelfe this Myrrhe and this Copher. For touching the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which we haue and concerning the fruites of them, which are good works, all theſe are qualities not borne in vs nor with vs, but are come on vs of the liberality of him, who createth and formeth in vs both to wil and to doe: ſo that to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, it is not we that ſmel ſweet, but the giftes and graces of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1883:103"/>
God wherewith he hath endued vs, cauſe vs to ſmel ſweet. But it is the Bridegroome which hath al of himſelfe, in as much as he is God, and giueth al vnto himſelfe, in aſmuch as he is man. In a word it is hee that is all perfection: and that hath it in him without meane or meaſure: but to impart and communicate it howe and to whom it pleaſeth him, as the fragrant flowre keepeth not his ſweete ſmel to it ſelfe, but poureth it forth and cauſeth it to be ſauored and ſmelt of them which approch and come neare it. And this is the cauſe why it is ſaide elſewhere not onely that this Bridegroome hath life in him: but <hi>that he is the life it ſelfe and the reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>that hee hath life in himſelfe, yea</hi> ſaith he <hi>the ſpirit taketh of mine,</hi> Ioh. 16.14. as elſewhere hee ſaith, <hi>that he hath power to lay downe his ſoul, and to take it to himſelfe againe,</hi> Ioh. 10.18.</p>
            <p n="15">15 And this is the reaſon alſo why he is not compared ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie to one graine but to <hi>an handfull or bundell of Myrrhe,</hi> nor to one graine alone of <hi>Copher,</hi> but to <hi>a cluſter of Copher,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that indeede hee giueth of his ſpirit by meaſure, but hee hath al in himſelfe without meaſure. But alas it is not vpon the woorld that he hath powred this odour. For neither doth this ſmel wel vnto it, nether doth it ſmel wel vnto the Bridegrome. Who is then quickned with this <hi>odour of life?</hi> 2. Cor 2.16. It is ſhe who hath <hi>this bundel of Myrrhe and cluſter of Copher in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> namely they who according vnto the example of the bleſſed <hi>virgine Marie</hi> lay vp and keepe the <hi>wordes of eternall life,</hi> Ioh. 6.68. <hi>in their heart,</hi> Luk. 2.15. <hi>Who heare this woorde of the Lorde and keepe it,</hi> Luk. 11.28. and <hi>meditate therein daie and night,</hi> Pſal. 1.2. <hi>in whoſe hearts this word dwelleth plentifully,</hi> Col. 3.16. and by conſequent <hi>Ieſus Chriſt together with his father,</hi> Ioh. 14.23. as alſo <hi>the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Gal. 4.6. to the end <hi>that our bodies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be his Temple,</hi> 1. Cor. 6.19. Let vs therefore learne to diſcerne the painted ſhew of the world from the true beuty and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and let vs pray our good God it maie pleaſe him to change vs throughly, driuing out of our vnderſtanding al filthineſſe of falſehoode and ignorance and al infection of our affections, in lieu whereof hauing perfumed vs within and without with the

odour and ſweete ſmell of his integrity and obedience, it will pleaſe him to reforme vs alſo in all pureneſſe and holineſſe, to bee vnto him a ſweete ſmelling ſauour by his holy grace and ſingular mercie. And becauſe that hitherto wee haue abuſed theſe his graces, notwithſtanding his ſo great patience, wee wil demaund and craue mercy at his hands as followeth.</p>

This loue therefore is mutual and reciprocal: and ſeeing that ſuch ſpeech cannot proceede but from faith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. it cannot be but acceptable vnto God, who taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to bee loued and honoured of his. But notwithſtanding there is great difference betweene the loue of the Bridegrome towards his ſpouſe, and that of the ſpouſe towardes the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1883:106"/>
&amp; preſentes it ſelfe firſt, the other followeth. The firſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from himſelfe engendreth the other in vs of meer grace. For <hi>our wel-doing reacheth not vnto god,</hi> Pſal. 16.2. to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added, &amp; from whom nothing can be taken. But al the good and profit which can proceede from the loue that a faithfull ſoule beareth vnto his Sauiour, returneth to it ſelfe, becauſe it pleaſeth God <hi>to honour them who honour him,</hi> Gen. 22.26. 1. Sam. 2.30. Pſal. 91.14. And who wil not cry out with the Prophet, ſaying; <hi>What is man that thou vouchſafeſt to know him, &amp; the ſons of men that thou wilt haue care of them?</hi> Pſal. 8.5. and. 144.3. And againe, <hi>What ſhal I render vnto the lord?

            <p n="5">5 The ſpouſe addeth, <hi>Beholde thou art goodly and pleaſant.</hi> A moſt true ſpeech. For what is there in reſpect of this great ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſo goodly or ſo pleaſant?

But beſides this, we muſt note that ſhe which ſpeaketh heere, is ſhee onelie, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what this beuty is, albeit her ſelfe were truly faire, &amp; heard her beautie commended by her Bridegroome, ſtaieth not her ſelfe notwithſtanding thereon, but ſeemes ſhe would ſaie, that as for her ſelfe, all her beauty is nothing vnto her, but that it is her Bridegroome who is indeede <hi>goodly</hi> and worthy to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on, as alſo hereon it is that ſhe altogether reſteth her ſelfe. The poor Paynims and not our wiſe Salomon onelie, <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.2. could tel wel enough how to blame &amp; diſlike of them, who gaze on their owne feathers, &amp; praiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. And how may wee cal the aſſembly of them, the ſpouſe of the Lord, that is to ſaie, the true Church, who alleadge their vertues and merites, though they had an hundred times more then they attribute vnto themſelues? This ſaie they, thinking thus to excuſe the matter, proceedeth not only from our ſelues, but from grace alſo, with the which if we were not preuented and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, wee coulde merit nothing at all.

And what ſaith the Apoſtle of Abraham the father of the beleeuing? <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if Abraham were iuſtified by woorkes, he hath whereof to boaſt, but not before God,</hi> Rom 4.2. And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God what aunſwere doe they returne the Lord giuing them teſtimony of their good life in the later day? <hi>lord, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaw we thee hungry &amp; thirſty &amp;c</hi>? Mat. 25.37. Let vs therefore apply our ſelues vnto the ſtudie of good workes, which are the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie giuen vnto the Church of God, and know we that God wil begin them in vs, as it is he who doth them in vs, beſtowing on vs freely both <hi>the willing and the doing,</hi> Phil. 2.13. but by his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace, freely beſtowed in him in whom alone he accepteth of vs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. and not for any value or merit of them. For not onlie we haue nothing but of free gift, 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 4.7. but alſo <hi>when we haue done al, we ſhal be nothing but vnprofitable ſeruantes</hi> to that maſter who hath nothing to doe neither with vs nor with our woorks, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. as alſo the Apoſtle ſpeaking of thoſe who are moſt righteous ſaith, that <hi>euerlaſting life is the gift of God by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 7.23.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Finally the ſpouſe ſaith: <hi>Our bed is green, the beams of our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are of Cedar, &amp; our galleries of Cypers.</hi> As touching the bed, this may be mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not of a couch to ſleep on, but of the maner they vſed of old in taking their repaſt, not ſitting but halfe lying on cuſhins, as the proper ſignification of the word importeth which the ſpouſe aboue vſed, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 12. This may bee alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well referred vnto that which is ſaid of the <hi>greenes,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if it were made of greene graſſe. Notwithſtanding there is nothing letteth why it may not be taken alſo for a couch or
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1883:107"/>
bed, whereon men repoſe &amp; reſt themſelues. Nowe in what ſort ſoeuer it bee taken, the ſpouſe doth rightly ſay that this bed is greene, to ſhew how pleaſant <hi>that peace is which the world cannot giue,</hi> Ioh. 14.27. <hi>neither yet take awaie,</hi> Ioh. 16.22. which repoſe is not found but in Ieſus Chriſt alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>there is no condemnation in them which are in him,</hi> Rom. 8.1. And this is the reaſon wherefore this ſpouſe, yea euerie of the faithfull is compared vnto <hi>a goodly tree alwaies greene and bearing fruite,</hi> Pſal. 1.3. &amp; 92.15. And Saint Peter ſaith that <hi>our crowne is incorruptible.</hi> That which is added, of beames of Cedar, &amp; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of Cpyers or other ſuch wood, hauing reſpect vnto the buildings and pallaces of kings couered flat with battlements and galeries on the top, tendeth vnto the ſame end, namely, to ſhew vs by the ſimilitude of theſe two ſortes of odoriferous &amp; not putrifiyng trees, that the ioyning and coupling of this Bridegrome with this ſpouſe withdraweth vs from the ſtench and corruption of the woorld, making of our ſoules &amp; bodies ſo many <hi>Temples,</hi> diſtinctly conſidered, <hi>dedicated vnto God,</hi> 2. Cor. 6.16. and Ioh. 14.23. as being ioined together they are called <hi>liuing ſtones</hi> for the building of this one and ſpirituall Temple, namely of the church truely Catholique &amp; vniuerſal, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Neither muſt we forget that ſhe maketh diſtinct menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firſt of the beames, and then of the galeries: naming the principal proppes and ſtaies of this building, I meane the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, who yet to this day quicken &amp; giue life vnto the Church of God, by their holy writings preached and expounded therein, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. Such therefore is this houſe of the Lord and the habitation of the true Church, &amp; not this lakes built vpon mens traditions with mouldy and rotten wood which hath ſome faire ſhew at the firſt bluſh, but being tried in the day of the Lorde it is incontinently conſumed like hay &amp; ſtubble, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. before that conſuming fire which is ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3. But to conclude, ſeeing the Cedar and the Cypers wood is ſuch, as no continuance of time ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſault with rottenneſſe or corruption, what meane they to doe, who
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1883:107"/>
haue taken vpon them to pul downe theſe beames &amp; galeries? What is this but to think to ruinate and ouerthrow that which is built vpon <hi>the moſt higheſt,</hi> and <hi>whoſe kingdome is without end,</hi> as the Angell Gabriell witneſſeth vnto the bleſſed virgin Mary, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33. Now ſeeing it is in this houſe of Cedar, &amp; of Cypers that he raigneth, namely in the true Sion which ſhall neuer be ſhaken or remooued, <hi>the worde of the Lorde enduring for euer,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.25. God giue vs grace to be wel ſeated for euer in this holy houſe, and pray we, it may pleaſe him to bewtifie vs with his holy ſpirite more and more, that wee may bee vnto him a ſweet ſmel in our true Bridegrome, &amp; finally may raign with him for euer: which thing wee will craue at his handes, with a true confeſſion &amp; deteſtation of our faults, deſiring him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiueneſſe as followeth.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1883:109"/>
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt her head, in whom ſhe ſeeketh and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whatſoeuer ſhe can deſire, though ſhe yet in effect enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but a ſmal portion of thoſe benefites and bleſſings which are obtained her by this bond, the ful conſummatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherfore ſhee expecteth and looketh after with a marueilous ardent longing and affection. And hitherto is it that this alſo tendeth which we are now to expound, as alſo all the reſt of this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or Song, in which vnder the figure of a marriage feaſt and banquet, and of mutual kind entertainement of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome and the ſpouſe each towards other, vſing in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſinges diuerſe ſingular ſimilitudes, is repreſented vnto vs both the perfect excellency of this Bridegroome, as alſo the moſt happie eſtate and condition of this ſpouſe, to forme and breed in vs a deſire of preferring Ieſus chriſt &amp; his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al things, being throughly incorporated into this church, which is the company of the faithful figured out &amp; repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by this Queen. The Bridegroom therfore ſpeaking here firſt of himſelfe, compareth himſelfe vnto two moſt goodly and moſt odoriferous and ſweet ſmelling flowers aboue al other, which are the <hi>Roſe</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lilly,</hi> applying afterward vnto his ſpouſe the ſame ſimilitude of the <hi>Roſe.</hi> Which the ſpouſe hearing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth him firſt vnto <hi>A goodly apple-tree ful of moſt pleaſaunt and exceeding ſweete fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Now for the firſt we maie not thinke it ſtraunge that the Bridegroome commendeth himſelfe, contrary vnto the leſſon which Salomon himſelfe hath giuen and ſet downe, <hi>Prou.</hi> 72.2. As indeede wee ſee how the Apoſtle beeing conſtrained to ſpeake more magnificently of himſelfe to eſtabliſh his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Apoſtolical, is fain to vſe a preface in that behalfe, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth that he is forced to do, as fooliſh men are wont to do, who preach their owne praiſes. But it is another thing in God then in men. For men are naturally ambitious and can hardlie praiſe &amp; commend themſelues, but they are ſtraightway tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſome opinion of themſelues, attributing the whole or at leaſt ſome part of the whole vnto themſelues, as if it waxed in their owne garden, whereas they haue nothing but of free
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1883:109"/>
gift, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. beſides that they know not how to keepe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in either rule or meaſure. And this is the cauſe why ſuch as are wiſe are ſo far from praiſing and commending of themſelues, that they cannot heare themſelues praiſed in their owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but they muſt bluſh: and if it be ſo that they muſt needs ſpeake of thoſe graces which rhey haue receiued of God, they doe it alwaies in ſuch ſort that they euer attribute the whole vnto the giuer, as Saint Paul is wont to doe in moſt expreſſe termes, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. keeping therein a good meaſure, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. As likewiſe if they muſt commend another they faile not to adde, that the praiſe thereof pertaineth vnto God, a witneſſe whereof may be the ordinarie beginning the ſame Apoſtle v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in his Epiſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.2. and 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. But when the lord commendeth himſelfe, beſides that hee cannot ſaie ſo much of himſelfe but that there is ſtill a great deale more remaining, which maketh his teſtimony of himſelfe moſt certaine &amp; ſure, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.14. he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alſo doe it vpon ambition. For all honour and glorie is due to him alone, and nothing can bee added vnto or taken from him. Neither doth he this but to moue vs thereby and to draw vs out of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But this he doth in two ſorts opening his holy mouth to teach vs. Firſt to make vs to vnderſtand the language of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſenſible creatures, which ought to be vnderſtoode of euerie one, &amp; is notwithſtanding vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the moſt part of men. For when he calleth himſelfe Almighty and eternall Creator, moſt patient, and yet notwithſtanding moſt iuſt and righteous, he doth as a maſter painter, who ſhould paint cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine figures in a table, not to ſtay his ſcholers in the outwarde view and contemplation of that which the painting doth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly figure &amp; repreſent, but to make them thereby to know things greater and inuiſible by thoſe viſible repreſentations &amp; Images. For example, the picture whereof the world made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes a deteſtable Idol, called <hi>Saint Chriſtopher,</hi> was neuer the picture or pourtrait of any man of that name: but was firſt inuented to repreſent the condition and ſtate of euery chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1883:110"/>
called <hi>Chriſtophorus,</hi> that is to ſay, bearing in effect the name of Ieſus Chriſt, namely the burden of his Croſſe, and paſſing as a mighty gyant through the gulfe of this woorlde, with the reſt and proppe of <hi>faith,</hi> ſeruing him as it were for a ſtaffe, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guided alwaies by the meanes of the light of the worde vnto the hauen. And thence it came to paſſe that becauſe the Chriſtians could neuer abide any Image or portraite to bee brought into the aſſembly and congregation of Chriſtians, theſe Saint Chriſtophers are yet remaining in the church por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: as alſo the figure of that, for which they haue made their Saint George. But the diuell found afterwardes the meane to bring into the Church both theſe pictures, and a million of ſwarmes of other Idoles, euen to put God and his trueth out of doores. To returne vnto my matter, the frame of this worlde (as, beſides that which the blinde Paynims themſelues haue in this behalfe obſerued, the whole Scripture teacheth vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and 145. and elſewhere almoſt throughout, &amp; namely the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and <hi>Acts.</hi> 17. in that excellent Sermon of his which he made at Athens) is a plain and excellent preaching, of the eternall wiſedome, power, and bountie of God. But when god ſpeaking either vnto his ſeruants, or by his ſeruants, declareth vs the ſame, hee is then as it were a verbal expoſitor of that which many (were it not for this) would neuer obſerue in the contemplation of the heauens, or of the earth, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the creatures of God. And hereunto we muſt referre a great number of places of the holy Scripture, which are as it were a gloſſe and commentarie of that which the good and goodly creatures of God doe teſtifie vnto vs without ſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Secondly becauſe this whole manifeſtation of Gods ſo great and magnificent maieſty, could not but aſtoniſh vs, nay condemne vs, &amp; make vs altogether inexcuſeable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. Therefore hath God reuealed and manifeſted from heauen an other more notable &amp; excellent myſterie, I meane the goſpel, announcing and preaching vnto vs the free reconciliation of God with vs, together with al the vertue of the ſpirite of God,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1883:110"/>
to enlighten and to chaunge our hearts: wherein God againe vſeth the meanes of viſible thinges, but yet after a maner and faſhion ſomewhat diuerſe and different from the former. For as concerning the firſt point which we haue touched, the lord maketh himſelfe as it were the expounder of the book of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But in this ſecond point hee vſeth his creatures to a more excellent end, and ſuch as paſſeth and goeth beyond the end of their creation, that is to wit, to aide and helpe vs to conceiue this high and ſupernaturall ſecret of our ſaluation and of the author thereof the ſonne of god, and of that which dependeth thereon, in aſmuch as he taketh and draweth from theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral &amp; viſible things, ſimilitudes, ayding &amp; helping greatly for the conceiuing of thinges ſpiritual. This appeareth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit ſimilitudes &amp; parables or compariſons found in the holie Scriptures, and eſpecially in the hiſtory of the goſpel, which if we haue well rooted and planted in our memorie, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can preſent &amp; offer it ſelfe vnto our eies which induceth vs not to think on God to dedicate our whole life vnto him.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In this place therefore according vnto this cuſtomable manner of doing, the Bridegroome which is Ieſus Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth vnto our vnderſtanding his beutie &amp; excellencie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelfe vnto two flowers the <hi>Roſe</hi> and the <hi>Lilly,</hi> yea to a <hi>Roſe</hi> of the faireſt which were in all the countrie, being moſt likely that ſuch were they <hi>of the champion of Sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on,</hi> wherof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 33.9 &amp; 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.29. and <hi>Act.</hi> 9.35. as if we being in Fraunce ſhould ſaie, a <hi>Roſe</hi> of Prouince. Neither is it without cauſe that this compariſon was choſen in this place by the holie Ghoſt. For if we conſider well and narrowly of all ſortes of flowers, we ſhal finde that among al the creatures we ſee here below with our eies, there is none more admirable, or which ſeemeth rather ſent from heauen, then to come out of the earth, then a flower, how ſmal ſo euer hee be, whether wee regard the pure and ſubtil matter it is compoſed of, or whether wee conſider the workemanſhip more then admirable which appeareth in them: or whether we reſpect the colours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are checked and diapred: or whether wee ſtand on
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1883:111"/>
the ſweete ſauour and ſmell which proceedeth from them, or finally whether wee looke vnto the fruites and ſeedes which ſpring from them according vnto their infinit diuerſe kindes. So that there needeth but the leaſt flower that is to conuict all the Atheiſts &amp; mockers of the woorlde of the infinit power &amp; wiſedome of God. And therefore it is not without cauſe that the Lord <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.27. ſaith, that <hi>al the glorie &amp; glittering of Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not comparable to one blewed Lillie of the field.</hi> True it is that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers are of little continuance, for the which cauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth often times repreſent and compare our poore and fraile condition vnto a flower, which is ſoone faded and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, as, <hi>Eſaie.</hi> 40.7. and <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.2. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. but wee muſt apply ſimilitudes no farther then vnto the ende they are referred.</p>
            <p n="6">6 I ſaie therefore that this ſimilitude taken from theſe two moſt faire and exceeding ſweet flowers aboue al other, is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous fit and proper to repreſent this Bridegroome vnto vs, as it were in a glaſſe of the moſt faire and beutifulſt. There is nothing more white and neate then the whiteneſſe of a <hi>Lilly,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Lilly</hi> of the valleies, becauſe it groweth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in ſuch places. And who is hee that commeth neere vnto the puritie and righteouſnes of him in whom there was neuer found anie ſpot neither without, nor within, who is the holy of holies, the only righteouſnes and innocency of whom was able to appeaſe the wrath of God? Aſmuch may bee ſaide of the <hi>white Roſe.</hi> But if we liſt rather to compare this Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome vnto the damask or ſcarlet <hi>Roſe,</hi> hee ſhal be yet better repreſented vnto vs, not according vnto that diuine nature, inuiſible and incomprehenſible, diſtinctly conſidered and by it ſelfe; but in as much as he is the ſonne manifeſted (that is to ſaie made viſible &amp; true man) in our bodily nature. For among al the coulours of the woorld, as the dy of the <hi>ſcarlet Roſe</hi> is the moſt excellent that maie be found, ſo ther is none which doth more liuely and naturally repreſent the coulour of mans fleſh quicke and temperately coloured. What is then this ſcarlet or damaske fleſh color <hi>Roſe</hi>? It is the great ſecret of our religion,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1883:111"/>
namely the true <hi>ſonne of God, manifeſted in fleſh, iuſtified in spirite, ſeene of Angels, preached vnto the Gentiles, beleeued on in the world, and receiued vp into glorie,</hi> 1. Tim. 3.16. this is that <hi>elder brother,</hi> Rom. 8.29. <hi>the faireſt of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> Pſal. 45.3. <hi>this is our ſoueraigne high prieſt, holy, without spot of ſinne, ſeparated from ſinners, exalted aboue the heauens,</hi> Heb. 7.26. <hi>crowned with glorie and honour,</hi> Heb. 2.9. <hi>who hath a name aboue al names,</hi> Phil. 2.9. But how is he aſcended vnto his degree? By the ſuffering of his death, euen the death of the croſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. Beholde then a gaine <hi>a Roſe</hi> not onelie in part died, but all red with that blood by the which our ſinnes are waſhed. Such was hee when Pilate hauing ſcourged him brought him forth vnto the people &amp; ſaid, <hi>behold the man.</hi> Such was hee when hee was al bathed with his owne bloode on the croſſe <hi>beaten for our ſinnes, wounded for our iniquities, torne and disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> Eſaie. 53.5. And what was then the beuty of this <hi>Roſe</hi>?

nor ſhould not now haue beene, or at anie time hereafter anie ſpouſe of this Bridegroome, that is to ſaie, neither Church nor eternal and euerlaſting happines and felicity.

In a word, although the act of this bloody ſacrifice, and of this onely oblation once for al made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 14. be paſſed alreadie, and that Ieſus chriſt liueth and raigneth as a victorious Lord ouer death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. hauing led his enemies captiue in triumph, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.8. yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding before the father, vnto whom there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of time paſt, preſent, or to come, the woundes of this Bridegroome, wherewith this <hi>Roſe</hi> is bathed, do as I maie ſo ſaie, alwaies bleede freſh and ſhal bleede for euer, holding ſtill &amp; appeaſing the wrath &amp; anger of God the father. And what doe we euerie day, whether it be in hearing and receiuing this word and giuing him thankes, or whether it be ſpecially in the celebration of the holy ſupper, but renew and refreſh the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of his death and paſſion, not to offer him vp againe in ſacrifice (for this were to denie his reall oblation once for all made, and for euer) but as it were to preſent him, beeing yet, as I may ſo ſaie, euery daie ſacrificed, and as it were ſtil bloody, in aſmuch as we ſet his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between god &amp; vs, as the only foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of our faith as alſo of our hope. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs know that without wee preſent vnto the father this <hi>Roſe</hi> throughout red, &amp; this <hi>Lilly</hi> altogether white &amp; pure, neither we nor our prayers can be acceptable vnto him: of the which flowers, if the coulor, which is a witneſſe of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

and ſatisfaction and innocencie of this Bridegroome, be pleaſing and acceptable vnto god, the odour of them figured by the perfumes of the Law, as we haue in our ſermons going before at large declared, is much more ſweete &amp; pleaſant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And this is it which we haue to conſider in this Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome to be thereby ſtirred vp and moued to ioyne our ſelues euery day nearer and nearer with him.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Let vs heare now what he ſaith of his ſpouſe, to the ende to make vs the more deſirous to enioy her companie. <hi>Like as the Lilly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>among the thornes, ſo is my loue among the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> We haue alreadie ſpoken of this moſt excellent name and indeede precious of <hi>Loue</hi> or <hi>Welbe-loued,</hi> vnder which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed al maner of bleſſing, and the fountaine and ſpring from whence it floweth, which is the meerelie free loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, who are by nature his enemies, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10. and therefore without farther ſtanding hereon, wee will onelie conſider the cauſes wherefore the ſpouſe is heere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto a <hi>Lilly,</hi> and wherefore theſe words <hi>among the thorns</hi> are added. The faithful, (the aſſemblie and company of whom in one myſtical bodie of Ieſus Chriſt is called the Church) are compared ſometimes to <hi>goodly trees bearing fruit at al times,</hi> Pſ. 1. ſometimes vnto <hi>palm trees &amp; Cedars of Libanus,</hi> Pſ. 92.13. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vnto a <hi>fruitful vine,</hi> Pſal. 80.9. in this place ſhe is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared by her Bridegrome vnto <hi>a Lilly,</hi> as himſelf was alſo called a <hi>lilly</hi> in the verſe going next before, to ſhewe vs the agreeableneſſe and conuenience betweene theſe two. Beholde therefore two <hi>Lilly plantes,</hi> both of them moſt faire and moſt ſweete. But the firſt is a <hi>Lilly</hi> of himſelfe and in himſelfe, yea ſo perfect a one, as hath no fault or blemiſh in it. But this ſecond beeing of it ſelfe a dead plant and infected, is made a <hi>Lillie,</hi> by drawing of the nature and iuyce of the true <hi>Lillie</hi> whereunto it is incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: cleane contrary vnto that which falleth out in graffes of mens planting, in which the graffe remaining ſtill in his owne nature, the wild ſtock on which he was grafted, is altered and chaunged. Such are the faithful called <hi>goodly fruitful trees,</hi> but it is by vertue of the water, which is alwaies at the foote of

their roote, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. who are called <hi>Palmes and Cedars,</hi> but it is becauſe they are planted in the houſe of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.13. who are a <hi>fruitful vine,</hi> but transported and brought out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and planted and husbanded by the hand of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80 9. <hi>whoſe field and husbandrie it is called,</hi> 1.

Neither maie wee maruaile that the name of <hi>Lilly</hi> is giuen and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Church, ſeeing ſhee is ſometimes called by the name of Chriſt her husband, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. in aſmuch as ſhee is made one with him. And indeed why ſhould ſhe not be called <hi>a Lilly,</hi> aſwel as her husband, ſeeing ſhee is holy and righteous with the proper holineſſe &amp; righteouſneſſe of him? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and conſequently of a moſt ſweete ſauour in him? 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. Such then is the true Church, through the onelie grace of god, in him who (beeing made true man in al and through al, ſinne onelie excepted) maketh her conformable vnto himſelfe, &amp; by conſequent euerie of the faithful, chaunging the fleſh into ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, that they maie bee al made one ſpirit in him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. this is I ſaie this true <hi>Lilly,</hi> and therefore it followeth that wee muſt hold her for a falſe and baſtard plant, which ſauoreth not but of her wild and ſtinking nature: or happilie thinketh to muske and perfume her ſelfe with that which ſhe falſly calleth her merites, or the merites of Saintes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. much leſſe are they this Church who by their wicked and deteſtable life, are abominable before God and men, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. vnto whom the Goſpel is turned into the ſauour of death, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But that which is after ſaide, namelie that <hi>this Lilly is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thorns,</hi> giueth vs to vnderſtand, what the condition of the Church here below is, to wit a lamp ſhining amidſt the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. or as a ſheepe among the wolues, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16. in a woord, as a floriſhing plant in the deſertes full of millions of croked bryars and thornes: beeing notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a moſt ſweet ſmel, amongſt al ſtinking and venemous plantes Neither are theſe thorns onelie round about this faire <hi>Lilly,</hi> but thruſt themſelues into her, and ſeeke to choke the <hi>Lilly</hi> and her flowers.

Such therefore is the condition of the Church and of euerie member thereof, as continuall experience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, whereof it was neceſſarie we ſhould bee put in minde and warned, to the end wee ſhould not thinke that we can bee the <hi>Lilly</hi> which is liking and ſmelleth ſweete vnto the men of this world: but contrariwiſe that we ſhould make our account betimes, that the more we be changed into true <hi>Lillies</hi> by the grace of God, the more wee ſhal diſpleaſe the hogs and dogs of this woorlde, to whom nothing is ſweete but that which is filthie and vncleane, the enmity of God and the world being perpetual.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Hereon ought amongſt all others thoſe ſages and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique wiſe eſpecially to thinke, who imagine they can finde a means to agree light and darknes together.

Darknes cannot let the moone and the ſtars to continue ſuch as they are, although ſometimes the vapours be ſo thicke &amp; ſo groſſe, that they who are below are depriued of the ſight of their clearnes and brightnes, euen ſo muſt we bee children of the light in the middeſt of the darknes of this woorld, as the land of Goſen enioyed the light of the daie, when the greateſt part of Aegypt was couered with thick and palpable darknes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.13. Wee muſt bee children of the light to force the moſt wicked to acknowledge in vs the father of light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. and to conuict the froward and wicked woorld, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.

Followeth now what the ſpouſe teſtifieth ſhee hath found &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the excellencie of her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, whom ſhee compareth vnto <hi>an apple tree</hi> full of moſt pleaſant fruit and growing in the midſt of <hi>a foreſt of wilde trees</hi> and ſuch as are vtterlie different in nature from this <hi>apple-tree:</hi> wherein are ſhewed vs great and high myſteries.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1883:115"/>
but to aſſure vs of that which we ought to ſeek after for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance of the true life, the infirmitie of our faith requireth that we ſhould bee taught according vnto our rudeneſſe and weakneſſe. And this is the cauſe why, for that men liue not by the odour and ſmell of flowers, but muſt eate and drink to be ſuſtained: the holy ghoſt compareth and likeneth in this place this Bridegrome, whom he had before compared vnto <hi>a Roſe and a Lilly,</hi> vnto <hi>an apple-tree and other like fruitful tree.</hi> For the woorde which Salomon heere vſeth, as alſo that of the latins which ſignifieth <hi>an apple,</hi> comprehendeth in generall euerie fruitful tree me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eate of, be it of apple, or nut.

Wherein we ſee what a correſpondence there is betweene the Church, which is as <hi>a Roſe among the thornes,</hi> and her Bridegrome being <hi>a fruitful tree planted among other wild trees.</hi> Before the ſinne and tranſgreſſion of man it was not ſo, when there was nothing neither among the fruites of the earth, nor otherwiſe in al this whole worlde, which agreed not with God the Creator, and which was not anſwering vnto the deſire of man, whom God appointed to be ruler and gouerner of al theſe inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But the ſinne of man hauing brought foorth thornes and bryars, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18. it is no maruaile if this change and alteration be found: but this is rather to bee woondred at, that it pleaſeth the Lord of his infinite goodnes to grub vp in ſome part of the world theſe brambles and bryars, and to plant himſelfe there as <hi>a fruitful tree,</hi> to the end that ſome number, whome it hath pleaſed him to elect before the foundation of the world, might feede and be ſuſtained vnder his ſhadow. Wee read in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie

But this implieth nothing but a temporall power, and ſuch as continueth but a ſmall time. And therefore all ſuch trees are ſubiect to bee cut downe, yea rooted vp and conſumed in their time, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that prophecie. But heere mention is made of an <hi>apple-tree</hi> which repreſenteth him whoſe kingdome is euerlaſting, as the father who planted it promiſed it ſhould bee: whereas contrariwiſe <hi>al wild plantes</hi> ſhal one daie be rooted vp and caſt into euerlaſting fier. This is then the imp which is ſprouted out of the ſtocke of Iſaie, vnder whom all the nations of the earth ſhould be gathered there to reſt themſelues, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 11.1.10. and this goodlie tree of life figured by that in the garden of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.7. of whom whoſoeuer eateth he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer die.

We read how Eue our firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, poyſoned with the venom of that old ſerpent, had an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to the eating of that fruite which ſhe was forbidden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſaw it fair to ſee, and good to eat. In that ſhe thought it to be faire and goodlie to ſee, therein ſhe deceiueth her ſelfe nothing at all, but (had not her vnderſtanding beene vtterlie corrupted ſhe would neuer haue thought that that could bee good to eate, the eating whereof ſhee was forbidden by the mouth of her Creator himſelfe. In ſuch ſort doth Satan deale with vs euerie daie, by the meanes of our concupiſcences ſette on fire and entiſed by the outward ſhewe and appearance of thinges, to bring vs vnto ſinne and tranſgreſſion: and yet wee doe much worſe and are more deceiued a great deale then
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1883:116"/>
euer Eue was. For the tree which ſhe tooke to be faire, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed faire and pleaſant to behold, though it was not good to be eaten of. But as for vs, beſides that wee abuſe the beuty and goodneſſe of the creatures of God as ſhe did, we are ſo blinde, that that which is moſt foule ſeemeth vnto vs moſt faire, and that moſt ſweete which is indeede moſt bitter, vntill ſuch time as it pleaſeth God of his mercie to chaunge our ſenſes, and to enable them throughly to diſcerne betweene that which is good &amp; that which is euil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. In a word this tree wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſpouſe here ſpeaketh, is that of which if we eate not, we can haue no life in vs, contrarie to that tree, of which our firſt Parentes were forbidden vnder paine of death to eate.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And ſeeing the deadly taſt of that forbidden tree hath cauſed vs to loſe all luſt and appetite of eating and liking the fruit of the ſecond, which is the only remedie we haue againſt death, we are continually to pray vnto God, that it will pleaſe him to make vs to know the beuty and goodneſſe of this fruit, to haue a through appetite thereunto, to deſire firſt <hi>to ſit vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadowe of it:</hi> which thing we are diligently to conſider of. For among other commodities which trees haue, in places of heat &amp; of parching, their freſh &amp; wholſome ſhade is not the leaſt. And what heat or burning is greater then that of this world, ſeeing we beare beſides within our ſelues, as it were the ſuburbs of hel, where that fire is which is neuer que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched? True it is that according vnto the example of the <hi>rich man</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom mention is made, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. the men of this world inſteed of perceiuing this wretched and miſerable eſtate, find therein a certain cool refreſhing, &amp; cannot abide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who would bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence vnto this true refreſhing ſhade, but in the end they feele it to their great &amp; remediles ſorrow; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are fallen, as we ſay, out of a could feuer into an hot ague, from whence they can neuer get out again. This <hi>ſhade</hi> therfore is the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe &amp; reſt of a mans conſcience, which is no where els to be found but vnder this <hi>tree,</hi> which we ought aboue all things to couet after, as himſelfe alſo ſignifieth by that leſſon which he teacheth vs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. Let vs adde hereunto that which the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1883:117"/>
ſpouſe ſaith, namely, <hi>that ſhe is ſitten vnder this ſhade.</hi> For to what purpoſe were it to enter into a place of refreſhing, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to go out of it? And this is it which ſerueth as it were for an inditeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt ſo many flying &amp; giddy minds &amp; ſpirits, who happily begin wel, but end moſt il: ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wauering now on oneſide, &amp; ſometimes on an other, without reſoluing them ſelues any way, as Elias reproched them of his time, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.24. others whirling about like fanes and wether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cockes with euerie winde, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.6. others turning themſelues the cleane contrary way, as an infinite number of lewd and wicked Apoſtataes and reuolters doe at this day, for whom it would haue beene better they had neuer bin borne. To all this ſort of dealing is oppoſed that which the Spouſe ſaith in this place, <hi>that ſhee is ſitten vnder the ſhade of this tree.</hi> Which ſerueth not onely to the reproofe and condemnation of thoſe whom we haue already ſpoken of, but alſo of a ſort of curious companions who come neare the tree, onely to gaze on it and to looke on them who ſitte vnder it; as alſo of thoſe, who albeit they depart not from vnder the ſhade of this tree, but pretend to ſtay vnder it, notwithſtanding are alwaies gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo after this and that, that they feele not the one halfe of this comfortable refreſhing of this ſhade. Which thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vnto vs in the perſon of Martha, preferring the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhe had of prouiding of corruptible foode for her gueſt, the true &amp; incorruptible life, ſo far as to take it il that her ſiſter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry al that time ſate ſtil at Ieſus feet hearkening vnto his word. But what did the Lord anſwere her? <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art carefull and encombreſt thy ſelfe after many things, but one thing is neceſſary, Mary hath choſen the better part, which ſhall neuer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her.</hi> And would to God all of vs had well &amp; throughly learned this leſſon. Which if we had, we ſhould ſee no longer others walking vp and downe and telling of newes, others ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at their tables a making of good cheere, others in their ſhoppes marchandiſing and traffiking, others out of towne to get in their debts, or rather their reuenewes, while the Lorde inuiteth vs to be at his feete and vnder <hi>the coole ſhade</hi> of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1883:117"/>
ſweete refreſhing of his. Wee haue a long time warned euery one hereof, and we cry out for it in vaine, but <hi>wiſedome cannot be iuſtified but by her children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 The ſpouſe therefore witneſſeth vnto vs the contrary, <hi>that ſhee is ſitten vnder the ſhade,</hi> and which is more, ſhee addeth that ſhe was not idle neither. For ſhe emploied her time <hi>to feed herſelfe with the fruite of this tree,</hi> whoſe excellent ſweetnes ſhe highly commendeth. The houſe of god, which is the encloſure of this tree, and the harbour and dwelling place of the church, is not the encloſure of ſome precious and ſtately building, whereinto a man entreth to ſee the goodly woorkemanſhip of vaultes or of pillers, the glittering of gold, and of ſiluer, and of precious ſtones, nor a place into which a man goeth to hear the Quire or the Organes which fill the eares: but it is a place where the pure word of God is ſincerely preached in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſight of euery man, with exhortations, conſolations, warnings and neceſſary reprehenſions vnto ſaluation, not to returne thence but being fed with the true and ſolide food of ineſtimable ſweeteneſſe to the ſoules of them who taſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour it indeede. For this is indeede the foode which cauſed Saint Peter and his companions to ſtay with Ieſus Chriſt their maſter, when others departed from him, at what time the ſame Saint Peter ſaid vnto his maſter, <hi>Lord, to whom ſhall we goe? Thou haſt the words of eternall life,</hi> Ioh. 6.68. as it is elſewhere ſaid, <hi>that the doctrine of the eternall and euerliuing is the reſtority of the ſoule, that the teſtimony of the euerliuing is true, giuing wiſedome vnto the ignorant, the commaundements of the euerliuing are right, reioycing the ſoule, &amp; the doctrine of the euerliuing pure, enlightening the eies, more to be deſired then gold, yea then the fineſt gold, &amp; more ſweete then any hony, yea the hony combe.</hi> Pſal. 19.8. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Nowe the ſpouſe to ſhewe vs that this Bridegroome of hers nouriſheth her not by halfes, but prouideth her of drinke aſwell as of meate, addeth <hi>that the Bridegroome hath led her from vnder this tree, into a place appointed for the drinking of his wine,</hi> if we had not rather vnderſtand by theſe words which Salomon here vſeth <hi>the banquetting hall</hi>: wherein we are firſt to note that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1883:118"/>
ſhe ſaith not, <hi>that ſhe went,</hi> but <hi>that the Bridegrome led her thither:</hi> to the end wee alwaies remember, that as grace beginneth in vs our ſaluation, creating in vs to will, ſo muſt the ſame grace guide and direct forwarde the ſame will which it gaue vs. For without this inſteede of making forward one pace, we ſhal fal flat to the ground. But as it is he which leadeth vs, ſo wee muſt folowe him: and ſo by conſequent it is not ynough to haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this fruite in our owne home, but wee muſt goe in vnto <hi>the banquet.</hi> We muſt I ſaie ioyne our ſelues vnto our brethren, &amp; make a good confeſſion of our faith altogither euen before men alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for this ende, namely for this <hi>common banquet,</hi> the ſeuenth daie hath beene from the beginning of the world ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the other, and the three ſolemne feaſtes eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vnder the Lawe. Such alſo were at the beginning of the Chriſtian Church thoſe common feaſtes of the Chriſtians, whereof mention is made in the Actes of the Apoſtles, and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. and <hi>Iude</hi> 12. ioined with the celebration of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Supper. Where are then the falſe Nicodemites of our daies? Where are they who for fear of men keepe themſelues cloſe, bearing themſelues in hand that they need not to come in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the banquet</hi>? No, no, the Lord wil haue indeede euery man to meditate and praie by himſelf too <hi>ſitting vnder the ſhade of this tree,</hi> but hee will haue alſo euerie one to enter in into this <hi>banquetting hall,</hi> and there to feaſt togither, for which cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo chriſtian aſſemblies haue a ſpeciall promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. and 24.18. as there is a ſpecial warning alſo giuen vs that wee take heede howe wee deſpiſe ſuch aſſemblies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15. for which cauſe wee ſee many horrible iudgementes fallen vpon manie. Let vs alſo learne that grace is added vnto grace vnto him, vnto whom it is giuen to vſe it well, as is ſhewed in the parable of the talentes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. which is heere declared vs by that which the ſpouſe ſaith, namely, that being before as it were in the fielde, <hi>ſate vnder this tree,</hi> and eating of the fruite thereof with a good ſtomacke, ſhe was afterwardes led in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>the hall of this great feaſt,</hi> where ſhee was yet more aboundantly fedde, and that in ſuch ſort as that ſhe confeſſeth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1883:118"/>
that ſhee fell into a ſound, not beeing able to receiue and conceiue of ſuch exceeding intertainement. Let vs note in the third place which I haue touched in one word, namelie, that Ieſus Chriſt prouideth vs not onely of meat, but alſo of drinke too, that is to ſay, that in him alone wee muſt wholly and entirely ſeeke after and find our whole ſuſtenance and ſpiritual noriſhment. Which he would alſo ſhew vs viſiblie &amp; ſenſibly in the bread of the holie Supper, which is a certaine &amp; ſure teſtimonie of the partaking of the bodie which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for vs: and in the wine which is the ſacrament of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood ſhed for vs, not to be ſet before our viſible eie (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it cannot now be ſeene but by the eies of faith) but to bee trulie communicated after a ſpirituall faſhion vnto a ſpirituall and eternal life. The like is to bee vnderſtood of the ordinarie preaching and adminiſtration of the word, in which alſo Ieſus Chriſt preſenteth himſelfe wholy vnto vs, to be receiued as it were by the hand of faith.</p>
            <p n="7">7 And therefore let vs reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, my brethren, that this place, this place I ſay, wherein wee are, as alſo all other aſſemblies of the faithful, were there but two or three gathered together, are this <hi>wine-ſeller or banquetting hal</hi> of that great King of whom mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.17. And who is he who being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the houſe of ſome great Lord, to ſit with him at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, would willingly &amp; wittingly bring thither with him any filthineſſe or villany? Therefore alwaies and as oft as we heare the trumpet of the Lord to ſound, calling vs into his houſe, I meane ſo oft as wee heare the bell ringing vnto a ſermon, we ought not to go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to runne, nay to fly thither: &amp; yet not ſo at randon, but that we firſt prepare our ſelues, through a true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and conſideration both of the death of him who inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs vnto this banquet, preuenting vs by his great mercy, as alſo of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of that treaſure which he wil there diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto vs, that we bring thither a mind apt and ready to be taught, an heart full of appetite of this heauenly foode: in a woorde, a moſt ardent deſire of receiuing, eating, liking and digeſting ſo precious a meate, to ſhew afterwards the fruits &amp;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1883:119"/>
effectes thereof, within and without our houſe, at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, farre and neare, by all our actions aſwel of the body as alſo of the minde. But what? It is no marueile though we haue no taſt and feeling of ſuch a liberality of our God, ſeeing the moſt part contemne it, others eate of this food but for a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and very few there be who digeſt it, to bee ſuſteined by it, a miſerable and lamentable caſe, and for which we ſhal pay one day ſweetely, if wee thinke not betimes better vpon it.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But I pray you wherein do thoſe peſtilent harbours of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles, which they cal the bookes of the ignorant, reſemble <hi>the hall of this banquet</hi>? Where inſteede of adminiſtring this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquor, mens eares are filled with howlings, and their harts impoiſoned with errors, where vnder ſhadowe of deuotion &amp; bearing men in hand that they are fedde by an attourney, they deuour widdowes houſes, yea Kings Crownes and ſcepters: where in lieu of the true Ieſus Chriſt, they feede the woorlde with a Ieſus Chriſt of paſt, &amp; for a full meaſure of all manner of ſacrilege, they haue vtterly rakt away one of the two ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the holy ſupper. But if theſe be to be condemned, as ſure they are, what ſhall become of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who come vnto this <hi>banquet,</hi> otherwiſe well prouided and adminiſtred, to their iudgement and condemnation?</p>
            <p n="9">9 Moreouer wee may not lightly paſſe ouer that which the ſpouſe addeth, namely that <hi>the banner or ſtandarde, or enſigne</hi> of her bridegroome which is vpon her, that is to ſay, vnder which ſhe marcheth, is called <hi>dilection or good-will.</hi> For as in an armie, the enſigne is it, which diſtinguiſheth euery band and company vnder which euerie ſouldiar is to march, ſo the loue and good-wil which Ieſus Chriſt beareth vs is that, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth vs together to compoſe this bodie which is called the Church: which linketh and keepeth vs one to an other, which helpeth and aideth vs in all the aſſaults and combates which wee are to ſuſtaine. For what induced and perſwaded this great God to make the worlde for man? Nothing but his good pleaſure to make a creature, in which he would declare
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1883:119"/>
by effect his ſingular loue and affection, that is to ſaie, becauſe he would make one creature whom he would indeed entirely loue, ſo far as to make it gouernour &amp; ruler of al the creatures elſe below, as if he had reſerued for himſelf the place aboue, to commit vnto him that below, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.16. And now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this is exceeding much, nay ſo great, as no man is able to comprehend the infinitnes of ſuch bountie towardes the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature which was not yet in beeing: but what is this in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that which is ſhewed in the woork of the redemption of this vnthankful and traiterous creature? And that before the foundation of the world he prouided for this, that man being thus iuſtlie condemned vnto death, ſhould not onelie not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but be exalted by meanes of his exceeding loue into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree aboue the Angels themſelues? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.2. In ſuch ſort, as that a man maie and ought to ſaie, not praiſing the euill, but praiſing him who draweth light out of darkneſſe: <hi>O ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Certainly nothing but his infinit goodnes &amp; loue, as the Prophet writeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5. and 144.3. And who can ſay the contrarie? This counſaile of his beeing once determined, what induced this great God to execute and perfourme it by ſo rare, ſo ſtraunge, ſo admirable a meanes, that the Angels themſelues (according as it was figured in thoſe two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins hauing their face turned ouer the couering of the Arke of the couenant) doe yet deſire to comprehend it more &amp; more, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.10. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. Certainelie this cannot haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but from the ſame fountaine of his vnſpeakable dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and loue, through which hee had accepted of vs in his

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <hi>this loue and goodwill of his,</hi> the depth whereof no man is able to ſound, or meaſure the height, bredth, or length thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18 And what is the ground and foundation of our faith, but this aſſurance, <hi>that we are loued with an vnuariable and vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dilection?</hi> Rom. 8.38. And how could wee hope in him, and how cal vpon him without the teſtimonie of the holie Ghoſt, which teacheth vs and ſealeth it vs in our hearts that he loueth vs? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Ga.</hi> 4.6. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.6. This is it therefore in a word which the ſpouſe would ſaie in this place, that nothing elſe inuiteth her to retire her ſelfe vnto God, and to haue her refuge vnto him, nothing aſſureth and aſcertaineth her, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe diſtinguiſheth and maketh her different from the world, but <hi>the loue</hi> which her Bridegrome beareth her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as vnto her enſigne ſhe keepeth her ſelfe, to bee couered therwith and as it it were wrapped in it. Neither may we think it ſtraunge that the name of <hi>Dilection or Loue</hi> is giuen vnto this <hi>ſtandard,</hi> ſeeing that yet more ſignificantlie the name of <hi>Loue or Dilection</hi> is attributed vnto God himſelfe, becauſe that he is the fountaine thereof from whence it floweth vpon vs, beeing his nature to loue man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, ſuch as he hath choſen, whom hee iuſtifieth and ſanctifieth, and wil finally glorifie. And this <hi>Loue</hi> engendreth, back againe another loue in vs, being giuen vs to loue him, who hath loued vs ſo much as is to be ſeene by this whole Canticle.

We muſt therefore note that our infirmity and weakneſſe is ſuch and ſo great, that cannot in truth ſuffer either ioie or ſorrow, if the one, or the other ſurpaſſe our capacitie. In ſuch ſort that as a man may die by hauing his heart ouerſtraitned and locked vp with anguiſh and ſorrowe: ſo maie the like alſo happen vnto him, if his hart bee ouermuch opened and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a ſuddain and ouer great ioy. The like we ſee to come to paſſe in many places of the holy and ſacred hiſtory, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſonages become for a time no better then deade men, if the Lord appeare vnto them in anie vnaccuſtomable maieſty As the Apoſtle witneſſeth &amp; ſaith, that when it pleaſed God <hi>to make him to ſee things that cannot be told, he knew not whether it were
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1883:121"/>
himſelfe, his ſpirit remaining within the body, or were otherwiſe raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of himſelfe,</hi> 1. Cor. 12.2. Act. 22.17. And that the like hapned alſo vnto the prophets beeing filled with the ſpirit of God, appeareth by that we reade, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24. The ſpouſe therfore in this place, being preſent at this banquet, ſaith that <hi>the apprehenſion &amp; conceit of ſo great a fauour, &amp; as well the ſweetnes of the fruite of this Apple-tree, as alſo the ſauour of that drink ſhee drank in this ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet, maketh her to ſound,</hi> as beeing at the firſt not capable thereof. Not that therefore ſhee had loſt all appetite (for contrariwiſe <hi>ſhe calleth for that wine and for thoſe Apples</hi>) but as if ſhee deſired that ſhe might haue them in ſuch ſort, as that thereby ſhe might bee brought vnto herſelfe againe, whereas ſhee was not able to beare them in ouer great aboundaunce. <hi>Cauſe therefore,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>my spirit to come againe vnto me, by giuing me of that wine, and making mee as it were a bed of thoſe Apples: by the odour whereof my ſpirites may be recreated</hi> as men are wont to doe vnto them who beginne to faint at heart, to whom they giue not anie great quantity to eate or drinke, but a droppe or two of wine, or ſome other ſweet thing to ſmell vnto, to cauſe their ſpirites to come vnto them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And what ſhall I ſay touching this point, but that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in a manner, that there is no longer any Church in the world? For euen in our time, in which it hath pleaſed God not onely to ſet vp <hi>the hall of this banquet,</hi> but alſo to leade vs in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; to offer vs this very ſame meat, &amp; this very ſame drink, after the moſt requiſite ſort of prouiſion that poſſibly may bee made: where are thoſe, who inſteede of apprehending ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a bountie as to be therewith rauiſhed, voutſafe ſo much as to ſit downe at table? Or being ſitten downe, to eate and reliſh and to digeſt this meate with an eager ſtomacke &amp; hungrie appetite? Nay rather on the contrary ſide, doe we not as did the children of Iſraell, who fell ſome to loathing the Manna, which they could not at the firſt ſufficiently praiſe &amp; commend? The Lorde therefore of his mercy ſharpen our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, &amp; correct our taſt, &amp; make vs this true ſpouſe, of whom it is here ſpoken.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1883:122"/>3 Let vs note farther that it is not ſpoken here of all wine, but <hi>of the wine of thoſe veſſels</hi> ſaith the ſpouſe. For there is a mingled wine, ſuch as the Phariſies gaue the people to drink. There is alſo a vineger-wine, a dead and turned-wine, yea a poiſoned wine, as is that with which the great whore of Rome hath poiſoned the kings &amp; nations, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.2. to make them to raue and to rage, as Ieremy alſo ſpeaketh of that other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.17. And therefore wee muſt take diligent heed we be not herein deceiued, the world being ouer ful, and now more then euer, of ſuch brewers and minglers of this <hi>wine,</hi> that is to ſay, of this word of God which ought to be ſincerely and purely adminiſtred, as the Apoſtle warneth vs, propoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for an example, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. warning elſewhere al the faithfull, <hi>to proue all things and approue the good:</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5.21. We muſt therefore followe the example of them of Beroea, who, as it is written, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. before they would drinke the <hi>wine</hi> which was preſented them by the hande of the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, a faithful ſeruant of God, would firſt ſee and know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it agreed with <hi>the wine of the old veſſels or barrels, namely that which</hi> the Prophets gaged and drewe: which when they had found, then they receiued it and drank thereof: as it is alſo ſaid by the Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.52. that <hi>euerie ſcribe and doctor which is wel taught in the kingdome of heauen, is like vnto an houſe-holder which bringeth forth of his treaſure things new and old.</hi> And here we muſt againe take diligent heed of ſatans and his miniſters ſubtilty, who would beare vs in hand that al <hi>old wine</hi> is good, and muſt be receiued: which is moſt falſe. For there is aſwell <hi>olde wine</hi> mingled and poiſoned, as <hi>new wine,</hi> which we muſt warily take heede of. The receipt therefore to preſerue vs there-from, or if happily wee haue dronke of it, to vomit it vp againe, is firſt, to conſider wel whether it be drawen out of the <hi>true veſſels of the Lordes ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Againe ſeeing the craft and ſubtilty of theſe lewd tauerners &amp; poiſoners is ſuch, that they infect &amp;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1883:122"/>
corrupt eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>the pure wine</hi> drawn out of the true veſſels: we muſt in the ſecond place conſider of wel, not only the colour, which they can wel tell how to counterfet, but eſpecially the ſauor &amp; the taſt, before we ſwallowe downe one drop of it. Aſmuch is meant by that which the ſpouſe ſaith afterwarde, not ſimply that <hi>they ſhould make her a bed of apples, but of thoſe apples,</hi> to wit, of thoſe which are gathered from <hi>the true apple tree,</hi> which is <hi>the tree of life: of which whoſoeuer eareth, hee ſhall neuer ſee death,</hi> Ioh. 6.51.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But yet this ſpouſe is not ſo contented, if the Bridegrome <hi>hold not vp her head with one hand &amp; her body with the other,</hi> &amp; that for two reaſons. The firſt becauſe the force and vigor of <hi>that wine,</hi> and of <hi>thoſe apples,</hi> that is to ſay, of the preaching of the worde of God <hi>which quicken our hart &amp; cauſe our spirits to come again vnto vs,</hi> dependeth wholly and entirely vpon the inward power and working of God, without which the woorde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched is no other thing then a ſound which entreth in at the one eare, and goeth forth at the other: and the ſacramentes are nothing els but vaine ſhewes and repreſentations of thinges terreſtriall and common: ſaue that the contempt, either of this woord or of theſe ſacraments condemneth the contemner &amp; deſpiſer of them before God. For it is for ſorcerers, charmers, and inchaunters, to attribute a power of woorking vnto the bare and ſimple pronuntiation of wordes, be they vnderſtood and liked of, or not: as alſo to attribute any kind of holineſſe or vertue of working in our ſoul vnto the ſigne of the Sacrament, is not only ſuperſtition, but execrable and damnable Idolatry. For this is a thing denied vnto the Angels themſelues, this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue being incommunicably proper and belonging vnto God, ſignifieng only by his word and by his ſacraments, that which he doth truely woorke and effect within and in the heart and ſoule of euery faithful by his only powerfull woorking: which I will declare and make plaine vnto you by a familiar ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that we iut not any more and runne a-ſhelfe on ſuch Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and very manifeſt ſorcery. The queſtion therefore being of corporall nouriſhment, becauſe God hath ſo ordained it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1883:123"/>
from the beginning, that the creatures ſhould be ſuſtained in their earthly and ſenſuall life, as Saint Paul calleth it, by that which the earth bringeth forth and produceth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.29.30. It is certain that God hath withal giuen &amp; as it were encloſed in the bread, that which the Prophet calleth <hi>the ſtaffe of bread,</hi> Ezech. 4.16. that is to ſay, a natural vertue and power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſtrength of body in him who eateth thereof and can digeſt it. Likewiſe he hath giuen vnto the wine a naturall and inwarde vertue and property to ſuſtaine and to cheare the heart of man which drinketh thereof competently and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurablie: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. The like is of other creatures created for the vſe of this corporall life with giuing of thankes, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. as it commeth alſo to paſſe in many other creatures ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for remedies of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, againſt which, wee ſee that god hath inſerted in them a certaine proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral force and vertue, reſeruing ſtil notwithſtanding vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the right &amp; power of making this vertue of theirs auaila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or not auailable in his creatures, according vnto his good will &amp; pleaſure: ſo that it is on iuſt cauſe, that we craue of him <hi>our daily bread,</hi> as confeſſing, that as hee alone hath made the bread, ſo he hath compaſſed and limited the vertue and force thereof: in which reſpect wee muſt auouch and confeſſe, that himſelfe is the firſt and true cauſe of our beeing and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but as for the life ſpirituall and eternall, that is in ſuch ſort reſiant and abiding in the onely perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>the true and only bread of life,</hi> that there neuer was, nor is, nor ſhalbe any creature whatſoeuer in heauen, or in earth, or belowe the earth, which hath in it any one dram, be it neuer ſo litle, of this force &amp; vertue, which truely quickneth &amp; liueth vnto eternall life. For euen as himſelfe alone hath doone all thinges which were requiſite for our ſaluation: ſo the force &amp; vertue both of diſpoſing the ſoule of man to receiue &amp; apprehend that which he hath doone for vs, as alſo of applying this ſaluation, is no where els but in the ſole perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, whence it muſt flowe and be powred vpon vs by the vertue and power of the holy ghoſt, which is alſo the eſſential power of the father and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1883:123"/>
the ſonne: of whom for this cauſe Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>he ſhall take of mine and ſhall ſhewe it vnto you,</hi> Ioh. 16.14.15. What do the Angels then touching our ſaluation? They are ordained of God to oppoſe and ſet themſelues againſt all aduerſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary powers (as we ſee it verified in Daniel) being camped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the faithfull, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. In a woord, <hi>they are his meſſengers vnto the ſaynts,</hi> Act. 10.3. Heb. 1.14. but not that they haue any vertue or power, either in whole or in any part what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, <hi>to drawe vs vnto God: to chaunge our heartes of ſtone into heartes of fleſh: to giue vs eares to heare: to open our heart, much leſſe to iuſtifie and to ſanctifie vs.</hi> For all this is properlie appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto God our father, by his holy ſpirit, in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. And what is the power of men choſen and ſent vnto this purpoſe? <hi>To be the embaſſadors of God, to announce and declare his wil, to ſow, to plant, to water the field into which they are ſent,</hi> in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they preach the word &amp; adminiſter the ſacramentall ſignes: but who is it that diſpoſeth and fitteth the land, which of it ſelfe is barraine and ſtony, to receiue the ſeede? Who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to grow, to bud forth, to floriſh, to beare fruite? <hi>The one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſonne of righteouſneſſe, the onely appointed Prince and Sauiour to giue repentaunce and remiſſion of ſinnes vnto his Iſrael,</hi> Act. 5.31. What is then the vſe of the word? To ſignifie vnto the ſoule of man by the eares, that wherefore the woords are in euery lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and toung ordained, and nothing elſe: in ſuch wiſe, that in reſpect of them who haue not the vnderſtanding of the toung in which a man ſpeaketh, and of them which well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the toung, but haue not receiued of God the capacity of vnderſtanding, to diſcerne and like of that which ſoundeth in their eares, this word hath no more efficacie of working vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaluation, then if one ſhould ſpeake vnto a deade man. And the ſacramentes what vertue haue they? To repreſent vnto the eies that which the ſacramentall promiſe ſaith vnto the eares, and nothing elſe. What doth then the water of Baptiſme doe in the adminiſtration thereof? It teſtifieth vnto the eies and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſenſes of him which is Baptiſed being come vnto age, that as the common water waſheth away the filth and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1883:124"/>
of the bodie, ſo Ieſus Chriſt hath by his death and paſſion waſhed awaie and done forth al our ſinnes, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and clenſed vs from our corruption to glorifie vs one day in life eternal. This is it I ſaie which it teſtifieth and witneſſeth vnto vs, &amp; not that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſe any thing to be perfourmed in vs vnto farther ſanctification, or produce anie thing in vs in that behalfe, as beeing therfore called <hi>ſacred &amp; holy,</hi> not that it hath anie more puritie or holineſſe in it ſelfe then common water: but onelie becauſe it is appointed and dedicated vnto this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vſe, to be an holy, heauenlie and ſpirituall teſtimonie of our ſanctification, by the ordinance of God. The like is to bee ſaid of the ſacramentall ſignes of the holy Supper of the Lorde, to wit, that the bread and the wine are holy and ſacred teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ordained of God to witnes vnto our eies things inuiſible, and ſuch as are effectuated and wrought in vs by the onelie working and power of the holie Ghoſt, namely, that as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bread and wine corporally for the noriſhment of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and mainteinance of this corporall life: ſo embracing by faith our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, true God and true man, he is made ours and wee are made his moſt nearely and ſtraitly by a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual communication which we haue with him, and by the true iuyce of ſpirituall and eternall life and nouriſhment which we draw from him: to the end to liue eternallie in bodie and ſoule with him, when this bleſſed and happie daie ſhall come. I ſaie therefore againe, that, to attribute anie inwarde vertue and power vnto the woords, though the wordes be ſuch as are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God and pronounced in his name: ſemblaby to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute anie vertue vnto the adminiſtratours of the woorde or of the ſacramentes: yea farther to attribute anie ſpiritual force of woorking vnto the ſacramental ſignes, is a moſt open and deteſtable, not onelie ſuperſtition, but alſo Idolatrie.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To come now vnto the ſpeach of our ſpouſe, knowing this, <hi>ſhe deſireth both hands,</hi> that is to ſaie the power and vertue of her Bridegroom <hi>to make that wine and thoſe Apples profitable to her,</hi> and by this meanes <hi>to cauſe her ſpirits to come againe vnto her.</hi> Secondlie ſhee therefore deſireth this, becauſe ſhee knoweth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1883:124"/>
that if the ſecond grace accompanie not the firſt, and the third the ſecond, and ſo on vnto the end, nothing would bee perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and effected in vs, and we would incontinentlie vomit vp againe the meate and drinke wee receiued, with how good an appetite ſo euer wee firſt ſauoured and ate it: and ſo our latter eſtate and condition ſhould bee worſe then the firſt, and from ſounding wee ſhould fall into an vtter fainting and giuing vp the ghoſt. And therefore if we wil be this true Church, there is no thinking of our ſelues proper and able men ſtraight way, when we haue receiued a little, and ſo content our ſelues with that meaſure of faith we haue, though we had an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more then wee haue: but we muſt haue a perpetual appetite, deſiring that which wee haue alreadie, to the end it may be ſtil continued &amp; encreaſed in vs: crauing of God new ſtrength, and that it would pleaſe him <hi>not to lead vs into tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> but continue to ſuſtaine and hold vp <hi>with one hand our weake and heauie head, &amp; embracing with the other hand our hart</hi> and our wil altogither fainting and languiſhing, naie for the moſt part of time, rebelling againſt him: to the end that beeing fortified in all the faculties and actions of the bodie and ſoule, and ſo ſtrengthened throughlie in bodie and ſoule, wee may end our courſe happilie and receiue the crowne which he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It followeth now to ſee how the ſpouſe being by means of <hi>that wine, and thoſe apples</hi> come vnto herſelfe, is in this place propoſed vnto vs as it were <hi>in a deepe reſt,</hi> not of a ſleep, which would bereaue her of al manner of feeling of that good, which ſhe receiueth in this feaſt, as we ſee how that natural ſleepe is no other vnto vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Image of death, hindring the actions of al our ſenſes, albeit that God hath ordained it for the refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and ſtrengthening of our poore bodie, which hath need of this comfort, and would not otherwiſe be able to indure &amp; continue in his daily trauell. But we muſt vnderſtand by <hi>this ſleepe</hi> of the ſpouſe, that happy repoſe and contentment, which euerie faithful ſoule enioieth, being ſequeſtred from all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cogitations and thoughts to be occupied onely in the good
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1883:125"/>
digeſting of that which it hath eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this feaſt, to be thereby nouriſhed, that is to ſay, of that which ſhee hath learned and receiued in the Church of the Lorde, hearing his woorde and receiuing his ſacraments: euen as after corporall repaſt, a man quitting and laying aſide all his corporal actions, ſetteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſleep, to digeſt that which he hath eaten and dronken, thereby to be preſerued &amp; ſuſteined. <hi>This repoſe</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing els but that meditation whereof it is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.17. And elſewhere in many other places, &amp; whereof we haue excellent examples, in the Canticles or ſongs of Samuels mother, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.1. and of Dauid, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. of Zacharie, of the virgin Mary, of Simeon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. and 2. For ſo farre is it that <hi>this ſleepe</hi> cauſeth the ſaints to looſe their ſpeech, that contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is it which openeth their mouth, not to talke as in a dreame, but to ſpeake as being rauiſhed into heauen. This is it which we ſee happened vnto Saint Peter, in the hiſtory of the transfiguration of the Lord, hauing his eies dazeled with the appearaunce of his glory, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.6.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now as it is not in the power of men to giue vnto vs <hi>this repoſe and reſt,</hi> Ioh. 14.27. ſo neither can they take it from vs. True it is that Satan troubleth it, and cutteth it off ſo much as he can, and wanteth no helpes, yea of our owne ſelues in this behalfe and to this purpoſe. But yet notwithſtanding it is not in the power of any to trouble vs, except when &amp; how farre it pleaſeth God they ſhall doe it. This is it which we are heere to learne touching the expreſſe charge, the Bridegroome in this place giueth vnto <hi>the daughters of Ieruſalem, that they trouble not this reſt of his spouſe, but ſuffer her to ſleepe quietly ſo long as ſhee will.</hi> Wherein we haue firſt to marcke diligently, this continuall &amp; perpetual prouidence of him, of whom it is ſaide, that <hi>hee that keepeth Iſraell doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe,</hi> Pſal. 121.4. And therefore it is vnto him we muſt make our only repaire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge ſaying with the ſame Dauid: <hi>I will laie me downe to ſleepe &amp; wil not wake, for the eternall wil defend me.</hi> Which he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, when in deſpite of the Diuel &amp; al his complices wee haue ſome reſt, as wee may ſay, that for theſe fifty yeares or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1883:125"/>
thereabout, it hath pleaſed God to continue it vnto vs in this place, and as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. to feed vs in al aboundance with his heauenly foode, in the ſight and view of all the enimies of his trueth: but alſo principally in the moſt rough tempeſtes of tryals: that we might ſay with Dauid: <hi>he hath hid me in his taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in the time of aduerſitie</hi> according vnto thoſe wordes with which the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth his church, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Ariſe my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, enter into thy ſecret chambers and ſhut the dore vnto thee, &amp; hide thy ſelfe for a litle time, vntill the indignation be ouerpaſſed.</hi> It is the Lord then who giueth <hi>this true repoſe and reſt</hi> vnto his Church, and who defendeth it ſo farre as ſeemeth expedient vnto his bleſſed will.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But what are <hi>theſe daughters of Ieruſalem</hi> which are thus adiured in this place?

But it were needleſſe to vſe ſo ſolemne a charge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes ſuch perſons: and it ſeemeth rather that this is ſpoken vnto them who would not faile to trouble <hi>this repoſe and reſt</hi> if ſo be they were not hindred.

Theſe are therfore they vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Bridegrome giueth this charge, as vnto thoſe, who are the neareſt, &amp; therfore the moſt dangerous enemies of the Churches reſt, as experience hath dayly ſhewed, &amp; yet euery day ſtil ſheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be. For who are they who at this daie doe moſt hinder the aduancement of the kingdome of God, and that the Church ioyeth not in <hi>this reſt</hi>? They are neither Iewes nor Turkes which ſo much doe it, in compariſon of them, who call themſelues the Catholique Church, naie the chiefe pillers thereof: together with certaine curſed Apoſtates and heretiques <hi>gone foorth from vs, becauſe they

were not indeed of vs,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.9. but what? God brideleth them notwithſtanding then, &amp; ſo far as is behooueful &amp; expedient, as it is ſaid in this place.</p>
            <p n="9">9 As for <hi>the Roes and Hindes</hi> which are heere taken to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this charge, beſides that this maner of ſpeech is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the whole tenour of this Canticle, in which this mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſcourſe is repreſented to be had between thoſe which are in the fields: it is no new thing that the Lord and his ſeruants, take to witnes againſt men al ſorts of creatures: as the heauens and earth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.1. the oxen &amp; the ſtars, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 1.2. the cranes, the ſtorcks, and the ſwallowes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.7. yea the mountaines &amp; the foundations of the earth, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.1. As in deed there is no creature high, middle, nor lowe which demaundeth not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce of God, againſt ſuch as are rebellious and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto his commandementes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21: Yea when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, hee maketh them executioners of his iudgementes, as appeareth by the ſauadge and cruell beaſtes, of which it is ſpoken, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 13.25. and 2. <hi>King.</hi> 17.25. euen the verie frogs and flies, as appeareth by the plagues of Aegypt: ſo that it is verilie a terrible thing to fal into the handes of the liuing god. And with this are they eſpecially threatned, who are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers &amp; troublers of the church, otherwiſe called the <hi>annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord,</hi> Pſalm, 105.15. and which are heere named <hi>the Bridegroomes loue,</hi> a woord moſt ſweete, pleaſant and amiable. O wretched and wretched againe is he who refuſeth to haue his part therein, eſpecially now when the ſonne hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto vs al the ſecretes of our ſaluation, as vnto his frindes, and not as vnto his ſeruantes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.15. yea, hath confirmed and ratified vnto vs this infinit Loue and Dilection of his, by giuing his life for vs.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But what meane theſe wordes which follow, <hi>vntil ſhe wil be awaked?</hi> For can the faithful ſoule be full of <hi>this ſleepe,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be awaked out of it? Certainlie Saint Peter had no ſuch meaning in the hiſtorie of the transfiguration, but rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he might ſtay continually in the mountain. I confes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſuch a meditation and as it were ſuch a retired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1883:126"/>
of euerie faithfull ſoule, is a thing altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable in reſpect of anie thing in this woorlde beſides: whereof Dauid may be a witnes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.6.7. But notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſeeing the members of the Church ought not onlie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this nouriſhment to be thereby ſuſtained and nouriſhed, but alſo to imploie themſelues to the vſe and ſeruice of the whole bodie, there is no talke of being alwaies &amp; continuing in this contemplation: but we muſt come alſo vnto action and trauaile daie and night, euery man according vnto his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore theſe good fathers, who ſo ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the world, that in the end they haue neither ſerued to their own &amp; others profit, haue greatlie abuſed themſelues. So wee read that Ieſus Chriſt, the true and perfect patterne of Chriſtian life, withdrewe himſelfe aſide at euening into ſome ſecret place: but he emploied al the day in going vp &amp; downe, in teaching and doing of miracles, yea buſying himſelfe ſo far as that he forgate his meate, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.20. Saint Paul alſo kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not which of the two he ſhould chuſe, namelie, either to be diſlodged out of this bodie, which he eſpecially deſired, or to remaine in it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.23. and that to trauel night and daie, both publikely and in priuate houſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20. And this is the cauſe why the Bridegrome would haue his ſpouſe to take her reſt and that ſoundlie, and ſo far as to be ſatisfied therwith, and no man to trouble her repoſe, except the Bridegroome would ſo haue it and appoint it. For it is for him alone to wake her, as he ſaith afterwardes, and her ſelfe alſo deſireth no more reſt then it pleaſeth her Bridegroome to graunt her.</p>
            <p n="11">11 And thus you ſee in ſumme what wee are to learne out of this moſt excellent place of Scripture full of ſingular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, namely that it is in God alone in whom we muſt ſeeke after our true felicity, hearing and meditating day and night his holy word, &amp; depending on his prouidence &amp; protection, vntill wee be gathered together in his euerlaſting kingdome, where this holy and perpetual marriage ſhalbe conſummated and ended.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue left the ſpouſe in the repoſe and reſt of her meditation rauiſhed as it were altogether in an ecſtaſie, out of which her repoſe, ſhe is now awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the Bridegrome, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not to trouble her, but to leade her as it were out of one pleaſure into an other. The like commeth to paſſe after naturall ſleepe, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſufficient meaſure refreſheth a man, &amp; raiſeth, as a man would ſay, new forces in him: as contrariwiſe the ſame, if it paſſe &amp; exceed a mean, breedeth firſt in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a lazines &amp; ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe, &amp; finally draweth a man into a bad &amp; naughty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. So is it in this ſpiritual reſt, which the ſoule being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen aſide by it ſelfe to meditate on the graces of God, and to be occupied in praier in his ſecret chamber, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: bee it by day or by night, according vnto the example of Dauid in many of his Pſalms. But if of this meditation a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil make a contemplatiue life, faſlly called Angelical, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth therein two notable faults, which by litle and litle come at the length to a third, which is vtter perdition and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelfe. For firſt a man departeth &amp; withdraweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the principall dutie of a Chriſtian, which is to ſerue his neighbour according vnto his vocation: which cannot bee doone if a man ſequeſter himſelfe from men and imploy not his minde in any other actions then ſuch, as are ſpecially and particularly belonging vnto himſelfe, whereas wee ought to apply al the knowledge we haue in humane or diuine thinges
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1883:128"/>
vnto the mutuall profit and aduancement of one an other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by ſuch a kinde of continuall contemplation, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but a man will become at the laſt ſottiſh and fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, eſpecially if vnto it bee added an auſterity of life without meane and good meaſure: and at laſt after that a man hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted himſelfe with ſuch a dreaming and fantaſticall kind of life, he beginneth to perſwade himſelfe by little and little, not only in that falſe and damnable opinion of merite, but alſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that he is arriued to the greateſt perfection that may be, nay gone beyond Paradiſe it ſelfe. I let paſſe to ſpeake of the notable hypocriſie, and other moſt ſtincking filthineſſe which is hidden vnder the cloke and colour of this kind of life, which falſly appropriateth to it ſelfe the name of <hi>Religion.</hi> For proofe of this let vs look no farther, then firſt vnto the doting dreams which are found aſwel in the legendes of theſe holie fathers, as alſo in the writings of certaine contemplatiue doctors: and after that, vnto the abuſes with which this kinde of vermine hath filled the whole world, and poyſoned eſpeciallie al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome: in ſuch ſort that the Popes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues haue been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and conſtrained to decree that there ſhould be no more new orders of monks ſet vp, as that decree made expreſlie to this purpoſe in that great Councel of Lateran vnder Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent the third, <hi>An.</hi> 1215. may witnes. And yet for al that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold yet a new ſwarme of locuſts, the order of the Capuchins, &amp; of thoſe ſhameleſſe companions which attribute vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the name of the companie of Ieſus, which are within theſe forty yeares crauled out of the bottomles pit, to happer and ſwarme throughout the worlde, which indeede deſerueth nothing elſe but to be brouſed and bitten with ſuch caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But let vs go out of this ſinck, and return vnto this ſpouſe, who is now awaked by her Bridegroom, and inuited and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto the other part of Chriſtian life, that is to ſaie, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of conuerſing with her Bridegroome, namely vnto the practiſe of that which ſhe hath learned and meditated. For what is this elſe, <hi>to riſe and to take her waie to come vnto him,</hi> but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1883:128"/>
to order and direct the courſe of her life according vnto her vocation, conformably vnto the commaundementes of God? <hi>Thy woorde,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 105. <hi>is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my going.</hi> And this is the reaſon why we are warned <hi>to walke in his waies,</hi> and wherefore Ieſus Chriſt ſaid <hi>Walk while you haue the light.</hi> But how ſhall they march forward and walke, who haue no legs?

But this voice muſt alſo be heard &amp; receiued by his grace, who openeth the heart to hear wel, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. as this ſpouſe in this place wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, ſhewing that ſhee is the true Church, according vnto the ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt, that <hi>his ſheepe heare his voice, &amp; not the voice of a ſtraunger,</hi> Ioh. 10.3.5. In a word therefore, we would neuer come vnto him, naie neuer ſo much as thinke to goe vnto him, if he came not firſt vnto vs, to warne vs thereof, naie to forme in vs the deſire of going vnto him: and which more is, if he accompanied not this grace of going vnto him, with a ſecond grace of bleſſing and effecting in vs this deſire of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him to the end that that might bee accompliſhed in vs which he ſaith by his Prophet, <hi>I haue made my ſelfe to be found of them who ſought not after me,</hi> Eſai. 65.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And neede we go any farther then vnto our ſelues, who are here to verifie this doctrine? Behold vs a multitude aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled partly of originary inhabitants borne in this place; &amp; partly alſo, and that too for the moſt part, gathered together out of many nations of the Eaſt, Weſt, South, and North. Dare the borne-dwellers of this Citty ſay, that themſelues did firſt ſeeke after this bridegroome? Or not contrariwiſe, that he came and ſought them? Nay muſt they not confeſſe that the Bridegroome hath eſpouſed them by plaine miracle, bringing
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1883:129"/>
them an happy freedome both temporal and ſpiritual: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtil maintaineth them to the woonder and admiration of the whole worlde? And as for vs who are here gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from out of all the quarters and corners of the world, if we conſider euerie of vs out of what bottomles gulfe and dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath drawen vs, and when, and howe: muſt wee not ſaie vnto him: <hi>Lord vnto thee be glorie, and not vnto vs?</hi> But alas what ſhall become of them who hauing heard his voice, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen their word alſo they would goe into the vineyard, nay haue gone into it, haue there become deaffe, and wicked workers?

            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Nowe though this bee a benefit altogether ineſtimable, that it pleaſeth the bridegroome to awaken his ſpouſe, to the end himſelfe might teach her, &amp; make her a better huſ-wife in the houſe of her Bridegroome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet what is this in reſpect of the extreme carefulneſſe and diligence which hee vſeth in this behalfe? <hi>He mounteth,</hi> ſaith the ſpouſe, <hi>ouer the mountaines, and ſkippeth ouer the hils like a Roe or an Hind calfe.</hi> And what vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of man is able to comprehend ſo great a loue and good-will? His ſheep are wandred and ſtraied of themſelues: and behold the ſheepeheard who runneth after them, and there is neither rocke, nor torrent, mountaine, nor valley, which can ſtay him from paſſing ouer vntil he finde them, to bring them backe againe vnto the fold. And what manner of ſheepe I pray you? Mary ſuch as are ſtubborne and rebellious, and ſeeke themſelues after the wolfe, ſo little account make they of the ſheepeheard. And of what ſheepeheard? Of ſuch a one as hath no need at al of the ſheep, &amp; who neither feedeth himſelfe with the fleſh, nor clotheth himſelfe with the woll of them, and which of themſelues can bring no other thing vnto their ſheepheard then al maner of filthineſſe &amp; vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; yet are ſought after of him notwithſtanding ouer hill and dale, of him I ſay, who neither hath any neede of them, neither can euer receiue any commodity by them.

of the Bridegroome in haſtening to waken his ſpouſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſleepe, may not bee vnderſtoode of an other ſleepe then that, whereof we ſpake before.

And therefore it is not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he vpbraideth vs with this ſlothfulneſſe and retchleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ours by his Prophet, ſaying, <hi>I haue ſpoken continually vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you from the morning vnto the euening, and you haue not hearkned vnto me: I haue cryed vnto you, but you haue not heard me,</hi> Ier. 7.13. and 11.7.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Alas, my brethren, it is of vs that this complaint is made, vnto whom the Lord for theſe eight and fortie years hath not ceaſed to crie: but how manie are there who inſteede of awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, according vnto the exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. ſleep not on ſtil in their ſinnes and vices, yea ſo far as that they haue left no place more neither for the iudgementes of God, neither for the faithfull and continuall admonitions of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants? And yet if we wil be this true ſpouſe of Chriſt, we ſhoud doe that which is here ſaid, I meane we ſhould aſſoone as the Bridegrome hath ſpoken, ſaie, <hi>behold the voice of the Bridegrome,</hi> we ſhould goe, naie wee ſhoulde runne to meete him, <hi>with our lampes in our handes,</hi> to enter in vnto the marriage feaſt, as it is ſpoken in the parable of the virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. before he ſwear <hi>that we ſhal not enter into his reſt,</hi> Pſal. 95.11.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now to make vs the more aſhamed of our ſlownes and ſluggiſhnes, wee muſt conſider of this ſimilitude of <hi>the Roe or hind-calfe,</hi> vnto which the Bridegrome is in this place compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as vnto beaſtes of great agilitie and nimblenes: eſpecially if we take the word which Salomon here vſeth, not for a <hi>Roe,</hi> but for a chamoiſe or gemps, which is a beaſt more ſwift then the other without compariſon, &amp; of an incredible venterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and dexterity together to leape from cliffe to cliffe, as if it were a beaſt that rather flieth, as a man might ſaie, then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth.

vnto his ſpouſe, <hi>quitteth the Mountaines and the hilles.</hi> And what are <hi>theſe mountaines</hi> elſe, but that which putteth a mid-wall, as it were, betweene God and vs, to hinder him if it might bee, from comming vnto vs, and ioyning himſelfe with vs?

But to goe no farther for proofe hereof, what hath beene doone in this behalfe in our time by Kinges and Emperours enchaunted and bewitched by that whoore of Rome, &amp; by her ſlaues? And what doth the worlde ſtil euerie daie? Reade we ouer al the hiſtories of the auncient perſecutions, no one excepted, ſhal wee find the like vnto that which hath beene practiſed in our time? For there is neither fire, nor water, nor aire, nor earth, which haue not al of them beene emploied to ſucke the life of our poore brethren: there is no kind of cruel death through which they haue not paſſed, neither haue the handes of the hangmen onelie beene weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their ſlaughter, but the people alſo haue been imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to embrue themſelues with the bloode of the poore, meek and innocent, without diſtinction of age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or difference of ſexe, or anie priuilege of nature whatſoeuer: &amp; this licenciouſneſſe hath beene permitted, to anie that would die his handes red with innocent bloode, not in time of warre and hoſtility, but in the greateſt appearance and confidence that might bee of peace and frindſhip. As for all manner of ſleightes and wiles, hath there bin any one vnforgotten? But what? Could theſe impedimentes ſtay the Bridegroome, and ſhut him as it were vp in heauen? No But hee hath <hi>leaped</hi> ouer all this, and though hee ſeemed to haue abandoned and forſaken thoſe who are his, yet was there neuer anie tempeſt wherin he reached them not foorth his hand, and whereof the end and iſſue both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them whom hee hath miraculouſlie preſerued and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1883:130"/>
plucked foorth out of the bloodie handes of their enemies, as alſo in regard of them whom hee hath vouchſafed this honor of finding their life before him, in leeſing of it before men) hath not finallie turned vnto the confuſion of the perſecutors themſelues: ſome of them beeing preſentlie puniſhed, others beeing ſet as a ſpectacle of Gods horrible iudgementes, not outwardlie, which is a falſe marke &amp; note, but inwardlie, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as wickedlie as they liued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others liuing ſtill to this day for no other end, but to be witneſſes of gods infinit patience; who giue them grace to acknowledge and amend their ſo great wickednes. Yea but will ſome of theſe mockers and ſcorners, of which the world is ful fraught at this daie, ſaie; <hi>It is now too late.</hi> I anſwere, and that without all ſophiſtication, taking the woords as we ought to take them, that <hi>to come late</hi> is not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a long time in comming, but more time then ſhould bee beſtowed. The ſunne commeth not vnto his point and period but after twelue monethes: ſhal we ſaie that he is <hi>too late</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ruling the ſeaſons of the yeare? Yea verily, if we wil be wiſer herein then God: but men of vnderſtanding and reaſon, and ſuch as knowe that the Lorde hath ordered and ruled the motions of the heauens with a wiſedom in no point impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able &amp; ſuch as preacheth the glorie of God vnto al the world, as it is declared in the 19. Pſal. and elſwhere, iudge otherwiſe. And who maie then be ſuffred to ſaie, that the Lord who hath made the times and ſeaſons for the good &amp; the bad, according as it is ſaid, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 8.22. hath not alſo bounded the gouernment of his houſe and dwelling place, which is the Church? The Prophet is not of this opinion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.10. Let vs therefore knowe and holde this for an irrefragable point and vndenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and altogether reſolued vpon, according vnto that which Saint Peter teacheth vs, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. that the Lorde is neuer late or ſlacke in comming, that is to ſaie faileth not to come at the point, yea and that <hi>leaping</hi> ouer all that which might ſeeme to ſlack &amp; ſtaie his comming: but it is hee which hath made the time, and who meaſureth it in ſuch ſort as it beſt appertaineth, which meaſuring of his a man can no more reaſonablie finde
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1883:131"/>
fault withal, then if he ſhould blame the ſunne for not riſing at night or at noone.</p>
            <p n="7">7 But al this which we haue ſaid touching <hi>theſe mountaines &amp; hils</hi> is not the principal, as being a thing eaſie to be vnderſtood, that there is neither force nor ſubtilty which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hinder or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the almighty ſo much as a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of time. But know you what theſe great &amp; terrible <hi>mountains</hi> are which ſtand ſo high betweene god &amp; vs? They are our ſins, they are our iniquities, they are our wickedneſſes which indeed <hi>ſeparate and diuide vs from God</hi>: Eſaie. 59.2. And herein wee muſt take heede howe wee flatter or ſooth our ſelues. For truly theſe ſinnes of ours, theſe transgreſſions of ours, theſe wicked impieties of ours, are growen and heaped vp from time to time into huge and great <hi>mountaines</hi> before the face of the euerliuing. And what hath the Lord alwaies done? Hath he not trauerſed <hi>theſe mountaines</hi> to take pitty vpon his choſen and elect? What huge <hi>mountaine</hi> was the ſinne of Adam? what mighty <hi>rocke</hi> raiſed betweene God and the woorlde, was that confuſion which brought the deluge vpon the woorld? If wee paſſe farther in conſidering of the time vnder and after the lawe, what elſe ſhall wee find, then that which Daniel in that moſt excellent praier of his acknowledgeth and confeſſeth? <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.4. In the meane time what hath the Bridegroome done? Adam and Eue, in whom this ſpouſe which was and ſhall be vntill the number of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect be accompliſhed, was then wholie as it were compriſed, had no ſooner caſt away &amp; vndon themſelues, but this bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome haſted ouer <hi>the mountaine</hi> to remedy the matter. The very night that the fower hundred years were expired &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he brought his people out of Aegypt, ſhaking the heauens and the earth at their departure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.8. and 12.41.

               </gap>ciſely at the end of ſeuentie yeares, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a moment beyond to deliuer his people out of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of Babylon. For the Lorde is true in his promiſes, not in part, but in all and through al. Are we aſſaulted of any enimy? He is ſtraight way by vs with armes in hand to defend vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.

If he be verie angrie, &amp; wil ſtrike in earneſt, yet behold how he preuenteth his, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them as it were, before he haue hurt them. <hi>Goe to, ariſe my people, enter into thy ſecret chambers</hi> (that is the captiuity of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon) <hi>&amp; ſhut the doore vpon thee, &amp; hide thy ſelfe as it were for a ſmall moment, vntill the indignation paſſe,</hi> Eſay. 26.20. and 1.

            </p>
            <p n="8">8 And becauſe that in the way he was to meete with that great &amp; more then feareful bottomleſſe pit of Gods moſt iuſt curſe &amp; malediction vpon vs, how hath hee wrought therein? O bounty of his, O loue, O charity infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible! He hath charged vpon his backe this <hi>mountaine</hi> alſo of our ſinnes and carried it euen vnto his croſſe, he hath entred &amp; waded through the gulfe of the malediction of that Iudge, ſo far as to cry: <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Being dead, he hath purſued death eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his own home, which is the graue, &amp; finally paſſing as a victorious conqueror through all this: he is come running vnto this poore deſolate ſpouſe, &amp; hath drawen her out of darckeneſſe into his moſt admirable light, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and hath raiſed her from the bottom of hell to the higheſt toppe of the heauens. Yee ſee then how moſt true it is which the ſpouſe here ſpeaketh preaching vnto vs the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable ſpeede and readineſſe the Bridegroome vſeth <hi>to awaken her,</hi> to guide and help her at her neede.</p>
            <p n="9">9 But that which the ſpouſe addeth, <hi>That the Bridegroome kept himſelfe behind the wall, and cauſed himſelfe to be ſeene only through the grate or lattiſe,</hi> ought well to be conſidered as put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a difference betweene the old and the new couenant. For it is true that there was neuer no other mediatour betweene God and men, but this only Bridegroome of this only ſpouſe,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1883:132"/>
which is the Church. It is alſo moſt true, that in reſpect of the effect of his death, he hath ſuffered from the beginning of the world, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.8. and that conſequently the faith of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers and ours is al one faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. But in reſpect of the maner &amp; meaſure of the manifeſtation of this knowledge, there haue beene two couenants: the one new, the other olde which hath an end, being ordained no longer then vnto the real comming of the Sauiour and full exhibiting and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the goſpel. Vnder the ancient couenant therefore the Lord hath ſpoken many times &amp; in diuerſe ſortes, not of another doctrine, but after another faſhion, both vnto the Patriarches before the Lawe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward after another maner vnder the Law by the ſhadowes &amp; figures thereof: whereof Ieſus Chriſt was the bodie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. &amp;. 10.1. &amp; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.17 &amp;. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.11. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. but in the fulnes of times God ſpake by the mouth of his owne ſonne, who became our brother, &amp; exhibited and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed reallie that which was before repreſented as it were a far off, through the ſhadowes of the Law ceremoniall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. The Bridegroome therefore came then vnto the ſpouſe, but not ſo near <hi>as to kiſſe her with the kiſſes of his own mouth,</hi> for the laſt pledge as it were of the conſummation of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: but kept himſelfe aloofe <hi>behind the wall,</hi> to ſaie as it were vnto his ſpouſe, Lo behold me who forget you not, but wil aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredlie keepe my promiſe with you in his time, without fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a iot with you, how manie difficulties and hinderances ſo euer preſent themſelues betweene vs. Which thing is verified throughout the whole ſacred hiſtorie of the time which went before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt in fleſh. By this <hi>wall</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt vnderſtand, firſt of al whatſoeuer was wanting in the ancient couenant being compared with the new, &amp; this againe in a double reſpect. For beſides that the effect and end of the faith of the ancient fathers depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on that which was to be executed &amp; performed, &amp; which was really executed for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Ieſus chriſt come in the fleſh, to the end that as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. <hi>they ſhould not be ſaued without vs:</hi> this ſecret
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1883:132"/>
&amp; myſtery was ſhadowed forth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by diuerſe &amp; ſundry legal figures, which is compared vnto <hi>a wall,</hi> which was firſt to be ſallied ouer, before he &amp; his ſpouſe could ſee each other &amp; be ioined more neerer together. Moreouer, as the ſame is moſt diuinelie handled by the Apoſtle in the Ep. to the Galathians, the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhment of all righteouſnes &amp; the ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſins beeing not yet actuallie come, although by faith the ſame were preſent before God &amp; vnto the eies of the beleeuing: yet was there ſtil as it were a very <hi>thicke wall</hi> betweene this Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome &amp; this ſpouſe. Secondly the Lord hauing choſen vnto himſelfe that only people of the Iewes, ſeparated al other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery kind of ſort, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the principal point which was the couenant of ſaluation, or whether wee haue a regard vnto all that which concerned the policie of Iſrael, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. the which ſeparation endured vntil the <hi>mid-wal</hi> was broken downe, and the teſtament of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob was accompliſhed, who calleth the Meſſias (that is to ſaie this Bridegroome) <hi>the expectation of the Gentils</hi> in general as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon in his ſong expounded the ſame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.32. conformablie vnto the whole Scripture. It is no maruel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this ſpouſe hauing regarde vnto her condition, ſuch as then it was &amp; ſhould remain vntil the comming of this Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome in fleſh, maketh mention of this <hi>wal.</hi> Now ſhe addeth this word of <hi>grates or lattiſe</hi> to ſhewe hereby that this <hi>wal</hi> is not of anie thick or earthlie matter, ſo that the Bridegrome might not be perceiued through it anie whit at al being on the other ſide: nor like vnto thoſe wals which ſeparate the wicked from God. But ſuch <hi>a wal</hi> as hath open windowes in it, or as if it were pearced with <hi>grates &amp; lattiſe.</hi> For ſuch was the ancient couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made with Abraham &amp; afterward renued vnder Moſes with a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ceremonies, albeit obſcure, yet ſuch notwithſtanding as that through them the ancient fathers beheld with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>the daie of the Lord and reioiced thereat,</hi> Ioh. 8.56. Neither maie we doubt but that Salomon, who was the builder of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vſed theſe maner of ſpeeches, in reſpect of thoſe wals, vails and bars, by which not onelie the common people were kept
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1883:133"/>
forth out of the court of the prieſts, but the inner court alſo of the Prieſtes diſtinguiſhed from the ſanctuarie, all which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions were firſt broken downe from the bottom vnto the top at the death of the Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.31. to the end that all that, which declared that the promiſes were not yet reallie execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being remoued, the people of God ſhould looke for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. &amp; that that which ſeparated the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael from other nations of the earth beeing beaten downe, all people ſhould be bleſſed being made the ſonnes of Abraham, vnto whom the promiſe was made, that hee ſhould bee the father of bleſſing, to all the nations of the earth, as the Apoſtle declareth the ſame moſt amply and at large in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles vnto the Galathians and the Epheſians.</p>
            <p n="10">10 It is ſaid therefore that <hi>this beloued cauſed himſelfe to bee ſeene through the grates or lattiſe,</hi> but it is alſo added by and by that he ſpake too. For the true Ieſus Chriſt is not a dumbe Idol, nor a crucifixe of ſtone or of wood, hee is not this goodly breadden god cloſed in <hi>the Pixe,</hi> which cannot ſhew himſelfe, without he bee caried about, and is dumbe and can make no complaint though the mites or the miſe eate him. But this is the true God which ſpake then in the Temple by the figures of the law, and by the mouth of the Prieſtes doing their dutie, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. and in the Synagoges by the Leuits and doctors of the law euerie ſabbath <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.27. and 15.21. &amp; in al places and euerie where by the Prophets, aſwel by mouth as alſo by writing, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 36.2. &amp; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. In a woord, <hi>wiſedome did then cry in the ſtreetes,</hi> euen by the mouth alſo of the penne-man of this Canticle, as all the reſt of his writings doe alſo witneſſe, <hi>Prouer.</hi> 1.20. but neuer by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Idols, which were afterward called <hi>the bookes of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people</hi> indeed books to teach them al maner of falſehood, as the Prophets pronounce of them, and ſuch as transforme the worſhippers alſo of them into Idols, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.8. and 135.18. as indeede is come to paſſe, and is to bee ſeene with the eie in euerie falſe Church of Idols. The true &amp; only Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſhe, which alone may ſay, <hi>My welbeloued hath spoken vnto
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1883:133"/>
me,</hi> which ſhee could not ſay neither, if as the Bridegroome ſpake, ſo ſhee alſo did not hearken vnto him, and retained that which ſhe heard of him without blending any thing with it, or without adding ought thereto, or diminiſhing any thing from it. For the falſe Church vaunteth alſo that the Bridegroome hath ſpoken vnto her too: but if a man demaund what it is he ſaide, then appeareth her ſhameleſneſſe and forgerie. For as for the common ſort, whom they call the laity, it is hereſie for them to read this word in the common &amp; vulgar language: &amp; as for thoſe to whom they are to refer themſelues, ſhall a man find one man among an hundred, who euer thought vpon the holy Scriptures, nay hath ſeene ſo much as the couer of the bookes? Indeede certaine wallet-brethren there are, of whom ſome be chattering vntill their chappes bee made vp with the pray they ſought after: others of them recommend their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent to the charity of deuout people, and all of them together beſtirre themſelues well in their buſineſſe. But where is in the meane time the word of this Bridegroome? It either ſleepeth, or is yelled &amp; howled out, cenſed, adored, clouted &amp; patched vp in a ſtrange language, and vpon ſome ſolemne daies ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated and quinteſſenced in a limbecke, to ſerue for a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue in the poiſoned drench of the whore. O moſt poore and miſerable conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>! But the world is worthy of ſuch Prophets.</p>
            <p n="11">11 I haue ſaid, that it is not enough that the Bridegroome ſpeake, but wee muſt hearken vnto, knowe and practiſe that which he ſpeaketh. That is not the true Church then which ſtaieth herſelfe ſtill here belowe, and conſequently goeth no farther then herſelfe, either in whole or in part, mingling her owne merites with grace, according vnto the example of the proud Phariſie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. and that much leſſe, which either boroweth or buieth the falſe merits of an other, which were neuer any: but ſhee which ſeeketh after her whole righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; life, in the only free loue and dilection of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12 He calleth her alſo <hi>his faire one,</hi> and that by great reaſon and on iuſt cauſe. For the true Church is adorned and decked with the whole beutie of her Bridegroome, and therefore it is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1883:134"/>
not that harlot painted with the painters pot of thoſe inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereof mention is made, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.22. as neither are thoſe hipocrites the Church of God, who are like vnto painted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, faire without, and ful of al ſtench &amp; rottennes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27. Neither thoſe who are the reformed in name but more then deformed indeede, who haue put off the Pope with his ſuperſtition, but yet haue not put on Ieſus Chriſt and true godlines: haue aboliſhed and remoued the viſible Idoles of wood and ſtone, but harbour ſtil within themſelues the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible Idoles, the more daungerous, whom they ſerue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour day and night, I meane couetouſneſſe, gluttony and ſuch other good goddeſſes.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The Bride addeth <hi>and come thy waie,</hi> namelie vnto mee, and to no other neither in heauen nor in earth, yea and that without ioining with him anie companion or fellowe collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as they doe who worſhip and adore a ſtraunge Queene of heauen: much leſſe making anie his ſuperiour, as doe thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious worſhippers and adorers of the virgine Marie, who are ſo impudentlie preſumpteous as to crie out in their dennes of Idolatrie, <hi>Roga patrem, iube natum:</hi> that is, <hi>praie the father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the ſonne:</hi> and <hi>Iure matris impera,</hi> that is, <hi>command in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of a mother.</hi> For this Bridegroome is <hi>the onelie mediatour between God and men,</hi> not only of <hi>Redemption,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> though the Saintes which liue doe praie in common both for themſelues and for their brethren. And this was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the whole Church from the beginning of the worlde, vntil the time of the generall reuolt, when it came in by litle and litle vnder colour of deuotion.</p>
            <p n="14">14 But ſome man wil happily demaund, in what ſort this is to bee vnderſtoode, that hee which commeth himſelfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake the ſpouſe, inuiteth her <hi>to come vnto him?</hi> The aunſwere is, that wee would neuer come vnto Ieſus Chriſt, either to heare him, or to practiſe his doctrine, if as he hath loued vs firſt, ſo he came not alſo to ſummon and warne vs firſt, to follow him. For if he came vnto vs to ſtaie and abide here below with vs, then were his kingdome of this woorlde: but now hee ceaſeth not
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1883:134"/>
to crie after vs to draw vs from hence on high vnto him, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.1.</p>
            <p n="15">15 What did this Bridegroome then ſaie by all the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent prophecies and ſhadowes of the Lawe, but this, <hi>Come vnto me,</hi> and reſt not your ſelues on that which you heere ſee with your eie, but hold your ſelues vnto him, who is to come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Which thing beeing not well conſidered by the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and ignorant, ſeeking after their ſaluation in the altars and ſacrifices, wee ſee how ſharplie and bitterlie they are for that cauſe reprehended thoroughout the whole Scripture. Which more is, this Bridegrome being arriued in perſon, and making himſelfe viſible and palpable in fleſhe (which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle iuſtly calleth <hi>the great ſecret or myſtery</hi> Eph. 5.32.) would not notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding haue vs to ſtay our ſelues on that corporal preſence of his, but contrariwiſe <hi>it is expedient,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I go my waies,</hi> Ioh. 16.7.

I vnderſtand by this other world him, <hi>whoſe ſinnes are taken awaie by the Lambe,</hi> Ioh. 1.29. him, <hi>for whom the father gaue his ſonne,</hi> Ioh. 3.16. and who is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto him, <hi>for whom Ieſus Chriſt ſaith that hee praieth not,</hi> Ioh. 17.9. and, <hi>from whom alſo wee are ſeuered,</hi> Ioh. 17.16. In a worde it is the Church that is here ſpoken of, and which hath, ſo long as it continueth here belowe, her ſpring-time, and her ſommer, her autumne &amp; her winter, not ruled by the courſe of the ſtarres, but, as I haue ſaid, by a ſpeciall motion of him, who hath made the heauens and the earth, to beginne and ende, where, and how far, and in what ſort it pleaſeth God. Neither is it therefore to bee ſaid that the Church, beeing compoſed of men, paſſeth not through the colde and heat of this lower and elementarie world, and by the effectes which follow thereof, as are barrennes, famines, plagues, and other inconueniences, nay that ſometimes it ſuffereth not in theſe things more then others, as this argument is handled at large, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this naturall diſpoſition of ſeaſons is not it whereby wee muſt iudge the ſeaſons of the Church, becauſe her ſpring time is often in the greateſt and ſharpeſt winter of others: and contrariwiſe that which is the ſpring-time to others, is vnto her the moſt rough and tempeſtuous winter. For ſhee hath her ſunne by her ſelfe, the approching whereof with a milde and quickning heate, not parching or ſcorching, bringeth her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1883:137"/>
a moſt pleaſant ſpring-time for her better ſowing, bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; floriſhing: &amp; afterward a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perat ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of her fruit: after that a goodlie autumn to gather it in his ripeneſſe: &amp; finally a good winter for the enioying thereof, and preparing of another ſeede. Contrariwiſe when this ſunne withdraweth it ſelfe, or diſtributeth not the influence of his light and heate, as the neceſſities require, there are no good times of ſowing, or of harueſt, or of vintage, but a general bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainnes and mortal famine; in a word, a perpetual winter, that a man cannot ſee ſo much as one greene leafe, though all the woorlde beſides bee in great good health and tranquillitie, with plentie and abundance of al dainties and delicacies. This ſunne is this Bridegroome: <hi>that ſunne of righteouſneſſe, who carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth health vpon his wings,</hi> Malac. 4.2. <hi>that braunch of light or daie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring from on high,</hi> Zach. 3.8.

And becauſe that this is by the order which he hath eſtabliſhed, that this world of his is gouerned, I meane by the ſincere preaching of his word and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his ſacramentes, accompanied with the efficacie of his holie ſpirite, according as the ſunne drawing neare or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther off, appeareth vnto the worlde, we muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conclude, that according as this holie miniſterie hath his force, or is depriued of it (whether it be for a time eclypſed, or whether it caſt forth his beams mightily, but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſtil more then this light, in ſuch ſort that litle effect thereof appeareth) it is vpon this diuerſitie and difference wee muſt iudge of the good and faire weather, or of the il and hard time of the Church, &amp; not according vnto the outward either proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, or aduerſitie of this worlde belowe. Notwithſtanding when it ſo pleaſeth God, <hi>the ſunne of the Church, and the ſunne of this world</hi> meet, to cheriſh it in al kind of ſortes: as ſometimes on the contrarie, both of them are withdrawen together, to bring on it a marueilous rough and as it were a deadlie win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

and appeare yet moſt clearly in our time: but I wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelfe with the allegation of a few notable examples, vnto the which Salomon himſelfe might ſeem to haue had an eſpeciall regard. I ſay then, that if euer the Church enioyed a goodly and faire time of weather, it was vnder Ioſua and the gouernours of that time, the people beeing planted together with the ſeruice of God, moſt triumphantly in the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as appeareth by that which is written in <hi>Ioſu.</hi> 24.35. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, for al the time of the Iudges vntill Samuel, if it had one faire day, it had an whole yeare of ſtormy weather and tempeſtes. And what a witnter was that time, in the which the Arke of the couenant was taken captiue, Silo ruined, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all brought into an vtter confuſion? God draue away after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde this ſtorme of fowle weather, by his Samuel, who alſo reformed the ſchooles of the Prophets. But this ſun-ſhine was ſcarcely appeared, when horrible darckeneſſe was brought in by Saul, the Prieſts themſelues beeing maſſacred, ſorcerers and ſouthſaiers ſet vp and reſtored, and the people expoſed to ignominie among their enimies, beeing as a body without an head, vntill that Dauid, not without grieuous rough ſtormes, being made king by the Lord, the goodly clear fair wether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed began to ariſe, which continued as it were vnto his full noone, vnder Salomon, who furniſhed the houſe of the Lorde both within and without, with a moſt triumphant magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, at which time God graunted ſo long a peace vnto his Church with aboundance and plenty of all temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges: and it may be that the Bridegroome ſetteth before the eies of his ſpouſe, that happy change of the time, inuiting &amp; bidding her to awake to haue the fruition thereof. As much may we and ought we to ſay, to haue come to paſſe in the time begunne, about theſe threeſcore yeares ſince, the lord hauing of his infinite bountie and mercy driuen away out of a great part of Chriſtendome, the horrible and deadly darckeneſſe of that Idolatry brought in by the falſe whore with ſuch an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the ſpirite of error, that the greateſt part of them who attribute vnto themſelues the name of great Catholickes and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1883:138"/>
Chriſtians, are yet therewith vnto this day enchanted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched. This ſpring-time therfore was ſent by the Lord from heauen, who raiſed vp in our time theſe great and famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages in the holy miniſterie of his woorde, and on the other ſide placed in the ſeates of magiſtrates, his Ezechiaſſes and Ioſiaſſes, who mightily deſtroyed the newe Baalimes and Aſtarothes.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And what did they els but call and inuite this ſpouſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awaked, to come vnto her Bridegroome, and to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him into thoſe goodly gardens of true delights wherof the Prophet maketh mention, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.36? And we which are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded after them, what other thing doe we but crie in your eares, in the name of this Bridegroome, <hi>Ariſe, come, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is paſt, the goodly weather is come, the acceptable time, the day of Saluation,</hi> 2.

But as our firſt Parent then, when as yet hee was not corrupted but moſt ſound and entire in that nature, which he receiued from his Creator, did voluntarily depriue and ſpoil himſelfe of that light he had of vnderſtanding and vprightnes of wil, ſo his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity for the moſt part, through naturall wickednes which is now in them, refuſeth, both the Phiſition who offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and the phiſick.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But let vs hearken vnto the reſidue of the Bridegroomes ſpeach, ſeeking after this ſpouſe: <hi>My doue,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which keepeſt thy ſelf in the cleftes of the rocke, and in the ſecret places of the aſcent therof.</hi> And what are the great ſecrets which are compriſed in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1883:146"/>
theſe words? Let vs pray vnto God he wil vouchſafe to teach them vs throughly. We haue ſaid before, that the ſpouſe, the Church, is brought in in this place and repreſented vnto vs, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by her Bridegroom in ſuch ſort, that ſometimes ſhe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth after him, ſometimes ſhe obtaineth as it were the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſailes, ſometimes ſhe ſeemeth to be as it were a far off, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as it were ſomwhat nearer, ſometimes ſhe is ſeeking as it were after him, ſometimes ſhee ſeemeth to be ſought after: which thing we are neceſſarily to vnderſtand &amp; diligently to conſider, that we take heed the better of the mask of the falſe Church, which many paint foorth and ſhape out vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their owne braine, perſwading themſelues, that the Catholique Church continueth always in her apparant gloſſe and bewty: contrary vnto that which is deliuered through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole ſacred hiſtorie, and the experience wee haue ſince had, and haue vntill this day, thereof: wherein theſe ſo wretchedly abuſed reſemble the Butterflie which flieth into the candle and burneth himſelfe, and thoſe ſimple ſeely birdes which fly into the fire thinking they are in the warm ſun. This is then a falſe opinion in which many do gladly pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, becauſe they would haue a goſpel of eaſe and a Church all of veluet: whereas, it is in the croſſe, that the Bridegroome triumpheth, and hee was crowned with <hi>a crowne of thornes,</hi> and there is no reaſon the ſpouſe be put in a better liuery then her Bridegroome. Wee haue therefore heard aboue in the 11. verſe, how the Bridegroome made mention of the winter, bringing tidinges vnto his ſpouſe of the ſweete and pleaſaunt ſpring-time. Hee ſpeaketh therefore now vnto her, as if ſhee were frighted and skared as ſometimes Pigeons are and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the doue houſe, and therfore flowen to hide herſelfe in ſome chinckes and creuiſes of a rocke, to haue there ſome place of retire and reſt. Where we are to note that it is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in theſe and ſuch like occurrences, that the faithfull ſhewe themſelues like <hi>Doues,</hi> not countermining deceit by deceit, but withſtanding and fighting againſt the ſleights and craftes of the world by their meeknes and ſimplicity, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.18. and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1883:147"/>
leaue not, for al the hote aſſaultes that are giuen them, to keep their conſcience pure ſtil and vndefiled, as Dauid ſo often both in woord and deed profeſſeth, which is the cauſe alſo why the Lord ſpareth them, <hi>when the rod of the wicked is vpon them.</hi> Pſal. 125.3. and 1. Cor. 10.13. but yeelding vnto the furie of their perſecutors ſo much as they maie, their only refuge they haue is, to endure in ſilence, &amp; patience, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. It is this ſpouſe therefore who beeing forced to ſhroud and to hide herſelfe <hi>in the clefts and holes of the rocks,</hi> is now inuited by her Bridegrome <hi>to come downe againe into the plaine,</hi> the foul weather being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed and gone.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Such was the ſtate and condition of the Church manie times vnder the Iudges, and eſpecially in Helies time, as when the arcke was taken, there followed an horrible confuſion. In the time of Samuel it had as it were ſome ſmall refreſhing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the beginning of Saules raigne. But by and by after, and eſpecially during the time of the perſecution raiſed againſt Dauid, the maſſacring of the Prieſts, the diſcomfiting of Saul, the ciuil war betweene Dauid, &amp; Iphiboſeth, whither ſhal we ſay the ſmall number of the true faithful were brought, ſo long as god exerciſed his iuſt iudgements vpon the whole country? In what eſtate was then this doue-houſe, that is to ſay, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle &amp; the whole ſeruice of God, Silo being deſtroied, &amp; the Arcke placed in a priuate mans houſe, to wit, Abinadabs, 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 6.22. ſeparated from the tabernacle which was in Nob, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. &amp; from thence was brought vnto Gibeon, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 1.3. And this ſeparation of the Arke from the tabernacle du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill the time of Salomon, who (beeing a figure of this bridegroome) ſet vp that goodly temple as it were a doue-houſe, whither he inuiteth <hi>this doue</hi> in this place: whereunto it is no doubt, but this text ought to bee referred, eſpecially the ſame being twiſe ſpecified in the hiſtorie, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.1. &amp;. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.3. namely that the houſe of Abinadab from whence the Ark was brought by Dauid vnto Hieruſalem, was ſeated within an hill: which it may bee Salomon meant expreſſely to note vnto vs, making mention of the cleftes of the rocke, whither this
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1883:147"/>
ſpouſe retired herſelfe during this tempeſt. But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing letteth but that we may extend this yet farther. For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the kingdome of Salomon himſelfe, was ſhe not in part as it were driuen from her doue-houſe by the Idols which Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſet vp? And what was ſhe afterward? So that the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church is here repreſented vnto vs, not as it is once, or fiue, or ſixe, or moe times, but as beeing an ordinary and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary thing vnto this ſpouſe, whom notwithſtanding her Bridegroome in his good time calleth downe againe <hi>into the plaine.</hi> So then after Salomon, by the diuiſion of the ten tribes, how many doue-houſes, I meane ſynagogues, were ruined &amp; plucked downe, to lodge Ieroboams calfes in? Whither was then the reſort and repaire of Leui, flying as it were in flockes with as many as feared the Lord into the rocke of the temple of Hieruſalem? 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.14. But alas what was this neſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt part of the kings of Iuda, from Roboam vnto Zedechias? A neſt prophaned vilanouſly polluted with the doung of Idols, as the ſtorie witneſſeth, and is eſpecially moſt amply declared in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. What could the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poor childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God do but ſigh &amp; mourne like vnto poore pigeons in their ſmal holes? Such was the flight of the prophets into waſt &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert places of Iſrael vnder Elias and Elizeus, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 4.38. And yet was this poore culuer-houſe ſorer ſhaken, and as it were vtterly ouerturned by Ieſabel, inſomuch that an hundered of the Prophets were hidden by a good man in two caues, and fedde with bread and water, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.13. Behold alſo Elias himſelfe brought vnto that extremity, that he was faine to bee fedde in an hideous deſert by two rauens, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17.16, &amp; by the miniſtery of an Angel, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.5.6. And during the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity this <hi>poore doue</hi> beeing driuen thriſe away by that horrible northerne wind which razed at length the doue-houſe &amp; the Citty, did ſhee not neſt, and as it were hide her head in ſecret holes? For ſo is it ſaid, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 26.20. and vnder the horrible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Antiochus, whither retired ſhe herſelfe with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tathias? 1. <hi>Macab.</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But what? Beginning with Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1883:148"/>
Bridgroom which is here ſpoken of, was he not himſelfe from the time of his natiuity driuen as it were out of the world? For in what place was he born in? In a ſtable, the lodging of beaſts, for there was no other roome for his mother, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.17. from thence muſt he not fly into the deſerts of Aegypt? <hi>Math.</hi> 2.14. Where was he brought vp and nouriſhed? In a poore Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters houſe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.3. in the cittie of Nazareth built alſo vpon a rock, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.29. a cittie of ſo ſmall reckoning and account, that it is demaunded <hi>whether any good thing can come from thence,</hi> Ioh. 1.4. driuen thence whither muſt hee retire himſelfe? Vnto the rocke of Capernaum, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.31. and 10.15. not hauing a place where to reſt his heade, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.58. finally whither was he cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be crucified? Vnto the mount of ſculs, otherwiſe called Caluarie. And where was hee laid after his death? In a caue hewen out of a rocke, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.53. Thus you ſee how the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome himſelfe, during the time of his life here belowe did nothing els, but fly as a man would ſay from rocke to rocke, vntill he were flowne againe into heauen. This is alſo the way which all the Apoſtles haue walked, and the whole Church truely Apoſtolicke, being in this world as wayfarers and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers hither and thither, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. the ſame being foretold, euen vnto the laſt time, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Such was the condition of the ancient Church, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that of Rome, vntil the time of Sylueſter vnder Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the Great, ſince which time <hi>this doue,</hi> which kept herſelfe before vntil this time in holes and corners, finding afterwarde the ſpring of the meddowe, ſo pleaſant and ſweete, and ſo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there aſleepe, the rauening and vnclean birds are come &amp; neſtled in her place, and diſguiſing themſelues at firſt into Doues and pigeons, haue ſo flattered and enchaunted the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Eagle, that finally the great puttocke of Rome hath ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the Eagles crowne, and charged himſelfe with three, decking himſelfe with the Eagles feathers, and namely with the capitall citty of the Empire, ſo that at this day the reſt muſt doe homage vnto this beaſt. And this is the reaſon why this Image of the Romane Empire (which is the whore ſitting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1883:148"/>
the ſeuen hilles of Rome) ſucceeding this beaſt whoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſhe is called, being of the ſame nature, tendeth vnto the ſame end: vſing ſtil the ſame trade of ruining the doue-houſes and driuing away the poore feareful doues of the Lorde with fire &amp; ſword, yea thruſting the fire into their ſmal culuer holes, as ſhee hath alwaies doone, and yet doth vnto this day. But what? The Lord hath limited the ſeaſons of the winter, as wee ſee he hath doone, by continual experience, yea breaketh off ſuddenly the courſe of the ſtormes and tempeſtes as it is ſaide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.8. and as he practiſed the ſame ſenſiblie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.26. I ſpeake this eſpecially for vs in this place, which a man maie truely call a ſmall neſt placed in theſe cragges and mountains, which hath ſerued and yet ſerueth for an harbour of poore fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue doues, which hath beene by a ſinguler and more then admirable goodnes and mercy of God preſerued, and that by euident &amp; apparant miracles, againſt al the enterpriſes which ſatan and his complices could hitherto deuiſe: for which ſo great a benefit of his, God giue vs grace to be thankefull, both in word and deede.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But to goe on let vs note that this Bridegrome ſaith not that <hi>this Doue is retired into the holes</hi> of the rocks, but <hi>of the rocke,</hi> as of a certaine rocke and no other. For it is for them of this woorld to retire themſelues heere and there at euerie iut they haue in time of aduerſity, keeping neither waie, nor foot-path, as we ſee how the ſuperſtitious haue euery one his ſaint, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one his deuotion apart: but the children of God haue but one <hi>rock</hi> and refuge, to which they wholie betake themſelues, according vnto the ſtile which Dauid cuſtomarily vſeth in his Pſalmes, and therefore faile not at anie time to bee in ſafety. Contrarie the vnfaithful ones and enemies of God find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues deceiued of their imagined helps, when the iudgement of God falleth on them and purſueth them, and therefore cry in the daie of wrath vnto the hils and ſaie, <hi>Fall vpon vs, and hide vs from the face of him which ſitteth vpon the throne,</hi> Apocal. 6.15. So did the fiue kings of Canaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hide themſelues in a caue, but it was to haue their reward which they deſerued, <hi>Ioſua.</hi> 10.16.

Now I would ſee you and heare you, and therefore you ſhall come and viſit me and doe me homage thriſe a year, to the end that you may reioice in my preſence, and I with you.

That then which the Bridegroome ſaith in this place is the ſame which is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23.

Neither are we now to trot vp and downe hither &amp; thither as theſe holy pilgrimes of Ieruſalem, who go yet at this day to ſeeke after Ieſus Chriſt in his ſepulcher. For euery land and country is now ſanctified vnto him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.26. and he is neere vnto vs in euery place, and we muſt cauſe our ſelues to be ſeene and heard, lifting vp of pure hands, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. in al places, whereſoeuer it pleaſeth him to lift vp his banner.

            <p n="3">3 But aboue all others the <hi>foxes</hi> which haue ſucceeded certaine faithful auncient paſtors of the Church of Rome, haue vnder the coulour of the authoritie of the Cittie of Rome, and becauſe the Lord at the beginning cauſed the glory of his exceeding grace to ſhine foorth, learned to plaie the part of a <hi>fox</hi> ſo ſliely and ſo wilily, that by little and little, &amp; that (which is a thing of al others exceeding ſtraunge and wonderful) hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to hunt other foxes, they haue brought all vnder their pawes, and then ſtripping themſelues out of their foxes caſe, (but yet ſo, as to ſlip it on againe when neede and occaſion requireth) haue taken vnto themſelues the Lions skinne, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed their talants, torne and deuoured the poore flocks, ſo that they haue wonderfully skared them.

not a creature which demaundeth not vengeance vp on them of god: but I haue principally reſpect vnto their falſe &amp; curſed doctrine: being no hereſie concerning the office of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt (without the which trueth, whatſoeuer they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe touching his perſon and the pointes concerning it in the <hi>Creede,</hi> ſerueth them to no other end, but to colour their lies &amp; falſehoodes which they couer with the cloke of this truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the example of ſatan their father, whom the lord put to ſilence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.34.) which is not couied, and afterwarde hatched, &amp; ſtil nouriſhed and maintained yet in the ſchoole of theſe <hi>foxes,</hi> or rather theſe wolues, which are the talants &amp; the teeth of that great monſter of Rome, who hath left them to deale in the doctrine, wherein they haue learned to acquite themſelues ſo wel, that euerie one hath his morſel of the pray: &amp; hath ſnatched for himſelfe together with his ſpiritualities, the ſcepters and crownes of Princes. Such are among the reſt theſe foure ſortes of wallet-breethren declared ſometimes by the Vniuerſities themſelues to be the locuſts iſſuing out of the bottomleſſe pit, of whom mention is made in the Apocalyps.

And yet the humanity and manhood of Chriſt began not actually to bee before then, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the vertu of the holy ghoſt in the womb of the moſt bleſſed virgine.

               <hi>returning</hi>? For this preſuppoſeth ſome retire &amp; withdrawing going before.

For to ſay the tueth, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome did neuer vtterly forſake this ſpouſe, no not when ſhe for the moſt part forgot herſelfe &amp; her duty greatly: for which reaſon we ſhall ordinarily finde in the Prophets, in one &amp; the ſame Propheſie, <hi>the wound of chaſtiſement,</hi> and <hi>the medicine of grace,</hi> neuer befalling the like to <hi>Sion,</hi> as vnto <hi>Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha,</hi> Eſa. 1.9. But becauſe he is neuer ſo neare at one time, as at an other, not onely when the drawing backe is on the ſpouſes ſide, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.3. but alſo when it pleaſeth the Bridegrome ſo to proue his ſpouſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1. &amp; as the Lord hath thought it good to make his trueth to ſhine in the worlde, more in one time then in an other, as it is to be ſeene in the ancient hiſtory, eſpecially from Ioſua vntil the time of Dauid: this is the cauſe why the ſpouſe beſeecheth him <hi>to approch nearer and nearer</hi>: as alſo, how euer it be, the Lorde for his part hath doon, though the one halfe hath more &amp; more abuſed this grace &amp; fauor of his. This is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that praier which we in like maner ſhould day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make, beſeeching the Lord (who iuſtly ſeemeth to draw himſelfe from vs by little &amp; little, hauing verily take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the world within theſe fewe yeares, ſo many great and excellent lightes of his Church, who might yet haue continued, becauſe we were not woorthy of them) that it wil pleaſe him <hi>to approch and draw nearer againe</hi> vnto vs then euer before.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Finally this ſurname or name of addition which ſhe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth calling them <hi>craggie or cleffie Mountaines</hi> as beeing full of downe-falles &amp; hollow places, in which the chamoyſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſtes of marueilous and almoſt incredible agilitie are mounting and skipping from cliffe to cliffe, this appellation, I ſay, together with the zeale, wherewith this ſpouſe is moued, deſiring there might be no difficulty which might hinder the arriuall &amp; comming of this Bridegroome more neare vnto vs, doth repreſent vnto vs the heauens which ſhee attendeth and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1883:159"/>
looketh for: not ſo euen and ſo fairely poliſhed as they ſeeme vnto vs in faire &amp; cleare weather, but as they ſhew ſometimes crancked and entercut with mighty heapes of cloudes which a man would take to be ſo many mountaines and rockes ful of the ſtrangeſt cragges and downe-falles a man can imagine: in ſomuch as Eſay ſeemeth to giue vs a moſt plaine and cleare expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this place when he ſaith, <hi>O that thou wouldeſt cleaue the heauens and come downe.</hi> The ſpouſe therefore wiſheth and deſireth, that as theſe beaſtes are not hindered any whit at all by any cragges or downe-falles of the rocks, to deſcend &amp; go whither they will, the Bridegroome ſhould alſo in like maner iumpe as it were, from cloude to cloude to approch neare vnto her. But particularly this exceeding great ſecret, &amp; more then incomprehenſible vnto any creature whatſoeuer, namely that the ſonne, <hi>who thought it no robberie to aequall himſelfe with the Father,</hi> being truly ſuch as God is, to wit, verie God; <hi>hath taken on him the forme of a ſeruant, and humbled himſelfe to the death, euen the death of the Croſſe:</hi> this, I ſay, is as it were indeede <hi>to cleaue the heauens, to deſcend into the loweſt parts of the earth,</hi> Philip. 2.6. Epheſ. 4.9. and 5.32. And indeede a declaration thereof was giuen and repreſented vnto Iohn Baptiſt at the baptiſme of Chriſt, who law <hi>the heauens cleft and opened, and the spirit of God to deſcend in the forme of a Doue vpon Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And if we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeke after theſe mountaines and ſteepe places here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, we may ſay, that ſeeing our ſinnes are they which put a diuiſion betweene God and vs, the ſpouſe praieth the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome in this place to <hi>drawe the nearer vnto vs,</hi> not to reſpect theſe hindra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, which are as it were <hi>high Mountaines,</hi> between him and vs, but to doe as theſe chamoyſe and roebuckes doe which vault and bound ouer the rockes how high ſoeuer they be.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Nowe to conclude as the auncient Church hauing the gages &amp; pledges of this ſpiritual marriage whereby they were partakers of all his bleſſinges, praieth the Bridegroome and beſeecheth him <hi>to approch yet nearer vnto her, and in perſon, cauſing the ſhadowes and figures of the auncient couenant to vaniſh awaie and

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue in the Chapter going before vnderſtoode and ſeene the ſweete and gracious behauiour of the Bridegrome in careſſing and entertaining of his ſpouſe, and repoſing of her in a moſt happie reſt, looking for ſtill notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and expecting another more near arriuall &amp; comming of his, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie then, when hee ſhould come as the Sunne riſing from on high to giue light vnto the woorld, and when the figures and ſhadowes of the Law ſhould haue an end, as it is ſaide, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 9.2. and by Zacharie yet more expreſlie in that excellent Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or Song of his. It ſeemed then that all went the beſt that might be in the woorld, the temple of the Lord beeing perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ended with ſo great magnificencie, al that ſeruice ſo
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1883:161"/>
well eſtabliſhed, and the ſtate of the kingdome ſo wiſely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and adminiſtred by Salomon. And indeed, we may and ought to ſaie, that the Church was then maruailous goodlie and glittering, and al the people in exceeding great quiet and peace. The ſame may likewiſe bee ſaide of the eſtate of the Church in the time of Ioſua, the people beeing brought as it were into the reſt of the Lord, as himſelf ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.11. But what? This endured not long, as it was alſo foretolde by Moſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. which thing is heere in this place deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or rather moſt diuinely painted forth vnto vs, containing doctrine altogether neceſſary for our time, that we be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to the endamaging of our own ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the church of god is fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age into that miſerable eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13.25. by beeing by little &amp; litle brought into an heauie ſlumber, by her ouer great eaſe, in ſuch ſort that while ſhee is aſleepe the enemie hath ſet vp his ſeate and prepared it as he would in the verie midſt of the houſe of God, as the Apoſtle foretolde it, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.5. and ſo on. And when at this daie the Lorde would awake her, the moſt part haue ſuch bleare eies that they cannot nor wil not open them: others are in ſo deepe a ſlumber that though they bee waked with neuer ſo great ſtrokes of the whip, yet they lay their head downe againe vpon the pillow: but in general <hi>there where the pot ſeethes is our holy mother the Church.</hi> In a word if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them the gilden ſteeple of S. Peter at Rome, &amp; the chair wherin they ſay he ſate, are the eſſential, immutable, neceſſary, &amp; infallible viſible marks of the true religion &amp; of the Church which they cal <hi>Roman &amp; Catholick</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, <hi>particular &amp; vniuerſal both togither.</hi> Al this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, if you wil haue me ſay that which is, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this repoſe of too great an eaſe. But to bring farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep thoſe who are already brought aſleep, there are no faire pretences wanting, of the excellency of S. Peter among the reſt of the Apoſtles, which they turn into a principality: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for that Saint Paul ſo highly commendeth the faith of the Romanes of his time, as if their ſucceſſors were like vnto them. Beſides this they alleadge the preeminencie which the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1883:161"/>
Biſhops of Rome had aboue others, which wee know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, proceeded partly vpon the autority of that City, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head cittie of the whole Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which preeminencie was alſo maintained by the godlines and conſtancie of the Biſhops there &amp; the notable examples of their martyrdomes: partly alſo beeing afterward autorized by the firſt councell of Nice, vntill ſuch time as the perſecutions ceaſing, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together with wealth &amp; riches encreaſing, euery one ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſoundly in their peace, entred in place of doctrine doting dreames, ſo that finally the poore ſpouſe at her awaking found herſelfe in a moſt wretched &amp; miſerable eſtate, in which ſhee yet continueth to this day, perſecuted in ſo greeuous manner as ſhee is, by the officers of the whore, who hath taken her place while ſhe ſlept ſo quietly, as it was alſo expreſly foretold of the Church of Rome, both by Saint Paul, and alſo by Saint Iohn in his Apocalyps, if we wil credit in this behalfe the moſt auncient expoſitors, Greekes and Latins. And (as it is come to paſſe by a more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> admirable prouidence of God herein) the Italians the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, whoſe poems &amp; rimes are at this day prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; ſong in Rome, cal her <hi>Babylon ful of couetouſnes &amp; impiety, the harbour of the wrath of God, &amp; the temple of hereſie,</hi> beſides that common experience maketh the ſame moſt plaine &amp; euident vnto the eie of thoſe, who are not vtterly blinde. Neither is it in our time, or our fathers time onely, that ſatan hath firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne to deale in this ſort. For behold how the gouernours of the Church &amp; ſucceſſours of Aaron together with the people bewitched in like maner and enchanted, replied vnto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of God, reprehending their falſehood in doctrine, and corruption in maners; <hi>the Temple, the Temple, the Temple of God,</hi> Ierem. 7.4. &amp; that with as loude a cry, as that ſeditious Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius cried, &amp; cauſed to be cried in Epheſus, <hi>the Temple of the great goddeſſe of Diana, of the Epheſians</hi> yea caried headlong with the ſame <hi>lying</hi> and murdering ſpirit, being no other difference at all betweene them then this, that the Iewes abuſed a good ground and principle, for indeede <hi>the Temple of Ieruſalem</hi> was built by the commaundement of the Lord, and vnto the Lord,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1883:162"/>
which could not bee ſaid of <hi>the Temple of Diana,</hi> built by the ſuggeſtion of Satan vnto a falſe goddeſſe: all comming not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to one end, ſeeing the Temple built &amp; conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God, was become the place where his holy name was moſt vilanouſly polluted and abuſed. This is it which wee are taught in this place by the verie confeſſion of the ſpouſe herſelfe, <hi>ſeeking after her Bridegrome, and not finding him in her bed,</hi> where the Bridegroome, without going far from her, had laid her, as we haue ſeene in the Chapter going before. And how came this to paſſe? Vpon no other thing, but that the ſpouſe fell aſleepe in <hi>this bed,</hi> on which notwithſtanding ſhe was laid downe, not to ſleepe, but only to reſt herſelfe, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſtil watching. And yet neither if we continue ſo, can we deale ſo wel and ſo diligently, that there be no default, as wee ſhall afterwardes ſee. What other thing then can happen, but an extreme deſolation, when men fal aſleepe vpon their eaſe and quiet, and eſpecially when they of all other are the faſteſt aſleepe, who ſhould watch for themſelues and for others? <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25. But from whence is the fault? Not on the lords ſide, but on the wretchedneſſe of man, who cannot order him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aright, neither in proſperity nor in aduerſity, not in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor in wealth &amp; abundance. And if we compare both theſe extremities together, we ſhall find both by reaſon and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the waie of peace and reſt, accompanied with proſperity &amp; aboundance, is the more dangerous. For aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and neede ſtirreth vp and awaketh the moſt ſenſleſſe and ſluggiſh, to thinke on the remedies thereof, whence it is ſaid that <hi>Neceſſity hath beene the occaſion that artes and ſciences were found out and inuented:</hi> but proſperity and aboundance bring the beſt aſleepe, witneſſes whereof may be Adam and Eue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their miſerable fall, and Salomon who was ſo wiſe: in a word the whole hiſtorie of the Church truely Chriſtian, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall and Catholique, which floriſhed vnder Saint Peter, and Saint Iohn, <hi>who had neither gold nor ſiluer,</hi> Act. 3.6. but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed vnto others in midſt of their pouerty from the break of daie vntil night, the true riches which God had committed
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1883:162"/>
vnto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.21. &amp; vnder S. Paul <hi>who liued and nouriſhed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the labour of his handes, preaching vnto them daie and night, and that with teares,</hi> Act. 20.31.34: whereas afterward vpon the peace which Conſtantine graunted it, accompanied with wealth and aboundance, the mother of ambition and diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it neuer ceaſed vntill this daie to decline touching hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly &amp; celeſtial things, though in reſpect of the world it haue growne great and mighty. For how can the kingdom of God and the kingdome of the world agree together? <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.36. Things ſo contrarie one vnto the other, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.4. Thus you ſee then in what ſort a ſweete repoſe and reſt bringeth aſleep not this man or that man, but the whole Church conſidered in a generality, that in leſſe then a turne is ſhe turned and wandred away from her Bridegroome.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But the Bridegroome who can neuer vtterly forget his ſpouſe, no not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath for a time in his iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts caſt her off &amp; left her as it were to the wide world: findeth alwaies means to awake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, &amp; to forme in her a deſire of returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to find him, as it is ſaid, <hi>Deu.</hi> 32.37. &amp; 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.46. which is here declared vs by the ſpouſe ſaying, that <hi>ſhe ſought him.</hi> And how could this be if ſhe were not firſt gone from him, &amp; afterwarde come againe vnto herſelfe to thinke to ſeeke after him? And that by his meanes who ſpeaketh within, and ſaith, <hi>Awake thou which ſleepeſt,</hi> Eph. 5.14. and Eſai. 26.19. And here wee muſt put a great difference betweene that ſort of waking which is proper vnto Gods elect, and which proceedeth from his meere grace (as hee alſo cauſeth vs to finde the waie out of which we are wandred and ſtraied) and that waking &amp; good morrow of ſinne which the wicked haue, which leadeth ſuch as are reprobate into deſpaire, according vnto that which is ſaid, that <hi>there is no peace vnto the wicked,</hi> Eſai. 48.22. and as is to be ſeene in that horrible example of Iudas the traitor, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.4. For this awaking proceeding from the pricke of ſinne, maketh the ſinner to flie before the face of the Iudge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the example of Adam, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.8. but that awaking which proceedeth from grace, &amp; from an hart truly contrite,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1883:163"/>
createth in a man an ardent deſire of returning vnto his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: for which reaſon the ſpouſe here ſaith, that <hi>when ſhee awoke ſhe ſought him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 But what meaneth that which afterwardes is added by her, namely, <hi>that ſhe founde him not</hi>? And how agreeth this with that promiſe of Chriſt verified by ſo many experiences, <hi>knocke and it ſhal be opened vnto you, ſeeke and you ſhal find?</hi> Matth. 7.7. and Luk. 11.9.10. And if <hi>the Lorde hath cauſed himſelfe to bee found of thoſe who ſought him not,</hi> Eſa. 65.1. (for it is the ſheephard which ſeeketh after the ſtraie ſheepe, and not the ſheepe the ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.12) how is it poſſible that this ſpouſe <hi>found him not?</hi> I aunſwere that the ſpouſe ſaith not, that ſhee could neuer find him, which ſhould contrarie the promiſe aboue: but <hi>that ſeeking after him in her bed, ſhee found him not.</hi> True, <hi>in her bed,</hi> for there he was not. <hi>To find him</hi> therefore, it is not enough <hi>to ſeek him,</hi> but we muſt ſeek where he is to be ſought: &amp; therfore it is no maruel though <hi>the ſpouſe found not her Bridegroome in her bed,</hi> for he was not there. Moreouer we muſt ſeek him in a fit and conuenient time if wee will find him, namely when the time is of ſetting the dore open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwiſe wee looſe but our paines to ſeeke him, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 55.6. and we muſt knocke at the doore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be bolted on the innerſide, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.12.

For the fault is in vs. And though wee failed in no one point of thoſe which I haue aboue ſet downe yet we muſt doe God this honor to giue him leaue to chuſe the time and the meanes, to grant vs that which he wil giue vs, when we haue demanded it as he hath giuen vs our rule.

and failed in looking and waiting after it,</hi> Pſal. 119.82. and <hi>that hee was hoarce with crying,</hi> Pſal. 69.3. not that the Lord is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ready to heare then we are to pray, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>it is hee who formeth in vs the deſire of praying, and who teacheth vs how we ought to pray,</hi> Rom. 8.26. and it is he <hi>who muſt open our lippes that they maie ſhew forth his praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 51.17. But it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and profitable for vs to be ſo delaied, becauſe <hi>we are wont to make light of that which we come lightly by:</hi> in a woord how euer it bee, it is hee who hath <hi>the times and ſeaſons</hi> in his hand, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But here the ſpouſe ſeeketh after him whom ſhee ought to ſeeke, &amp; faileth not in any thing ſaue this, that ſhee ſeeketh him of errour there where he is not: and where is that? <hi>In her bed.</hi> And yet who gaue her <hi>this bed,</hi> and who laide her there? Her Bridegroome, hauing ſo expreſly inuited her, and ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and kindly entertained her, as we haue ſeene in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter going before, and eſpecially in the tenth verſe, and in the verſes following. What is the reaſon then, why <hi>hee could not bee founde,</hi> as if hee had parted cleane awaie? Becauſe the ſpouſe falling aſleepe, made more of the gift, then of the giuer, that is to ſay, gaue herſelfe ſo farre ouer vnto this reſt and eaſe, that ſhe continued to be heauie and drowſie ſtill. So commeth it to paſſe in all other temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings, when we ſtay and ſettle our harts and mindes wholly vpon them. Life it ſelfe is an eſpeciall gift and bleſſing of God, <hi>in whom we are, we moue, and we liue.</hi> Act. 17.28. But ſay we once with the children of this worlde, There is nothing more to be deſired then to liue? <hi>We are dead whileſt we liue,</hi> 1. Tim. 5.6. Aſmuch is to be ſaid of all the commodities and bleſſings of this life, albeit they bee the bleſſings of God, vnto them on whom the gift is beſtowed of vſing them wel, as on Abraham &amp; on Iob, <hi>Iob.</hi> 31. and on a verie fewe others. But what doe the moſt part of the world deſire? Mary <hi>they would find Paradiſe in their bed,</hi> that is to ſay, they would haue a <hi>peaceable gospell,</hi> that they might lie downe ſoftly and ſleepe, &amp; paſſe their time of life with others in reſt and ſecurity. I ſpeake not yet of them, who looſe the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:1883:164"/>
raines to all ſortes of pleaſures, and giue themſelues ouer to their vnmeaſured luſts: but of thoſe who would content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with a meaſure. Notwithſtanding if we ſettle &amp; reſt our ſelues hereon, as if we were to find herein our only felicity, we ſhall finde our ſelues deceiued, and depriue our ſelues of the principall vſe of theſe benefits and bleſſings, which is to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them ſo as if we handled thorns, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. &amp; to be more carefull in the well diſpoſing our expence, then in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of our receipt, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18. in a worde to followe the proteſtation of Dauid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5.</p>
            <p n="5">5 For example we may and ought to ſay that God hath at this day prepared vs a goodly ſoft <hi>bed,</hi> and giuen vs reſt both here &amp; in many other places, whether we reſpect that which is the principall, I meane, the purity of doctrine, &amp; ſome kind of order in the Church together with the meanes of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in learning and good letters, or whether wee regard our ciuil liberty and freedome oppoſed to the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a great part of the world beſides. This is a goodly <hi>bed</hi> which God hath himſelfe made vs by litle and litle in this world, &amp; which he hath curtained and kept cloſe for vs about theſe 60. years, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the infinit reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, which is as much as if he ſhould haue built his neſt in the middeſt of the impetuous waues of the maine Ocean. If hereupon euerie man fall aſleepe in his <hi>bed,</hi> and let the preachers preach what they liſt, they wil care for nothing but for their temporall profits and commodities: briefly, if we make but an acceſſarie or a by-woorke of that which ſhould be the principall, what will come thereof in the end but this, that at length the principall will be cleane neglected and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? And this is the cauſe why God hath giuen vs ſome ſmal laſhes with his rod, and namely the laſt yeare, to awaken vs therby: but who hath beene the better by them? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs take heed hee laie not downe his rod and take vp a whippe, and in the end a barre of iron, not to awake, but to quell them who are ſo faſt and ſo heauie aſleepe in time of their peace and quiet. Now if but to occupy our mindes a litle

in thoſe commodities which the Lord granteth vs, be a thing ſo dangerous, as it became to bee to Salomon himſelfe, what ſhal become of them who haue ſettled their minds ſo farre on them, as that they vtterly forget the giuer? What ſhall I ſay then vnto you ye rich-miſers, who either haue inherited hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes full of wealth, or whoſe labours God hath ſo plentifullie bleſſed, to you I ſpeak, who put your confidence in your riches and thinke on nothing elſe, but how to pintch and ſpare and ſcrape and ſcratch together, and neuer make any reckoning how or where to imploy them wel, you I ſaie, who haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther god but your belly: in a word all you who haue receiued ſuch <hi>a largeſſe</hi> of gods bleſſinges, and thinke on nothing leſſe then how to vſe them to his honour and glorie. What ſhall I ſay vnto you? Wil you neuer bethink your ſelues of ſo great an abuſe? Neuer conſider of ſo great a diſorder, feare yee not to be forſaken of him, whoſe bleſſinges you ſo wickedly, ſo wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly abuſe?</p>
            <p n="6">6 But what ſhall become of them who ſleepe not in that <hi>bed</hi> which God laied them in, or enioy that reſt &amp; quiet which God beſtowed on them, but in that which their owne luſtes, &amp; their wicked practiſes haue purchaſed them? As ſome plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of riches, and goods il gotten, or ſome other ſhewe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce of credit and quiet, redeemed and purchaſed with the loſſe of their conſcience: as alſo when anie are aſleepe in a leud courſe and traine of life, whether it bee in whooredome (whereof we haue a ſtraunge example in Dauid himſelfe, who of an adulterer became a traitor and a murderer, by falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in his ſinne) or whether it be in gluttony, as wee ſee it to be the trade of theſe gameſters, tiplers, tauern-haunters, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch diſſolute people, who ende their daies in miſery and commonlie on the gallowes: for fewe of them haue that grace giuen them which is mentioned in the parable of the prodigal ſonne.

            <p n="7">7 But to apply this doctrine yet more nearer vnto our vſe, when wee ſee at this day ſuch differents and controuerſies in Chriſtendome, it is not for vs to ſay, <hi>Let all be as be may, we will meddle with none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="9">9 The ſpouſe addeth that which is properly belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this matter, ſaying, that <hi>when ſhee found not her Bridegroome in this bed where ſhee ſought him, ſhee roſe to ſeeke him whom ſhee ſo hartily loueth,</hi> where euer he were.

that which is ill, but wee muſt like and approoue that which is good and practiſe it. What is then <hi>to riſe out of her bed</hi>?

            <p n="2">2 But wee muſt eſpecially conſider that which the ſpouſe ſaith in this place, namely, <hi>that ſhe dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſought after her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, by the open places, and went round about the Cittie and found him not.</hi> For contrariwiſe in the parable of the banquet, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.21. the ſeruantes are commanded vpon the refuſall which the greater ſort and the rich made, <hi>to go vnto the open places &amp; ſtreets of the City, to bring together thoſe which were poore &amp; impotent, lame and blind.</hi> But this ſimilitude tendeth to another purpoſe then this of the ſpouſe, to wit, to ſhew vs that they are no members of the Church, or (if they were before) leaue to bee, who make more reckoning of their woorldly eaſe and other their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and affaires of this world, then they doe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: in whoſe places God doth often <hi>chuſe the poore and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible of the world,</hi> as it is ſaide in the Canticle of the bleſſed virgin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.52.53. We read alſo, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.20. that <hi>Wiſedom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her voice to ring in the ſtreets and open places:</hi> but it is not ſaid that ſhe was harkned vnto or receiued there: yea co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, Wiſedome lamenteth and bewaileth the diſorders which doe there raigne. There is likewiſe ſpeach in the parable of the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1883:168"/>
ſower of <hi>ſeed which fel in the waie,</hi> which becauſe it pearced not into, and entred the earth, <hi>it was incontinently eaten vp by the birds.</hi> Theſe two places maie ſerue vs for the interpretation of this, in which we vnderſtand by <hi>the open places and the circuite of the Citty,</hi> that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly receiued &amp; beareth ſway among men. And to ſaie al in one word, it is that mask which is called at this daie by the name of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> not that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church which wee mention in our Creede, but that monſter which the efficacie of errour hath engendred by her, who hath bewitched the kinges and nations of the earth, as it hath beene before prophecied and foretold.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To anſwere therefore this matter, which is the laſt refuge of our aduerſaries, what is that the ſpouſe here ſaith, beeing ſo affrighted &amp; hared, for that her Bridegrome is departed from her, while ſhe was aſleep in <hi>her bed?</hi> It is this, which I ſay &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate againe, that ſhe thought, that he whom ſhe ſought, and ſo conſequently the truth, and her ſaluation, were to be found in the religion which was commonly receiued among the people. And what induced her to think ſo? The promiſes made vnto that people and to no other, before the comming of the Bridegroome in fleſh, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. as at this daie, <hi>the Church,</hi> ſay they, <hi>cannot erre,</hi> hereupon to ground al their errours. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then did this ſpouſe deceiue her ſelf? Euen with that which was aunſwered, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.18. and preſuppoſing (as they woulde gladly make vs to beleeue at this daie of Saint Peters ſteeple at Rome) that religion was nayled as it were with a tennepenie naile, vnto Abrahams race, without diſtinguiſhing the true Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites from the falſe, as Saint Iohn Baptiſt reproched them in his time: ſhee iudged of true religion according vnto that which was brought in when ſhe was aſleepe, &amp; of a long time receiued of great &amp; ſmal, whereas ſhee ſhould haue ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which was propoſed and commanded for a rule vnto the people, that is to ſaie, <hi>in the lawe and in the teſtimony,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.20. For ſeeing that the true Church iudgeth not the the controuerſies of religion, but ſo farre as to referre her ſelfe wholy vnto that which the Bridegroome hath thereof deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1883:168"/>
by the mouth of his Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, it followeth that it is neither vnto that which is commonly receiued and maintained, nor vnto the greater number that wee are to refer our ſelues to be reſolued, ſeeing that euen in the affairs of this world there bee more fooles then wiſemen, and more wicked men then good: but we muſt refer our ſelues vnto the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome himſelf, who is iudge both of the one and of the other. Yea, but where ſhall a man finde him? Wee muſt not ſay, (ſaith the Apoſtle after Moſes) <hi>wee will aſcend vp into heauen to finde him there, or paſſe the Sea to ſeeke him. But the woorde is in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is to ſaie, this word of faith which wee preach,</hi> Rom. 10.8. And this is it by which we muſt diſcerne the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church from the falſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 What is then, you will ſay, this Catholicke Church, in the which no where elſe, Ieſus Chriſt is found, &amp; out of which there is no ſaluation? It is the aſſembly of all the true elect and faithfull, gathered out of al people and nations in vnitie of the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall doctrine conſidered in her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, in which aſſemblie truely the light of the trueth can neuer be put out, albeit in the parts and members of the bodie diſtinctly &amp; ſeuerally conſidered, there may be ſome defects, doubts, &amp; ignorances, as the hiſtory of all times declareth the ſame. To this Church thus vniuerſally conſidered, is oppoſed the generality of all companies beſides, which are alſo called Chriſtian, and which keepe the marcke of Baptiſme, but haue forged vnto themſelues a religion, according vnto their owne luſt and fancy, whether they couer themſelues with the name &amp; writings of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles il interpreted, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they inuent a doctrine altogether newe according vnto their own pleaſure, for which cauſe ſuch a church is called he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, that is to ſay, grounded vpon a doctrine which a man hath choſen and taken vnto himſelfe, and which agreeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that which is Catholicke, nor with it ſelfe, but is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times diuided into ſo many peeces as there are braines gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto their owne priuate and particular ſenſe, hauing all of them this in common, that they goe aſtray and wander from
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1883:169"/>
the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall truth. I knowe that all this is applied againſt vs by the aduerſaries of our time, who for this cauſe cal our Church new, and giue vs ſuch titles as like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues beſt, not perceiuing howe themſelues cut their owne throats calling their Church the Catholicke Church, except they can ſhew vs that Rome and the whole world are all one: but the controuerſie would be ſoone ended if men would but harken vnto reaſon. I ſaie therefore that accordingly as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to ſhew his iudgements vpon the vnthankefulnes of the world, or of his mercy to ſpare mankinde, the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church hath ſometimes ſhined foorth and appeared in her bewtie, but not alwaies aboue the falſe and heretical: the painted &amp; diſguiſed ſtrumpet, counterfaiting the chaſt ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt ſo well, and diſplaying the beames of her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bewtie ſo magnificently for the moſt part, that all both great and ſmall take her to be the true, &amp; thereupon the poore ſpouſe, which is the true ſpouſe indeed, is forced to retire into the deſerts, vntill the time of indignation be paſt, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Apo.</hi> 17.14. That this is ſo it cannot be denied, but that a man ſhalbe conuicted by the whole hiſtorie of the Church, and by that which wee ſee at this day with our eies. Thence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the multitude and the greateſt and apparant num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is a moſt falſe marke of the true church: but without ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either on few or more, we muſt keep vs vnto this infallible point, that the true Church and worthy of the name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke and vniuerſal is that, which maketh a true profeſſion of the doctrine preached &amp; entirely regiſtred by the Apoſtles to be the onely rule of trueth vnto the whole company of the elect.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Theſe two names therefore of Apoſtolicall doctrine and Catholicke Church, are both of them ſo inſeparable &amp; agree in ſuch ſort, that the true Church is by this true and eſſentiall marcke diſtinguiſhed from the falſe: &amp; againe the true church beareth certaine marckes of the ſeede whence ſhee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And to the end that they reply not hereupon that the one
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1883:169"/>
and the other aſſembly may alleage the ſame text of the bible: I anſwere, firſt, that the falſe Church maketh no reckoning of keeping herſelfe wholly to the holy Scriptures: ſecondly, that the Scripture ought aſwel to be the commentarie as the Text, and that al interpretation of Scripture being referred vnto the articles of faith, as vnto a certaine and infallible rule to diſcern that which is true fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is falſe, as being the abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Scripture, it wil be alwaies eaſie not to be deceiued, except a man wil himſelfe. Thus you ſee what we are to think of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munalty of the greater number, which cried in Chriſts time, <hi>away with him, away with him, crucifie him,</hi> which is oppoſed vnto that which Ieſus Chriſt calleth <hi>litle flocke,</hi> Luk, 12.32. But let vs ſee whether the ſpouſe haue any better dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Shee ſaith then in ſumme that going ſo through the City <hi>ſhe was found by the watch,</hi> &amp; ſhe asked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>if they could tell her any tidings of this Bridegroom,</hi> and ſaith not what aunſwere ſhe had of them: but it appeareth ſufficiently by that which foloweth, either that they anſwered her nothing, or that without ſtaying their anſwere ſhe went her way farther.

            </p>
            <p n="8">8 Wee maie not maruell then that the ſpouſe found as little comforte by <hi>the watch,</hi> as ſhee did <hi>in the open places of the Cittie:</hi> beeing a thing moſt certaine and aſſured, that if the poore Church of God, hauing, amiddeſt theſe ſtraites of hers,

loſt the ſight of her Bridegrome when ſhee looked ſo ill vnto him, had referred her ſelfe to this goodlie <hi>watch</hi> to haue her reſolution of them, ſhee had but loſt her paines, this <hi>watch</hi> beeing ſet rather to turne aſide &amp; to ſkare theſe poore affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſheepe, then to bring them againe into the right way.

            </p>
            <p n="9">9 But let vs ſee whether this doctrine, which we haue more neede of now then euer, extend it ſelfe vnto the time of the newe couenant: for behold the poynt wherein Satan at this day employeth his whole forces, namely to perſuade men that neither can it nor may it euer happen, that they whom they cal <hi>the Church repreſentatiue</hi> (the titles whereof they afterwards ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhorten or lengthen as pleaſe them, calling it ſometimes <hi>the Romane Church,</hi> ſometimes <hi>the Romane Catholique Church,</hi> &amp; ſometimes the <hi>Catholique Apoſtolicall Romane Church,</hi> that this company I ſaie, either hath or can euer be ſo forſaken of God, that it may for the moſt part bee either it ſelfe apparantlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, or deceiue others. If a man aſke why, ſeeing this came notoriouſly to paſſe in the ancient Church, beholde their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is ready. It was ſaide vnto Saint Peter, <hi>I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile not.</hi> Now that Saint Peters faith were not at one time greatly ſhaken it cannot be denied. And therefore they muſt needes confeſſe, that if their <hi>repreſentatiue Church</hi> haue no more force then hee whom they of a notable abuſe take for their foundation, it may at leaſt for one time be ſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as to denie Ieſus Chriſt three times <hi>and that with an oth and execration.</hi> And I would to God the like had happened to them but thriſe. But to let this paſſe, what maner of concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I pray you, is this? The Lorde by a ſingular grace of his, raiſed vp and comforted his diſciple in ſuch ſort that hee acknowledged his fault without drowning himſelfe any farther therein, &amp; which

more is, hee vſed him afterward to encourage and ſtrengthen others, I pray you, what doth this appertaine vnto the Citty of Rome, or vnto the See afterwardes erected there? Saue that I confeſſe (and I ſay it after one of their principall Poets whoſe verſes themſelues yet print and ſing euery day) that many ages ago this Papall See hauing put out and defaced the ancient A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique Church of Rome, is become <hi>The temple of hereſie in doctrine, and an other Sodome in manners.</hi> But what alleage they farther? Ieſus Chriſt ſaide thriſe vnto Peter, <hi>feede my ſheepe. The Pope therefore, and that Church which acknowledgeth the Pope for their head cannot erre: no though he ſhould driue whole cartloades of ſoules vnto hell, no man may ſay vnto him, ſir what do you?</hi> O God, what impudent ſhameleſnes is this! As if Saint Peter, the See of Rome, and they who ſit in it were al one. Yet this I will wel confeſſe notwithſtanding, that ſince the time of many ages they who haue ſate in this See, and haue made a throne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and exalted it as much as lay in them, aboue that of God himſelfe (in that they attribute vnto themſelues the power to diſpenſe with the Lawe of God, and the autoritie not to bee iudged of any man liuing, yea to haue power to commaund the Angels) that they, I ſay, are not fallen from the faith which they neuer had nor neuer cared after or tooke thought for: I let paſſe other allegations of theirs, which howe friuolous and fooliſh they bee the very little children are able to iudge. And what hath come to paſſe in this behalfe which was not expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly foretold by Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and found true by the experience of our time? <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.43. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.2. and 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. and 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and 6.3. and 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. and 3.16. and 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.18. Now if theſe ſo expreſſe predictions and prophecies ſuffice not, and that the whole eccleſiaſtical ſtorie cannot ſerue for ſufficient proofe, at leaſt let a man now open his eies and ſee the effectes thereof more apparant and great then great and mighty mountaines, I meane the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in all the ground articles of Chriſtian Catholique doctrine, that is to ſay, the doctrine which God hath deliuered vnto his
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:1883:171"/>
whole Church at the beginning, to remain and continue vnto the end and conſummation thereof. For at the leaſt it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by that we haue aboue ſaide, and followeth vpon neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie conſequence, that ſeeing they who ought to bee the eies of the flocke are ſubiect not onely <hi>to be blinde, but leaders alſo of the blinde to fall both togither into the ditch,</hi> Matt. 15.14. and that they who ought to haue <hi>the key of knowledge, may keepe it back, &amp; indeede haue often kept it back, not onely not to enter in themſelues into the kingdome of heauen, but alſo to keepe others out,</hi> Luk. 11.52. it is an ouer manifeſt falſehoode to conclude, that without all manner of replie and gaineſaying, we muſt in matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience &amp; relligion, hold our ſelues vnto that which they, who call themſelues the ſucceeding Church of the Apoſtles, and eſpecially that goodly Apoſtle of Rome, who may be iudged of no man liuing, commaundeth vs to beleeue.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Nay albeit we granted them that their originall &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were as Apoſtolicall, as it is Apoſtatical, Ieſus Chriſt who is the truth it ſelfe might wel haue made after Saint Iohn Baptiſt this concluſion for himſelfe abſolutelie, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.33. and yet he notwithſtanding ſuffered &amp; commaunded alſo that his doctrine ſhould be examined by the ſcriptures, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. The Apoſtles alſo though their doctrine were vngainſayable (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the meaſure of the ſpirite which they had) yet they came vnder this examen, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. and practiſed it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and recommended the ſame expreſly vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For it is by the doctrine of the Apoſtles expounded by it ſelfe, that wee muſt diſcerne <hi>the Apoſtolique Church,</hi> to which we are to ioyne our ſelues: from the falſe, which we muſt turn from and auoide: and therefore our aduerſaries could by no meanes better ſhewe by what ſpirit they are led, and that they are not ſucceſſors, but vſurpers &amp; vniuſt poſſeſſors, ſince they refuſe this examen and tryal, vnto which they haue beene and yet are euery day called but in vaine, except they will bee both Iudges &amp; parties, <hi>but it is thou ô eternall God who ſhalt iudge of all this matter in conuenient time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11 Why then, wil ſome reply, what manner of Church wil
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:1883:172"/>
this be if the prelates be not the Iudges of errors, and if other keepe them not to their ſentence and reſolution? Truly I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes that <hi>all things ought to be orderly done in the houſe of God,</hi> Cor. 14.4. but what is this order? Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the Lord of the houſe hath eſtabliſhed by his Apoſtles. Let vs then firſt of all keepe and obſerue this, and hold all that for diſorder which ſhalbee farther added, diminiſhed or chaunged: (I meane in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of doctrine) ſo that whoſoeuer oppoſeth himſelf againſt this diſorder, whenſoeuer it ſlideth into the Church, may not be iuſtly held for author of confuſion, but ought rather to bee praiſed &amp; harkned vnto, as the ſetter vp againe &amp; reeſtabliſher of that order, which the ſonne of God eſtabliſhed in his houſe. Secondly although the forme of outwarde order be obſerued, yet we may not tie the holy ſpirit to perſons without exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for thoſe reaſons which I haue proued, &amp; becauſe that in many thoſe things wherein they offend goe not before but followe their vocation, as the Apoſtle warneth vs, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. in whom the Church findeth afterward that ſhee hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as all the auncient heretiques and the greateſt part of them of our time may ſufficiently witnes. But we are to follow the rule which the Lord gaue, and which he alſo confirmed by his owne example. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſit in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Chaire, do yee that which they ſay, but do not that which they doe,</hi> that is to ſay, ſo farre as, according vnto the order of God eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the miniſtery of Moſes, they preach the truth in the Synagogues, their hypocriſie and wicked life otherwiſe, maie not hinder you from receiuing and practiſing that which they teach, for the truth dependeth not on the perſon of him which teacheth, either in doctrine or in the ſacramentes. But what ſaith Chriſt in an other place? <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Take heede of the leauen of the Phariſees:</hi> and in an other place, <hi>Let them alone, they are blinde, and leaders of the blinde,</hi> Mat. 15.14. And indeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf openly condemned their falſe interpretations of the Law: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.8. and cared as little for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.42.44. What are we to doe then in ſuch a caſe? <hi>Wee muſt,</hi> ſaith the beloued diſciple, <hi>proue the spirits

Naie contrariwiſe the whole church warneth &amp; enioyneth vs, as touching doctrine, to take heed of falſe Prophets, &amp; to flie not only Idolaters but Idols alſo, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.21. So did the Leuites and the Prieſts, retire themſelues out of the kingdome of Iſrael, when al thinges were there in vtter ouerthrow and confuſion. There continued notwithſtanding an aſſemblie of Prophets which communicated not at al with the Baalims, nor with ſuch as aſſembled themſelues there, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 11.14. &amp; 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.38.42. And the Lord himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Let them alone, they are blind, leaders of the blind.</hi> Matth. 15.14. but ſaie our aduerſaries, hee went vnto Ieruſalem, hee came into the Temple as others did, yea into the Synagogues alſo. I graunt, but I aunſwere that firſt there was but one Ieruſalem, where the publique outward ſeruice was adminiſtred according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of God: the prieſthood was yet on foote: Moſes &amp; the Prophetes were al of them in the Synagogues: and albeit the doctrine was mingled with much leaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet the true dowe remained ſtill notwithſtanding, and the ceremoniall ſeruice continued in his entire eſtate. Secondly it was to driue out of the Temple with the whip the buyers and ſellers whome hee found in the Temple, crying out ful loude and ful ſhrill againſt the leauen of the Phariſees, Sadduces, Herodians and others, as likewiſe hee did in the Synagogues. But if the Temple had beene brought to that paſſe, as it was at that time when the

For I pray you, if the Prophetical ſcriptures were ſufficient in the time of Ieſus Chriſt, to make him throughly to be known, and to cauſe al contrary doctrine to fal and vaniſh away, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical writinges and ſcriptures haue they empayred and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed this clearnes, or haue they not rather bin as the ſun riſing, after day break? If the Baptiſme of Iohn which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the daies morning, was ſufficient to direct them whom Chriſt ſent back thither, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25. and <hi>Act.</hi> 19.30. ought we now to ſeek any other text or gloſſe, then ſo authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick a teſtimonie, ſealed by ſo manie miracles, and ſo faithfully regiſtred in thoſe writinges which wee call the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin ſhewed in the Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what diligence the ſpouſe vſed in ſeeking after this Bridegrome of hers, who ſeemed for her, to bee loſt: and how ſhee found him not in the open places, nor could heare anie tidinges at al of him of the watch: whereof we haue largelie entreated. There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth notwithſtanding one difficultie more, in that wee ſaid that by this watch were meant the falſe Paſtors of the Citty of God which is the houſe of this ſpouſe, namelie, the Church: whereunto it ſeemeth that this which is here ſaid is directly contrarie, to wit, that this watch was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe in their priuate houſes (for had it been ſo, the ſpouſe had not met with them, as neither would ſhee haue made this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1883:175"/>
vnto thoſe which had been aſleepe) but that ſhe found it where it ſhould be to gard &amp; defend the Citty round about: which thing the falſe Paſtors are not wont to doe, whome a man ſhal find rather in their beds, or at table, or in the ſtewes or anie where elſe then in their corps degard. I aunſwere that there are in general two ſortes of theſe falſe Paſtors: for ſome of them are more ſhameful and deteſtable in their whole life, and making their vices the onely trade of their life they ſhew themſelues publickely and openly for ſuch as they bee: others there be (to wit ſuch are of the richeſt and wealthieſt ſort) who are Church-robbers, haukers and hunters, dronkards, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, adulterers, hauing no other god but their belly, brieflie ſuch as Bernard deſcribeth the court of Pope Eugenius which is ſince nothing mended, but hath ſowed and encreaſed her filthy manners in al the quarters of the world: others (of which ſort are theſe maſſe-mungers, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſors, graund amners,) make open profeſſion of being baudes, ſtewards of the houſe, clearks of the kitchin, yeomen of the horſe, to haue a ſoupe at their maiſters broth &amp; brewes. In the meane time the poore vicars muſt trudge about and watch, that is to ſaie, muſt barke &amp; bay daie and night at the parchment, and make ſale of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize for the quick and the dead which they haue taken to farme, to ſel againe (as well as they maie to bee ſauers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, how euer the poore ſheepe paie for it) to him that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moſt and out-biddeth the reſt: paying the woorld againe with Chriſtmas-carols, and prouiding eſpecially for this, that no other wolue catch their ſheepe. And thus you ſee howe the Lords ſheepefolde is guided by them who cal themſelues the chiefe pillers of the Catholique Church, and maintainers of diuine ſeruice. For which thinges I report me to that which heauen and the verie conſcience of euery one which hath any at al can witnes, to iudge whether I ſlaunder them in ſpeaking thus of them or no. Others are after another ſort diſguized, all of them hauing this one thing in common, that they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they appear without for to be, I mean, true Paſtors, but deceiue, after diuerſe ſortes, both themſelues and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:1883:175"/>
others. Some make nothing elſe but a mockerie of them who make reckoning of them, beeing no other within then meere Atheiſts: others are poor ſuperſtitious ones, abuſed &amp; abuſing others, thinking to appeaſe the fire of the wrath of god by their inuentions &amp; deuotions, ſparing neither body nor ſoul which they torment not, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.22.23. And this is properly of thoſe two laſt ſorts of gardiens that the ſpouſe here ſpeaketh, whom a man ſhal find to buſie from mattins to veſpers a mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling their crucifixe, beſides their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie deuotions: ſome of them of a meere hypocriſie: others of zeale without knowledge: albeit, when there is any queſtion of perſecuting the Church, we maie then truely ſaie, that there is neuer a one of theſe aſleep, but they al forget for a time their ordinarie traine altogether, to catch and entrap as many ſeely ſheepe as ſeeke to flie and eſcape their talants: as did the great councel of Ieruſalem who watched al night long, to take Ieſus Chriſt, and to frame his enditement, when Saint Peter himſelf and his companions could not keepe themſelues waking. This is not al then to watch, for the Diuel watcheth alſo, as do they alſo whom he ſetteth a worke. But wee muſt keepe watch and ward to a good end, for they are of al others the moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, who are moſt diligent and expert men to doe euil.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But let vs leaue theſe merchandizers of ſoules, and ſuch as make trafique of poore ſeely conſciences, and come wee now vnto that which the ſpouſe here ſaith. Which is in ſumme thus much, <hi>that beeing paſt a little this watch ſhee found her beloued whom ſhee neuer left vntill ſhee had brought him home to her mothers houſe, yea to her mothers owne chamber:</hi> whereupon we are to rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate that which we haue aboue already noted, namely that when the Lord maketh vs to ſeeke him by recoiling as it were and drawing backe from vs, hee doth it not therefore that hee would fruſtrate that deſire which he firſt formed in the hearts of ſuch as are his: but becauſe hee would by that meanes ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their diligence, and cauſe vs to eſteeme ſo much the more of him when wee haue found him: beeing an ordinarie thing with men to contemne that which they came light by, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:1883:176"/>
we haue ſtil daily experience. For <hi>if himſelfe ſeeketh after the ſheepe which is ſtraied,</hi> Pſal. 119.176.

            <p n="3">3 What excuſe then ſhal our temporizers at this day haue, who albeit they be in their conſciences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted, expect not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome of them the reſolution and determination of a general councel to bee reſolued: others ſome aſſurance of peace, before they wil ſhew themſelues and returne vnto the flock?

But ſaie theſe kindes of people; ſome, <hi>I am no cleark.</hi> Deſire therefore and labour to be one.

What muſt we do then? That which the ſpouſe here teacheth vs. We muſt take a good and holy courage vnto vs, and goe farther. For in the end we ſhal meete with Ieſus Chriſt. But wil he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend viſible from heauen to make himſelfe to be ſeene? No, for hee hath alreadie deſcended, and hath withdrawen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vp againe into heauen vntill the latter daie, in reſpect of his corporall preſence, yet notwithſtanding hee continueth with his by his quickening power to the end and conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. But where is he in a word? Verily there whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſendeth vs, namely in his ſcriptures, as wee declared at large the laſt Thurſdaie, which aunſwere Abraham alſo made vnto that rich damned wretch, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29.

confeſſe that we haue herein a great aduantage aboue this ſpouſe conſidering the time when ſhe ſpake thus: the light of the Scriptures or writings of the Apoſtles, being farre greater without compariſon then that of the Prophets, as is moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſet downe vnto vs and declared, in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, and by the ſimilitude of the body, and of the ſhadowe which the Apoſtle vſeth, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.17. But they reply again &amp; ſay, <hi>euerie one we heare dispute, alleageth the Scriptures for himſelfe: what ſhall we then doe hereupon</hi>? Mary firſt looke diligently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, whether it be true that euerie one alleageth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For if I ſhould ſay that a great number of lies &amp; forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be found in the writings of our aduerſaries, alleaging moſt falſely for Scripture that which is no more found in anie booke of the Bible, then Paradiſe is in Hell, I ſhould not lie at all. Secondly we muſt note that they are no leſſe falſe-ſaiers then the reſt, who for proofe of their doctrine, alleage any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonies, ouer and beſides the aboue named ſcriptures and writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, vnto whom wee are no leſſe forbidden to adde, then to change and diminiſh, ſeeing <hi>they containe the whole Counſell of God touching our ſaluation</hi> Ioh. 15.15. and <hi>Act.</hi> 20.27. And to the end no man reply, <hi>that al was not written which the Apoſtles taught:</hi> let vs anſwere this lie firſt with that which is ſaid, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. where Saint Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing, beſides the ſcripture, <hi>to make the man of God perfect &amp; complete.</hi> Secondly let theſe goodly <hi>vnwritten doctrines and verities</hi> forſooth be compared with the ſcriptures, and the day wil condemne this darckeneſſe. Thirdly, alwaies and as often as there are diuerſe interpretations found of one and the ſame place, let vs know that this commeth to paſſe, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euerie one hath not one and the ſame meaſure of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and partly becauſe the ſcripture is ſo plentifull in all trueth, that of one and from one only place, a man may drawe diuerſe expoſitions, which may be al of them notwithſtanding conformable vnto the trueth of edification, &amp; euerie of which may as occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerueth be profitable.

them be falſe, then if we conferre other places therewith, &amp; ſo expound Scripture by Scripture, as Ieſus Chriſt teacheth vs by his own example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6.7. &amp; as the ancient Councels haue doone (hauing by this only moſt true and moſt aſſured means conuinced al ſorts of falſe allegations of heretickes) &amp; if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al we refer the whole vnto the correſpondencie of the articles of our faith, which we call our <hi>Creede,</hi> the ſummary abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euery fundamentall point of Chriſtian doctrine &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there is no man can bee deceiued, no not the ſimpleſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diots of all, except they will needs deceiue themſelues: I mean if ſo be they bring with them a docible and teacheable mind, and a deſire to bee taught in all humility, according vnto that which is ſaid of the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.8. &amp; <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.1. And thus you ſee how folowing the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the true Spouſe, that is, <hi>ſearching Ieſus Chriſt in his owne home,</hi> we ſhal find him, &amp; neuer be deceiued.</p>

            <p n="5">5 But wee muſt yet better examine all the woordes of this ſo true and faithfull a ſpouſe. <hi>I found him,</hi> ſaith ſhee, <hi>whom my ſoule loueth</hi>; yea, becauſe he made himſelfe to be found, and for that the true loue of the Bridegroome ſerued for a guide to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this ſpouſe, whom himſelfe loued firſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>I ſeazed or laid hold on him.</hi> And with what arm? Verily with that of <hi>faith,</hi> for this is the only veſſell to receiue him in, this is the onely hande to take hold of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30. But this faith muſt be firme &amp; ſtedfaſt to holde him without letting of him goe, otherwiſe this is not that true faith which is <hi>the gift of god,</hi> properly belonging vnto the elect &amp; irreuocable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.29. but an opinion which vaniſheth away, with the firſt wind that bloweth: which maketh vs in ſome ſort to taſt the good gift of god, not to ſwallow it down &amp; digeſt it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21.</p>
            <p n="7">7 And howe is this faith and by it Ieſus Chriſt continued &amp; mantained in vs?

               <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.23. and in this ſenſe ſhe hath no <hi>Mother,</hi> but one hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father alone.

In which ſenſe a man may ſay that <hi>the Church of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> (&amp; not that of Rome) hath brought forth al the churches: the word of god (which is <hi>the incorruptible ſeed,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.23.) proceeding and comming from her, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.3. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto this ſenſe alſo is it, that this ſpouſe which is but one &amp; perpetual in her generality, is (according as the one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth the other vnto the Lord) diſtinguiſhed into an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent church vnder the law, &amp; into a chriſtian church which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded it: &amp; according vnto this maner of ſpeaking, the church of our time hath for her <hi>Mother the church</hi> which we cal <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</hi> What is it then which this ſpouſe, conſidered as it were in the time of Dauid, meant to ſay and to teach vs in this place? Namely this, that after thoſe troubles &amp; diſorders which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſo many times in the time of the Iudges &amp; of Saul, ſhee hath as it were found her bridegroome &amp; is moſt happily reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him vnto her mothers houſe, that is to ſay, hath now the full knowledge and enioying of her Bridegroome, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming herſelfe vnto the true auncient Church of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arcks, ruled &amp; ordered afterward by the Lawe, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered her vnto the Lord. For it is in the church of God that this Bridegroome doth raigne &amp; that we enioy his graces and bleſſings, the greateſt part of the worlde remaining vnder the tyranny of him who is called <hi>the Prince of darcknes &amp; curſednes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 Let our aduerſaries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; gainſaiers reproch vs no longer that we attribute nothing vnto the church. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe we auow &amp; proteſt that the Apoſtolick church is <hi>our mother,</hi> in the which the holy ghoſt hath in his time begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs &amp; nurſed vs,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1883:178"/>
as he yet nouriſheth vs. The controuerſie then between them and vs lieth not in this point, <hi>whether there be any ſaluation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church,</hi> and <hi>whether the Church bee our mother in whoſe chamber we muſt liue and abide as her true children:</hi> for hereof wee make no doubt. But this is the whole controuerſie, namelie, whether they be the true Church, or rather the clean contrary a falſe ſtrumpet, which hath driuen <hi>the true mother</hi> out of dores into the deſerts, and bereaued her of her children, which ſhee demaundeth of her againe, and which this true ſpouſes Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome maketh her to reſtore and deliuer euery day.</p>
            <p n="9">9 But yet there ariſeth one, naie two difficulties more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter. For firſt if this Bridegrome be found no where but in his Church, and this Church is <hi>our mother,</hi> how can it be that this ſpouſe found him without? For how may it bee ſaide that ſhe brought him in into this houſe, if he were ther already and that ſhe found him there? The anſwere is, that it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that this Bridegroome dwelleth, that is to ſay, declareth his vertue and healthful power in this houſe. But it followeth not thereupon that he goeth not foorth, as I may ſay, vntil hee find his children euen in the boſom of this back-ſliding whore (as in our time he hath fetched them and yet fetcheth them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, out of theſe ſinckes of monaſteries) to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe. So hee went out of Ieruſalem, and ſent into the Eaſt and Weſt to cal vs, to make vs to draw near vnto him, vs, I ſaie, which were poore Gentiles and nothing leſſe then his people, to bring vs into his admirable light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 12.12. And thus you ſee how <hi>this spouſe found her Bridegroome abroad,</hi> from whom ſhe was, as we haue moſt amply declared before, ſtraied aſide and wandered.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The other difficulty ariſeth vpon this manner of ſpeach <hi>that the spouſe cauſed her Bridgroom to enter into her mothers houſe,</hi> ſeeing on the contrarie ſide, it is the Bridegrome, who ſeeketh after vs and findeth vs, and bringeth vs in into his houſe. This is moſt true, and we muſt doe God this honor, to confeſſe that it is he, who according vnto his infinite goodneſſe, as he hath deſtinated vs vnto ſaluation in his ſonne before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:1883:179"/>
of the woorlde, ſo doth he in his time preuent vs, ſeeking after vs al when we are ſtraied, &amp; finding vs when wee are fled from him, and bringing vs into his houſe, which is alſo the dwelling place and habitation of our good and holy <hi>Mother.</hi> But this is after ſuch a manner notwithſtanding, that wee are not all this while like blockes and tronckes, which a man fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth &amp; carrieth whither he wil, without anie feeling or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in themſelues. God then ſeeketh after vs, forming in vs the deſire to ſeeke after him: he findeth vs giuing vs the meanes &amp; the power to find him: we take hold of him and embrace him meeting with him, bicauſe he createth in vs the faith which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hold of him: he bringeth vs into the houſe of our mother, beſtowing on vs the grace of deſiring to ioine our ſelues vnto the company of the true church neuer to ſtir or depart from it. Theſe two things then agree very wel together, prouided, that we adde this, that as God produceth in vs natural effectes by natural cauſes which he hath created in vs: ſo, if the queſtion bee of theſe graces which are meerely ſupernaturall (ſeeing <hi>fleſhe and bloode reueale not theſe thinges vnto vs,</hi> Matth. 16.17. naie <hi>our naturall wiſedome is enmitte vnto God,</hi> Rom. 8) wee muſt voutch and confeſſe that the puritie of vnderſtanding and vprightneſſe of will are the meere free giftes and graces of him who <hi>enlighteneth the eyes of our vnderſtanding,</hi> Epheſi. 1.8. and <hi>createth in vs both to will and to doe,</hi> Philip. 2.13. So that if this propoſition and ſentence bee true, when wee ſpeake of the creation of the woorlde, that it made not it ſelfe, and that a dead bodie raiſeth not himſelfe: ſo is it as true, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being of the light of the ſoule, be it in the vnderſtanding or vprightnes of wil, that <hi>we are truely the woorkmanſhip of God by his meere and only grace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1.5.10.</p>
            <p n="11">11 There remaineth yet one point more to be handled tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this place, namely, concerning that which is here ſaide, <hi>both of the houſe, as alſo of the chamber of this mother,</hi> a thing which ought to bee well and throughly weighed of them who deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the holy publicke aſſemblie eſtabliſhed from al time by the Lorde in his Church, and without the which, as I maie ſo
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1883:179"/>
ſaie, <hi>the Church</hi> (which is as much to ſay as <hi>an aſſembly called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of the woorld</hi>) is no Church: as a flocke hath no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant forme of a flock, if the ſheep remaine ſcattered one from another. I ſpeak here of the contemners of congregations and aſſemblies, as we haue among vs <hi>Sundaie and Thurſday Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> naie ſome from <hi>Communion</hi> to <hi>Communion:</hi> &amp; others which make no reckoning at al of them, wicked wretches and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inexcuſeable before God and before men. There are others and too too manie, ſome of them making no conſcience to betake themſelues into the midſt of Idolaters, following here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Lots fault: others who neuer come forth, &amp; being reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; accuſed for not giuing teſtimonie of their Chriſtianity, inſteed of confeſſing their weaknes and infirmity, or their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt and couetouſnes, beare themſelues in hand they doe wel enough in reading at home in their houſe &amp; praying a part by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. But the Apoſtle exhorteth them in another la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, <hi>forſake not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>our aſſembly as the manner of ſome is,</hi> Heb. 10.25. And indeed if this pretence might take place, muſt we not condemne the Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp; other martyrs of the lord for madme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſenſeles? But behold how wily ſatan is to diuide this body in peeces, which can neuer bee ioined ynough togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; vnited. And indeed the end of ſuch goodly <hi>priuate chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> maketh vs at the laſt to know their faire domeſtical exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe they practiſe at home: which wee neede not to maruell at, ſeeing that euen thoſe who are moſt diligent to freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies &amp; congregations, where they are reproued, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, comforted, taught, ſtirred vp &amp; heated euery day, leaue not for al that to be cold, lazy, &amp; negligent in their duety. Let vs therefore note heere, my bretheren, in Gods name, that the ſpouſe proteſteth ſhe came with her Bridegroome not onely <hi>into the houſe,</hi> but which is more, <hi>into the Chamber of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> What ſhal we ſaie then of thoſe who wil not ſet foote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>houſe,</hi> and think to keep themſelues without with Ieſus Chriſt? But yet it is not enough to bee in the <hi>houſe,</hi> but we muſt enter into the <hi>priuy Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber</hi> &amp; wardrob of this ſpouſe. For ſuch a one may be in the houſe which is not in it, and who entred
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:1883:180"/>
not in, but to come foorth ſtraite waies againe. But <hi>to enter into the chamber of this mother,</hi> is to bee in the place of her reſt, and where ſhe cauſeth her ſelfe to bee ſeene and heard, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing there her children with the <hi>bread of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12 Now ſith our good God amiddeſt ſo manie tempeſtes, which haue ouerwhelmed and deſtroied the woorld, &amp; which haue within theſe few yeares borne and beaten downe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly Churches, the mother and her children beeing ſo cruelly driuen forth, hath vouchſafed vs ſo great and ſingular a benefite, to preſerue vnto vs this little cabbin, aſſaulted with ſo many wild &amp; cruel beaſts, ſhal we alwaies contemn ſo great a grace and bleſſing and ſo long a patience of his?

               <hi>Touch not mine annointed,</hi> Pſalm. 105.15. So that no ſacrilegious perſon, no not among the Paynims and worſhippers of falſe Gods had euer his wickedneſſe vnreuenged: and Aegypt and Babylon caried not farre the outrages they committed againſt the people of God. In a woord, it is not without cauſe that the head ſpeaking of his members cryed from heauen, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me</hi>? Act. 9.4. But heere the matter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſpirituall bleſſinges, and the proper and peculiar treaſure of the Church, namelie, the enioying of the Bridegroome in his woord, and the gouernment of his houſe. Pharao woulde needes ſeeke to hinder the children of Iſrael from this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, firſt ſimplie, afterwarde by certaine conditions. Wee ſee what it coſt him. The Aſſyrians and Chaldaeans, who ruined the Temple, and deſtroyed the Cittie, fared no better. So ſped the Kinges of Perſia who hindered the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Contrariwiſe God bleſſed in carnall and woorldly things Alexander the great, who bare himſelfe otherwiſe, how am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious a Paynim ſo euer he were. His ſucceſſours the Kinges both of Syria and of AEgypt, maie ſerue vs for example heerein both on the one ſide and on the other, according as they fauoured with al peace and tranquillitie this mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this Bridegroome and ſpouſe, or otherwiſe endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hinder it. Thoſe two Romane Captaynes, Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and Pompee, who were the firſt which ſpoyled the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God (although it were then moſt vilanouſlie pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by the gardiens and keepers of it themſelues) peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſo exemplarilie and wretchedlie, that hee is blinde who perceiueth it not. The third who was Titus eſcaped no better. And the Romane empire, when God had ſerued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with it to reuenge the vnthankfulneſſe of his people, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre againſt this ſpouſe, neuer ceaſed ſince to bee the executioner and hang-man of itſelfe, vntil it fell in peeces.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The beaſt mowled and faſhioned vpon this Empyre, againſt which monſter wee are ſtill in combate at this daie, wil ſaie as much againſt vs, putting her ſelfe in the place of this ſpouſe. But wee haue two peremptorie replies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

The one, that all hiſtories make contrarie proofe heereof, if wee iudge thereof not by the beginning of a falſe proſperity, but by the iſſue and ende of houſes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies which haue fauoured this beaſt, on whom the horrible iudgement of god hath finally bin brought. The other, that by the iuſt permiſſion of God the prince of this world muſt keep ſome promiſe with his ſeruantes, whom he telleth euery daie ſhewing them the kingdomes of this world, <hi>Al theſe wil I giue you if you wil fal downe and worſhip me:</hi> and therefore they, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to that which Chriſt aunſwered him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.9. take him at his woord, and become his ſeruantes. But ſuch a maſter fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in the end to pay ſuch ſeruants their wages. And if we haue but eies to ſee the examples of our time which haue been ſhewed vpon the greateſt of Chriſtendome both in the Eaſt, Weaſt, North, and South, wee ſhall not neede to ſearch anie auncient recordes for this matter. Such is then this gallaunt and holie confidence of the ſpouſe to braue her enemies, in whoſe perſon the Apoſtle ſpeaking, wee ſee how hee dealt with Elymas, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.10. howe he defieth all creatures, high, middle, lowe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. how hee beareth downe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie high thing which preſumeth to make head againſt God, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.5. And indeede what power is there of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narcke whatſoeuer which can vaunt of this promiſe: <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you bind on earth ſhall bee bound in heauen?</hi> Matth. 6.19.

Whereupon a man maie firſt of all demaund, what perſonage is brought in in this place.

It is therefore the Bridegroome which ſpeaketh, diſcourſing and talking with his ſpouſe <hi>in her Mothers Chamber,</hi> and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieng

with her the graces and bleſſings which himſelfe had beſtowed on her. And this very changing of the perſon (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he turneth his ſpeech ſo, as if he ſpake to a third perſon although hee ſpake to her herſelfe) hath a marueilous grace. Neither muſt we take this for a queſtion or demaund, as if the Bridegroome asked and enquired after one which hee knewe not: but we muſt take it as a kinde of admiration, touching the goodly comelines and grace of this ſpouſe. He compareth her therefore <hi>vnto a pillar which is high and ſtreight as were the palmes or date trees of that countrie: a pillar,</hi> Iſay, <hi>of a vapour or fume moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting countermount from the mountaines of the deſert or wilderneſſe,</hi> which vapour hee alſo ſaith to proceed from hence, that the ſpouſe <hi>is ſo perfumed with al ſortes of excellent odors,</hi> that the fume thereof mounteth, as I may ſay vp vnto heauen, whereof wee ſhal ſpeake anon. Such the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, which ſeemeth to haue beene borowed from this, that a multitude marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and comming from any place reſembleth as it were a clowde, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. For how euer this ſpouſe be brought in, ſpeaking in this Canticle as it were one perſon onely, it hindereth not for all that, but that the whole company of the faithfull and beleeuing be vnderſtood by her perſon, ioyned together notwithſtanding in one bodie, and quickened by one and the ſame ſpirit, as it is deſcribed vnto vs, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32.</p>

And yet we muſt confeſſe that many euen among theſe, keeping no meane or meaſure, neither in their ſolitude, nor in their auſterity of life, did both themſelues and the Churches great wrong.

Salomon therefore in this place repreſenteth vnto vs this Bridegroome, the true and only peace-maker between god &amp; his beloued as he is expreſly called <hi>the prince of peace,</hi> Eſa. 9.6. &amp; his <hi>bed</hi> at this day is the whole vniuerſal world whereſoeuer he is knowen &amp; acknowleged of the elect gathered out of the four corners of world, as the ſame was declared vnto S.

            <p n="11">11 The ſpouſe after this, to ſhewe vs that it is there and no where elſe that we muſt ſeeke after and find the true repoſe &amp; reſt, as it is declared vnto vs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. &amp; that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſafe &amp; aſſured then this reſt, addeth that this <hi>bed is enuironed &amp; compaſſed with</hi> 60. <hi>valiant men of Iſrael: and who beſides their prowes and courage haue alſo experience, to hinder that nothing fal out by night, which may hinder the fruite of this reſt.</hi> Now that which we try &amp; experience euerie day ſheweth vs, howe not only profitable, but altogether neceſſary this doctrine is. For what is one of the chiefe and principall cauſes of this, that ſo few men giue themſelues vnto this reſt, and that ſo few conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it?

ſhould be eaſily ſurpreſſed &amp; haue their throates cut.

But what ſaith the Lord? <hi>Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeene, thou haſt beleeued: but bleſſed are they who haue not ſeene, and yet haue beleeued.</hi> Ioh. 20.29. In the meane while we do al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that God alone is almightie, yea that none hath any power but of him, as himſelfe ſaid vnto Pilate, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.11. But why doe we not ad, that it is in his Church that hee truely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaieth and ſheweth forth indeede and moſt mightily this power of his? Becauſe there are very few which haue learned throughly to beleeue that God is almighty, a friende and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of ſuch as bee his, and that it cannot be that the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome ſuffer any one of them to periſh, whom the father hath giuen him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.9.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Now touching this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of 60. we are not ſcrupulouſly to ſtand vpon it, albeit that they who haue written of numbers obſerue in this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber a ſpecial perfection, for which cauſe the Aſtrologers did eſpecially chuſe it for the eaſier &amp; readier cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating their degrees &amp; minutes: ſeeing a man may find in it without any fraction or broken nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber a moity or halfe, which is thirty, a third which is twenty, a fourth which is fifteene, a fifth which is twelue, a ſixth which is ten: all which numbers are found quoted in that materiall Temple built by Salomon, except the fifth which is the number of twelue.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1883:186"/>
of the olde as of the newe teſtament, excluding the two latter Epiſtles attributed vnto S.

            <p n="13">13 But what are theſe of the gard? They are firſt of all <hi>the Angels which pitch their campe about al thoſe who feare God,</hi> Pſal. 34.8.

But eſpecially becauſe our chiefeſt enemies, are <hi>not fleſhe and bloode,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. that is to ſay viſible enemies, but that great lion which ſeeketh to deuoure vs, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. and ſo many wicked and damnable affections, which are bredde and borne with vs: and becauſe we are to fight euery houre and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie moment by the vertue of the ſpirit of God, to come vnto this eternall reſt which is heere repreſented vs by this <hi>bedde,</hi> which we yet poſſeſſe not but by hope: therefore it is againſt theſe eſpeciallie that wee are to bee aſſiſted and aided with our ſpirituall &amp; inuincible armour &amp; weapons. Who are then <hi>theſe threeſcore ſouldiars,</hi> in this reſpect? They are truely theſe couragious and valiaunt rutters and olde ſouldiers, renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for their infinite victories againſt Satan and his angels, hauing all of them his ſworde vpon his thighe, nay alreadie drawen in his hande, to fruſtrate and breake whatſoeuer the enemies of our ſaluation can enterpriſe or take in hande. Such were Abraham, Iſaack, and Iacob, and ſo manie legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of braue and valiaunt ſouldiers, whoſe valiaunt acts are regiſtred and recited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Such were thoſe ſo many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and truſtie Captaines, whom neither Satan, nor any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeat ſhewe of falſe wiſedome whatſoeuer, nor any wiles,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1883:186"/>
nor any cruelty of all the woorlde could withſtand or hinder from erecting and ſetting vp their trophees and ſignes of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory throughout the world: and building this holy Citty the foundation whereof they haue laid prepared by the Prophets 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. But ſome man wil ſay: theſe are dead a great while ſince, and howe then ſhall they be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs at this day? Exceeding well and moſt aſſuredlie, not by their merites (for as a good auncient father, and he a verie learned Biſhop of Rome hath very well ſaide, <hi>The Saints gaue not, but receiued crownes of righteouſnes</hi>) nor by their interceſſions in heauen. For <hi>wee haue there one onely mediator both of redemption and of interceſsion, which is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1. Tim. 2.5. Heb. 1.25. 1. Ioh. 2.1. And al theſe merites and prayers whereof the falſe Paſtors make themſelues treaſurers, and diſpenſers of them for ready mony, are nothing elſe but ſo manie buyinges and ſellings of ſoules: a merchandize moſt abominable before the Lord. But behold how theſe valiaunt captaines are yet at this daie our defenders. Firſt by their examples, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. And therefore one among them and he of the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antſt and truſtie ſouldiours was bold to ſaie, <hi>Bee yee followers of me as I am of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.1.

I meane the holy ſcriptures vttered to the penne of the Prophets by the holy Ghoſt, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and yet in more greater aboundance and with greater efficacy deliuered vnto the Apoſtles, in whoſe writinges are to be found al theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons ſet in order and prepared for euery one that wil vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, taking them &amp; learning the vſe of them, from the hands of the true Paſtors and diſpenſers of them.

            <p n="14">
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:1883:187"/>14 But aboue al let vs ſeeke after our ſtrength and force where it is, to wit, in that great <hi>Salomon,</hi> of whom all the reſt is but an inſtrument: who beeing come, and hauing made the combate, and vanquiſhed all his enimies by his ſufferinges in reſpect of the aſſault which was giuen him, in as much as hee entred the combate for vs: and maſtring in vs from daie to day by his holy ſpirite theſe ſame enemies which are ſtill ſtirring within vs, what haue wee longer to feare, to bee there with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted?

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the <hi>bed</hi> of the Bridegroome we haue already ſpoken, nowe there is heere made a moſt magnificent deſcription of his <hi>Coch,</hi> according vnto the whole frame and building thereof: whereas concerning the <hi>bed</hi> there is no ſpeech but in generall, and <hi>of the gard about it.</hi> The reaſon thereof is, becauſe that to ſay the truth that repoſe &amp; reſt which is figured vnto vs by that <hi>bed,</hi> in which the Bridegroome doth yet ſtay for &amp; expect his ſpouſe, there to reſt with him for euer in perpetual bliſſe &amp; felicity, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. is yet vnknowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, naie is incomprehenſible, hauing receiued nothing yet but the pledges thereof: but the <hi>Coch</hi> repreſenting vnto vs the holy miniſtery of the word of truth and of life, ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knowen vnto vs, that it may bee ſet vp and vſed among vs. Moreouer in that the <hi>Coch</hi> is added vnto the <hi>bed,</hi> it ſheweth vs, if we conſider of the ancient couenant, that the bridegrome had in ſuch ſort erected and ſet vp his <hi>bed</hi> in that Temple, and the ſeat of his kingdome in Ieruſalem, where he ſaid he made his dwelling place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13.14. that notwithſtanding hee woulde make, as it were, his progreſſe throughout the whole country, for which cauſe not onely the Citties of the Prieſtes, but the families alſo of the Leuites, were diſperſed heere and there throughout the whole country, as the ſacred hiſtory ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs. But it was indeed eſpecially vnder the new couenant ratified by the comming of the Bridegroome, that he indeed walked and made his progreſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt in perſon throughout the whole countrie, ceaſing neither daie nor night, preaching vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woorld the ioyful tidinges of the perfourmance and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the promiſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. and the true yeare of Iubilee to be put in the poſſeſſion of our true heritage, <hi>Eſai,</hi> 61. and ſending after his aſcending aboue the heauens his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and after them Paſtors and Doctors <hi>for the gathering togither of his elect from all the foure corners of the world,</hi> Eph. 4.11. But this miniſtery being in ſuch ſort polluted by litle and litle
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:1883:188"/>
for many hundreds of yeares, that in the end this <hi>Coch</hi> of the Bridegrome was made the throne of the whore which ſitteth vpon the ſeuen hils, the Bridegroome hath in our time after ſo long an interruption reſtored it againe &amp; hauing harniſhed it anew &amp; ioyned his horſes vnto it, hath trauerſed a great part of the world in it, to enlighten the eies of the blind, as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets faine that the ſunne guiding his chariot from Eaſt to weſt giueth his ſhining light vnto the worlde. Such is then this Coch, the deſcription whereof, we are more nearly, and more particularly to conſider of.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Firſt therefore it is ſaid <hi>that Salomon himſelfe made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe this Coche,</hi> to teach vs, that whether wee conſider the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of truth, for the publiſhing &amp; making knowen whereof this <hi>Coche</hi> was made: or whether we regarde the whole furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and direction thereof, it is he that muſt ſet downe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and as I may ſay the Carpenterſhip: he muſt pinne it and fit it throughout, and he muſt after teach the Cochemen the manner and order how he will haue it ruled and gouerned. Wherein there is a double fault co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. The firſt is in them, who will build &amp; frame this <hi>Coche</hi> after their owne fancie and appetite, keeping themſelues no farther then liketh them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ordinaunces and preſcriptions of the bridegrome: the other is in them, who confeſſe indeede that as for the manner and faſhion of this <hi>Coche</hi> in generall conſidered, there muſt be nothing but that which is correſpondent vnto the patterne which the bridegrome himſelfe hath left vs, not in chalk one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in liuely picture and pourtraite in his holy ſcriptures. But for the direction of this <hi>Coche,</hi> ſome are of opinion that they muſt followe the ancient cuſtomes of the fathers, taking away onlie ſuch abuſes as afterwardes came in: others thinke that becauſe of the contrarietie of circumſtances of places, times, and perſons, God hath left it in the power and libertie of the Churches to appoint and ordaine the whole ordering, according as they iudge it to be expedient: prouided alwaies they tend vnto the right end and marke they ought. And the grounde of all this is that God doth it as it were by himſelfe
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1883:189"/>
which he doth by the miniſterie of them whom he ſetteth a worke in his name, whether they be Paſtors, or chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. I allow well of this ground, for otherwiſe what ſhall be ſaide of the auncient Church which went before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Bridegrome in perſon, and of the Church, which followed the aſcenſion of the Lord into heauen, &amp; which ſhal continue vnto his ſecond comming in perſon? And he that would gainſay, &amp; contradict this, ſhould find himſelfe conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the whole ſcripture: but I deny the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which are drawen from hence. Now to aunſwer diſtinctly of both theſe points, I meane, that of doctrine, and afterward that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the gouernement of the Church: I ſay touching the firſt, that being a thing moſt notorious <hi>that fleſh and bloud,</hi> Mat. 16.17. (that is to ſay, the ſpirite of man ſuch as it commeth into this world, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile or comprehend that which is the onely and true foundation of the doctrine of ſaluation,</hi> that is to ſay, of that which is neceſſarily, &amp; abſolutely neceſſarie vnto the ſaluation of all ſuch as are of yeares of diſcretion, as the <hi>Creede of Athanaſius</hi> doth witnes, and the articles alſo of our <hi>Creede called the Apoſtles Creede,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ſummarie abridgement of the whole doctrine taught by the Apoſtles: it followeth that we muſt draw all this truth from the mouth of the Lord himſelf, who hauing ſpoken vnto the fathers in a certain meaſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. hath finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto the whole world whatſoeuer is requiſite vnto our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.15. Firſt by the preaching of his Apoſtles, who were moſt faithfully &amp; perfectly taught, yea extraordinarily, &amp; who haue with like faithfulnes executed their charge, not onely in ſpeaking, but alſo in writing, in ſuch ſort that it is a mere phreaſy to imagin that they haue omitted to preach by mouth, or to ſet down in writing any one point of the doctrin of ſaluation. Our aduerſaries reply at this day hereupon &amp; ſay, that though happily the Apoſtles haue taught al, yet haue they not written all. But when we demaund them what the pointes then are of doctrine which they haue omitted in their writings, they ſtick faſt as a man would ſay in the glue-pot. For
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1883:189"/>
either nothing of that which they alleage appertaineth vnto doctrin &amp; the articles of faith: or els it is ſuch as maybe proued to haue been forged by this man or by that man, being a thing eaſie to quote the inuenters thereof &amp; the beginning: or els it ſhalbe found to agree no better with the articles of our faith which are the extract of the whole eſſentiall doctrine of the Apoſtles, then light with darknes, falſhood with truth. I know they are too wiſe to confeſſe thus much. But beſides that theſe thinges haue beene ſo often diſputed and clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that we may ſay with <hi>ſaint Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. that <hi>if they be obſcure and hidden, it is vnto them who will not heare them ſpoken of, or whoſe eies the prince of this worlde hath blinded</hi>: we haue alwaies offered and doe ſtill offer to ſhewe and proue them to the eie before a true and Chriſtian councell.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I ſay the ſame touching the whole eſtate of the houſe of the bridegrome, namely, that by theſe ſame Apoſtles he hath fully ſet vp &amp; appointed both the vocations &amp; charges thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, as alſo the exerciſe of them in that which concerneth the ſubſtaunce of the gouernement of his family: in ſuch ſort that it is more lawfull to change, diminiſh, or ad any thing in theſe vocations then in the doctrine, the application &amp; execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely of the ſaide charges and vocations, being onely left free, according vnto the circumſtaunce of places, times &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ordered alwaies after one faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe of the neceſſary diuerſity of them. So did Moſes order himſelf as <hi>a faithfull ſeruant in the houſe of God,</hi> hauing done nothing but <hi>according to the patterne which he had ſeene in the mount,</hi> Heb. 3.2. &amp; 8.5. In which afterward nothing was chaunged or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the true Prophets, but when it pleaſed god to erect his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, &amp; to ſet vp the whole building &amp; ordering of the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall charges thereof: which was ordained by the Lord by the mouth of Dauid &amp; effected by Salomon, &amp; yet this eſtate was not to endure, but vntill the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of <hi>the Lord &amp; maſter of the houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.6. who afterward by his holy ſpirit <hi>ledde his Apoſtles into al truth,</hi> Ioh. 16.7. <hi>who withhold &amp; hid nothing thereof, but haue declared and opened all the counſell of God,</hi> Act. 20.27.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:1883:190"/>
yea left in writing to continew vnto the end and conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. Whereupon it followeth, that that which is cuſtomarily, and commonly alleadged, to wit, that the maſter holdeth it for done, which is done by his workemen, cannot haue any place in this matter, I meane, neither in the doctrine, nor in the generall, and fundamentall eſtate of the houſe of God, to attribute thereby vnto the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, any power and aucthoritie, of chaunging, adding vnto, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing any thing, either in the one, or in the other. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the Apoſtles haue left nothing to be ſet vp by their ſucceſſours, but haue themſelues taught and eſtabliſhed all things, hauing left nothing to the Paſtors, Doctors, Elders, Deacons, but to gouerne them-ſelues, and their flockes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto this rule and foundation, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. without adding to any new thing, or clipping therefrom, or changing ought, the <hi>Coche,</hi> God be thanked, of this bridegrome being of an other building then is <hi>ſaint Peters Church at Rome,</hi> a true fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of falſe religion, in which there is alwaies ſome thing to be amended, added, or chaunged. And therefore they who began firſt not to content themſelues with ſuch ordinaunces, as were truely Apoſtolicall, witneſſed by their writings, what end thereof ſo euer they had, and what occaſion ſo euer they pretended, opened the gap to all that confuſion &amp; deſolation, whereunto the Church of God was by little &amp; little moſt piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully brought. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this point, it is the bridegrome himſelf, &amp; our only &amp; true Salomon, who hath diuiſed &amp; built this <hi>Coch</hi> by his truſty &amp; faithful Cochwrights, &amp; Carpenters.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But why is this houſe which is ſo ſtrong and ſtable, that it preuaileth againſt hel-gates it ſelfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18. compared here vnto a <hi>Coche</hi> which is made to go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place? We haue already yeelded the reaſon therof, to which ye ſhall adde this which I will farther tell you. It is to ſhewe vs how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wittingly they abuſe them-ſelues, who dreame that God hath tied his truth vnto one ſole place, or See, which men in our time haue perſwaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be the See of Rome: in ſo much that ſome are become ſo blockiſh blind as to think
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:1883:190"/>
that <hi>the Catholicke &amp; Apoſtolicke Church, &amp; the Romane Church is all one,</hi> adding this word vnto the Apoſtles &amp; Nicene Creed: a thing as improper &amp; abſurd, what reply ſoeuer be made to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſay, that <hi>the head of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were al one:</hi> though we ſhould grant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the See of Rome, ſuch as it is at this day, were not only the true Church, but which is more, the head of al particular Churches. Let vs therefore note that this true <hi>Coche</hi> is there found, where this Bridegroome is purely preached, both in reſpect of his perſon, and in regard of his office: without matching him or ouer-matching him with a companion either ſuperior, <hi>as they do who pray the virgine Mary to command her ſonne:</hi> or collateral, <hi>as they doe who cal the ſame vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine their aide and their hope:</hi> or elſe inferiour, <hi>as they doe who call vpon the Saintes abſent, or vpon the deade.</hi> But ſome man will ſay, <hi>Is there then no certaine viſible place, on which the Chriſtians ought to depend &amp; ſtay themſelues, to ſay, we muſt beleeue and do that which is taught and commaunded in ſuch a place</hi>? Ieſus Chriſt beeing asked the ſame queſtion, anſwereth not, that it is Rome,, or any other place.

But how many breaches &amp; interruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were there, in ſuch ſort that the temple was ſhut vp, &amp; finally razed, afterwards repaired, after that moſt vilanouſly polluted &amp; defiled? I demaund therefore, where was then this catholick See, yea &amp; whileſt it ſtood were we to conclude as they do at this day who cal themſelues Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Romanes, the high-Prieſt is the ſucceſſor of Aaron, &amp; therefore he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>noter, &amp; we muſt beleeue &amp; do whatſoeuer is taught &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by the catholicke church of Ieruſalem?

            <p n="5">5 But can it be ſhewen by the Scripture or by any teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woorthy of credit that Ieſus Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in the world one certaine place or catholick See, that is to ſay, where an head ſhuld be ſeated hauing autority ouer al the particular churches of the world?

vp of it according vnto the forme and pattern which himſelfe &amp; no other hath deuiſed: &amp; giuing the name of <hi>Coch</hi> vnto this eccleſiaſtical gouernment, he hath declared that hee woulde not make it abiding for euer in one place, but hath vſed and doth vſe, &amp; ſhal vſe it vnto the end of the world, tranſporting it according vnto his good and holy wil &amp; pleaſure, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It remaineth we conſider by peece-meale the building of this <hi>Coch,</hi> according as the peeces thereof are ſet downe vnto vs in this place. This diſcription therefore beginneth firſt with the matter wherewith the bodie of the <hi>Coch</hi> is built, namely <hi>of the wood of Liban,</hi> that is to ſaie of Cedar, this tree hauing this property, that it is as a man would ſay incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. This is it which I haue alreadie declared vpon the laſt verſe of the firſt Chapter, to witte, that thereby thus much is declared vnto vs, that this holy and ſacred gouernement is inuincible, both in reſpect of time and of men. The reaſon is if wee conſider the generalitie of the Church, becauſe the kingdome of this Bridegrome is euerlaſting, as the father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33. reaching it ſelfe and as it were walking from one end of the world vnto the other, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.8. &amp; lifting it ſelfe vp in the end aboue the heauens, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.2. As alſo if we conſider of euerie member of the church, which are as it were ſo many perſons placed and conducted in this <hi>Coch,</hi> not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can periſh, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.39. &amp; 18.9. What do you then ſhall I ſay men or diuels, who ſeek to ouerturn this <hi>Coch</hi>? Who indeuor to hinder it in his courſe? Nay, who deuiſe by al meanes to pull it in peeces? Alas poore caitifes, it is <hi>of the wood of Liban,</hi> which reſiſteth al aſſaults. You doe nothing but runne your heads againſt the mountaine, and are no wiſer then your predeceſſors, who are daſhed in peeces, and yet the mountain continueth ſtill firme and ſtable. This <hi>Coche</hi> reſiſteth iron, and therefore wil turne the edge of your ſwordes. The fire cannot conſume it, but purgeth it and maketh it more bright and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.

vs, ſeeing the graue doth nothing elſe but refine our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to bee afterwarde clad with incorruption, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42. Where ſhal then our place of refuge be in a time of ſo great &amp; ſo rough ſtormes? In this <hi>Coch,</hi> my breethren, in this <hi>Coche</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wing and protection of the mightieſt of mighties, and no where elſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The ſpouſe hauing ſpoken of the matter of this <hi>Coche,</hi> commeth <hi>vnto the Pillers</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>are of ſiluer, and made by this King Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And what are <hi>theſe Pillers</hi> els but ſuch as God hath choſen and giuen to be the principal peeces of the <hi>Coche,</hi> and whoſe miniſtery he vſeth for maintaining and preſeruing of it, as <hi>the Pillars</hi> vnder-prop and ſtay vp the building? I mean the Prophets and Apoſtles as the principall maſter-builders, and as it were the hande of this king to put this <hi>Coche</hi> in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: as the Paſtours and Doctors finding it ready made, as we haue aboue declared, are put in truſt to maintaine and keepe it whole in al his parts and peeces, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 41. And this is the cauſe why the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the Church is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi> Ephe. 2.20. becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles receiued this grace to haue ended that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had as it were hewed out and ſquared: as it is ſaide, that <hi>the wall of the City deſcending from heauen had twelue foundations, and in them the names of the twelue Apoſtles,</hi> Apoc. 21.14. &amp; how is this, but that yet at this day the true Church hath no other obiect of her faith then the doctrine taught by the faithfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of the Lord? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. But, ſome man wil ſay, is there then any more then one foundation of the church and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment thereof? No truely. But there are moe laiers of the foundation, but there is but one foundation only. If we reſpect then the worke of euery foundation-laier, we ſhal finde, that there are ſo many foundations, that is to ſay, ſo many founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion works as there are foundation-laiers, one working here, &amp; an other there: as in the reſtauration and building vp againe of the Cittie of the terreſtriall Ieruſalem, euerie one wrought in his quarter but al was one and the ſame wall vpon the olde foundation, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. and 3. Here we haue then the definition
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:1883:193"/>
of <hi>the truely Catholicke Church,</hi> namely that it is it for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof euery Apoſtle hath built for his part, by one &amp; the ſame doctrine founded vpon one ſole foundation, one and the ſame Church: none of the builders beeing maſter aboue his felowe-builder, although Nehemiah as Lieutenant of the king gouerned the whole, as a faithfull magiſtrate ought to procure aboue al things, that God raigne and beare rule in the midſt of the people whom he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto his charge. And therefore here was no principality which men haue falſly attributed &amp; giuen vnto S. Pet. but he wrought mightily as the others did in his charge and quarter. In this ſenſe therefore it is that we muſt vnderſtand theſe twelue foundations, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-layers: only we muſt take heed how we ſay that S. Paul, who notwithſtanding built more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. &amp; Barnabas were forgotten in the viſion of S. Iohn. For the whole book of the Apocalypſe declareth that the forms there of ſpeaking are applied &amp; fitted to the manner of the Iudaical common-weale: in which becauſe there were 12. tribes, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of 12. gates, and 12. foundation-laiers only.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And to the end that this may more clearely appeare in this allegoricall deſcription, let vs note that theſe <hi>Pillars</hi> haue two ends or extremes, the one belowe, the other aboue. The baſe or lower end is ſuſtained by the bottome of the <hi>Coche,</hi> the top or vpper end by the vaut of the <hi>couering.</hi> Theſe <hi>pillars</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not they properly which hold and beare vp the <hi>coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> but onely becauſe themſelues haue their baſes, and are ſuſtained vpon the bottom. And this is alſo the cauſe why it is ſaid, that <hi>they are of ſiluer: but the bottome is of gold.</hi> Firſt, becauſe <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is truely the only foundation ſtone,</hi> 1. Cor. 3.11. Eſa. 28.16. ſuſtaining and bearing vp the whole by his only force and power, and therefore moſt rightly compared to the moſt fair, precious, &amp; firme mettall. Secondly becauſe it pleaſeth him of his good will, and not of any neede he hath of them to ſerue himſelfe with <hi>theſe pillers of ſiluer,</hi> in aſmuch as hee hath giuen an efficacie vnto their miniſtery, and doth yet ſuſtaine at this day his <hi>Coche,</hi> I meane, <hi>the gathering together of his Saints</hi> by the

vigor of his ſpirit which he laieth open in the heart of his, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.12. their writings beeing preached in all theſe places, whither it pleaſeth him to guide and conduct his <hi>Coche,</hi> retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alway this principle &amp; maxima, that <hi>he which planteth, &amp; he which watereth,</hi> (which are <hi>theſe pillers of ſiluer) are nothing,</hi> to wit, beſide the planting &amp; watering, according vnto the force which is giuen them to plant &amp; to water: <hi>but he is all in all who giueth the increaſe,</hi> to wit, <hi>the bottome and ground of gold,</hi> to thoſe who are well planted and watered vpon him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.</p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>The couering of this Coch,</hi> ſaith the ſpouſe, <hi>was made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by this King Salomon,</hi> which ſheweth vnto vs the proceeding &amp; power of God, couering from his heauen &amp; azured throne his poore children, expoſed otherwiſe vnto al iniuries of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtormes and tempeſtes. And this is a leſſon infinite manie times repeated &amp; reiterated in the Scripture: &amp; namely, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91.1. where it is ſaid, that, <hi>who ſo dwelleth in the ſecret of the moſt high, ſhal abide vnder the ſhadowe of the almightie.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15. <hi>The eies of the Lorde are vpon the righteous, &amp; his eares are attentiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their cry.</hi> And Pſal. 121.4. <hi>The gard and watch-man of Iſraell wil neuer ſlumber nor ſleepe. The ſunne ſhal not burne thee by day, nor the moone by night.</hi> Which thing the children of Iſrael did viſibly experience, being defended by day by the cloud in the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſert, &amp; by night by the piller of fire. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1. <hi>He that truſteth in the Lord, ſtandeth faſt and is for euer aſſured, as the mount Sion, which ſhaketh not.</hi> In a word the whole Scripture is full of ſuch ſentences. And beſides the Scriptures wee haue thereof continuall experience, ſeeing that euen thoſe whom a man would take to be vtterly forſaken are the firſt &amp; the beſt prouided for &amp; aſſured. But this <hi>couering</hi> is not ſeene but with the eies of faith, as it is ſaid of Moſes, <hi>that he ſaw him which was inuiſible, He.</hi> 11.27. Albeit theſe viſible heauens might ſerue vs therunto, ſith their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued ſtability &amp; ſo wel ordered courſe are as it were engraued teſtimonies, of the infinit might &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lord, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.1. &amp; 119.89.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But alas behold for a certain our iudgement &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely that the moſt part of vs, who vaunt our ſelues to be
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:1883:194"/>
the reformed Church, that is to ſay, receiued into and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by this <hi>Coche</hi> into paradiſe, beleeue not neither <hi>the pillars,</hi> nor <hi>the bottom,</hi> nor <hi>the couering</hi> thereof. For if it be true that the doctrine, which wee (who are choſen by the great mercie of the Lord for the doing of this) preach vnto you, is the onely &amp; true obiect of faith, why are we not beleeued, either when we teach, or when we comfort, or when we reprehend? If we be beleeued, wherefore doth euerie one make vnto himſelfe his particular ground &amp; reſting ſtaffe? And how ſo wil ſome man ſay? For this were to play the parts of Idolaters and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men. And are not you ſuch yee couetous mizers, who haue nothing before your eies but gaine? I ſpeake vnto you mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts, who knowe ſo well to make your commodity by the riſing &amp; falling of crowns to the loſſe of your poor neighbors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who knowe your cabala ſo well to make your profit rather by ſelling for time, then for ready mony, making 9. pecks of 1. bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel. I ſpeak vnto you vſurers &amp; white wolues (though there be ſome who begin very young) who vnder coulour of aiding &amp; helping your neighbor make it your trade to liue by, &amp; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich your ſelues by the neceſſity of another. Out vpon you cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, wil you be alwaies with vs as it were in this <hi>Coch,</hi> to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne not only the <hi>Coch,</hi> but your ſelues &amp; vs too? To ſay it in a word, ſo manie trickes of cloſe conueyance &amp; deceit, ſo many left &amp; ſiniſter means raigning &amp; ſwaying in the middeſt of vs, how loud ſo euer wee cry out againſt them in the pulpit, and what Lawes ſoeuer bee prouided and eſtabliſhed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are ſufficient teſtimonies that we yet beleeue not neither <hi>bottome</hi> nor <hi>couering</hi> of this <hi>Coch:</hi> as if wee neuer had yet heard any ſpeech thereof. And what ſhal I ſaie of ſo many renegants &amp; Apoſtates, ſome vpon a iollity of minde, others vpon feare, who haue finally hardned themſelues ſo far as to put out both their own and others eies? Let vs here remember <hi>the net which gathereth the good and bad fiſh,</hi> Matth. 13.27. which appertaineth alſo vnto this <hi>Coch:</hi> as alſo him who was <hi>found at the marriage feaſt without his marriage garment.</hi> The ſcandale is great, yet <hi>ſo it muſt bee, but curſed bee they who are guiltie thereof.</hi> Matth.

11.8. <hi>There muſt alſo bee hereſies, that they which are currant may bee knowen,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.19. But let vs preach God that we bee not of this number, being vpheld &amp; ſtaied vpright by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that looking down we ſtay our ſelues vpon this <hi>bottom and ground of pure golde,</hi> which is our only foundation, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp we muſt caſt our ancre on that throne where the ſame Lord and maſter of ours doth ſit diuerſly conſidered, I meane, as he ſuſtaineth vs below to lift vs vp togither vnto himſelfe in euerlaſting life, and preſeruing from aboue that which is here below for a time.</p>
            <p n="11">11 There remaineth the ornament of the in-ſide of this <hi>Coch</hi> which the ſpouſe ſaith to bee <hi>adorned,</hi> that is as a man would ſaie, <hi>tapiſtred with the dilection of the Daughters of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> that is to ſaie with <hi>hiſtories painted, or rather engraued in the holy ſcriptures,</hi> which teſtify vnto vs the infinit dilection which this true Salomon bare vnto his Ieruſalem. This allegorie is founded hereupon, that from all times great Lordes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are wont to adorne the hals of their houſe, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and horſelitters with clothes of tapiſtry, or paintinges, or or carued hiſtories, as alſo their ſepulchers and monumentes. But eſpecially men are deſirous to haue and ſee the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits of ſuch perſonages as they beare affection vnto.

For beholde to what point the world is come. And as for theſe great religious men who merite both for themſelues &amp; others, alack how ill they be lodged in their royall and more then royall pallaces: alacke poore men how they are famiſhed, when the world fighteth who ſhall beſtow moſt vpon them, and their own mouth is neuer ſtopped not to demaund, or their hands ſo troubled with the gout, not to take and receiue whatſoeuer comes.

            <p n="3">3 If hereupon it be replied that there are ſome truly religious who go wolward and in haire, liue hardly and auſterely, whip and ſcourge themſelues in good earneſt: though we graunted them al this, and that they did an hundred times more then is reported of them, yet come they nothing neare Baals prieſtes who cutte and ſliced themſelues with raſors hauing crien out from morning vntill noone, whom Elias notwithſtanding with full mouth mocketh 3. <hi>Kings.</hi> 18.27. or the religious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetanes of diuers ſorts and faſhions.

away the ſuperſtitious diſtinction of daies and meates, we had forbidden men to faſt, to giue themſelues to praier and al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes: not as if we had commaunded euery day to eate fiſh and fleſh. We ſay therefore in ſumme, that for a man to feed his horſe moderately, yea to make him to faſt, when, and ſo as need requireth (for fearing leaſt fatted at too much eaſe, he waxe headſtrong and fall to kicking and flinging, in ſteede of carrying his rider well and quietly) is farre an other thing, then by hard and euill handling of him to make him vtterly vnprofitable, in ſuch ſort that he fainteth &amp; falleth flat vnder a man, or cannot but with much adoe, ſet one foote before an other, when a man would vſe him. Moreouer we ad that it is an vniuſt and intolerable thing to make the rules of ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes certaine and generall, which thing was neuer appointed by the word of God, nor practiſed in the chriſtian Church ſo long as it continued in her puritie, ſeeing that vnder the yoke of the law it ſelfe there was but one faſting day appointed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be obſerued euery yeare. I ad further, that whereas the beſt &amp; the moſt excellenteſt works which the holy Ghoſt worketh in thoſe who are moſt holy, cannot be taken in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for ſatiſfaction of our gilt, or payment of our ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: it is a moſt abhominable error to thinke to gaine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe by eating or not eating by marying or not marying, by eating fleſh or eating fiſh. But I confeſſe I doe the world great wrong to enter into diſpute of ſuch thinges againſt them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whoſe vnchaſt &amp; gluttenous Epicurian life the heauen and the earth demaund iuſtice at Gods hand. Leauing them therefore to be carried in their Coch in full gallop to the place aſſigned them, I referre them by the way vnto that which all the Prophets haue written againſt the hypocrites and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries of their time, and vnto that which the Lord himſelfe ſaith in ſo many places of the Euangeliſtes, and ſaint Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. ſpeaking of that which was for a time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the commandement of God himſelf, who hath not buried Moſes to make place for humane traditions, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.23. 1. <hi>Timot.</hi> 4.3.8.</p>

But God did ſpeedily prouide for it, hauing raized a faithful Cocher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting himſelfe, I meane Dauid that great Prophet and king, who hauing conquered and afterward prepared Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, raiſed vp to honor, and ſo farre fauoured of God as to be called his Cittie, his Houſe, his Reſt, and hauing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally prouided &amp; diſpoſed all the furniture of this <hi>Coche,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired as it were all a-new, hee left for ſucceſſour the chiefe builder thereof, namely his ſonne Salomon, who brought this excellent woorcke vnto an ende with ſuch direction, wiſedome, and magnificencie, that there was neuer ſeene among the Kinges of this world the like thing, beeing in this reſpect the figure of the true Salomon, King of peace, and Lorde and eternall ſonne of Dauid.

But what? If wee conſider well of all wee ſhall finde the cleane contrary. For ſo farre is it that they who ſeeme to haue hadde this aduauntage might vaunt them-ſelues of thoſe victories, that contrariewiſe it is the King himſelfe who ledde and conducted and ſette him-ſelfe his enemies a worke, not to ouerthrowe

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT which we haue already lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as wel of the matter as of the building and adorning of the <hi>Coche Royall,</hi> ought to cauſe vs to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the excellency thereof.

For firſt ſeeing <hi>eternall life conſiſteth in the knowledge of the father in his ſonne whom he hath giuen vs,</hi> Ioh. 17.3. &amp; Satan ceaſeth not to preſent vnto the world counterfeit Ieſuſſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.5. &amp; ſo by conſequent falſe Churches, there is nothing more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie then throughly to know and take marks of the true Ieſus Chriſt, and his true ſpouſe. Secondly there are not a few men who care neither for Ieſus Chriſt nor the Church as they ought to care for and eſteeme them, becauſe they do not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly know of what valew the one and the other is: in ſuch ſort that ſuch maner of people are eaſily enticed an other way by the vaine appearance of the world dazeling them ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one ſort, others after an other, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. beſides that this <hi>King</hi> and this <hi>Queene</hi> conſidered with the eies of fleſh ſeem ſo foule and euill fauoured, men are loth to come too near them, ſo farre are they from being willing to keepe themſelues vnto them, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53.2.3. &amp; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9.13. And therefore it is not without cauſe that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.14. it is ſaid, that <hi>this beauty is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:1883:202"/>
which thing we are diligently and particularly to conſider. Let vs therefore conſider firſt the perſon which ſpeaketh, then to whom ſhe ſpeaketh, and afterward how and whereof ſhee ſpeaketh, to the end we may make our profit the better by it. For this was not written for one day, but that this voice ſhould ring night &amp; day in our eares, pearcing euen <hi>vnto the diuiſion of the ſoule and of the spirite</hi>: Heb. 4.12. It is therefore the ſpouſe which ſpeaketh and which ought to be heard of vs vnder pain of beeing reckoned &amp; accounted among profane perſons and publicanes, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17 &amp; <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But becauſe this authoritie of the true Church hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Satans turne at all times, in transferring it vnto the falſe, we muſt therefore withall conſider what this true ſpouſe is, to take heede the better of her which boroweth her name. It is therefore ſhe not which entiſeth men vnto her ſelfe, as harlots doe, but inciteth them to <hi>contemplate her Bridegrome,</hi> yea and that crowned, as anon by Gods grace wee will handle.</p>
            <p n="3">3 She ſpeaketh vnto <hi>the daughters of Syon,</hi> that is to ſay, vnto them whom God hath vouchſafed this fauour to ſend vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meſſage of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether they receiue it as they ought, to become as it were members of this ſpouſe who calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the aſſembly and myſticall bodie of the beleeuing: or whether they make themſelues vnworthy of the grace which God offereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is ſignified vnto vs in the parable of the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.14. in which we muſt note that which is there ſaid that all they who were inuited began with one accord to excuſe themſelues, though they tooke diuerſe excuſes, to ſhew vs that there is alſo aſwell a falſe Catholique Church, that is to ſay a Church generall agreeing in that which is ill, though they be diuided in opinions, as there is one true and only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, hearkening vnto with one accord this only &amp; true bridegrome. And this is the cauſe why I ſaide before that there are two ſortes of <hi>daughters of Syon,</hi> ſo called becauſe the terreſtriall Ieruſalem was the mother Cittie of the people of God. The one ſort therefore were as it were the waiting gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-women of this ſpouſe, to enter in after her by order, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:1883:202"/>
in companie vnto the marriadge banquet, as it is ſaide, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.15. The other were in the church but not of the church, &amp; being there as it were only to behold what was done there, or otherwiſe to doe their owne buſines, of which ſort I would to God we ſaw not ſo many of the like examples amongeſt vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Now to come vnto the third point, namely the better to vnderſtand of whom, and how this ſpouſe ſpeaketh, we muſt eſpecially waigh &amp; conſider her wordes. <hi>Come forth</hi> ſaith ſhe. And how ſo? For if <hi>Syon be</hi> the habitation of the Church, why ſhould a man <hi>come forth</hi> of it to behold the <hi>King</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath there choſen himſelfe his habitation? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. &amp; 132.15. I anſwere that this ſerueth not but for a ſharper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, to be corporally in <hi>Syon,</hi> if our affection be not there alſo, and that to haue our affection there is to goe forth of our ſelues, to ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I liue, howbeit no longer I, but Chriſt liueth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Moreouer when as Ieruſalem it ſelfe is for the moſt part polluted and defiled, &amp; the king is in this reſpect driuen forth and chaſed thence, a man muſt go forth if he will contemplate him, as in deede this <hi>King</hi> went forth, and hath raunſomed and redeemed vs, being crucified without the terreſtriall Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where we muſt alſo go forth after him, as the Apoſtle warneth vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.12. So this is then an other reaſon why we ſhould goe forth, whereof the ſpouſe in this place ſpeaketh, and this pollution is ſhewed vs by many examples. Pilate was within Ieruſalem as was alſo Herode, and yet ſo farre were they from knowing of Ieſus Chriſt though he were before their eies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the iuſtice of his cauſe, that contrariwiſe the one conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned him againſt his own conſcience, the other ſent him away with ignominie. Yea the very troupes and companies who the day of his entrance cryed ſo loud, <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> ceaſed not to cry the friday following, <hi>away with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> away with him, crucifie him.</hi> It is not therefore without cauſe, that it is ſaide vnto <hi>the daughters of Syon that they muſt come forth to contemplate this King crowned.</hi> And we haue at this day more neede then euer of this aduertiſement, the ſame belonging properly vnto vs which
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1883:203"/>
was ſaide vnto this ſpouſe her ſelfe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11. who now tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth her daughters the ſame leſſon, <hi>Forget thy people and thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe,</hi> as we are alſo bidden to doe: <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. And in what ſtate was <hi>Syon</hi> then when Babylon had planted her ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the very middeſt of <hi>Syon,</hi> as it hapned to the people, when <hi>Bethel</hi> was turned into <hi>Bethauen,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the houſe of God into the houſe of iniquitie,</hi> according vnto that which was foretold by Dauid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22. by <hi>Eſay.</hi> 28. by <hi>Ierem.</hi> 14.14. by <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in his whole 13. Chapter, by Ieſus Chriſt the maſter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.38. hauing driuen and that at two ſundry times out of the houſe of his father thoſe whom he calleth theeues, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.46. together with the buiers &amp; ſellers, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Math.</hi> 21.12. and who finally ſet fire in it &amp; left not a ſtone vpon a ſtone <hi>Math.</hi> 24.2. Now who can ſay that this viſible company was then the true Church and not rather directly oppoſed vnto it? And which therefore was not to be forſaken according vnto the commaundement of the Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.14. To depart with the Eagles thither, where the dead body was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.37. Now that the like ſhould come to paſſe in the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, and eſpecially in that o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

it is a thing vnpoſſible to ſerue Ieſus Chriſt and Baal, <hi>and there is no communion betweene light and darkneſſe,</hi> 2. Cor. 6.14. we muſt abandon &amp; forſake the kingdome of darkenes if we will ſee vnto ſaluation this king of light.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Come foorth</hi> therefore ſaith this Queene vnto her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But what to doe? For it is an eaſie thing to goe, naie to leap out of one miſchiefe into another.

            <p n="7">7 Behold therefore the reaſon why this Queene addeth, <hi>and contemplate the King Salomon.</hi> But we muſt know what it is to <hi>contemplate.</hi> It is not ſimplie to looke vpon a thing, as at the entrances of kings euery man getteth him vp into a windowe, or goeth out into the ſtreete to ſee him paſſe by, and after that there is an end. But <hi>to contemplate</hi> is rather an action of the mind then of the eies, when to take the thorough viewe of a thing &amp; perfectly to know it, a man looketh round about it &amp; peereth to the very bottome: which is ſaide of S. Peter when he came vnto the Sepulcher, and leaned his bodie downe into it to ſee throughly whether the body of the Lorde were there or no, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.12. Yea but will ſome man ſay, when theſe thinges were written, the <hi>king</hi> figured by Salomon was not yet viſible, ſeing he had not yet put on him our fleſh, &amp; yet ſtil at this day, hauing withdrawen himſelfe ſo far from vs ſhall not be ſeene vntill his latter comming. I confeſſe al this, &amp; I ſay farther that euen ſo long as he was in this world truely viſible and in ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and palpable fleſh, yea after his reſurrection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. ſo far is it notwithſtanding, that this viſible nature cauſed him to be knowen, that contrariwiſe to ſee him man as others, and ſo vile and contemptible without, was as it were a vaile ouer the eies of the beholders, hindering not only ſuch as were carnal, as they who called him <hi>Nazaren,</hi> Ioh. 1.47. and <hi>Carpenter the ſonne of a Carpenter,</hi> Mar. 6.3. and Herod who did nothing but mocke him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.11. but his diſciples alſo to ſee and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:1883:204"/>
either his maieſty, or that which we ought principally to ſeek after for our ſaluation, albeit his glory ſhined in his words and in his workes. And this is the cauſe why Ieſus Chriſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Philip, requeſting him that he would ſhew him his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.9. that <hi>it was expedient that he ſhould depart,</hi> Ioh. 16.7. It is therefore for the eies of the vnderſtanding enlightened by the ſpirit of God to found the ſecrets of God, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to make this <hi>King contemplated</hi> and knowen. But our outward ſenſes ſerue they to no purpoſe?

For if hee bee knowen and conceiued by faith, and faith is bred in vs by the hearing of the word, by the which he manifeſteth himſelfe vnto vs, <hi>Rom</hi> 10.7 it followeth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily that it is in the word of this king that wee muſt ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him and know him, who and what he is. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if faith be a vertue which hath his ſeat in the vnderſtanding, being there created by the vertue of the holy Ghoſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward maintained and encreaſed by the vſe of the viſible ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which the vnderſtanding ſeeth and conſidereth that which is ſignified and preſented vnto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it followeth that this apprehenſion and conſideration or contemplation be ſpiritual and not corporal, although the vnderſtanding be informed by that which it heareth in the word and ſeeth in the ſacraments. For if it were otherwiſe, what ſhould the faith of the fathers be, who went before his comming in the fleſh, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did ſo throughly <hi>contemplate</hi> him, that vnder other ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes they did eat the ſame meate, and drank the ſame drink with vs, being made partakers of this tru king Salomon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom there is neither faith nor eternall life, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3.4. So did our father Abraham ſee him in the circumciſion, which
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:1883:204"/>
was vnto him a ſigne and ſeal of his iuſtification by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. becauſe he embraced the word when hee was yet vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.10. So did the holy fathers ſee him &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him both in the promiſes hearde and receiued by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and in the ſhadowes of the ceremonial Law, of which this true Salomon was the ſubſtance, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. So the bleſſed virgine Marie before ſhe conceiued him eſſentially in her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal womb, conceiued him by the eare, receiuing by a true faith the word of the Angel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.38. as Elizabeth knew it by a Propheticall ſpirite, and praiſed her greatly for it, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.45.</p>
            <p n="8">8 This doth not hinder notwithſtanding but that they who liued in the time of his conuerſation among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; whoſe eies of their vnderſtanding the ſpirite did withall enlighten, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.18. and opened the eares of their hart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 16.14. were not aided and holpen to beleeue at the beginning, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confirmed in that which they alreadie beleeued, by that which they ſaw, heard, &amp; touched with the hand, as we ſee the ſame in Simeon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.28. in Anna the Propheteſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.38. in the Samaritanes of Sicher, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 42. and in the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. and 2.22. and 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. yet that which cauſeth faith to be bred in the vnderſtanding of the ſeers and hearers, is not the ſight nor the hearing of the bodie, but the action of the mind enlightened by the holie Ghoſt. And therefore ſaid the Apoſtle vnto the Epheſians (who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding neuer ſaw with their eies, or heard with their ears Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in perſon) <hi>Chriſt dwelleth in your heartes by faith:</hi> &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20.21. ſpeaking of the hearing touching the word which he had preached vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>yee haue not</hi> ſaith he <hi>ſo learned Ieſus Chriſt, if ſo bee yee haue heard him, and haue been taught by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9 Now to ſhew that this corporall ſight was not ordained to be alwaies the meane to know this king, but onely for that time he conuerſed among men in that viſible fleſh which hee carried vp into heauen, it appeareth both by many expreſſe textes of the Scripture, as alſo by neceſſarie conſequences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:1883:205"/>
thereupon, ſo wee preſuppoſe and agree vpon theſe three pointes. Firſt that the queſtion be in this place of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and not of his diuinity in it ſelfe, which hath alwaies been, is and ſhal bee inuiſible: ſecondly that Ieſus Chriſt hath taken vnto himſelf from the beginning and for euer an humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with al his proprieties, without which no body can bee a body: and thirdly that the eies haue an action bounded and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by which they cannot ſee (except it be by way of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) that which is not preſent, or which is ouer farre remoued from them. Behold therefore Ieſus Chriſt who ſaith expreſlie, reprehending and blaming the incredulity of Thomas, <hi>Happie are they which haue not ſeene and haue beleeued,</hi> Ioh. 20.29. And in another place, <hi>ye ſhal not alwaies haue me,</hi> Mat. 26.11. Ioh. 12.8. And Saint Paul, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>While we are ſtraungers</hi> ſaith he <hi>in this body, we are abſent from the lord.</hi> And Phil. 1.2. <hi>I deſire to be diſlodged and to be with Chriſt.</hi> And Coloſſ. 3.1. <hi>Seeke ye the things which are aboue where chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> And Saint Peter, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. <hi>the heauens muſt containe him vntill all thinges be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> In a word, as oft as it is ſaid that <hi>he goeth vnto the father</hi> (this beeing vnderſtoode of the departure of his humanity) ſo oft doth he witneſſe his abſence, as alſo ſo oft as hee ſaith <hi>that hee wilcome.</hi> For no man is ſaid to come vnto a place where hee is alreadie. And to thinke that the true bodie of <hi>this king</hi> is in his eſſence in anie part without poſſeſſing a place and beeing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in himſelfe, can bee no more done without transforming the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt into a ſpirituall eſſence, then it maie bee ſaide that his diuinity is circumſcribed within ſpace of place without transforming it into a corporal eſſence and being.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Let vs conclude therefore that this true Salomon in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his diuinitie cannot be ſeene with the eies, though he bee euery where eſſentially, and eſpecially in this humanitie which he hath vnited perſonallie, vnto himſelfe. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his humanity, it can at this daie bee no more ſeene of vs by our eies then his diuinity, not that it is in it ſelfe inuiſible (ſeeing that the celeſtiall glory hath not aboliſhed his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:1883:205"/>
nature, corporal and therefore material, viſible, and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according vnto his dimenſions) but becauſe he hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen it from vs aboue the heauens truely and properly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his returne in the later day. And therefore it is vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the vnderſtanding enlightened by the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and vnto faith (by which Saint Paul ſaith, <hi>hee dwelleth in our hearts</hi>) and vnto the inward eies, <hi>before which</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>this king is painted forth vnto vs,</hi> Galat. 3.1. that wee muſt referre this aduertiſement and warning of the ſpouſe, <hi>Come foorth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this King,</hi> to wit, in his word purely preached, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaking ſaid vnto the Corinthians, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>I haue begotten you in the Lord</hi>; and to the Galathians 4.19. <hi>I trauel again to bring you forth, vntil Chriſt be formed in you.</hi> And according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſenſe alſo is it that it is ſaid of the ſacraments, that is to ſaie, of the viſible ſigns adioined vnto the word, touching Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme that <hi>we put off the old man to put on Ieſus Chriſt in whom we are made new men,</hi> Galat. 3.17. and Coloſſ 3.9.10. and as touching his holy ſupper, that <hi>we eat his fleſh, and drinke his bloode.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11 Now this truth cannot be better vnderſtood &amp; known then by comparing it vnto the language of the Church of Rome at this daie, which vſurpeth the name of this ſpouſe, &amp; inuiteth alſo her companions to <hi>contemplate</hi> Ieſus, but God knoweth what Ieſus Chriſt, whereof we wil ſpeake anon. But where to <hi>contemplate</hi> him? In a painted and materiall Image of wood or of ſtone. And what ſhal I there ſee? His remembrance ſay theſe deepe contemplators. For that Image will tell you that he was crucified for ſinners. Iuſt. But firſt this manner of teaching is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expreſly by God in the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, &amp; elſewhere in infinite many places, and is ſuch as in the time of ſaint Ierome himſelfe was accounted execrable, as the Epiſtle of Epiphanius Biſhoppe of Cipers which hee tooke paines to tranſlate out of greeke into latin, to this effect, declareth. Farther, what ſhall it preuaile me to know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Ieſus Chriſt was crucified, if I knowe not what was the true cauſe of his death, the good that returneth to me thereby, and the meane to attaine vnto it? Now what can this
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:1883:206"/>
crucifixe teach mee of all this? For beſides the forme which is but a vain appearance, this crucifixe is nothing elſe but a dead and corruptible matter. But ſay they this is taught by word of mouth. Nothing leſſe. For if we conſider but of their Curates, Vicars, Priors, or Abbots, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Primates, Cardinals, &amp; eſpecially their chiefe head, euery one knoweth that not one among an hundred of them knoweth any more then doth the crucifixe of wood or ſtone. And they who know any thing what account make they of preaching? On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide if wee conſider of their ſeruice, as they call it, what is the people taught by it, ſith it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of nothing but of ſongs in an vnknowen tongue, beſide the Idolatries &amp; meere moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keries of God therein committed? For the reſt, if happily ſome wa let-brother open his mouth ſometimes in Aduent or in Lent, what is their doctrine els as we haue already many times ſhewed in the expoſition of this ſame Canticle, but ſo many blaſphemies againſt all the partes of the office of Ieſus Chriſt crucified? But beſides this, what thing is it elſe but to mocke God and all Chriſtendome, to ſay that they teach theſe things as they ought, and yet doe forbid the holy Scripture to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted or redde in the vulgar tongue, and ſuch as al Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vnderſtand? But there is yet more, for they teache that it is ſufficient vnto ſaluation to know that which their Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, without any farther enquiring or knowing what it is. And what meditation, I pray you, or contemplation can a man haue of that, of which he knoweth nothing, &amp; of which he is no whit bound to know any thing in ſpeciall? But prouided a man haue a good meaning and referre himſelfe to the articles of their faith, be it as be may, and kneele himſelfe down before a Crucifixe, or ſometimes ſeeke a great way for one when hee hath one hard by, or be as ready to ſay an <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> as a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſter</hi> (for indeede the one in this caſe is as good as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being as little vnderſtood of him that ſaith it, as it is heard of the Image before which he prayeth) behold a merite by and by atchieued, beholde the wrath of God very well appeazed. And how ſo? Is this to pray vnto God <hi>in spirite and truth,</hi> Ioh. 4.24.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1883:206"/>
to preſent our ſelues before him <hi>in faith, without the which a man cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. To beleue &amp; to be ignorant of a thing is this al one? Is this this <hi>faith by which we ſtand</hi>? 1. Cor. 16.13. <hi>by which we beate backe the fierie darts of our enemie?</hi> Eph. 6.16. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>in which we ought to continue grounded and ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi>? Coloſſ. 1.23. Is this that doctrine <hi>which we muſt meditate day and night,</hi> without inquiring after it or knowing it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. And if this be it, how ſhall we <hi>be ready to yeeld a reaſon thereof,</hi> according vnto the ordinance of the Apoſtle, when we neuer knewe what it meant? That is to ſay, how can wee giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that, for which we neuer made either ſpent or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? And who teacheth this leſſon? That doth ſaint Peter, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. And how is he the true ſucceſſor of ſaint Peter who not only knoweth ought himſelfe, but forbiddeth alſo and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from others the onely meane of executing that which S.

Are not theſe ſort of men rather thoſe of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, that <hi>they neither enter into the kingdome of heauen themſelues, nor ſuffer others to enter thereinto,</hi> Math. 23.13. in ſuch ſort that truely it may truely be ſaide, that their graund Porter carrieth not without cauſe two keyes, the one to ſhut vp Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe as much as lyeth in him, and the other to open hell vnto euery one that will goe thither? But let vs leaue theſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of wood and of ſtone, dead and dumbe as they be, which themſelues will haue called the preachers of Idiots: and let vs come vnto him whom they pretend to be perſonally and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this very king, as bigge and as great as he was hanging on the Croſſe. And what doth he ſay? Doth he teach? Doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort? Doth hee reprooue? Leſſe a great deale then the other, which ſeemeth to be that which he is not, where as this nether is, nor ſeemeth to be he, &amp; in deed if we beleeue them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues who make him, and who are ſo ſhameles in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges as to call themſelues the <hi>creators of their Creator,</hi> hee is not there to preach but to be ſacrificed &amp; offered, not without exceeding mockery, becauſe that he which offereth him doth eate him, and drinke him, leauing nothing at al vnto him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom hee ſaith that hee doth indeede and really offer him.

And yet this is the maine grounde, chiefe point and ſumme of their diuine ſeruice, and this is their owne language <hi>to lift vp God</hi> in reſpect of the actor, the prieſt: and <hi>to ſee God</hi> in reſpect of the looker on the people, or at leaſt to ſpeake more pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which they ſay, <hi>to lift vp Ieſus Chriſt</hi> and <hi>to ſee Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But they muſt ſhewe that which they doe both in wordes and in deede</p>
            <p n="12">12 But let vs get vs out of this mire, and praiſe God that he hath pulled vs out of it. And on the otherſide let vs employ diligently all our minde throughly to knowe, and as through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerue him who hath opened the eies of our minde &amp; our heart vnto this effect, that wee fall not into greater reproofe then they who faile in this point either of ignorance or of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; whereas the couetous conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate nothing elſe with their minde and eies but their riches, the fornicators are giuen vtterly ouer vnto their vncleanneſſe and wantonneſſe, hauing their eies full of adulteries and other infamous villanies, the gluttons think on nothing elſe but their good-cheare, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious nothing but on their pompe and vanities: and ſo on in the reſt: whereas al things which preſents it ſelfe before our eies, ought to drawe vs rather vnto that which all the worlde preacheth vnto vs, namely to conſider the wiſedome, power, and infinit bountie of ſuch a worke-man, and to dedicate and conſecrate vnto him both our ſoul and body in an acceptable ſacrifice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. It is not enough therefore to <hi>contemplate</hi> him, but wee muſt acknowledge him for ſuch a one as hee is, which is the end and ſcope whereunto all this contemplation ought to be referred. In a word we ought to confeſſe &amp; adore this King Salomon and that crowned. And with what crown? With that <hi>which his mother crowned him withall.</hi> And when? <hi>In the day of his fianſailes &amp; mirth.</hi> Let vs therefore conſider againe al theſe points directly.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Wee knowe well enough what this woorde of <hi>king</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, namely a ſoueraigne power ouer his ſubiects ordered with reaſon. And thus it is, that it is taken in this place, but yet with the differences which are between this <hi>king</hi> and al others
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:1883:207"/>
which haue bin, are, or ſhalbe euer in the world. All the other kinges therefore except this, are in ſuch ſort ſoueraigne ouer their ſubiects, that their countries are limited, the time of their dominion bounded, their power reacheth no farther then the body and goods, and all this with a charge and condition to yeald an account one day to him on high, who hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them in their thrones heere belowe. But <hi>this king,</hi> to the knowing and <hi>contemplating</hi> of whom we are in this place inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>hath all power in heauen and in earth,</hi> not onely becauſe hee is god coeternal &amp; coeſſential with his father, but alſo in aſmuch as he is man, vnto whom all gouernment is giuen ouer al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bee they high, middle, or lowe, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.27.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.9. and that for all eternitie <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</hi> 9.6. And not onely ouer the bodies, but ouer the ſoules alſo of his friends and true ſubiectes to defend them vnto the ende of the worlde, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. And finally to make them really his coheires in the euerlaſting kingdome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. And likewiſe ouer his enemies in the middeſt of whom hee raigneth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. Repreſſing them, chaſtiſing, deſtroying, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he knoweth to bee expedient for his glorie and for the ſaluation of his, as the whole ſacred hiſtorie doth witnes, waiting for his full victorie and dominion which is promiſed him of the father, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. It is therefore very true that this king in aſmuch as he is God with his father, hath altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him all power and all empire, yea ouer euery tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtate of this worlde, <hi>ſitting in the middeſt of Magiſtrates</hi> Pſal. 182. <hi>loſing and girding the collar and girdle of Princes,</hi> Iob. 12.18. <hi>As hee alſo demaundeth them an account of their gouernement,</hi> Pſal. 58.1. But here is mention made of a kingdome which is not like vnto them of this world, as the king hath himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.36. the one concerneth all men, the greateſt part whereof ſhall periſh by their owne fault, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.13. the other concerneth them who are eſpecially called the houſe of God, although there bee more which are called then choſen, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.16. In the one the queſtion is of the gouernement heere belowe which paſſeth no farther, in the other the caſe
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:1883:208"/>
is of the gouernement of the conſcience, reaching farther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this life. The one is temporall, the other is eternall: the one is ſenſuall, the other is ſpirituall: and if there be any thing viſiblie and corporally adminiſtred, it is to lead vs farther and beyond this worlde: the one is adminiſtred of God by the Magiſtrates whom he appointeth with power &amp; authoritie to make lawes and politicke ſtatutes according vnto that naturall equitie which he giueth them: in the other which concerneth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer ſoules, this authoritie is more high then that it may bee communicated vnto Angels themſelues. <hi>This King</hi> therefore hath alwaies beene, is, and ſhalbe hee, who bindeth the ſoules and conſciences, hauing reſerued this onely right vnto himſelfe: in ſo much that if an Angel from heauen ſhould ſay, I wil haue this to be law to bind the conſcience, we ought to haue him in execration, as attributing vnto himſelfe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God alone, ſeeking to raigne ouer his ſonne our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p n="14">14 And in this point is it alſo that the difference of theſe two kingdoms conſiſteth.

But as touching this ſpiritual regiment, the officers of <hi>this king</hi> haue no other power nor autority, but to declare and publiſh the ordinances which hee hath made, adioyning vnto them the promiſes and threats ſuch as he hath deliuered vnto them and left in writing, with the execution, either of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towardes the repentaunt, or of condemnation towardes the incorrigible rebels: but, in the name of <hi>this king</hi> according vnto the tenour of the commiſſion hee deliuered them, vnder paine of Nullity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. and all after a ſpirituall kinde of proceeding, exhorting and reprouing by the woord, and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and looſing by the ſame and no otherwiſe.

chriſtian magiſtrates they beeing alſo commaunded to doe homage vnto <hi>this king,</hi> Pſa. 2.12. they are alſo officers truly of this ſpirituall kingdome, yea principall ones, but not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto the aultar, as that proueth which happened to Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah otherwiſe a good king and zealous, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. but to arme with their authority the ſpiritual ordinances of this king, as did Dauid, Salomon, and their good ſucceſſours, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in due ſort ſuch as not willing to order themſelues vnto this king, &amp; deſpiſing his ſpiritual officers, ſeeke to ouerthrow the true ſeruice of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.

of their commiſſion, bearing theſe words, <hi>goe, teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe all thoſe things which I haue commaunded you?</hi> Shall wee ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that touching the ſubſtance of the eccleſiaſticall diſcipline and ſubſtantiall exerciſe of the holy miniſtery, by the which the ſonne of God will haue his houſe to be gouerned vntill his latter comming, that the holie Ghoſt taught not the Apoſtles al, or that they did not acquit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues faithfully of al, without omitting of any thing?

Paul, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. though it bee there eſpecially ſpoken of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the holy Supper, &amp; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.16. &amp; the verſes folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in which is contained whatſoeuer may be ſaid of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let vs beleeue Saint Peter alſo aduertiſing the paſtours expreſly (vnto the companie of whom hee ioyneth himſelfe not as a prelate, but as a companion, in the ſame miniſtery) <hi>to feede euerie one his flocke, not as hauing a lordſhip ouer the Lordes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, but that they be enſamples to the flocke,</hi> 1. Pet. 5.1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto S. Paul agreeing, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. proteſteth that he wil not ty and intangle any man. And thus you ſee what this name of <hi>king</hi> importeth in this place, ioyned alſo with the name of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, which ſignifieth as much as peaceable, &amp; is meant of the exerciſe of this kingdome in regard of this ſpouſe which is his Church, ouer which himſelfe alone hath power, quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, iuſtifieng and ſauing it, as it is hee alſo alone vnto whom ſhe yeeldeth al obedience in that which concerneth this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kingdome. It remaineth we conſider whether this king be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſuch a one as he is among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from whom we haue ſeparated our ſelues. Alas nothing leſſe. For he is no otherwiſe called <hi>King</hi> among them, then he was of thoſe who whipped him in Pilates iudgement-hal: not that I wil ſay that an infinit nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of poor people who wander without a ſhepheard haue the ſame meaning which they had, but becauſe that in effect it commeth al to one end. And to proue that this is ſo, let vs ſee whether they leaue vnto this king one ſole point of his roialty and regality, which is not violated by their doctrine. Firſt they ſay they haue a King Lieutenaunt Catholique and vniuerſall. Aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who this is, &amp; they wil anſwere you, he which ſitteth
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1883:209"/>
in the See of Rome. If you aske on what right: they aleage that for his right poſſeſſorie, there are ſo &amp; ſo many ages that they haue been in this poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as for their right petitorie, it is that ſame which was granted by the Lord vnto S. Peter. Now if we would but debate theſe allegations, it were an eaſie matter to ſhew that there was neuer ſuch impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie ether ſeen or heard to propoſe ſuch thinges. But though we preſuppoſed all this, that is to ſay, that darkenes were light, I demaund of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a lieuetenant of a king hath more authoritie then he who ſent him to keepe his place: &amp; if he haue not or cannot haue, I demand, whether ſhrowding him-ſelfe in this lieutenauntſhip with all manner violence and vnlawful practiſe, and being ſo deſperate &amp; preſumptuous that there is no manner falſifiyng of the will of his king which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth not openly, he may bee tolerated as lieutenaunt of the king, or whether he ought not to be charged of high treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt his head. Now, that he of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeake is ſuch a one, it appeareth firſt by this that it ſhall neuer be found that the degree Epiſcopall is of the lawe diuine, but of the law poſitiue, as we terme it, beſides that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may point out the beginning of it, ſo far is it that Ieſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſet vp an Epiſcopalitie vniuerſall. And heereof I call him whom they call the chiefe of the foure Doctors, for a formall witnes after the holy ſcripture. Secondly if wee will decide this matter by the auncient Canons which meant to bridle this degree Epiſcopall, wee ſhall finde (I ſpeake it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men) that there is neither Pope, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle or degree of that hieraticall cleargy, which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and degraded by their owne Canons. But let vs come vnto that which is done. Can any one denie me this, that this lieutenant attributeth vnto himſelfe this authority to bee iudged of no man, though hee ſhoulde carry whole cart-loades of ſoules vnto hel? If this bee denied, ſhall not a man finde it in the verie wordes of their decrees? But you who ſay you haue ſucceeded Saint Peter in his Lieuetenaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ought you to be ignorant that hee was reprehended and reprooued by Saint Paul in Antioch, and that publikely
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:1883:210"/>
in a matter concerning his Apoſtolique charge? Yea ſaith S. Paul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Becauſe he was to be reprehended, and that he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not with an vpright foote?</hi> Haue you alſo forgotten, or do you diſſemble that which the ſame S. Peter warneth the Paſtours <hi>not to beare rule ouer their flockes,</hi> becauſe they appertaine vnto the maſter and not vnto the ſeruants whoſe charge is limited? Paſſe we farder. Truly he whoſe lieutenant this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith he is, hath without reply to the contrarie all power both in heauen and in earth &amp; that by good right. For he cannot erre, neither in aſmuch as he is God, nor in aſmuch as he is man altogether perfit. And who can challenge vnto himſelfe this perfit know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vprightnes, but he muſt make himſelfe equall with God? But paſſe we yet farder. Theſe two points are moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cleare &amp; certaine, namely, that the lawe moral, which is nothing but a refreſhing and renewing of the lawe natural, which ſinne coulde not vtterly deſtroy out of the hart of man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. and likewiſe the new couenaunt ratified in and by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ought to bee kept inuiolable vnto the end &amp; conſummation of the world. How then would <hi>this king</hi> eſtabliſh a lieuetenant in the world vtterly to aboliſh both the one and the other? But becauſe this matter requireth a more ample diſcourſe, wee will refer the ſurpluſſage vntill the next weeke.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Be wee therefore heedefull, my brethren, to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies this voice of the true Church in our eares, <hi>Come forth ye daughters of Syon, and contemplate this king Salomon,</hi> and let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that we are not here to reſt our ſelues vpon theſe baſe and corruptible thinges, but to this end, that acknowledging <hi>this King,</hi> we conſecrate both ſoule and body vnto his ſeruice, and tend wholy vnto this end, praiſing him for that great grace hee hath vouchſafed vs to driue vs out of this thicke and palpable darkenes to behold him in his holy word: and let vs make this grace of his auaileable vnto vs to his honor and glorie, waiting for the nearer and clearer ſight of him in that heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which he hath prepared for vs before the foundation of the world. So be it.</p>

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:1883:211"/>
end and conſummation of the world: and this is it which wee are now againe to proue and handle. I ſay therefore that there are three waies of falſifying an inſtrument, namely by adding, by clipping away, or by chaunging, in ſuch ſort that the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth, whereof the queſtion is, receiueth thereby an alteration. Let vs then ſee now whether al theſe ſorts of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification haue not beene and yet are committed by him of whom we ſpake, and let vs beginne with the Law moral. The firſt commaundement forbiddeth vs to haue any other God then the only ſoueraine father, ſonne, and holy Ghoſt. Nowe what is it to haue any other thing for a mans God, but to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto it that which is properly belonging vnto this onely God, whether a man conceiue this opinion within himſelfe, which is inward Idolatry, or whether a man yeelde it any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeruice appertaining vnto God alone, which is outward Idolatry, both theſe two being abominable before God? Now then is not this to make of a creature, naie of a demi-creature a God, to perſwade a mans ſelfe that it heareth and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the woords and thoughts of men, abſent, from as farre as that which is aboue the higheſt heauens is remoued from the earth, and which is more, ſpeaking and thinking in one inſtant in an hundred thouſand diuers places? This property I ſay, of being euery where, and of knowing the thoughts, is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging vnto the diuine eſſence alone? Their reply is that this were indeede to make gods of creatures, if they ſaide that theſe creatures did heare and vnderſtand of themſelues that which is ſaid and done in an inſtant in their abſence, in ſo manie diuerſe places, and by ſo manie diuerſe perſons: but that this is giuen by Reuelation vnto the Sainctes which are dead: as wee ſee how Elizeus by Reuelation of Propheticall ſpirite, knewe and ſawe and hearde in his abſence, what his ſeruant Gehezi ſaid and did with Naaman the Syrian, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 5.26. And it ſeemeth that the like may be ſaid of Saint Peter in that which he diſcouered of Ananias &amp; Saphira, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.4. And thereupon they ſaie, that if God vouchſafed his ſeruantes this grace, remaining yet here below in the infirmity of their fleſh,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:1883:211"/>
howe ſhould hee not beſtowe much greater vpon them now when they are with him in glorie? And thus you ſee how the peoples eies be at this daie bleared, being not able to conſider that this whole reply is grounded vpon an imaginary &amp; fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical preſuppoſal. For as touching the meanes it pleaſeth God to vſe heere below for the edification and preſeruation of his Church, his word aſſureth it vs not only in general but alſo in ſpecial by the whole courſe of the ſacred hiſtorie: namely that it pleaſeth him to vſe the miniſtery of men as an ordinarie meanes and of Angels themſelues by viſions and commiſſions extraordinarie. And therefore it pleaſed him during the <hi>ABC</hi> of the law, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh vnto the Galathians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. to reueale vnto his ſeruants not only that which was ſaid and done heere &amp; there, but alſo things to come ſo far as he would vſe them in their charge &amp; vocation: but not that he euer gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſimply to know or vnderſtand either thoughts or al things preſent done &amp; ſaid in their abſence, but only the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſo far as he would imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſo it is that that excellent prophet Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Ki.</hi> 4.29. which thing we ſee to haue hapned vnto Nathan who was conſtrained, for going too far, to vnſay that which he had ſaid, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3.5. And when Elias thought that al was loſt in Iſrael, did hee not ſhewe that God reuealed him not al things? 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.10.18. But if we ſpeak of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gouernment, in what place of Scripture, by what exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſacred hiſtory, ſhall we finde this imaginarie commerce &amp; dealing of the liuing, with the ſpirits of the ſaintes departed this worlde, hauing finiſhed their courſe? For as touching the bleſſed Angels, we are taught that their charge hath bin and ſo continueth ſtill, to bee ſent and employed for thoſe effectes and purpoſes it pleaſeth God: but it followeth not therefore that they heare or know al things, neither ſhal wee euer find either commandement to call vpon them, or any example in the Scripture that euer they were called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any ſeruant of God, no not when they appeared vnto him. But we ſhall well find that it is not ſo lately that the <hi>Inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of angels</hi> was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the Apoſtle expreſly, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. Moreouer let vs ſee
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:1883:212"/>
what is the originall of this <hi>Inuocation of the Saintes departed,</hi> ſo il grounded. The ground therefore of it in a word is double, to wit, their <hi>Merits,</hi> &amp; their <hi>Interceſſion.</hi> Of their <hi>Interceſſion</hi> we wil afterwardes ſpeake by it ſelfe. As for their <hi>Merits,</hi> whence are they drawn? Not from the holy ſcriptures which oppoſe them directly vnto <hi>Grace,</hi> Rom. 4.1. But though a man ſhould grant them this, and that there had bin in thoſe perſonages a perfect obſeruation of the Lawe without any defect, thoſe who <hi>merit</hi> are they not ſufficiently ſatisfied and contented with the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they haue receiued, to witte, with eternal life, according vnto the tenour of the legal couenaunt, <hi>doe all theſe thinges and thou ſhalt liue?</hi> Whence cometh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt of the <hi>merits</hi> which they cal <hi>the treaſure of the Church,</hi> and of which they make eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie daie ſo great a merchandize and yet it is not exhauſted and ſpent? And if the Saintes, as they cal them, haue hadde ſo manie and ſuch plentie of <hi>merites</hi> that there is an infinite ſurpluſſage of them, what neede hadde they of thoſe of Ieſus Chriſt? Beſides this vnto whom haue they giuen that charge of diſtributing of them? Where and when and who paſſed the couenants of this bargaines? Beſides all this if it be true which is taught in the ſchooles, as it is moſt true that <hi>the merite of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which we onely approue, draweth his infinit vertue from the diuinity in which his humanitie is perſonally ſubſiſting, how can this ſame vertue be attributed to thoſe <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Saintes,</hi> though they rebate neuer ſo much from them, without attributing vnto them alſo ſome diuine nature? And what is it elſe but to adore the creatures to attribute vnto them an heauenly and diuine vertue and power? As the power to preſerue the ſoule or the body, to ſanctifie the ſpirite, nay to do forth ſinnes which the Iewes being more blind a greate deale, knewe to ſay that it appertained vnto God alone, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.21. What ſhall we then ſay of their holy water, ſpetle, holy waxe, holy bread, &amp; of their <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> &amp; other their traſhe? Finally who will excuſe the adoration of the Chriſme or holy oile ſo many times and ſo expreſſely reiterated in their Ceremonies? Who wil not maruel at their blaſphemy, that kneeling down
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:1883:212"/>
on their knees before a croſſe of woodde or other ſuch matter, they ſalute it and call it <hi>their onely hope</hi>? Neither will any gloſe ſerue here, that this is not ſaide vnto the croſſe, but vnto Ieſus Chriſt who is repreſented crucified there. For the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appeareth by their owne words, which are theſe, <hi>O Croſſe all haile, our onely hope in this time of the pasſion, the gibbet on which was hanged in fleſh the Creator of fleſh.</hi> And what more? Can the bleſſed virgine Mary be called <hi>Queene of heauen,</hi> without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this kingdome? <hi>Our Lady,</hi> without matching a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>the onely Lord? Our life, our hope, our ſweetenes,</hi> without placing her manifeſtly in the throne of the godhead? But (ô moſt horrible blaſphemie that euer was ſpewed forth!) can a man requeſt her, without degrading of Ieſus Chriſt, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſon of the father, <hi>ſhee pray</hi>: but in reſpect of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, that <hi>ſhe commaund him of her motherly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie</hi>? And yet notwithſtanding this is not onely ſaide, but ſong and howled forth in their temples: and who ſo findeth fault with this, he is an hereticke. I conclude therefore, that ther are in this church ſo many falſe gods as there be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſerued with a religious adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to ſay concerning directly the conſcience, and the diuine ſeruice dewe to one onely God the father, ſonne, and holy ghoſt: and as many as there be temples and altars conſecrated and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated vnto creatures: and how then can that Church bee the true and onely vniuerſall Church?</p>
            <p n="2">2 This firſt commandement which is the ground &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of al the reſt being ouerthrowen, what may a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of the reſt? As for the ſecond, containing two principall points, namely an expreſſe forbidding to make any likenes of any creature high, middle, or low in the cauſe of religion, or to do any reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will not ſay of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as of the other. For they haue gone a great deale farther in this then in the firſt, which albeit in effect they haue violated and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet haue they left him written as hee was by the hande of God. But as for this ſecond, ſeeing that if he remained there, painted Images and Statues muſt fall to ground, they haue ſo
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:1883:213"/>
intangled it with the firſt, that they haue finally eclipſed it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: a moſt intolerable preſumption, and inexcuſably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable, ſeeing that the Lord who engraued it as it were with his owne hande and without the miniſterie of man, declareth that not one ſole little letter of the law may not be blotted out <hi>Math.</hi> 5.18. So then already this fault, I meane this eclipſing of this commandement by thoſe of whom we ſpeake is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all excuſe. But how on the other ſide may the tranſgresſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof bee excuſed, when in their churches, chappels, ſtreetes, great places, in citties and in fields there are found ſo many neſts of ſtatues and all ſortes of Images? We know well their goodly replies, which yet are ſuch as vaniſh away like ſmoke at the leaſt word of this comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement. The true ſenſe thereof beſides that it is moſt cleare in it ſelf, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may it be better gathered then by that which hath beene generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the chriſtian Church for moe then three hundred yeares together? <hi>Images,</hi> ſay they, <hi>are the bookes of the common people.</hi> And what can ſuch dumb doctors teach, ſet vp and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed againſt the expreſſe commaundement of God, who hath not onely forbidden to adore and worſhip them, but to make them, I meane to haue them vſed in the matter of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And experience hath finally ſhewed why the Lord diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed this commaundement into two principall heades, to wit, firſt forbidding to make them, and after that to worſhippe them. And indeede ſince the firſt entering of Images into the Church, men haue for a long time confeſſed that there was no honour due vnto them, but when Idolatrie was once entered, then they ſaid that this honour was not done vnto the ſtatua or Image, but vnto him which was repreſented by the Image. A moſt falſe excuſe. For if it were ſo, why ſhoulde a man vſe more deuotion to one Image of the ſame ſaint, then vnto an other? And if this were the meaning of theſe worſhippers of Images, as they ſay it is, what other thing is this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to anſwer, that a man playeth not the Idolater with the Image, but with him whom the Image doth repreſent? I ſpeak in reſpect of the Images of he &amp; ſhee ſaints as they call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For who will dare
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:1883:213"/>
to ſay (but he ſhalbe conuicted by the whole ſcriptures) that if the virgine Mary, or the Apoſtles, &amp; by conſequent other true Saintes were aliue at this daie on earth, that they coulde ſuffer that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould kneele vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? That they ſhould offer vp can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould preſent incenſe before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould preach of their merits? Their whole doctrine and their whole life being clear contrary vnto it. I let paſſe to ſpeak of their ſetting out of theſe goodly ſtatues &amp; pictures of their <hi>our Ladies</hi> as they call them, clad in their ſommer and winter garmentes, of their virgins attired like ſhameles ſtrompets, of horſes, aſſes, dogs and ſwine which charge their altars among their ſaintes, of their tapers and lampes burning before their blind ſtatues, and other ſuch meere and inexcuſeable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, all which notwithſtanding is couered with the goodlie name of deuotion.

For this is now growen into a cuſtome. And as if the exerciſe of a Chriſtian were to doe nothing, vnder a coulour of deuotion, they could not content themſelues with two and fiftie ſundaies, but they muſt haue ſo manie holidaies added, that almoſt the third part of the yeare is paſſed awaie in ſuch idle feſtiual daies.

            <p n="10">10 As for the other kinde of the lawe concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diuine ſeruice, the ſpirite of errour hath done the cleane contrary, tending notwithſtanding vnto the ſame end. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aboliſhed the Lawe morall which ſhould notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be perpetual, he hath cleane contrarie found the meanes to eſtabliſh the Lawe ceremonial, knowing that Ieſus Chriſt had impoſed an end vnto it: and this deſſein of his hath he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by a marueilous ſleight, which hath deceaued thoſe of the better ſort. For if he would haue perſuaded them that hee woulde ſet Iudaiſme vp againe, or retained Paganiſme, men would haue openly withſtood him. And therfore he obiected that the great ſimplicity of the outwarde ſeruice of God both in the miniſterie of the word &amp; in the adminiſtration of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes would breede a contempt, and therefore it would bee good to haue ſome petite matters beſide, not that this ſhould be of the ſubſtance of the doctrin or of the ſacraments, but to make the thinges more commendable, and men more attentiue and deuout. This being once thought to be good by an efficacie of errour, hee added, that vſing withal ſome cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

of the Lawe not to Iudaize but to turne them vnto a a good vſe, &amp; doing the ſame ſoberly in certaine points like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without ſuperſtition or Idolatry, would be a meane to winne the Iewes and the Idolaters the eaſier vnto the true religion. Thence came holy-Water, ſquare-Caps, Surpliſſes, hoodes, bald crownes, chaunting of prick-ſong, altars, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of daies and of meates, with the reſt of the furniture of al that goodlie ceremonial ſeruice, as if God had impoſed an end vnto the legall ceremonies, of which himſelfe was the author, to giue authority, not vnto the Apoſtles (who neuer ordained, nor practiſed ſuch thinges, naie contrariwiſe eſtabliſhed and recommended the true and pure ſimplicity aſwel of doctrine as of eccleſiaſtical gouernement) but vnto them who ſhoulde come after them, to cut and clip off al at their pleaſure. If anie man will denie this, the ſight thereof diſcouereth the fact, if wee conferre their inuentions with Moſes and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane hiſtories. True it is that touching this point they want no allegations of certaine bookes forged at pleaſure, but ſo doltiſhlie written, that a man need go no farther for proofe of ſuch forgeries. And thus you ſee how the ſpirit of error by a iuſt iudgement of God hath ſerued his turne with the holie Lawe of God, for the deſtruction of men, and al vnder the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of eſtabliſhing of it and teaching the right vſe thereof: a thing moſt miraculous and wonderfull, how men could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo brutiſh as not to ſuffer a man to touch their ſore, ſo far are they from ſeeking after or deſiring to finde or receiue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p n="12">12 But touching the law morall the abuſe there of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moſt ſtraunge in this, that there is no one ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which hath not beene more openly ouerturned in Chriſtendome then euer it happened in the ſynagogue of the Iewes, as the reprehenſion which the lawe-giuer himſelfe maketh, doth witnes of them from point to point in ſaint Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew chap. 5.6.7. But the fault is yet more daungerous in that, that the vſe and ſcope there of is turned vpſide downe. Which thing hath beene ſo much handled by ſaint Paul, eſpecially in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:1883:216"/>
the epiſtle to the Romans and to the Galathians, that it cannot be but an inexcuſable reproch vnto them who call themſelues Chriſtians to diſpute of this point any more. In ſumme, the law ſheweth vs, will we or nil we, what we owe vnto God and neighbour, and that no man neither diſchargeth, nor is able to diſcharge his debt in this behalfe, being vtterly vndone and made vnpayable by the naturall corruption of mankinde, which thing notwithſtanding neither exempteth him out of debt, nor from the penalty adioyned vnto the contract, which is euerlaſting death. For to thinke that God renounceth his debt without entire paiment made, is to transforme God into man. This is then an inexcuſable follie to ſeeke after the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoule by the obligation of death, that is to ſay in the lawe morall, which argueth our condemnation, and which can vſe no other language vnto vs then his tenor importeth. And yet notwithſtanding this is the foundation of the hope giuen of finding in a mans owne merits, or thoſe of an other, (whereof a man may furniſhe himſelfe for ready money vnto the diſtributer) that which is found, as we will anon declare, in Ieſus Chriſt alone, hauing ſatisfied for vs, <hi>in carying our ſinnes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tree,</hi> 1.

A matter of ſo great conſequence, that there cannot fall out any different or controuerſie among men, which is more nearer to be looked vnto. I ſaie then that this dignity or rather maieſtie of this king, mediatour betweene God and his Church, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in three points, namely in his royal dominion, ſpirituall, and ſoueraine in his kingdome, yea ouer ſinne it ſelfe and ouer death: afterwards in the office and charge which he receaued, to be the true, and to ſpeake properly, the onely Prophet and declarer of the counſel of God touching the ſaluation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: and thirdly in his eternal prieſthood. Now not any one of theſe three pointes remaineth in his entire in the Church of Rome at this daie, which by conſequent is nothing leſſe then the true and only ſpouſe of this king. Which thing we wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to open &amp; make plaine vnto you, howbeit ſummarily, bicauſe the ſame hath bin already handled at large by vs vpon the firſt chapter of this Canticle.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But theſe words of <hi>the king crowned,</hi> leading vs againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and for that this point can neuer be too oft declared and handled, we will enter again moſt willingly into it.

As for his prophetical ſoueraigne authoritie, by the ſpirit of whom all the auncient prophets ſpake, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. &amp; who afterwarde himſelfe in perſon declared all the will of God his father, without keeping backe any thing thereof, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.15. and hath ſince his aſcending vp into heauen vntill hee returne not to teach, but to iudge, continued to declare the ſame vnto the world by his faithful Apoſtles enlightened with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertue and power of the holy ghoſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.27. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. How could a man degrade Ieſus Chriſt of this dignitie more openly then by falſifiyng of all that which hee preached both by adding to &amp; clipping from, &amp; by turning white into black, and light into darkenes, as is in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5.20. Yea ſo far, as notoriouſly to forbid this declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his to bee read thorough al nations and peoples in a knowen and intelligible language, fearing, ſay they, leaſt men ſhould become heretiques, that is to ſay, fearing leaſt the light ſhould ingender darkenes, and the truth lying. And what is this elſe, then neither to enter into the kingdom of heauen, nor to ſuffer others to enter in, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.13. then to hide the light vnder a buſhel, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.11. There remaineth the third point of his office of Mediator, namely his eternal prieſthood, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two chiefe pointes: in our redemption, and in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercesſion: the which redemption hath two parts, the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſinnes, and our ſanctification, which wee wil han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from point to point diſtinctly.

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:1883:218"/>
this curſed roote, which bind vs ſpecially vnto eternal death: which roote of ſinne, albeit it be ſo deaded by the holy ſpirite in thoſe who are regenerate, whereof wee will afterwardes ſpeake, notwithſtanding it leaueth not to bud forth, though it be not with ſuch a final effect as before, being a perpetual war between this fleſh, that is to ſay the remnant of original ſin, &amp; the ſpirit, that is to ſay the power of god, &amp; his effect in vs. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. which combate is moſt liuely deſcribed &amp; painted forth vnto vs by the Apoſtle, <hi>Ro.</hi> 7. propoſing himſelfe for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If therefore we demaund theſe goodly Doctors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of theirs, how the fruits of this vice are pardoned vs, they will aunſwere with vs that it is by the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But if wee deſire to haue a farther declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this anſwere, then Satan, who was before diſguiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to ſhewe his hornes. For it is hee in deede who hath learned them certaine diſtinctions, by which this goodly firſt aunſwere of theirs vaniſheth away as ſmoake, namely the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, firſt between <hi>mortall and vemall ſinnes,</hi> which deſerue (ſay they) nothing but temporall puniſhment, whereof a man is purged by ſome diſpleaſaunce and remorſe of them, with one <hi>Asperges</hi> of holy water, one biſhops bleſſing, and other ſuch inuentions. Whence it would followe in ſound logique, that ſuch ſinnes haue nothing at all to doe with the death and paſſion of the Lord, ſeeing the euil requireth no ſuch paine in him who committeth it. Thus you ſee howe theſe good Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſteed of vſing one purgatiue remedie onely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which euery ſinne beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth deadly, caſt the poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men in a ſleepe (as the empeirall practicks vſe the medicines which they call narcoticall, that is to ſay ſuch as benowme and ded the diſeaſed) vntill at the length they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſeles and paſt feeling in all ſinne and wickednes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. and ſwollen and puffed vp vntill they be ready to breake againe with the falſe opinion of their ſati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:1883:219"/>
euery offence againſt God, yea both our peruerſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; euery motion thereof, bee it neuer ſo ſmall, &amp; depart it neuer ſo little aſide from the commaundementes of the law, which is ſpirituall (that is to ſay, reſpecteth principally that within, although no conſent, nor any effect of deed or of word do folow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.14. and 7.14,) is worthy of death, yea of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. As this Prieſt is he alone, who by meanes of the paiment which hee hath made for the maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and curſe which was due vnto vs, and hee alone without exception which taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. is the propitiation for our ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. which he hath borne vpon the tree in his owne perſon, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. namely for them, vnto whom it is giuen to repent, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. and to beleeue, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44.45. not that Repentaunce or Faith it ſelfe merite ſaluation any way, or haue any place of ſatiſfaction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God (ſeeing eternall life is of free gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23) but becauſe that god hath appointed and giuen true Repentance, as a good way to bee prepared to receiue pardon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12.19. and Faith, to apprehend him and to apply him vnto vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. In a worde therefore, all ſinne in his owne nature is mortall and deadly, and contrariwiſe all ſinne (except it bee the ſinne againſt the holy ghoſt which is vnpardonable) is pardoned the beleeuing by the onely obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our eternall Prieſt once made, <hi>Hebrew.</hi> 10.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Their other diſtinction is double, namely betweene the guilt and the paine ſatisfactory, ſeparating the one from the other: and betweene the ſinnes going before Baptiſme and thoſe which are committed after, and al to bring the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieſus Chriſt vnto this point, to make that which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from vs of ſome worthineſſe &amp; merite, which they call condignely meritorious, an abuſe which can in no ſort agree with the prieſthoode of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſole and immediate cauſe of the Remiſſion of our ſinnes, and ſo by conſequent of our ſaluation in this reſpect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. Theſe good Doctors &amp; teachers therefore, as touching the ſinnes which goe before
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:1883:219"/>
Baptiſme, grant indeede that they are entirely pardoned both in reſpect of the guilt, and in reſpect of the paine, and that by the meanes of ſome vertue of the ſacred water, with the action it ſelfe of Baptiſme, reſeruing notwithſtanding for the young Infantes which die before they come vnto the age of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a certaine place, which they call <hi>Limbus,</hi> where they are in ſome ſmal enioying of the ioyes of paradiſe, as are thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes which are dead when they are borne, or die before they be baptized. But as for the ſinnes which are committed after Baptiſme, the guilt and treſpaſſe onely pardoned, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſatisfactorie paine to be paid as they ſaie: and in what mony? By Faſtings, Almes, Pater-noſters and Aues, Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Foundations, and other paines and penaunces impoſed in Auricular confeſſion. And hereunto you muſt adde Pardons, Indulgences, and the merites of Saintes. But yet is a man freed and quited of all when hee is dead? No. But hee muſt goe and pay the reſt in an other worlde, in the fire of Purgatorie. But they ſay that hee which is there can merite no longer, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee muſt come out of this fire by the praiers and good woorkes of the liuing, and eſpecially by a number of <hi>Maſſes, Obits, Requiems, Holy-water,</hi> &amp; other like deuotions. But what, ſhal he come forth? Nay that they cannot tel, though they tax euerie mortal ſinne at a certaine number of daies and of years. But put caſe one for whom wee ſtill praie at all aduentures, be come foorth already long ſince? Mary this ſhal bee ſet of vpon the tayle of another ſcore, to bee allowed other. And whereto then ſhall the ſatisfaction of Ieſus Chriſt ſerue? Forſooth to make al this auaileable, and to ſend you into the fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for a certaine time, whereas otherwiſe you ſhoulde haue gon into hel fire for euer. And yet, when it ſo pleaſeth the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant royall of Pardons, hee doth more then Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For he abſolueth <hi>à culpa &amp; pana,</hi> that is <hi>quitteth both the ſin and puniſhment thereof,</hi> and commaundeth the Angels to drawe what ſoules it pleaſeth him out of Purgatorie. And is there any thing hee can doe more contrarie vnto the effect of that oblation which Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe hath made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:1883:220"/>
vpon the croſſe? Yea the ſpirit of lying, by the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God hath paſſed yet farther vpon thoſe which haue loued and doe ſtill loue darckneſſe better then light, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19. according vnto the Prophecie of Eſay, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 29.10. and that of the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11. and 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. For he hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled and countermaunded the oblation once made for all by Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, that he hath borne men in hand and perſwaded them, that they muſt euery daie really and actually reiterate the ſame: and whereas the holy ſupper of the Lorde was properly and peculiarly ordained and eſtabliſhed, that we ſhould be made partakers more and more of that myſticall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Ieſus Chriſt together with all his merites vnto eternall ſaluation, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. and ſecondly to celebrate in ſolemne wiſe the memory of his holy and onely ſacrifice once for all made with ſolemne thankeſgiuing, they haue conuerted the ſame into a daily ſacrifice actual and real of the verie and true body of Ieſus Chriſt vnto God his father, by an High-prieſt annointed and ſhauen to this end and purpoſe, and that with a greater efficacy then the firſt, which Ieſus Chriſt that perfect and only Prieſt &amp; ſacrificer of himſelfe, made vpon the croſſe: ſeeing that according vnto their owne ſaying, this of his reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſtil the ſatisfactorie paine, but this which is made by their prieſts maketh an entire ſatisfaction, yea ſaie they both for the quick &amp; the dead. And this is it which they cal their <hi>Maſſe,</hi> the which is ſo rooted in the hearts of the abuſed and abuſers, that there was neuer a more execrable blaſphemy in the woorlde, nor more directlie contrarie vnto the prieſthood and ſacrifice of the Lord, nor more ſtubburnely and cruelly maintained and defended.</p>
            <p n="7">7 There followeth the ſecond point of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> namely that which is called <hi>ſanctification,</hi> becauſe that by it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawen out of our natural pollution we begin to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and framed vnto iuſtice and vprightneſſe. It is alſo called <hi>Regeneration</hi> or <hi>Newe-birth,</hi> Ioh. 3.3. becauſe that by it wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come newe men as touching the qualities of the ſcule, our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being enlightned to know and embrace the truth
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:1883:220"/>
of God, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.18. and 4.24. and <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.10. As therefore man made not himſelfe, but the only power and bounty of god cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.3. ſo muſt wee confeſſe that this verie grace and power alone maketh vs new creatures in reſpect of the qualities which are within vs, in him who is made vnto vs alſo <hi>Sanctification,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.30. For the effecting wherof, firſt al the pollution and filthineſſe of the nature of man in the firſt Adam, was aboliſhed in the fleſh of this High-prieſt our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam, conceiued in the womb of the virgine by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: to the end that wee beeing vnited by faith with him we ſhould bee found in him with that vprightneſſe which the Lawe requireth of man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. I meane by meerely free Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Secondly this ſame Ieſus Chriſt, drawing vs vnto himſelfe by his holy ſpirite <hi>formeth in vs both to will and to doe,</hi> Philip. 2.13. being made and created anew in him vnto good works which he hath prepared to the end that we ſhould walk in them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. It is then this only Prieſt apprehended by faith, in whom wee find ſuch and ſo perfect a cleanſing of this original ſtaine, the ſame being imputed vnto vs, that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of this ſame corruption in vs, and the ſpiritual vertue &amp; power fighting in vs are at a combate within vs againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of our pollution whileſt we wait for our ful incorruption &amp; glorie in bodie and in ſoule vntil the latter comming of the lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhal crown of his grace &amp; mercy his works in vs, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. This is then the ſumme of the Article of our Sanctification whereof we haue the ſeale in holy Baptiſme, in which the water repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth vnto vs the blood which was ſhed for the remiſſion of al our ſins, together with the vertue of the holy ghoſt aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; burying the old man corrupted, and forming in vs that new man, to increaſe in vs from day to day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. Cleane contrary vnto all this, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries teach vs, firſt of all the merits of preparation, &amp; ſaie grace muſt preuent the remnant of our nature not altogether ſlaued vnto ſin: but only feebled, and yet ſtill in ſome ſort free, ſo that there is a concurrence of this nature &amp; of grace, and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:1883:221"/>
thence they drawe an heape of thoſe goodly merites whereof they haue a ſtore-houſe full, to ſell to euery one that will buy. Farther they ſay that <hi>originall ſinne</hi> is really aboliſhed by the water of outwarde Baptiſme, and by the vertue of the wordes pronounced together with their Chriſme and other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: Aſmuch ſay they of all actuall ſinnes going before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in thoſe which are baptiſed at yeares of diſcretion, whether hee which is baptiſed beleeue or vnderſtand what baptiſme meaneth, or not: prouided onely they be not in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne, as they call it. And thus you ſee how theſe braue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors faile moſt abſurdly &amp; blockiſhly in this ſo neceſſarie an article, firſt in beeing ignorant how great and deadly our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall maladie and ſickneſſe is: ſecondly ſophiſticating &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the ſole and only remedy againſt it, both in blending with it that which is naturally in man, and in attributing vnto the water, to the ſound of wordes, and finally to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions that which cannot be giuen vnto the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but we muſt ſubſtitute and place them in the ſeate and roome of this only high-prieſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8 There remaineth the point of <hi>Intercesſion,</hi> which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much to ſay, as <hi>Interuention,</hi> or a <hi>comming betweene,</hi> to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe between God his father &amp; them who cal vpon him in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in trueth, which theſe goodly doctors doe ſo expound, as if Ieſus Chriſt were vpon his knees, before his father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing our requeſts and ſupplications according vnto the manner &amp; faſhion of the princes of this world, who haue their Referendaries or maſters of Requeſt, contrarying herein them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues, who in their Letany ſay not vnto Ieſus Chriſt, Pray for vs, as they craue of their ſaintes departed this mortality, but haue mercy vpon vs. And that vpon great right. For Ieſus chriſt hauing in the execution of his prieſthoode here belowe, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo earneſtly and feruently for vs, and for the whole Church vnto the end of the world, as wee ſee him to haue done, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. and hauing beene without doubt heard for euer (mediating the oblation once made afterward by him for the full aboliſhing of that which put a diuiſion between God and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:1883:221"/>
vs) hath no neede any more to make new praiers for vs, ſeeing he hath now all power of the father to gouerne vs &amp; to grant vs all things we require: but it is ſaid that he maketh ſtil Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs, becauſe the vertue and force of his oblation is alwaies preſent before God, as alſo becauſe all the praiers of the Church which is yet here belowe are made in his name, in whom alone alſo they bee receiued and ſanctified by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and Interuention betweene the father and vs. Nowe in lieu of this Doctrine teſtified and verified throughout the Scripture, hauing made notwithſtanding a Referendary and maſter of Requeſtes, turning themſelues ſuddainly cleane backward, and conſidering of his maieſty &amp; glory, they teach that it were marueilous preſumption to goe directly vnto ſo great a Lord of Lordes, and King of Kinges: and therefore ſay they, wee muſt firſt ſpeake vnto others to haue acceſſe vnto him, as a man that will haue acceſſe vnto a King, will ſpeake firſt with the Vſhers of his preſence, or with the groome of his chamber, or other his fauorits. And who are they? Here nowe euery man according vnto his priuate deuotion hath power to chuſe himſelfe a particular patrone, beſide the generall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt which they attribute the ſoueraigne place vnto the bleſſed virgin, &amp; that by her motherly autority to commaund. And here euerie ones merits are propoſed and their particular commiſſions of healing this or that diſeaſe. And whereupon I pray you are all theſe Interceſſions grounded? Not vpon any word of God, not vpon any example of the Prophets, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or any other of their time: not vpon reaſon, ſeeing this cannot be done but we muſt attribute vnto theſe Interceſſors, that which is entirely proper and belonging vnto the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Godhead alone, without which Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe ſhould be il &amp; in vaine called vpon as we haue before ſhewed: al this notwithſtanding, this hath by little and little ſlipped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church by the efficacy of that ſpirit of error which they vſed who reſiſted Ieremy, keeping themſelues to their queene of heauen, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.17. as they of whom wee now ſpeake holde themſelues to theirs. And what I praie you hath brought in
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:1883:222"/>
this curſed ouerthrowe of the true inuocation of God in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome but the diſtruſtfulnes of the fauour and good will of our Mediator towardes vs? And yet what ſhall wee find either in heauen or in earth which hath giuen vs or coulde euer giue vs ſuch aſſured teſtimonies of his loue and dilection? For wee cannot ſo much as praie as we ought, without he doe firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vs by his holy ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. ſo far is it that there can be anie more prompt and readie then he to help vs. Now no prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proceeding from diſtruſt, or from our only imagination, bee it forged anew or retained by an euil cuſtome, can bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.6. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.22. and therefore aboue all thinges is this holie aſſuraunce vpon the onely truth, loue and power of the only mediator reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1. bereauing vs by conſequent of all preſumption of ourſelues. Why but, ſay they, we pray one for an other, and do alſo craue the praiers one of an other without any derogation at al vnto the autoritie or office of Ieſus Chriſt who is our ſole mediator: true, wee vſe the mutuall praiers of one an other as being enuironed al of vs with the like neceſſities, to the mutual participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which, charitie doth bind vs, &amp; which we may and ought to cauſe to bee vnderſtoode of one an other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worde of God and the examples of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles. And what is this to the inuocation and praying vnto of Saintes, the ſpirites of whom are in heauen in their reſt not able to bee conceiued of vs, &amp; their bodies are in the duſt waiting together with vs for the latter day? Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as are yet liuing demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; craue the mutual praiers of their brethren, this is not to make them Interceſſors, or to adioine them for companions vnto Ieſus Chriſt, or as ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate mediatours between Ieſus Chriſt and vs, to ranke them and cauſe them to marche in proceſſion as they doe in their Letanies. But this is to ioine our ſelues and them together, to addreſſe and direct our ſelues to one and the ſelfe ſame God and father in the name of this ſole and onely mediator aſwell of Interceſſion as alſo of Redemption, which are two pointes altogether vnſeparable, as ſaint Iohn witneſſeth calling Ieſus

Chriſt our Aduocate in the ſame ſenſe that he called him our propitiation meaning to exclude all other Aduocates and all other propitiators towardes God. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.1.2. beeing none beſides him in whom our prayers, or other workes whatſoeuer are acceptable. Hereupon they replie againe that ſo they alſo adde, <hi>Per Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum,</hi> that is to ſay, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord. Yea but this is after they haue ioined with him ſubordinate companions, both in the merites of theſe and thoſe, as alſo in pardons and whatſoeuer elſe commeth into their thought (which is nothing elſe but to derogate aſmuch from the mediation of Redemption) and beſides in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of others towardes him: yea with their motherly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, falſly attributed vnto her, who neuer thought vpon any ſuch vſurpation. In a worde therefore this is nothing elſe but to doe as they did who in Pilates houſe called Ieſus Chriſt by the name of Prophet and king: but it was when they buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſcourged him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.1.2.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thus you ſee my bretheren, what the Ieſus Chriſt of this falſe Church is, from which the mercy of God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen vs, to know and to ſerue the true &amp; onely Ieſus Chriſt, true God and true man, hauing a name aboue euery creature high, middle or low, in his celeſtiall and eternall Empire, who hath declared vnto vs all the counſell of God touching our ſaluation by the contents of the writinges of his faithfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Apoſtles, being the only eternal prieſt &amp; by vertue of this Prieſthood our ſole &amp; onely mediator aſwell of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as alſo of Interceſſion betweene the father and vs vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, in the which faith the Lord giue vs grace to liue and die to enioy one day on high eternally with him the glorie which he hath purchaſed by the price of himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="10">10 It remaineth now we conſider of what maner of <hi>Crowne</hi> this ſpouſe here ſpeaketh, and who this <hi>Mother</hi> is who hath crowned him therewith.

But who may this mother be, who
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1883:223"/>
hath crowned him therewith, ſeeing it is of the father onely that he craueth it, both in reſpect that his diuine maieſtie was as it were abaſed in the infirmitie of the fleſhe for a time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.5. as in reſpect of the ſuperioritie ouer all the world promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto him in regard of his humanitie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. expounded by the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. and <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2.9. This place therefore hath diuerſe interpretations. To let paſſe therefore the interpretation of certaine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue, or rather of dreaming and doting Doctors, who haue appropriated not onely this place, but almoſt all that is ſaid of the Church in this Canticle vnto the perſon of the virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who was truly bleſſed among all faithfull women, but not therfore as theſe foliſh ſuperſtitious haue imagined, as if Ieſus chriſt did hold of his mother the crown of his Empire: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is his meer gracious bounty which made her his mother, inaſmuch as he took our fleſh in her virginall wombe, &amp; who hath crowned her with ſuch meaſure of glory as pleaſed him. Others haue vnderſtood by this word of mother the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ieſus Chriſt, which contrariwiſe is crowned in him &amp; by him, who hath honored it ſo farre with his perſonall vnion.

This expoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the foundation which it hath, ſerueth vnto great edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:1883:223"/>
this coronation and this Crowne beeing diuerſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: in aſmuch as Hieruſalem a figure of the Church in her eſtate here below is ſometimes reſtricted vnto the elect, and ſometimes alſo comprehendeth all thoſe who ſay they are of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, of which notwithſtanding ſome of them are not knowen, as S. Paul before his couerſion was among the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, others are like darnell among the good corne vntill ſuch time as God threſhe it out. This is then the cauſe wherefore the true ſpouſe deſiring, according as this ſpirituall marriage implieth it, that al the worlde if it might be were ioined with her in one body vnder this head and Bridegroome, inuiteth the other Daughters of Hieruſalem, to come in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and not for faſhion ſake or outward appearaunce and profeſſion onely, to contemplate the true king of peace in this royal maieſty of his, wherewith their common mother, to wit Hieruſalem, had crowned him, I meane ſo farre as that earthly Salomon was the figure of this true king and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome, &amp; not that the maieſty of this Salomon proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſpouſe, but from the eternal father, as alſo by a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the coronation of the terreſtriall Salomon celebrated by thoſe of Ieruſalem, proceeded not of them of the City but from the ordinance and commandement of Dauid, which the city accepted of. But it may be together with this, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt ſpeaking by the mouth of the ſpouſe to the diſloyal of Ieruſalem in particular, would in this place vpbraid them the ſame with which S. Peter did, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23.24. &amp; 3.13.14. &amp; Saint Stephen, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.52. conformably vnto that which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.64. as if ſhee ſaid. Beholde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the true king of peace accepted and crowned with all maieſtie of Ieruſalem. Come and ſee him you who deſire your owne welfare and ſaluation: as for you the contemners and perſecuters of him, looke vpon him hardly vnto your confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You haue bought him of a traitor, and condemned him by falſe ſuborned witneſſes. It was through your cryinges that Pilate ſcourged him, that hee crowned him with thornes, that he crucified him. You haue denied him to bee your king, and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:1883:224"/>
haue ſought to put forth the title of his royalty, yea you moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him on his croſſe, you ſhut vp and ſealed his ſepulcher to hinder his victorie, and yet lo he is a king maugre your deſpite, hauing vanquiſhed all his enemies vpon the Croſſe, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan, ſinne and death. Behold how he ſitteth aboue euerie creature at the right hand of the father, and thence it is he ſhal come to condemne all his enemies, and to abſolue thoſe who are his for euer. There it is you ſhal ſee him vnto your condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Yea the ſufferinges which you cauſed him to endure were the waie by which hee is entred into his glorie, <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.46. Behold I ſaie in what ſort this ſpouſe might by a Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpirit reproch the <hi>Daughters of Ieruſalem.</hi> But beſides al this to expreſſe yet more clearely this name <hi>of Mother,</hi> I ſaie, that this which is heere ſaide of this coronation of Salomon by his Mother may be alſo referred vnto that which is in his hiſtory, namelie vnto that, that the crowning of him came to paſſe by his Mother, in aſmuch as ſhe by the ſuggeſtion of Nathan put Dauid in minde in good time of his promiſe which hee had made of leauing the crowne vnto Salomon and not vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donias. Which being referred vnto the true Salomon, we muſt attribute the crowning of him vnto the heauenly father which is ſome-what referred vnto the Mother in reſpect of him which was the figure of him: ſeeing in ſimilitudes it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that all the partes thereof agree throughout.</p>
            <p n="11">11 It remaineth yet we expound what <hi>this daie of the eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes is, and of the great ioie of this king.</hi> Whereupon we muſt cal to remembraunce that which I haue alreadie more then once reiterated vpon this Canticle, namelie that in this ſpirituall marriage, which is heere mentioned, there are ſo manie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to be conſidered as there be approchings of the Meſſias neare his Church by the manifeſtation of his will. Vntil the time of the Lawe therefore there was the treatie as it were of theſe fianſailes, and the time after the Law (which was as it were the chalking forth of this Bridegroome) ſhal be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it were the ſolemnizing of the fianſailes, eſpecially in the building of the Temple, &amp; in that ſo magnificent eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:1883:224"/>
of the Leuitical prieſthoode. Afterward at the comming of the Lorde in fleſh this marriage was really contracted by wordes of the preſent, according vnto that which the Apoſtle expreſſely teacheth vs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25.29. the contract of the new couenant beeing ratified and confirmed by the newe ſeale of the holie Supper, as appeareth by the tenour of the inſtitution of it, and by the ſcope and end whereunto it tendeth, namelie, to the communion of bodie and goods with this Bridegrome 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and 10.16. in ſuch ſort notwithſtanding, that the ful and perfectly real conſummation of this marriage, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining vnto the enioying of eternal life, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28.54. is differred vnto the daie of his glorious appearaunce, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16.17. and elſewhere in manie places. As this is alſo the ende and hope of this ſpouſe waiting for now with no leſſe deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſecond comming, whereof ſhe hath the pledges, then ſhe did ſometimes vpon other pledges expect his firſt. Vnto what time therefore ſhal we referre theſe eſpouſailes and this ioy and gladneſſe? Salomon the ſonne of Dauid beeing ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in this place as a figure of the true Salomon, and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation in Ieruſalem here below beeing repreſented vnto vs as no vaine figure of the real taking of poſſeſſion of the true Salomon in the heauenly Ieruſalem: it ſeemeth that it is not to bee doubted, but that according vnto the ordinarie ſtile of the Prophets, the time of the ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſing of the fianſailes, vnder the which this Canticle was written, is properly mentioned in this place: but yet ſo, that it is ioyned with that which is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that is, with the ſolemniſing of the eſpouſailes, as if it were one and the ſame time. And indeede this hath bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the right maner of ſpeaking of the figures &amp; ſhadowes of the Lawe ceremoniall, that the people was alwaies ledde vnto the ſubſtance &amp; bodie of them, which is our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. &amp; throughout the whole Ep. to the Hebrues, in ſuch ſort, that for want of obſeruing of this methode thoſe abuſes haue bin engendred which are reproued, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. &amp; ſo oft by al the Prophets, &amp; finally the phariſaiſme reprehended by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; afterwards by the Apoſtls. And yet
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:1883:225"/>
at this day the ſelfeſame fault is ſtill committed by them, in the Sacramentes ordained by Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; in others forged by men. Briefly Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath in this place declared by this diuine medly of himſelfe crowned in his fianſailes in his Ieruſalem, with the eſpouſailes of the true Salomon in his celeſtial Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem which was to be gathered out of al nations of the world, that he had not forgotten, that the promiſe made concerning him to Dauid his father, had in ſuch ſort lincked him with the other ſonne of Dauid, of which himſelfe was only the figure &amp; ſhadow, that it might ſeem at firſt ſight that the Lord ſpake of one onely perſon and of one onely eternall kingdome, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. &amp; 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.13.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Nowe that it is not without great cauſe that the ſpouſe calleth <hi>this day the day of the gladnes of the heart of this bridegrome,</hi> appeareth by the more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maruelous effects. For if this bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome had not taken an vnſpeakeable pleaſure, to make his very enimies his ſpouſe, how would he haue giuen his life for the winning of her, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.13. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. How would hee haue obiected him ſelfe vnto the horrible wrath of God for vs? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. How going vnto death woulde hee haue prayed ſo feruently for vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.20. How woulde hee haue proteſted, that he deſired nothing more then this oblation of himſelfe to carry our ſinnes vpon the tree, which is the principall article of the contract of this marriadge? <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. How would he haue proteſted of that ſingular deſire he had to celebrate that laſt ſupper with his diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.15. How in the angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of death which were more horrible a great deale in his ſoule then in his body, as that frightfull cry of his which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the ſunne, ſhooke the earth, &amp; claue the ſtones, namely that, My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me, declareth, would he haue praied for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who crucified him? <hi>Lu.</hi> 23.30. on whom alſo afterwardes he ſhewed mercie, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.17. which he yet continueth to doe at this day towardes vs ſo vnworthy of ſo great and incomprehenſible fauour.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Go too then (my brethren) vnto whom in our time this king is as it were again appeared, to cauſe vs to ſee the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

of his crowne buried as it were before in ſuch thicke dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ignorance and ſuperſtition, which were couered with the name of Chriſtianitie and true deuotion, let vs pray him, with al our hart, that this infinite loue &amp; charitie of his which ſheweth vs from on high the flowers of his crowne, to cauſe the glory of that kingdome which was prepared for vs before the foundation of the world, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.34. to be poured down vpon vs: Let theſe thinges (I ſay) pearce our hartes to cauſe vs to goe forth of our ſelues, to the ende that wee may throughly contemplate this king there where he cauſeth himſelfe to bee ſeene of vs, let vs know him, loue him, followe him through all the path-waies it ſhall pleaſe him to conduct vs, vntill wee arriue vnto the full conſummation of this moſt holy coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the which he ſhalbee all in all in his: Amen.
