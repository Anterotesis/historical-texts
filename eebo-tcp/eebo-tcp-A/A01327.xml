            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

are brused, &amp; to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord.</hi> Then after he had closed the booke, and deliuered it to the Minister, he sat downe to preach, and the eyes of all them that wer in the Congregation, wer bent vpon him. Then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his mouth, &amp; spake vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these words: <hi>This dai is this scripture fulfilled in your eares, and they all gaue him testimony that it was so.</hi> In like maner may I say, concerning this place of scripture which I haue read vnto you: In your eyes and eares is this scripture this day fulfilled; And I pray God you may all likewise beare witnes with me, that it is so.</p>

And for that purpose principally haue I chosen this text of scripture to speake of: That by the one we might bee enflamed with loue of the true church of Christ, &amp; by the other be moued to the hatred of that false church of Antichrist.

            <p>Now haue we to consider, what <hi>Babilon</hi> is, I haue vndertaken to prooue, that <hi>Babylon</hi> here spoken of, is <hi>Rome.</hi> But first I must admonish you, how I vnderstand <hi>Rome.</hi> And that is not onely for a certaine place in <hi>Italy,</hi> compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with walles, &amp; furnished with buildinges, us other Cities are: but for that aucthority, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, &amp; preheminence which is challenged by meanes of that city, or for the <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which is claimed by prerogatiue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same City: And so is <hi>Babylon</hi> taken in the scripture, and namely in thys prophecye. For in the. <hi>11.</hi> chapter of this Reuelation, the same great City is called also <hi>Sodoma</hi> and <hi>Aegiptus,</hi> wher our Lord was crucified. <hi>Sodoma,</hi> for the great abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and filthines therin maintayned: and <hi>Aegiptus,</hi> because it kéepeth the people of God in miserable bondage &amp; slauery, as <hi>Aegipt</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pharao</hi> did of old. Wherby it is manifest, that the great City is to be taken for that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, gouernment, &amp; preheminence, as I sayd, which is ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llenged in the right of that great City: and so is the regiment &amp; gouernance of the <hi>Romane</hi> Antichrist depending vpon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of his See, which is <hi>Rome.</hi> Now if


<pb facs="tcp:2920:6"/>
any wil contend, that <hi>Babilon</hi> must be taken in the proper sence for a City in <hi>Chaldea</hi> onely, as though we should looke for the Sée of Antichrist out of the East: As the Papistes for. xxx. or. xl. yeres ago deuised a fable, that was renued also in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, of a monstrous childe which should be borne at <hi>Babylon,</hi> which they would haue men suppose to be Antichrist: Hée may be flatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted of great ignorance, when the Angel in the. <hi>17.</hi> chap. of this prophecy testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that her name is <hi>Babilon</hi> in a mystery, as in the. <hi>11.</hi> chap. that she is spiritually called <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doma</hi> &amp; <hi>Egiptus,</hi> not in respect of situation of the place, but in similitude &amp; likenes of conditions.</p>
            <p>Wherfore it remayneth, that (according to my promise) I proue <hi>Babilon</hi> here mencioned, to be <hi>Rome.</hi> The greatest controuersy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thys day troubleth the world, is where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church of God shuld be, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists making great brags that it is on their side, &amp; we affirming that it is on our side. This controuersy will soone be cut of, &amp; brought to an end, if it may be shewed, that <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> is <hi>Rome.</hi> For then cannot <hi>Rome</hi> be the church of Christ, but the church of Antichrist: &amp; therfore it standeth ure vpon, to bring very good and substantial proues, to maintain this my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>Rome.</hi> But what proues may be counted sufficient? Is not the autority of holy scriptures, &amp; the testimony of auncient


<pb facs="tcp:2920:6"/>
Doctors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, good &amp; substantiall proues? Therfore if autority of scriptures be a good and substantial proofe, ye shal haue scriptures: if co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent of auncient writers in the same sentence be of any value, you shall haue plenty.</p>
            <p>And first beginning w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> scriptures, I will not alledge such places as be hard &amp; darke to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, but such as be plaine, euident &amp; manifest, and can receiue no other interpretacion to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the iudgement of any reasonable man. I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit therfore so many figures as in this Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do not very obscurely signify, but euen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly poynt &amp; paint out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Antichristian church. For although they do so aptly &amp; fitly agrée ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as a man might easely iudge, they wer made euen for the same purpose: yet because they might be wrested to som other meaning, if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest places did not withstand: I will leaue all aduauntage that I might take of them, &amp; hold me onely at this time, to those playne &amp; euident demonstrations, which with no equity nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can admit any other interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I wil here note, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forasmuch as all figures, types and coulors contayned in this booke, may so conueniently be applied to <hi>Rome,</hi> as though they had bene properly appoynted to describe her (as they wer in deede) it is a great preiudice agaynst <hi>Rome,</hi> although no playner prooues might be brought. But when so playne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments


<pb facs="tcp:2920:7"/>
ar brought forth, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out to much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency cannot be auoided, &amp; al other figures &amp; dark speches agrée accordingly, it is a manifest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uiction y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Rome</hi> is none other but this <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to begin w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these plaine places as I haue promised, the first shalbe out of the. <hi>11.</hi> chapter of this Reuelation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place before alledged: wher it is declared, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God in al times, yea in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test persecution, would maintain his Church, &amp; reserue at the least two witnesses which shuld testify of his truth, in spight of Antichrist &amp; hys adherents. Which although the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous beast that ariseth out of the bottomles pit, shuld mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; slay: yet God should restore them to lyfe again, continually stirring vp a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to beare witnes of his name &amp; doctrine. In that chapter I say is contained, that when the beast had murdered them, he should enuy them the honor of burial, &amp; so their bodies should lye in the stréete or market place of that great city, which is spiritually called <hi>Sodoma</hi> &amp; <hi>Aegyptus</hi> wher our Lord was crucified. Declaring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that as <hi>Rome</hi> had slain &amp; crucified the head, so should <hi>Rome</hi> persecute the members: and in the same city wher their Lord was murthered, the seruaunts also should be persecuted.</p>
            <p>But here a man would thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, to affirme that our sauiour Christ was crucified at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom al the world knoweth


<pb facs="tcp:2920:7"/>
to haue suffered death at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But you must call to remembrance, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> at the first I gaue warning, that I did not vnderstand <hi>Rome</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> topography of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, so much ground onely as is compassed within the walles of that city, but for the regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, gouernance, &amp; prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue that is claymed, by reason of that city, or that monarchie, wherof <hi>Rome</hi> is the head: and then I shall easely proue, that Christ was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified at <hi>Rome.</hi> For by whom was he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Was it not by <hi>Pilate</hi> the Deputy or Liefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Romane</hi> Empire? For what cause or crime was he adiudged to dye? Was it not for treason pretended to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against the <hi>Romane</hi> Empyre? With what kinde of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was he put to death? Was it not such as was vsuall by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> for such haynous offences as were vniustly layd to hys charge? Finally, was not the place wherein he suffered, within the circute of the <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre? May I not then iustly affirme, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he was crucified at <hi>Rome,</hi> when by the <hi>Romane</hi> Iudge he was condemned for a crime against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> state, and executed by a kinde of death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Romane</hi> lawes, &amp; in a place of the <hi>Romane</hi> dominion? As for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they had at that time no autority to put any man to death, as they confesse them selues, when <hi>Pilate</hi> had them take him, and iudge him according to


<pb facs="tcp:2920:8"/>
their owne lawe, meaning they should decrée some light punishment against him, they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death, &amp; he hath deserued to dye. As touching the cause, although they accused him of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in that he made himselfe the sonne of God, yet could he not be condemned for that, because <hi>Pilate</hi> would admit no accusation, but such as contayned a crime agaynst the <hi>Romane</hi> lawes. And as for the death of the crosse, it is manifest to be proper to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Romanes,</hi> for the <hi>Iewes</hi> would haue stoned him, if they might haue condemned him for blasphemy, according to the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> And that the Angel in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place by no meanes can vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it is manifest by these reasons: First, that he calleth it that great city, which term could neuer be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: also he calleth it <hi>Sodoma</hi> and <hi>Aegiptus,</hi> which was the sea of the monstrous beast Antichrist, which in other places is often called Babylon, wheras no man euer did imagine, that <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> should be called <hi>Sodoma, Aegipt,</hi> or <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Adde hereunto, that <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the place where Christ suffred, was vtterly destroied in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, whereby it is euident, that by thys great City, spiritually called <hi>Babilon, Sodoma,</hi> and <hi>Aegiptus,</hi> is ment none other but the <hi>Romane</hi> Empyre, which crucified the head, and should also bring forth the monstrous beast Antichrist,


<pb facs="tcp:2920:8"/>
which should torment and afflict the members which began with murther of the Lorde, and should continue, till it were destroyed, in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the seruantes. And by thys playne text, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be wrested to any other sence, this great City <hi>Babilon,</hi> where Christ was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, is proued to be <hi>Rome,</hi> and the aucthority, rule, and power of the <hi>Romane</hi> City.</p>
            <p>The second plaine and euident proofe which I will vse at thys tyme, shall be taken out of the <hi>13.</hi> chapter of this Reuelation, where that euil shapen beast is described, which is the head of the persecuting malignant church: hauing. vij. heads, &amp; ten hornes, and is the same which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde in the. <hi>17.</hi> chapter beareth the great whore Babilon, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother of all abominations of the earth. Who so therfore that wil compare these things that are written in this booke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the disposition of that monstrous beast, wyth those thinges that the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in the. <hi>7.</hi> chapter of his prophecy describeth of the <hi>

               </gap>he cruelty of the Leoparde, the Beare, and the Lyon, which were the former Monarchies, is


<pb facs="tcp:2920:9"/>
vnlyke to them all, &amp; therfore is the fourth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world acknowledgeth to be the Monarchy of <hi>Rome.</hi> What should I speake of the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the hornes, equal in both, &amp; general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all other partes of their discription, which is set forth so like, &amp; almost with the same words both of the one, &amp; of the other, that it were mere madnes to imagine that this beast which <hi>Iohn</hi> describeth, should be any other, then that <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> had so long before portraited. Then if the Beast in <hi>Daniels</hi> discription, doth signifye the fourth kingdome, as the Angell expoundeth it, which no man will deny to be the <hi>Romane</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie: The same monstrous Beast, beyng here painted out in this Reuelation, wyth the same shape, coulors and conditions, must néeds signify the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and so <hi>Babylon</hi> by this reason also is proued to be <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third argument or proofe is taken out of the. <hi>17.</hi> chapter of this Reuelation, &amp; the. <hi>9.</hi> verse Wher the Angell expounding to S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the mistery of the beast with seuen heads, declareth in very plaine words, that the seuen heades doo signify seuen hyls, wheron the woman sitteth. Now seing it is euident, that the woman signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a great City, we must see where we can finde a great City builded vpon seuen hyls, and that by the interpretacion of the Angell is <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> the See of Antichrist. And if we séeke


<pb facs="tcp:2920:9"/>
throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, wher shal we finde a great City builded vpon seuen hyls, but that great City in <hi>Italy</hi>? Which al writers, Poets, Historiers, Cosmographers, with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent do confesse to be <hi>Rome,</hi> which is builded vpon. vij. hils, whose names are these: <hi>Palatinus, Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus, Aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinus, Exquilinus, Viminalis, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinalis,</hi> and <hi>Caelius.</hi> This is so plain a notacion of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> builded on seuen hyls, that the Angel could not more plainly haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <hi>Rome,</hi> though he had named her. Nay this is a more euident and certaine description of Rome, to be the See of Antichrist, then if in plain words he had said <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>Rome.</hi> For it might be that some other City then that here was ment, might haue the name of Rome, but no other Citye could haue this notacion, to bée builded on seuen hyls. For <hi>Constantinopolis</hi> was afterward called new Rome, but <hi>Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolis</hi> was not builded vpon seuen hyls like vnto old Rome. Therfore this is a plain &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest circumlocution of Rome, which with no reason can receiue any other exposition.</p>
            <p>For what Boy going to the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer</hi> schoole, and reading in <hi>Virgils Georgikees</hi> thys verse: <hi>Septem quae vna sibi muro circundedit arces.</hi> That City (saith <hi>Virgil</hi>) which hath compassed seuen hyls within her wall, what Boy I say in the <hi>Grammer</hi> schoole, doth not vnderstand this


<pb facs="tcp:2920:10"/>
to be ment of the City of Rome, although the Poet in that place, doth not once name Rome? With what face therfore wyll any man deny, that the Angel here meaneth any other City by this Periphrasis &amp; circumlocution, then Rome? For it any man wyll be so froward to except, that the word of hyls is not taken in the proper sence, but figuratiuely and Metaphorically for some other thing, as some would seme to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete seuen hils in this place, for. vij. kingdoms, he shall plainly be conuinced by these reasons: First it wer absurd, that the Angell should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate one thing twise, for in the next clause hée sheweth, that the seuen heads doo signify kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms also. But specially we must remember, that this is an interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Angel, which must either be plaine &amp; easy to be vnderstood, or els it deserueth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of an interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore if the Angel, offering to expound the mystery of the seuen heads, geueth this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they signify seuen hyls: if hyls be not taken in their proper sence, to what purpose ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth this exposition? For if the name of hyls hath nede of an other exposition, he had bene as good to haue left the name of heades vnexpoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And as for the interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hyls to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify Kings, is more obscure, dark, &amp; far fet, then that heads shuld represent Kings, for it is more apt by Metaphore, to call a King an head, then


<pb facs="tcp:2920:10"/>
to call him an hyl. Therfore except we wil say, that the interpretacion of the Angel is in vain, yea more darke, then the thing that is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him, we must needes confes, that hyls ar taken in their proper sence for hyls, and then the Citye builded vpon seuen hyls, without all controuersy is the City of Rome.</p>
            <p>The fourth &amp; last proofe that I wyll take out of the holy scripture, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last verse of the same <hi>17.</hi> chapter, which is yet a more plain descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome, if any thing can be more plaine, then that hath bene already spoken of. For ther the Angel in plaine woords expoundeth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw, which was the great whore <hi>Babylon,</hi> is that great City which hath do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inion ouer the Kings of the earth. What brasen face is so impudent, to deny that Rome was that great city, which had dominion ouer the Kings of the earth at that time, when this was spoken? Or what other city had dominion ouer the Kings of the earth in s. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, but Rome? Who is therfore so froward and vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he will not acknowledge <hi>Babylon</hi> here to be plainly called Rome? If I should name the chiefe City of <hi>England,</hi> who would not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>London</hi>? If I should speake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cheif city of <hi>Eraunce,</hi> who would not conceiue <hi>Paris</hi>? And when the Angel named the chiefe citie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, who could be ignoraunt, liuing in that


<pb facs="tcp:2920:11"/>
time, or knowing the history of that time, that he vnderstood it of the city of Rome, which was the Sée of the Empyre, and from whence wee should looke that Antichrist should come, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former prophecies. For it is a shame in this place to slée vnto Allegories, and further expositions of this Angelicall interpretacion, which as I said before, if it be not cleare, playn, and easy to be vnderstood, deserueth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name of an exposition: as when one knowen thing is expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by another, as much or more vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, it is vayne, superfluous, and ridiculous. Wherfore, whom any bandes of reason wyll hold in, they must be satisfied with the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Angel, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is Rome. For seing it was necessary for the church of God, to know as well the place wher Antichrist should sit, as to be instructed of his craft and cruelty: our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, the Author of thys Reuelation, would not suffer his congregation to be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therof, but sent his Angel playnly to interprete and expound the vision of the great whore, that the Church being throughly admonished of her wickednes, &amp; instructed perfectly to know her, might more easely take heede of her, flée from her, and abhorre her. So that according to my promise I haue sufficiently proued by autority of holy Scripture, this first proposition which I tooke in hand, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2920:11"/>But because some ar of such obstinate &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frowardnes, that nothing will satisfy them, but they wyl styl grudge and repine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arpe and obiect against my interpretacions of the holy scriptures (for the text they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny) I wish them that are such, if they like not these exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I haue brought to the defacing of Antichrist &amp; his religion, then that they admit and reuerence those expositions, which their own Authors bring for the maintenance of the Popes authority, &amp; his religion. Of which sort are these: <hi>God</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Genesis) made two great lights, the Sunne to rule the day, and the Moone to gouern the night</hi>: That is, saith the famous Interpreter, God ordained y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope and the Emperour to rule the world. By the Sunne is ment the Pope, &amp; by the Moone the Emperour. And looke how much greater, and more glorious the Sunne is then the Moone, so much greater and more glorious is the Pope, then the Emperor. And not content with this he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth by <hi>Arithmatike</hi> how much greater the Sunne is in quantity, then the Moone, by proportion that it hath to the earth, &amp; so by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that the Pope is greater then the Emperor. But here a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might help him, what by <hi>Geometry,</hi> &amp; what by <hi>Arithma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,</hi> for wher as the Sunne is. <hi>166</hi> times grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter then the earth, &amp; the earth. <hi>39.</hi> times greater

            <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> writing a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary vpon the Reuelation of s. <hi>Iohn,</hi> is of the same iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of the authority of the woorke, I wyll moue no question at this time, seing it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs by <hi>Cuthbert Tonstal,</hi> late bishop of Duresme, who found it in an old Library, &amp; first set it in print, vnder the name of that great s. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and is willing that men should so thinke of it. It is good authority I say, against the Papists, being commended by so Catholike a Prelate, &amp; because they are woont to receiue whatsoeuer commeth vnder the name of an old Doctor, though it be neuer so vnlyke his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and cry out vpon vs for reiecting at our pleasure the workes of auncient Doctors that make against our doctrine, as though we reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any without cause, or they refused none for any cause: wheras <hi>Pighius</hi> their great Patron blusheth not to reiect the report of two general Counsels, the fift &amp; sixt of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople,</hi> which


<pb facs="tcp:2920:18"/>
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to vs by publike faith of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> because in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one Pope <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> is condemned &amp; accursed for an heretike, &amp; in neither of both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes Legats could haue the highest place, according to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> request of their ambicious Maister. But as for this <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if he wer not <hi>Ambrose</hi> of <hi>Millain,</hi> yet is it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant by the style, that he was some auncient writer of the Latin church, &amp; he throughout this prophecy interpreteth <hi>Babylon</hi> to be Rome: &amp; Antichrist to be sought no where but at Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Primasius</hi> also, a very auncient writer, who likewise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menteth vpon the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth these prophecies of Antichrist to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Romane empire, &amp; of the city of Rome.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his worke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> not once or twise, but oftentimes is bold to cal Rome <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Babylon</hi> Rome, as in his <hi>16.</hi> booke, and <hi>17.</hi> chapter, he calleth Rome an other <hi>Babylon</hi> in the West. And in his <hi>18.</hi> booke, &amp; <hi>2.</hi> chapter he calleth <hi>Babylon</hi> of <hi>Chaldea</hi> the first Rome, &amp; Rome of <hi>Italy</hi> the second <hi>Babylon,</hi> willing men to consider, that in the beginning of the city of God, which was the church in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> time, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first Rome that was Easterne <hi>Babylon</hi> her enemy was builded in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and about the same time that the first <hi>Babylon</hi> was destroyed, least the city of God should lack her enemy, the second <hi>Babylon</hi> which is Rome


<pb facs="tcp:2920:19"/>
in <hi>Italy</hi> was erected. It is a straunge matter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same city which is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> professed enemy of the city of God, should be the mother of al religion, &amp; the very city of God it selfs. O <hi>Augustin,</hi> thou wast not wel aduised to make the city of Rome enemy to the city of God, that Rome should be the same to the church of God, that Babilon of old was at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The same <hi>Augustine</hi> in the <hi>22.</hi> chap. of the <hi>18.</hi> booke, calleth Rome an other Babilon, &amp; daughter of the first Babilon. And in the <hi>27.</hi> chap. he calleth Rome Western Babylon. By these &amp; other testimonies of old<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> writers that might be brought, but for tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes I suppose it is sufficiently proued that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon in this my text spoken of, is Rome, and that we should not seeke Antichrist to proceede from any other place then from Rome. But what neede I trouble my selfe to seeke further testimonial, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of this matter, that Babylon is Rome, then of the Papistes them selues? For it is the common catholike opinion of all Papists, that s. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epistle where he sendeth salutacions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church gathered in Babilon, by Babilon vnderstandeth Rome. And they learne it of <hi>Ieronime,</hi> which in the life of s. <hi>Marke</hi> doth so expound it. So gréedy they are to finde a place in Scripture where <hi>Peter</hi> should be said to haue bene at Rome, that they are content to acknowledge Babylon in the


<pb facs="tcp:2920:19"/>
scripture to be vnderstood of Rome. And thus I haue performed I trust sufficiently, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I tooke in hand to proue, both by the autority of holy scripture in plaine &amp; manifest textes, &amp; by consent of many auncient writers, yea by the confession of the Papists them selues, that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon in the scripture is taken for Rome. And thus much for the first part, in which because I haue bene ouer long, I wyl be shorter in that which remayneth.</p>
            <p>In the second part I promised to declare how Babilon which is Rome is fallen, according to the prophecy of this Angell: <hi>She is fallen</hi> (saith the Angel) <hi>she is fallen.</hi> He repeateth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> woord of falling for two causes: First, to declare the certainty of her decay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> howsoeuer she seemed to floorish and triumph, as though she should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or come to ruine: yet God for her wickednes most righteously, &amp; for the comfort of his church most mercifully, had decréeed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly that she should fall, when that time was once come, which in his most wise &amp; well ordered councel was appointed for her destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, he repeateth twise that she is fallen, to shew that she should haue an vnreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable fall: she should not fall as other cities, which haue risen again, but she should fal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al hope of recouery, neuer to be restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Therfore in the <hi>18.</hi> chap. a mighty Angel


<pb facs="tcp:2920:20"/>
taketh vp a great mylstone, &amp; throweth it into the sea saying: <hi>VVith such violence s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therfore saith the Angel, <hi>She is fallen, she is fallen,</hi> that is she is destroyed, and neuer shalbe repaired.</p>
            <p>But if we wyll better vnderstand how she i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But especially &amp; chiefly <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen in credit of her doctrine. For besides so many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and states of Christendome, that by publike autority haue receiued the Gospel, &amp; vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished all <hi>Babilonicall</hi> doctrine: Euen in the midst of her tyranny &amp; persecution, great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes daylye are lyghtened wyth the bryght beames of the Gospel, that for all Inquisitions, imprisonments, exquisite torments, &amp; cruel bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nings, they neuer a whit diminish, but rather increase, as God hath prouided, that the blood of the Martyrs should be the seede of the Church. And they ar more then obstinate, if they do not acknowledge that this matter is gouerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God aboue. For if it had bene of men, it must needes haue decayed before this time, and haue come to naught, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> sayd of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doctrine of the Apostels. Therfore in fighting against it, they shew them selues but after the maner of the old Giants, to make war against God. Or as it is contayned in this prophecy, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Antichrist should gather together the Princes of the earth to make battail against him that sitteth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> white Horse, whose name is the woord of God, but al to their own vtter confusion &amp; destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the word of God must conquer and preuail in the last age, &amp; Antichrist must be consumed


<pb facs="tcp:2920:22"/>
by the spirit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of Christ, which is his holy word, &amp; vtterly abolished by the glorious brightnes of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as s. <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth in the second chap. of the second Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Thessalonians.</hi> Therfore it is in vaine that they seeke to vnderprop the doctrine of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> by cruelty &amp; tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, for al wil not serue, seeing the time of her final fall approcheth, and now already our sauiour Christ with the spirit of his mouth, hath wasted &amp; consumed a great part of that credit &amp; estimation, in which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Babylon</hi> of long tyme hath triumphed.

            <p>Thus haue I declared that <hi>Babilon</hi> in wealth and substance, in power &amp; autority, in credit &amp; estimation of her doctrine, is fallen, &amp; that with out hope of recouery. For her credit is cracked not onely among her enemies the Protestants, but euen among her best friendes, and greatest Archpapists.

in al other pointes of Popery. Yet all was not wel, they confes by their correction. And as for the greatest pillers and Proctors they haue, if they be pressed nere, acknowledge a great deale more. As one that landed lately at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> before witnes of good credite restified, that if he might be satisfised in two pointes, concerning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Popes supremacy, &amp; the real presence, for other matters he would not greatly striue.

the church of Christ, &amp; which is principally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Antichrist, could not be any of the heathen Emperors, neither the state of the heathen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, I wil make it manifest by plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations. And first I wil retain this principle, sufficiently proued before, that <hi>Rome</hi> is the Sée of Antichrist, and that by autority of scriptures and consent of auncient writers, we can seeke him no wher, but in the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. And now the controuersy resteth in this, whether y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heathen Emperors or the Pope vs them.</p>
            <p>First s. <hi>Paule</hi> in the second chap. of the second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> speaking purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Antichrist, saith expresly that he shal syt in the temple of God, which is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> church of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it is manifest, that the heathen Emperor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But chiefly let vs consider, that the beast, although he be but one, yet in the accompt he standeth for two, for he is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> seuenth head, &amp; the sight also: And remember that the Pope challengeth double authority, namely the power of both swordes, the spiritual &amp; the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral. So that in this exposition, althings agrée most aptly. Againe, it is manifest in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Antichrist should deceiue the world with false doctrine, vnder pretence &amp; coullor of true religion, &amp; therfore so often times the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture warneth men, that they be not seduced by him, which were needeles, if any open professed enemy of Christ should be that Antichrist. For there is no likelyhood, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an heathen man, a <hi>Iew</hi> or a <hi>Turke,</hi> shuld deceiue any multitude of true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but he that vnder the pretence of the name of Christ, seeketh most of all to deface the honor of Christ: he is a subtil aduersary, &amp; the very spirit of Antichrist, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> also in hys Epistle doth testify.

Seing therfore that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Antichrist for one that is gone from the Church, &amp; for a false Prophet, it is cleare that Antichrist is no heathen Emperor, which was neuer of the Church, nor anye false Prophet, that tooke vpon him to teach in the church.

               <hi>Rome</hi> is fallen, if <hi>Babylon</hi> by fallen.</p>
            <p>Now remaineth the last part that I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to entreate of, namely the cause of Gods so seuere iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against <hi>Babylon,</hi> that he hath decreeed her vtter ouerthrow and destruction, which the Angel comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in these words: <hi>Because she hath made al Nations dronke with the wyne of the fury of her fornication.</hi> That is: She hath deceiued all the world wyth false doctrine, which he compareth vnto two kindes of vices, wherby men are so deceiued, that they léese al right iudgement: <hi>Dronkennes</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi> For as these two vices do allure men to commit them, by coueting of vayne de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that is in them: euen so <hi>Babylon</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed all men lyke an other <hi>Circe,</hi> to drinke of the cup of her delectable errors, and to commit most filthy fornication with her idolatrous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For of all other religions to the carnall man, none is so pleasant as Popery is, in which be so many kindes of satisfaction to be obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both in this life, &amp; after men be dead, that there is no greater security of an hipocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to sleepe in, then in the faire promises of Poꝑerye. And that causeth so many willingly to embrace it, &amp; so loth to depart from it, because they wold styll continue without checke of true doctrine, which calleth men to repentaunce, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of lyfe, or els threateneth eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For howsoeuer it pleaseth them to charge the doctrine of the Gospell with cause of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it may easely be sene by comparison of it, with the doctrine of Popery, whether be cause of security: that which teacheth no satisfaction but one, for them that be penitent in this lyfe: or theirs that hath so many waies to merite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, &amp; to satisfy for synnes, not onely while men lyue in the world, but also for them that are already gone out of it. And ther is no wine so swéete to the taste of a carnall man, as that which maketh hym droonke with opinion of his own righteousnes, as it is the nature of strong wyne, to make very Cowardes thynke them selues to be valiant Champions: and such is the cup of popish doctrine, contayning merites and satisfactions.</p>
            <p>Agayne, when we consider that Antichrist should make men droonke wyth hys erroneous doctrine, we maruel lesse how men could be so blinded and infatuate, that they could not sée and perceiue such grosse errours, and manifest vntruthes as are in Popery. For as they that are ouercome with the strength of wyne, haue lost the right vse, both of their wyt, and of their sences: euen so they that are droonke with the hereticall doctrine of Papistry, do grope in the cleare light of the Sunne, and sée not their own

In like maner, they that be ouercome with the vnhonest loue of Harlots, haue theyr reason so imprisoned in corrupt affection and foolish fantasy, that they are at libertye neither to see their own folly, nor admit any wyse and godly counsel.

               </gap>roke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, this is chiefest of their fornication, and this is the iust iudgement of God, that they which haue shut vp their eares from hearyng the truth, should be deceiued with strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that they myght beleue lyes. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, by the names of these vices, the Angell comprehendeth all other vices that followe of them, as intemperancy, arrogancy, impudency, and such like as are woont to follow dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and incontinence. For these crimes go not vnaccompanied, for wher either of them is, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly both will be, &amp; they haue either of them, and both together, their trayne to wayte vpon them.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of these so great and haynous enormities the iust sentence of God, pronounced here by the Angel, is come vpon her, that she is now in her fall and decay, as she was once in her ruffe and glory. But this especially is to be noted, that the Angell here saith, that <hi>She should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue al nations with the fury of her fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For thys is the great vniuersallity that they make so great bragges of, and would haue it to be a certaine Note and Marcke of the catholike church to be vniuersal: Behold the Angel here saith in playne wordes, that all nacions should drinke of the wyne of the fury of her fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wher is then the vniuersall consent and vnity of all nacions in religion, that maketh a true religion? And yet vniuersallity and vnity be two great pillers of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for my part I do not enui her those marks which shee challengeth of vniuersallity and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (although wee might stand in law with her for them) but let her peaceably enioy them: for they may helpe to proue her to be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> false church of Antichrist, but they cannot make her to be the true church of Christ.

            <p>And here also is answered one great mighty obiection, wherwith they thinke to chekers: That séeing the church of Christ, is the Spouse of Christ, how could it be that Christ should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his Spouse, and suffer her to continue in damnable errours, so many hundred yeares? Why, Christ him selfe declareth, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites and errors of false Prophets should be so great, that if it were possible, the very Elect should be deceiued.
