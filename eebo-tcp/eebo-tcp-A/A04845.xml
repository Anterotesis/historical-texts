            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>My end and purpose therein, if charitie interpret for mee, will be found nothing lesse than vaine ostentation.

But so I meane; both to avoide the suspicion of a fault which the world laboureth of (flattering of great personages) who was and am content that all mine expectations in any respecte from them or theirs, bee laid in the same dust vvherein their bones lye; and to shew that <hi>loue is stronger then death,</hi> and that the vnexorable barres of the graue cannot forbid a man to continue that affection to the memory of the dead vvhich he carried to the living. For which cause, as others provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded spices and balmes, and monuments of stone or brasse to preserue their bodies, so I intended a monument of paper, and such other preservatiues as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I coulde, to keepe their names in life, which the violence of time cannot so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye iniurye, as the fatall vngratefulnesse of these latter daies.</p>
                  <p>But your Lordshippes most vndeserved and vnlooked for bounty towards mee, hath altered that meaninge. In whose countenance &amp; speech evermore from the first houre that I came into your honorable presence, there dwelt such plentifull comfortes and encouragements to make me hope
<pb facs="tcp:8475:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for better times, that I never went a way, but with more fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to my bones. And now the world can witnesse vvith mee, how largely you haue opened your hand, and sealed vp that care, in freely bestowing vpon mee not <hi>Leah but Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel,</hi> even the daughter of your strength, the best that your Honour had to bestow, I say not for my service of twice 7. yeares, but being yet to begin my first houres attendance. Which more then credible benignity, my right hande were vvorthye to forgette her cunninge, if shee tooke not the first occasion to write and report with the best skill shee hath.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding I haue bene bold thus farre, after the trees shaken and the vintage gathered to your Honours vse, to leaue as it were a berrye or two in the vtmost boughes to my former Lordes; and by making some little mention of their happy memories, both to testify mine auncient duety towards them, and to deliver them, what I might, from the night of forgetfulnesse, who were the <hi>shining lampes</hi> of the North in their life time. Such a Moses and such an Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, such a Josuah to lead the people, and such a Priest to beare the Arke, such a Zorobabel, and such a Jehozadak, such a Centurion in Capernaum to rule the country, and such a Jairus to governe the Synagogue, when the Lorde shall send togither againe, I will then saie hee hath restored his blessing amongst them. To this purpose I haue added two sermons more, to these Lectures vppon Ionas, the one preached at the funeralles of my former Lord the late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Yorke; the other no way pertinent to the latter, the right noble Earle of Huntingdon, except because hee commanded it, and it was not many weekes before his death, and the subiect was so agreeable to his most faithfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined heart. For if the sound of the tongue and applause of the handes may perswade for him, he never behelde the light of heaven within this land, that more honoured <hi>the
<pb facs="tcp:8475:5"/>
light of England.</hi> Long may it sparkle and flame amongst vs according to his harty wishes. Let neither distempered hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours within quench it, nor all the waters of the sea betwixt Spaine and vs, bring rage and hostility enough to put it out, but let the light of Gods owne most blessed countenance for ever &amp; ever shine vpon it.</p>
                  <p>It nowe remaineth, that in the humblest manner I can, I wholy resigne my selfe and the course of my life to your honourable both protection and disposition; askinge pardon for my boldnesse, and defense for these my simple en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, &amp; beseeching the God of heaven &amp; earth, to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his richest blessings, vpon your Honour, your Lady, and your Children whither within or without the land.</p>

Of all the fovvles of the ayre, I meane the Prophetes of the LORDE, flying from heaven vvith the winges of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, I haue chosen the Doue, (for so the name of Ionah im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, and Ierome so rendereth it to Paulinus) to bee the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte of my labour and travell vndertaken amongest you; vvho vnder the type of his shipwracke and escape, figuringe the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and resurrection of the sonne of GOD, and comming from the sea of Tharsis, as that Doue of Noahs Arke came from the vvaters of the floude, vvith an oliue branch in his lippes in signe of peace, preacheth to Niniveh, to the Gentiles, to the vvhole vvorlde, the vndeserved goodnesse of GOD towardes repentant sinners. For if you vvill knowe in briefe, vvhat the argument of this Prophet is, it is abridged in that sentence of the Psalme,<note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the prophecie. Psal. 145.</note> 
                     <hi>The LORDE is mercifull and gracious, of longe suffering, and of grette goodnesse</hi>: Hee is mercifull, in the first parte of the prophecy, to the Mariners; gracious, in the seconde, to Ionas; long suffering, in the thirde, to the Ninivites; and of great goodnesse, in the fourth, in pleading the rightfulnesse of his mercie, and yeelding a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his facte to him vvhich had no reason to demaunde it. So from the foure chapters of Ionas, as from the foure windes, is sent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8475:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a comfortable breath and gale of most aboundant mercies. And as the foure streames in paradise flowing from one heade, vvere the same water in foure divisions; so the foure chapters or sections of this treatise are but quadruple mercie, or mercie in foure parts. And so much the rather to bee harkened vnto, as an action of mercie is more gratefull vnto vs, then the contemplation, the vse then the knowledge, the example then the promise: and it is sweeter to our taste beeing experienced by proofe, then vvhen it is but taught and discoursed. You heare the principall matter of the prophecie.

To keepe his manner and vse of foretelling the plague before hee inflicteth it. 2. to set vp a standard of hope to the rest of the Gentiles, that they also should pertake the goodnes of God. 3. to prevent his people with mercy, and to take vp favour in Assyria for them before hand, against the time of their banishmente. 4. to shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the house of Israell, with the singular repentance of a strange people.

I will not enter into coniectures too farre;<note place="margin">1 Reason.</note> but surely it is likely enoughe, that either by the lookes, or speech, or attire, or behaviour, or some forepassed devotion, or other the like notice, the maister conceaved a good opinion of Ionas.

It may be, the maister of the shippe vvas so perswaded of Ionas, that though he were but one to a multitude, a stranger amongst strangers, a scholler and puny amongst marchants, and souldiours, whose state and carriage was every way beyond his; yet he might haue a spirit, blessing, and wisedome beyond all theirs, and therefore repaireth vnto him, <hi>Arise, call vpon thy God.</hi> How one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and incomparable vvas the favour vvhich Abraham the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many people found in the eyes of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> who being but dust and ashes, as himselfe confessed, pleaded vvith his maker as one would reason with his neighbour in the behalfe of Sodom, with six sundry replies, from fifty to ten righteous persons, vvhich number if it had beene founde, Sodom had escaped?<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> How deare was the soule of Lot, in that fearefull destruction, on vvhome the Lorde bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life, and the life of his wife and children, &amp; the safety of Zoar a litle city not far of, because he had entreated for it? the Angell pluckt him into the house from the fury of the Sodomites, and not lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pluckt him out of the city, (who made but slowe hast) bidding him flee to Zoar to saue his life,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note>

But when they saw their folly herein, <hi>as a thiefe is ashamed</hi> (saith God) <hi>when he is founde, so was the house of Israell ashamed, they and their kings, their Princes, their Priestes, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, because they had said to a tree, Thou art my father, and to a stone, Thou hast begotten me.</hi> He yet proceedeth against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>They haue turned their backe to me, and not their face, but in their time of trouble they will say, Arise, and helpe vs.</hi> You see the fits and pangs of idolatours.

What to doe? the dead to visit the deade; to honour stockes, and to come home stockes; to chaunge the aire, and to retaine their former behaviour; to doe penaunce for sinne, and to returne laden with a greater sinne of most irreligious superstition, meeter to bee repented, if they knew their sinne. Of such I may say, as Socrates sometime aunswered one, who marveiled that hee reaped so litle profit by his trauell: Thou art well enough served, saith he, because thou didest travell by thy selfe; for it is not mountaines and seas, but the conference of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that giveth vvisedome: neither can monumentes and graues, but the spirit of the Lord, vvhich goeth not with those gadders, put holinesse into them. They haue their walkes and excursions which go from their natiue countrey to Rome, (the first time to see naught, the second to be naught, the third to die naught; was the olde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe.)

The first &amp; last now a daies are not much different: they go to learne naught, they drinke vp poison there like a restoratiue, vvhich they keepe in their stomacks along Italy, France, other nations, not minding to disgordge it, till they come to their mothers house, where they seek to vnlade it in her bosome, &amp; to end her happy daies. Ionas, for ought these knew, might haue come from his countrey, a robber, murtherer, traitor, or any the like transgressor, &amp; therfore haue ran fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, as Onesimus from his master Philemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to escape iustice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they aske him, <hi>whence commest thou</hi>? that they may learne both the occasion &amp; scope of his iourney.

Such is the wisdome that God inspireth into the harts of men, for the triall of his truth, &amp; in the honor of iustice, to fit their demands to the conscience of the transgressours in such sort, that they shall even feele themselues to be touched, and so closely rounded in the eare, as they cannot deny their offence. <hi>There are diverse administrations yet but one spirit</hi>: Warriours haue a spirit of courage to fight, counsellors to direct &amp; prevent, magistrates to governe, iudges to discerne, examine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and to do right vnto all people.

                  <p>I haue a further coniecture of their meaning at this time. For Ionas presented vnto them a double person: a sinner, a fugitiue servaunt, a rebell against the Lorde; but vvithall, a prophet, one that is seene and skilled in the counsailes of the Almightie. They knowe themselues ignoraunt and barbarous men: for howsoever they might bee otherwise learned in the wisedome of Egypt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Vpon the perswasion heereof, they referre themselues to the vvisedome and integritie of Ionas.

                  <p>There is yet a further matter to bee considered, vvhich both the order of thinges precedent, and the circumstaunces of the text now in hand, mooue me to obserue.

Doth the sea sit still (as Elias sate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Iuniper tree, and cried, <hi>it is enough</hi>?) or settle her waters vpon her slime and gravell, and not fulfill the commandement of him that made it? No: but as a Gyant refresht with wine, so it renueth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubleth her wonted force, feeleth not the labour imposed, but doth the worke of the Lord with all possible diligence. The Lord saith, <hi>go, and it goeth,</hi> and it goeth with a witnes, as Iehu marched, of whom the watchman gaue warning, he marcheth like a mad man: so doth the sea go furiously, with an vnquiet, hasty, turbulent spirit, full of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and zeale, till God haue avenged himselfe against his diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient servaunt.

                  <p>The daunger was imminent, and called vpon the marriners, Yelde Ionas, or yeeld your selues; the sea importunate, and woulde not be answered.

Their commendation briefly is; that the life of a straunger to them all, a straunger of that land which vvas most hatefull vnto them, the life of an open and convicted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour, the onely matter of their woe, is so precious vnto them.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE order I kept in the verse going before, was this. Three persons were proposed vnto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. the person of Ionas, standing vpon his delivery; 2. the person of the marriners, being in ieopardy; 3. the person of the sea, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troublesome and vnquiet vnto them. The two latter whereof, the furiousnes of the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and their owne perill, were mighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to incense them against Ionas. In this verse he answereth their whole demaunde: 1. touching my selfe, you aske, what you shall doe vnto me? <hi>Take me, cast me into the sea.</hi> By this meanes, 2. <hi>the sea shall be quieted,</hi> 3. <hi>towardes you,</hi> against whome it is now enraged. This for the order and coherence. Now for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it selfe, it is devided into three branches: 1. the resolution, decree and sentence of Ionas vpon himselfe, <hi>Take me, cast me into the sea</hi>; 2. the end, and it may be, the motiue to harten them, <hi>So shall the sea be quiet vnto you</hi>; 3. the reason, warrant, or iustification of their fact, <hi>For I knowe that for my sake &amp;c.</hi> The verse riseth by degrees. You aske, what you shall doe with me? <hi>Cast me into the sea.</hi> What is that for our safety? Yes, <hi>the sea shall be quiet vnto you.</hi> But howe may we purchase our peace with so vniustifieable an action? Right well: <hi>For I know that for my sake the tempest is vpon you.</hi>

that he would never haue given that liberty vnto them against his life, but that he heard them say, vnlesse he went to Niniveh, they would cast him forth. There is not a syllable in the text, to iustifie this iudgement. For Ionas had made a reverent confession of God; a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular testimony of a minde recalling it selfe. And as for the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what kindnes they shewed him, both before, and after, the letter of the scripture plainly demonstrateth. I rather take it to be a doome of most propheticall and resolute magnanimity, wrestling with the terrors of death, as Israell with God, and prevailing against them.

VVho perswaded them? he that spake vvith GOD, concerning Ahab, <hi>I wilbe a lying spirite in the mouthes of all his Prophetes, to deceaue Ahab</hi>; a spirite of errour and falshoode, a spirite borne and bread within their owne braine.

Therefore they sinne a sinne, which the darkest darkenesse in hell is too easie to requite, who, when they haue spilte the bloud of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, like water vpon the grounde, defiled their neighbours bed, troubled the earth, and provoked heauen, vvith many pernitious, infamous mischiefes, rapes, robberies, proditions, burninges, spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, depopulations &amp;c. spewe out a blasphemy against righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe, countenauncing their sinnes by authoritie of him who hateth sinne, and pleading that they haue done but the will of God in doing such outrages.

giue you vnderstanding in all thinges.</hi> He hath spurres for their flankes and sides, which they neuer imagined.

                  <p>Thus the will of God is one way renounced, and as sure as hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and raigneth in heauen, shall at the same time, and in the same action some other way be perfourmed.

To thinke, to see, to desire, to mooue the partes of the body, were the good creatures of God, (therein consisteth the action:) but to turne these giftes of God to so vile a purpose, was the sinne of Cain, the fault of the action, proper and singular to his owne person.</p>

                     <hi>I deny it, chuse vvhether you vvill beleeue.</hi> The conversion of Paul, was the regeneration and newe birth of one that was a straunger to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes of God; the adultery of Dauid, the fall and escape of a Saint; the treason of Iudas, the damned apostasie of a reprobate. The conversion of Paul was the proper worke of God, whom Sathan had held in darkenesse and in the shadowe of death whilst the world had stoode, if God had not cast him into a trance, blindinge the eies, and killinge the senses of his body for a time, but illuminatinge his minde, changing his heart, creating a new spirit within him, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both to his eares and conscience vvith an effectuall calling. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hee founde no vvill in him fitte for his mercies, but wrought both the vvill and the worke to. In the adultery of Dauid, and the treason of Iudas, hee founde the vvill eagerly prepared to iniquity; God doth but vse that will: they runne of themselues, God staieth not behinde, but runneth with them, though to an other end; they to the satisfaction of their naughty lustes, God to the declaration of his righteous and vvise iudgementes. And although he loueth not their sinnes, yet hee loueth and is delighted vvith the execution of his admirable iustice hanging therevpon. And albeit neither the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of David, nor the treason of Iudas be his proper workes; yet God hath his proper working in both their workes.

In the afflicting of Iob (for example sake) Sathan hath leaue to lay his hand vpon Iob: his servauntes are slaine, his ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, asses, and camelles taken and driuen away by Sabaeans and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans.

A man mighte imagine, that either Sathan and the Sabaeans shalbe excused, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving society in this action with God; or God brought into question, for having society with them. Neither of both: The difference of their intentions setteth them as farre asunder, as heauen is from the earth at her lowest center. God hath a purpose to try the patience &amp; constancy of Iob, to reforme the opinion of his owne innocencie, to make him knowe that hee was but man, and to finde an occasion of powring greater blessings vpon him; Sathan to shew his envy, and malice to mankinde, to driue him to desperation; the Sabaeans to store vp treasures of vvickednesse, and to shew that stolne bread is sweet vnto them. The envy and malignity of Sathan, whence is it? of God?

Abandon the light of the sunne whereby our aire is brightened and illuminated, you neede not carefully enquire or painefully labour how to come by darknesse, the deficiencie and fayling of the light, is a cause sufficient to bring in darknesse.

                     <hi>I shalbe such as God hath fore-seene I should be. Who therin</hi> (saith Augustine) <hi>both spake a trueth, and yet was no whit bettered to amendment of life by that trueth.</hi> O damned absurdity, rooting her wickednes in heaven, as if the prescience and will of God were the cause of our sinning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his prescience is but the antecedent to our sins going before them, (for, because we sin, therfore they are foreknowne; not, because they are foreknowne, therefore we sin:) and his will is but the consequent, following vpon them. I say againe, God hath a will and purpose in the sins of vnrighteous men; not that he liketh the sins, but he orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth &amp; governeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in wise manner, &amp; turneth them to some end that well pleaseth him. And <hi>though he willeth not the evill it selfe, yet the doing of the evill doth in some respectes content him.</hi> And that will in God is consequent to our will. For albeit it were before ours in time (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his will is as ancient as himselfe, even from everlasting) yet in order and course of thinges, it commeth behinde it, and he that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the will of God, in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner (or rather the will of God is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled vpon him) shall hang in hell for his service; so little thankes is he likely to reape at Gods handes. For there is no question, <hi>but God doeth fulfill good purposes of his owne, by the ill purposes of ill men.</hi> Iudas was not yet formed, nor any member of his body set togither or fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when they were <hi>all written in the booke of God.</hi> He saw his treason in the glasse of his foreknowledge, and <hi>vnderstoode his thoughtes a far off.</hi> There was <hi>not a word in his tongue</hi> but God was long since acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it. He knew that his will was bent to mischiefe, from before the world was established. Now God hath a will vpon and after the will of Iudas, and thus he bethinketh himselfe. Iudas hath a will to betray his maister, I will not stop his will, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vert it to some good vse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will draw a preservative against poison fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very poison of a serpent, I wil declare my power &amp; skill therby.

I will shew my iudgements amongst all nations vpon Iudas and his complices; &amp; by the fruites of that bitter roote, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest treachery that ever hell cast vp, I will save mankinde. Iudas him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe never intended therein either to magnifie the power of God, or to manifest his iustice, or to deliver any of his brethren, vvho, I dare say, never conceived therein how his owne singular soule might be saved. So then, Iudas committed a treason, and God foresawe a treason, whose knowledge is as great as himselfe, and the workes of a thousand generations to come as present vnto him as that vvhich

Thus al things are done according to the foreknowledge &amp; will of almighty God; necessary things of necessity, contingent by contingency and happe, as we call it, naturall by kindely course, voluntary with ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and choise, their natures neither changed, nor any way enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the foresaid meanes. I conclude with Saint Augustin, <hi>God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated me with free will</hi> (hee speaketh of freedome from coaction,) <hi>If I have sinned, It was I that sinned; it was neither destiny, nor fortune, nor the devill. I will pronounce against my selfe, not against the Lord.</hi> I knowe I sin of necessity in one sence, because the corruption of nature hath remooved that originall integrity wherin man was first created; but I sin not violently, because mine owne will is reserved vnto me. For, as it was true of man in the state of innocency, <hi>Potest non peccare, hee may, if he will, not sin,</hi> because God lefte him in the hande of his owne counselles, and gave him liberty both waies; so it is now as true in the state of corruption, <hi>Non potest non peccare, he cannot chuse but sinne,</hi> the whole lumpe of his nature being sowred with that auncient lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; neither shall he ever be delivered from the corruption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he is subiect, till he attaine to the state of glorification, wherein it shall as certainely be verified, <hi>non potest peccare, he cannot sin</hi> though he would, corruption having put on incorruption both in body and spirit. Which necessity of sinning the meane time is not in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cause, either creator or creatures, but in the decayed nature of man, vpon the fall wherof commeth vanity in the mind, and a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes in the will to depart from the living God. Now I returne to my former assertion, that nothing is done without the wil of God, &amp; yet the will of man therby no way corrupted or compelled.

Ab illo est quòd statur, non est ab illo quòd ruitur, From him it commeth that we all stand, but not from him that any falleth: and many have beene helde that they fell not, no man pushed at to cause him to fall.</hi> Onelie hee casteth them downe <hi>by a consequence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee giveth not his grace which might have susteined them: as if a nurse lend not her hand to support her childe, the childe will fall, I graunte, but the cause of the falling is the vveakenesse and debility of the childe, the nurse no further the cause thereof, then that shee did not hinder it. Which though it bee a fault amongst vs, because wee are members one of the other, and tied togither by the bonde of charity, yet it is no fault in God, who having pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his clay, may worke at his pleasure either in iudgement, to make it a vessell of dishonour, or of honour in mercy. For manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of this latter point, that God instilleth not malice into the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours, in this execution of his iudgementes by punishing sinne by sinne, but finding these vesselles of iniquity full fraught of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, leaveth them with the season of their owne licour, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applieth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his wisedome to some good service of his; though I were able to open it vnto you in all the examples before alleadged, yet I will rest, in the seducement and fall of Ahab. Wherein it may seeme, that God doth not onely permitt the false spirit,<note place="margin">1. King. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou shalt seduce Ahab,</hi> but giveth encouragement also, <hi>thou shalt prevaile,</hi> and addeth a commaundement, <hi>goe forth,</hi> and alloweth of the forme of dealing in the matter, <hi>doe so.</hi> Now that you may knowe how innocent the Lord is in an action of such preiudice, observe the circumstances of the place well. 1. The thing intended is, <hi>that Ahab <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> might fall at Ramoth Gilead.</hi> Which purpose of God once set, is so vnchangeable, that if heaven and earth were confederate, they can not save the life of Ahab. God shall send forth a spirit, the spirit deceave prophets, prophets entice Ahab, Ahab change his appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and though Iehoshaphat be the fairer marke, yet Iehoshaphat shall escape, and one shall draw an arrowe by chance, and smite A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab betwixte his brigandine, and hee shall dye at evening; hee did so. Therefore touching the ende of this businesse, it is no iniustice in God, to execute iudgement and wrath vpon a famous adversary. 2. Concerning the meanes, enquiry was made who should entice A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> because in the nature of God himselfe it was not to entice him. 3.

The spirit commeth furnished <hi>of his owne,</hi> for vvhen one saide thus, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> otherwise, he profered his service to to entice him. 6. When God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> demaunded of the meanes, hee invented the practise, by being a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> false spirit in the mouth of his prophets. 7. What were those prophets of Ahab? men that were faithlesse of themselues, whose guise it was, either for rewardes, or for favour of the king, to say <hi>they had dreamed</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they had not, and <hi>the Lorde hath saide,</hi> when hee never saide it. So there is both malice in the spirit, and falshood in the prophets, <hi>before God setteth</hi> either hand or hearte to the businesse. Therefore what doth the Lord therin? he fitteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the throne as the iudge &amp; moderator of the whole action, hee comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the attendance of al the army of heaven on the right hande and on the lefte, cleane and vncleane spirites are in subiection to him, hee giveth leave to them who without his leave are vnable to doe any thinge, <hi>thou shalt entice</hi>; hee giveth the successe, which all the kingdome of darkenes coulde not effect, if hee woulde hinder it, <hi>thou shalt prevaile</hi>; he biddeth <hi>goe,</hi> and they goe, runne, and they runne, to shew that all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the worlde serue him; hee disposeth the course, <hi>Do so,</hi> that is, doe so and no more than so; as much as to say, Since thou hast malice to bestowe, extende it vpon Ahab rather than Iehoshaphat; and falshood to infuse, powre it forth vpon the 400. prophets of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab rather than vpon Michaeas or any prophet of mine; and let the fall of Ahab be at Ramoth Gilead rather than in another place, and in this battaile with the king of Aram, rather than at another time. Thus when the matter is their owne, God giveth the fashioning and ordering thereof in some sorte, touching the persons, time, place, and other the like particulars. But why is it further saide, that God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> put a lying spirit into the mouth of these prophets of Ahab? 1. hee did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it by way of a punishment, to bee avenged of that custome of lying, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which they were inured vnto aforetime: 2. hee did it by his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">

                  <p>By this time, I thinke, it appeareth, that in the actions and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of vnrighteous men, there is more to bee deemed of God than his bare permission. For doubtlesse hee hath his will therein, neither in alluring, neither in counselling, and much lesse in compellinge thereunto, but in ordering and governing them, in applying them to better endes than the oftendours are aware of, and in ordeining
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8475:134"/>
his iust iudgements consequently thereupon. Therefore when I say he hath his will therein, mistake me not. He hath not a will in such sort as if he approved sin, chose or desired sin, as if he bare appetite &amp; liking thereto. It is rather <hi>voluntas</hi> than <hi>volitio,</hi> if I may so speake, <hi>a wil than a willingnes</hi>; it is his will by obliquity, a side-will, vnproper,<note place="margin">

Thus hee permitted, and (more) hee decreed the treason of Iudas, and iniquity of the Ievves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his annointed sonne, as you have it confessed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Actes the fourth; <hi>that Herode and Pilate with the Gentiles and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israell gathered themselves togither against the holy sonne of GOD Iesus, to doe whatsoever his hande and his counsell had determined before to be done.</hi> God had determined it before, not in the favour of their sinne, but of our redemption.<note place="margin">

Happily they take the substance of their brethren, and by taking such snares away, saue their soules; or, if they take their liues, they ease &amp; vnlade them of a great burthen of their sinnes to come. The drunkard drinketh himselfe a sleepe, not God, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his owne senses and wits into a trance, but provoketh &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the righteous Lorde to do a worke of iustice.

The murtherer that spoileth the life of his mortall brethren, if every wish of his hearte were a two edged sworde, shall never kill the life of Gods immortall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

Sathan did service to God, it cannot bee denied, in the afflicting of Iob, winnowing of Peter, buffeting of Paul, executing of Iudas, and God did a worke in all these, either to proove patience, or to confirme faith, or to trie strength, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend iustice; yet is Sathan <hi>reserved in chaines, vnder darkenes, to the

                  <p>The ends of the Iewish sacrifices, if I mistake not, were these. First, to acknowledge therein, that death is the stipende of sinne, which though it were due to him &amp; those that sacrificed, yet was it transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; laid vpon the beast that offended not. Secondly, to figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, the killing of the lambe of God, which all the faithfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Thirdly, to testifie the submissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the hart, which in these vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible samplers, shone as a light before the whole world. So spoiling the sacrifice of the last of these endes, they make it in manner a lying signe, &amp; leaue it as voide of life &amp; breath, as the beastes which they immolate.

                  <p>The iustice and mercy of God runne togither in this history, as those that runne for the maisterie in a race.

Now whither he fulfilled that time exactly, yea or no, three na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dayes complete, consisting of twenty foure howres, neither can I affirme, neither is it materiall over-busily to examine.

Hugo Cardin. hath an other conceite, that from the creation of the worlde till the resurrection of Christ, the day was evermore numbred before the night, both in the literall and in the mysticall vnderstanding; first there was light, then darknes: but from the resurrection of Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, the night is first reckoned: (for which cause he thought, the vigiles were apointed for sabbathes &amp; other festivall daies, that vvee might be prepared with more devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to solemnize them:) herehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, that the night which followed the sabbath of the Iews, was the angular night (&amp; must twice be repeated,<note place="margin">

So they are not content to be sober interpretours of the minde of God, but they wil ghesse and divine at that which he never meant. They thinke their cunning abased, if they go not beyond the moone to fetch an exposition. What needeth such curious learning, to apoint every egge to the right hen that laid it, as some did in Delos, so these to think their labor vnprofitable in the church of God, vnlesse they can make the devises of their own heads reach home to the letter of the booke in al respects? Our soundest divines agree, that the triduan rest of Christ in the graue, must be vnderstood by the figure <hi>synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi> a part put for the whole. And thus they make their account: the first day of his passion &amp; enterrement (which was the preparation of the Iewish sabbath) must haue the former night set to it. The second was fully &amp; exactly run out. The third had the night complete, and only a piece of the first day of the weeke, which by the figure before named, is to be holpen &amp; supplied. Now I go forwardes to explicate the behavior of Ionas in the belly of the fish. Therein we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. what the history speaketh of Ionas, 2. what he speaketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

For so it is: he lieth in the belly of the fish, as if he had entered into his bed-chamber, &amp; cast himselfe vpon his couch, recounting his former sinnes, present miseries, praying, beleeving, hoping, preaching vnto himselfe the deliveraunces of God, with as free a spirite as ever he preached to the children of Israell vpon dry lande.<note place="margin">

He is not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which, as you heard, is sometimes a marke of impiety. 2. He doth not mutter to himselfe, as the philosophers in the Poet, humming within themselves, and vttering a kinde of vnsensible and vnarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late silence. 3. He doth more than speake: for that might argue the heart of a man but indifferently disposed to obtaine. 4. He speaketh with most endevored contention, he crieth vnto the Lord, &amp; when he hath once cried, crieth againe, &amp; with an other kinde of crying. For as if the former word were not enough, a latter is added, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie either a different kinde, or if the same, in a more intensive and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible affection. This ingemination, either of one and the same word again repeated, or of sundry bearing the same sense, giveth as it were a double strength to the declaration of that which is delivered.

But this is likewise cleared in the 102. Psal. where it is saide, <hi>that hee hath looked downe from the height of his sanctuary, out of the heaven did the LORDE beholde the earth</hi>; to what other ende? but <hi>that hee might heare the mourning of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and deliver the children apointed vnto death.</hi> And this moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I am sure of, that the LORDE hath often and expressely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vs, <hi>Call vpon mee</hi>: and if the booke were searched through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with cresset-light, never would it bee prooved, that hee gave any charge to call vpon others. Neither was ever the shadowe of any thing so faithfull to the bodye, to followe and waite vpon it, as the successe of good speede hath beene consequent to a prayer faithfullye made. For, as if their soules were knit togither, like the soules of Dauid and Ionathan, you shall ever see them ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So in the fourth Psalme, <hi>I called vpon the LORDE, and hee hearde mee at large</hi>: and an hundreth the like might bee alleadged for confirmation. And therefore if vvee erre in this point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, vvee may say truelye with Ieremy, <hi>Thou hast deceived vs LORDE, vvhen vvee vvere deceaved,</hi> that is, when wee were vvilled to call vpon thee alone, thine vvas the blame, if wee doe amisse, and wee may comfort our selves that wee erre by warrant and authority from him, that must pardon errours. Therefore I conclude from the two and twentieth Psalme; <hi>Praise the Lorde yee that feare him, magnifie him all the seede of Iacob, and feare him all yee the seede of Israell. For hee hath not despised the lowe estate of the poore, nor hidde himselfe from him, but when he called, hee harkened vnto him.</hi> Let the house of Esau vse the liberty of the wide worlde, and the feede of Babylon call vpon other helps as they have done,

And it is besides, a singular testification of his thankefull minde; who receaveth not the favour of God as the nine lepers in the gospell receaved their clensing, not returning againe to give thankes to him that cured them, but first reporteth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and as many as shall reade or heare this songe what God hath done for him, <hi>I called vpon the Lorde, and hee hearde mee,</hi> (which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further of;) and then with a nearer approche ioyning his soule as closely to the eares of God, as Philip ioyned himselfe to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the Eunuch, relateth the blessing of his prayer to the authour himselfe of all blessings, <hi>And thou Lorde hardest my voice</hi>; thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vnto him <hi>grace for grace,</hi> a kinde and dutifull rememoration, for the mercies bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>MAGINE the songe of Ionas to consist of three partes, a proposition, narration, and a conclusion; and the proposition alreadye to bee past in the seconde verse, summarilye abridging the beginning, proceeding and ending of the matter in hande, that is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, praier, and deliveraunce of Ionas. The narration nowe followeth to the eighth and ninth, wherein hee concludeth: so that all that lyeth betweene the seconde and those, maketh but for exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for both his daunger is more amplie described, and his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers often mentioned, and a frequent hope of his deliveraunce inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. And it is well worthy your considering, that as musicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of <hi>acutum</hi> and <hi>grave, high and lovve, sharpe and flatte,</hi> so this song of Sion which Ionas singeth in a strange lande, vvith a far hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier hearte then ever Israell sange by the rivers of Babylon, is mixte and compounded of two kindes of soundes. For on the one side, are daungers, terrours, desperations and deiections of minde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hearde, but on the other, the sweetest comfortes and ioyes of the holy Ghost that coulde be conceived. First in the third verse, <hi>Thou hadst cast mee into the bottome of the sea,</hi> with many exaggerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to declare his feare. But in the fourth, <hi>Yet vvill I looke againe to thy holy temple.</hi> Againe in the fifth, <hi>The waters compassed mee aboute vnto the soule, &amp;c.</hi> But in the sixte, <hi>Yet haste thou broughte vp my life from the pitte, O LORDE my God.</hi> Lastly in the seventh, <hi>My soule fainted vvithin mee, yet I remembred the LORDE, and my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came vnto thee into thine holie temple.

As who should say, I laye not in a calme, but looke where the waters were most vnpeaceable and vnquiet, even there was I compassed about and had no waye to passe forth. The sea is otherwise disquieted, when either the windes in the aire, or flawes from the vawtes and breaches of the ground, raise vp the waues thereof. For the earth hath aire oftentimes impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the hollownes of it, which being inwardly choked, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to get out, sometimes shaketh the ioyntes of the land with earth-quakes, sometimes setteth the people of the sea in a rage, and bringeth a furious commotion vpon the face of the waters. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ionas being carryed through the Mid-land sea, having the land on both sides of it, must needes bee troubled the more, by reason the waters haue not so free a passage as in the patent Ocean, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make a way with sorer impatience. Giue them streame at will, and there is lesse daunger of travaile, but straighten their course, and they breake a passage by force, and shewe what indignation they can against the barres that hinder them. By common experience at home in lockes and mill-dammes wee see what catarrhactes and downe-falles there are by the rage of the water, what hast it maketh to passe, how vnpatiently it roreth because her liberty is denied her. But those that ever passed the Magellan straightes, or entred the mouth of the Gaditan sea betwixt Europe and Africke, where Spaine and Barbary is devided, to make a voiage into Barbary, or any other

coast within the Mid-land sea, know it to be most true, not by easie experience alone, but by the adventure both of their vesselles and their liues also. So as, you see, the very nature of these seas, where the propinquity &amp; enclosure of the continent did so much annoye them on every side, partly by breathing vpon them out of manye holes and ruptures thereof, partly by lessening their channell, besides the ordinary windes which raised vp their billowes, and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary providence of God which delt more strongly than al these, did the more afflict Ionas.</p>

Ionas, thou art deceived. Thou speakest more to thy selfe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever the Lord said. Hee that cast thee into the sea, or caused the mariners to doe it, never said, that he cast thee out of his sight; &amp; if thou hadst askt the seas and the flouds wherein thou wert overwhelmed, they would never haue said it.

This vvas the snare that he set for the soule of Iob in the mouthes of his three friendes pronouncinge him a reprobate, and hypocrite, because hee was afflicted by God.

He that is throwne into this sea, is alwaies falling and descending, and never findeth an end. It hath no midst in it, as the sea hath, because it is vnmeasurable and infinite: I meane a desperate conscience, distrusting the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, relinquished of it selfe; the floudes and surges whereof, restlesse, turbulent, vnplacable cogitations can never be quieted, and the fightings therein, as betwixt waters and waters in the sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene affirmations &amp; negations (it is and it is not) cannot be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.

There is no entrance (I meane) for any perswasion of the graciousnes &amp; kindnes of the Lord, though it be preached a thousand times. The salt, vnsavory, bitter quality in the soule, wherewith it is baned before, hath no communion with so sweete a nature. Which sin of desperation as the nature of man hath iust cause to detest, because it breaketh that league of kindnes which we owe to our owne flesh, &amp; many a bloudy instrument hath it put into the hands of man to destroy himselfe, (which execution beeing done against the laws of nature, a worse ever ensueth from the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fear of God) so for that iniury &amp; indignity which it ostreth to the Lord of heaven, sooner shal he forgiue the apostasie of his reprobate angels, than this da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned sin.

Is it not more for a man to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent handes vpon himselfe, than to indure it at the handes of another? yet that the devill hath thus farre prevailed with many, wee knowe by frequent experience.</hi> He addeth. <hi>It is true that the true Martyrs are very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to suffer death Which proceedeth not from studipity, but from loue; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there an amission or leesing, but a submission of sense in them: not that paine is away, but for the loue of Christ, they vanquish and contemne it.</hi> The Apostle doth rightly expresse the cause of their wonderful pacience. <hi>In all these</hi> (he doth not say, we are more than men) but <hi>we are more than conquerours.</hi> I returne to the Stoickes. It fell out that one of that sect was sicke at Lebadia. His disease was a fever, wherewith hee was so afflicted, that he groned deepely and inwardly to himselfe, yet would skarcely seeme to doe it. Taurus willing to excuse him (a philosopher of a diverse profession) you haue seene a sight, saith hee not pleasaunt, yet profitable to bee knowne; a philosopher and paine wrestling and combating togither.<note place="margin">

                  <p>His danger by land is likewise expressed in two members of the 6. verse. First he was <hi>descended to the bottomes,</hi> or <hi>endes,</hi> or <hi>rootes,</hi>

the earth, that is, the strongest muniments and fenses it hath, are the promontories and rockes, which God hath placed in the fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to withstand the force of the waters.

                     <hi>heere will I stay thy prowde waues,</hi>; and if you wil these also are the pillers of the earth, which god hath fixed in such sort that it cannot bee mooved. The meaning of the prophet was, that hee was lockt and warded within the strengh of the earth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looking to bee set at liberty againe. I tolde you before, that the nature of the sea, wherein Ionas travailed, besides the over-naturall working of God, did adde much more trouble vnto him, than if he had past through the Ocean, where he had gained more sea roume, and the continent being farther of, would haue yelded a liberall current, and lesse haue endaungered him. Now he hath land round about him, by reason whereof, the sea is more narrow, rockie, and hilly, apter to stormes, skanter of rodes for safety, and subiect to a number of other incommodities. The course of the seas, through which hee past, was this. First hee tooke shipping at Iapho, and was carried thorough the Syriack sea; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce through Archipelago, or the Aegean; thence thorough Hellespont betwixt Sestus and Aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, where Asia and Europe are divided not by more than seven furlonges, others say but fiue; afterwardes thorough Propontis, where the sea is patent againe, &amp; hath his forth; from thence through Bosphorus Thracius, betwixt Constantinople and Natolia, where the passage is so narrow that an oxe may swimme over; and lastlie to the Euxine sea, where, they hold, hee was set to land. Thus was hee often encumbred with straightes, and never had cause to complaine of overmuch liberty, where he was most favoured, till he came to the dry grounde. Thus far of the daungers both by sea and land. The first extended his rage, not to the chin or lippes of the prophet, but <hi>to his soule</hi>; and threatned him with <hi>a depthe</hi> bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and vnmeasurable, and came not against his life with limpide and pure waters alone, but with other impedimentes, the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pelfe and corruption of the waters.

Then againe, I say, what needeth <hi>in seculum</hi>? so deepe a suspition of the goodnesse of the Lord, as if it had <hi>for ever</hi> relinquished him? it is an effect, which for the most part a vehement griefe worketh in all sortes of men, except some of a Stoicall disposition, and others of a worse, that have seared their heartes with hot irons, and can feele

Ionas made some triall of both these extremities. For when he went fiirst fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of the Lord, and refused a plaine iniunction, what was it els but presumption in him? Now to distrust of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and stifly to affirme that his miseries shall never be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is a spice of desperation. But his wisedome was, that at their first invasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he treadeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n the heades of both these serpents; assoone as he feeleth them sting, he presently armeth himselfe with the grace of God to escape from them. Otherwise, if as the speech of Ionas was <hi>in seculum,</hi> so the thoughtes of his heart had continued <hi>in seculum,</hi> without revocation, then had he also take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp his place amongst those whom God had set on his left hand, and made the mirrours to the world of his irrevocable damnation. For this were <hi>insanabilis plaga,</hi> as Ieremy speaketh, <hi>a wound that never can be cured,</hi> to despaire of the aide of God; as if a surgion should promise helpe to a sore, and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent should thrust his nailes into it, and answere him, nay, but it shall not be healed. It is the iust state of the damned; for when all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vpon the earth besides, liue by hope, (for he that soweth, soweth in hope, and he that reapeth, reapeth in hope, he that liveth, liveth in hope, and he that dieth, dieth in hope, yea the whole creature gron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnder hope, and waiteth <hi>for that time with a fervent desire vvhen the sonnes of God shall be revealed, and it selfe restored,</hi>) these onely are past hope.

The generall partes of all vvhich, were the feare and the hope, daunger and comfort of the prophet; vvhich two affections or conditions (you haue often hearde) the whole songe spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it selfe vpon. His feare and daunger in the last place was, that neither water nor earth spared him. The waters, touching their pride and exaltation, <hi>came vnto his soule</hi>; touching their measure, promised him <hi>no bottome</hi>; touching their traine and confederates, <hi>bounde their vveedes about his heade.</hi> The earth neither lodged him in a smooth and easie floore, but vnder <hi>the rootes and ragges of mountaines,</hi> nor in an haven, or any the like accessible place, but <hi>vvithin her barres.</hi> Notwithstanding, the head of the serpent, vvith all his subtile devises against the life of the prophet, is bruised at the heele of the speech, where one little particle of hope, wipeth out all the former discomfortes: <hi>Yet haste thou brought vp, &amp;c.</hi> Once againe, as heeretofore I dissembled not with you, I must enter into the selfe-same matter of discourse and explication.

Our saviour manifested this difference, both by the ende of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the flesh, which was principally for our soules, after for our bodies, first <hi>to take away the sinnes of the worlde,</hi> which are spirituall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, then to remooue corporall infirmities; and by the behaviour of his owne person amongst vs, who though he suffered his body to bee tried with all kindes of ignominious and accursed vexations, with spittings, whippings, buffetings, and the bitterest death of the crosse, yet was it ever his care to preserue his soule free from staines and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. <hi>It is not thus with the sonnes of men nowe a daies.</hi> They neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the care and culture of their soules, but the lustes of the flesh they make provision for with all possible diligence. They haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the schoole of Hippocrates the physitian, and Epicurus the swine, to physicke and diet their bodies, but the sicknesse and death of the soule, which are their sinnes, they never account of, till they see they must bee punished. O yee sonnes of men, foolish and slowe of hearte to conceiue the rightest thinges, howe long will yee loue such vanities, and seeke after leasing? These times are allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the soule, not to the bodie. Nowe is the time of salvation, not of pleasure and pastime. Let the flesh alone a while, more then nature and necessity require, let it not bee favoured, either in food or rayment, or any the like transitorye and fading benefite. And vvhen it is vveary of walking vpon the face of the earth, let it goe downe in peace, and rest in hope, till hee that came for your soules before, shall also come to raise and reforme it. In the fainting of our soules, there is a grosse difference betwixte Ionas and vs. His soule fainted vvithin him through paine, ours through pleasure, and that pleasure the mother and nurse of a worser paine. Our fleshe is too insolent against the spirite, and keepeth it vnder with a stronge hande. Hagar despiseth Sara, the servaunt setteth her foote in the necke of her mistresse. The flesh is cloathed like the raine-bowe, with colours of all sortes, wee goe into the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, wee goe into the bowelles of the sea, as farre and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:8475:193"/>
as lowe as ever Ionas went, to seeke pearles and the riches of the sea to adorne it. VVe forget our selues shamefully in such vnnecessary travaile. It is <hi>the Queene</hi> that shoulde bee cloathed in a vesture of needle vvorke, wroughte with diverse colours; but the Queene is stripte of her iewels, the soule robbed of her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and rich attire, and the body is the theefe that deceiveth it.

                     </gap>ervice of the righteous God? This is the cause, that Ionas begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with confutation. Before he will plant the vineyard, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove stones, and briers, and all other obstacles that may hurte the growth of the vines. Before hee buildeth his house, hee vvill first pull downe a ruinous and rotten foundation. So is the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a prophet in the first of Ieremie: <hi>This day have I sette thee over nations and kingedomes,</hi> first, <hi>to plucke vp, to roote out, destroy, throw downe</hi>; secondly, <hi>to plant, and build, and set vp againe.</hi> And so is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Evangelist also, who hath received the administration of the gospell of Christ: first to <hi>prepare the way,</hi> as it vvere, and <hi>to make straight pathes before the face of Christ</hi>; that is, first to <hi>reproove</hi> and then to <hi>teach</hi> concerning doctrine,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> first to <hi>correct</hi> and afterwardes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme touching conversation. Iohn Baptist, you know, a middle man betweene the lawe and the gospell, a prophet and more than a prophet, because he both foresaw, and visibly saw the Lorde of life, both prophecied and pointed with his finger, turning his face, like
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:8475:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Ianus in Rome, both waies; he first <hi>made ready</hi> the houses and heartes of the people before the king of Sion came, <hi>cast downe hilles, lifted vp vallies, &amp;c.</hi> that the gospell of the kingdome might have the freer admission. He beganne his preachings with reprehension of their vicious lives, <hi>O yee generation of vipers</hi>; and convulsion of their false groundes, <hi>Saie not within your selves, wee have Abraham to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. No man setteth a new piece to an olde garment</hi>: hee maketh the rent but worse. <hi>No man putteth newe wine into olde bottles</hi>: for hee then marreth both. It is to little purpose to offer truth, and the tidings of peace, the newes of the newe testament, to the olde man, whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient corruptions hange vpon him, and his wedded conscience is thoroughly seized and possessed with inveterate errours. There is but one truth, oppugned by falshodes without number, like the armes of the sea. But the nature and courage of that one trueth is, wheresoever she findeth falshode, not to dissemble her quarrell and emulation to her enemy, but to play the part of truth, that is, simply, ingenuously, apparantly, to defie her adversary, and to withstand her to the teeth. Fulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius in his first booke to Thrasymu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de king of Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles, giveth the reason of this orderly proceeding. <hi>It is almost all one, to deny the faith,</hi>

This, I suppose, was the reason, why Ionas beginneth his speech with a triumph against idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, &amp; being to magnifie the strong arme of the Lord, doth it with disdeine and contempt of all those that seeke vnprofitable meanes.

                     </note> It is not lesse then a wonder in nature, that Plinie in his naturall history reporteth of the bees: their industry and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to bee such, and so hardly to bee matched in the vvorlde, <hi>that almost of the shaddowe,</hi> saith he, (rather then substaunce) <hi>of a verie small living creature, nature hath made an incomparable thing.</hi> They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loose a day from labour, if the aire will giue them leaue to worke. And when the weather is lowring and troublesome, they cleanse their hiues, and carry out the filth of those that laboured within dores. The manner of their working is this. In the day time they keepe watch and warde at the gates, as they doe in campes. In the night they take their rest, and when the day is sprong, they haue an officer to call them vp with humming twice or thrice, as with the sound of a trumpet. The younger go abroad to fetch in worke, the elder stay at home, some bring burthens, other vnloade them. Some build, other polish, some supply them with stuffe for the worke, other take care for their victuals, for they take not their diet apart, that they may be equall in all things. Moreover they are very observant and strict in exacting the labours of every one, and such as are idle they note and chasten with death. Finally, the drones, which are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes of the right bees, they are content to giue house-roome vnto, in fruitfull years, but they rule them as their slaues, and put them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the labours, and if they be slacke; punish them without pitty, and when the hony is ripe, they driue them from their dwellings, and many falling vpon one spoile them of their liues. Go to the bees O sluggard, consider their waies and be wise, they <hi>are but small amongest foules, yet doth their fruit exceede in sweetnes,</hi> saith the sonne of Sirach, &amp; their labour in greatnesse. And goe to the bees ye magistrates of the earth, and learne from that little kingdome of theirs to vse the vigour and sharpenesse of discipline against our vnserviceable drones, who like paralyticke members in the body of man, loose and vnbound in the iointes of obedience, say to the head commaund vs not, for vvee will not stirre at thine apointment.

I will not reape the harvest of the nexte wordes, but onely viewe them in haste to make my connexion.

And as Ionas cried, <hi>yet forty daies, and Niniveh shall be destroied,</hi> so Niniveh cried vnto him againe, yet not forty howres, and thou shalt see Niniveh wholy changed. Our Saviour in the eight of Matthew, telleth his disciples, that <hi>the people had endured him nowe three dayes havinge nothinge to eate</hi> (for hee helde their stomackes and appetites, that they might not hunger, as hee helde the disciples eies that were walking towardes Emaus that they mighte not see, and when hee had fedde them sufficiently with the breade of life, then hee restored them to nature againe, and gaue them leaue to hunger and thirst after corporall reliefe.) The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Niniveh as commendable in an other kinde, never wearie of the preaching of Ionas, and willing to endure him more then three daies without eating or drinking, they wearie not him so much, as to put him to the toile of the seconde and thirde day, neither suffer they the nexte morninges sunne to arise vpon their former daies iniquity. But as if every soule in the citty had beene summoned as Lot vvas, <hi>Escape for thy life, make haste and saue thy selfe,</hi>

                     <hi>therefore the Lorde was not able to beare his words,</hi> and hee had his pasporte sealed, <hi>O thou the seer, goe flee thou avvaie into the lande of Iudah and there eate thy breade, and prophecie there, but prophecie no more at Bethel, for this is the kinges chappell, and this is the kinges courte</hi>: so I woulde rather haue thought that they shoulde haue entertained Ionas in the like manner, because hee came with fire and sworde in his mouth against them; the cittye is not able to beare thy wordes, vvee cannot endure to heare of the death of our king, and the vniversall overthrow of our people and buildings.

                     </note> there <hi>hee began</hi> to builde his prophecie. And even at the <hi>entrance</hi> of the gates, hee opened his lippes and smote them with a terrour of most vngratefull newes.

and dishonouring her husband. Thus we may answere the scruple by all these waies. 1. <hi>Yet forty daies and Niniveh shall bee overthrovven,</hi> and yet forty and forty years, and Niniveh shal not be overthrowen. Why? because Niniveh is changed, and the vnchangeable vvill of God ever was, that if Niniveh shewed a change it shoulde bee spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 2. There were two partes of Gods purpose, the one disclosed touching the subversion of Niniveh, the other of her conversion, kept within the heart of God. Wherevpon he changed the sentence pronounced, but not the counsaile vvhereto the sentence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. 3. If you consider Niniveh in the inferiour cause, that is, in the deservings of Niniveh, it shall fall to the ground; but if you take it in the superiour cause, in the goodnes and clemency of almighty God; Niniveh shall escape. Lastly the iudgment was pronounced with a condicion, reserved in the minde of the iudge. Niniveh shall bee overthrowen if it repent not. Now he that speaketh vvith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion may change his minde without suspicion of lightnes. As Paul promised the Corinthians to come by them in his way tovvardes Macedonia and did it not;<note place="margin">2.

If it were not for conditions and exceptions, every thing vvould be perfect. But nothing more vnperfect then Niniveh, if this secret condicion of the goodnes of God at the second hand, had not been.

thee, the night is come wherein thou canst not worke, the vision is ended, the prophecy fulfilled, the doores shut vp, thy gracious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation past; who in the closing of an eie are pulled from the lande of the living, &amp; their place is no more knowne. Let me tell you for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that which was spoken to Niniveh in this place vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, was afterwards simply pronounced by Nahum, &amp; Niniveh was destroied indeede. Tobias before his death hearde of the fall of Niniveh,<note place="margin">Tob. 14.</note> &amp; the monarchie that said within it selfe here will I dwell, was translated into Babylon. He that endured Ierusalem so longe, was afterward so obstinate against it, that if Moses and Samuell had stoode before him to aske her pardon, hee woulde not haue beene entreated; hee that forbare that froward and stubborne generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forty yeares long, afterwards sware in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest. And as he hath spared, and spared, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, so hee will overturne, <hi>and overturne, and overturne,</hi> Ezech, 31. and as he hath added yet more houres, and yet more yeares, <hi>and yet forty daies,</hi> so hee will add yet more plagues, and yet more punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet more vengeance. According to his fearfull commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Levit. 26. <hi>I will yet plague you seven times more, &amp; yet seven times more,</hi> &amp; still with further repetition, as there is no end of our sinnes, so there is no end of his anger. This were the preaching fitt for these times: blessings must sleepe a while, mercy go aside, peace returne to the God of peace &amp; not be spoken of. That reverend, religious, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest estimation which was of God, in former times, <hi>there is mercy with thee o Lord, and therfore shalt thou be feared,</hi> is now abandoned and put to flight. This rather must be our doctrine, there is iudgement with thee o Lord, with thee o Lord there is ruine and subversion, vvith thee are plagues o Lord, with thee there is battaile and famine and snares and captivity &amp; storme &amp; tempest. there is fire &amp; brimstone with thee O Lord, therefore thou shalt be feared. Happy are we if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue or feare will draw vs to repentance, if our marble and flinti heartes wilbe softned with any raine that falleth, if our stiffe and y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron-sinued neckes will bow with any yoke, either the sweete yoke of the gospell of Christ, or the heavye &amp; vnsupportable yoke of the lawe and iudgement. But if Niniveh continue as it hath begun, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh shall bee overthrowen. I am not a prophet, nor the sonne of a prophet to set the time, either of forty or fifty, daies or yeares more or lesse; hee sitteth aboue to whome it is best knowne, and is comming in the cloudes to determin that question. But mercye and iustice I knowe are two sisters, and as the one hath had her day

so the other shall not misse hers; and the Lord hath two armes, two cuppes, two recompences, <hi>and doubtlesse there is a rewarde for the righteous</hi> and doubtlesse there is also a plague for obstinate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poenitent sinners.</p>

The first of these five, which we are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deale with, is the generall table &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, of that which the other fowre diduce into speciall branches. as Ezechiel first portraied the siege of Ierusalem vpon a bricke,<note place="margin">Ezech. 4.</note> to give the people of the Iewes an image of that misery, vvhich after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes they should finde distinctly and at large accomplished: For whatsoever wee heare in the lineall succession of all the rest, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their faith, fastes, sackloth, proclamations, vvithout respect of person or age, wee have broched vnto vs, in this prooemiall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Their ordering and disposing of this weighty businesse of repentance, with every office and service belonging vnto it, is so comely, convenient, and with such arte, as if David were to apoint the Levites and priestes of the temple their courses againe, and to settle the singers and porters in their severall ministrations hee could not have shewed more wisedome and skilfulnes. For such are the duties tendered to God by this people of Niniveh, as were these officers of the temple. Some principall, others accessary; some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, others ceremoniall; some for substance, others rather for shew, and to set out the worke; some to the soule belonginge, others to the body and outward man. And in all these, the first have the first places, the second and inferiour, such as are fitte for them.

Faith goeth before works, &amp; in worke fasting goeth before sackloth &amp; in the persons the greatest goeth before the lesse, &amp; in the doinge of all this, the proclamation of the king and counsaile goeth before the excecution of the people. The army that Salomon spake of, was never better set,<note place="margin">Cantic. 6.</note> nor almost the starres of heaven better ordered, then this conversion of Niniveh. First they <hi>beleeved God.</hi> For the Apostles rule admitteth no exception. <hi>Without faith it is vnpossible to please God. For he that commeth to God must beleeue that God is,</hi> and not onely his being,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> but in his nature and property, <hi>that he is also a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that seeke him.</hi> This is the first stone of their building, the first round of the ladder of Iacob, whereby they climbe to the presence of God. From faith which is an action of the minde, they goe to the workes of the body. <hi>Fasting and sackloth.</hi> For faith cried within them, as Rachel cried to Iacob, giue mee children or I die. Faith is hardely received and credited to be faith vnlesse it be testified. For that is the touchstone that the Apostle trieth vs by, <hi>Shew mee thy faith by thy workes.</hi> So first they quicken the soule, (for faith is the life of it) and then they kill the body by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the foode thereof, wherein the life of the body consisted, and buryinge it in a shrowde of <hi>sackloth.</hi> In their workes they begin <hi>with fasting</hi> as it were the greater thinges of the lawe, and end with <hi>sackecloth</hi> as the lesse. For as Ierome noteth, fasting is rather to be chosen without sackcloth, then sackcloth without fastinge; therfore is fasting put before sackecloth.<note place="margin">

For when the soule is touched indeede, and feeleth the smarte of her sinnes, because it hungreth and thirsteth after the righteousnesse of God, therefore it cannot thinke on feeding the outward man, but commaundeth it abstinence for a time even from necssary eating: and because it longeth to bee clothed with the salvation of God, therefore it char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her flesh and bloud, not to take care for wonted attiring, but to change their accustomed ornamentes into sackcloth and ashes.

In the timeliest time of your harvest hee covered the heavens with a sacke, to teach you the way to sacke-cloath, and sent leanenesse vpon the earth, to teach you frugalitie and thriftinesse in the vse of his blessinges. Manie the poorer of our lande vvoulde bee glad vvith the disciples of Christ to rubbe an eare of corne betweene their handes, for reliefe of their hunger, if they coulde come by it. Their bowels sounde like shaumes for vvante of foode, and their teeth are cleane, vvhen your barnes and garners are filled to the toppe, your presses runne over, and your bellies are satisfied vvith more then the flower of vvheat. O take somewhat from your bellies and backes, if you haue any loue to that hidden Manna, the meate that perisheth not, the fruites of the tree of life in the middest of the paradise of God; if any desire to those vvhite garmentes washt in the bloud of Christ, and rather to shine hereafter as the starres in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then as glo-wormes vpon the earth in this present life; take from your bellies and backes, both in regard of your owne soules, to witnesse humility and sobriety before God and man, and for your poore brethren sake, that they may bee fedde and clothed. It is Christ that hungreth, and Christ that must satisfie you. Christ that craveth, and Christ that must give vnto you. Christ that lieth at your gates, and Christ that must advaunce you to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Hee is the advocate to the poore, and the iudge of the rich, hee hath the sentence of blessing and cursing in his mouth, and to those that are plentifull givers, he shall render a plentifull recompence.</p>

consider and apply the behavior of Benadab 1. Kings. 20. he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an overthrow of the children of Israell, one yeare in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, the next at Aphek. An hundred thousand footmen were slaine in the field in one day, seven and twenty thousand perished with the fall of a wall in the city, besides the danger of the king, who is afraid of his owne life, <hi>and runneth from chamber to chamber to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi> Vpon this misery wherewith they were toucht, one daunger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing past, another imminent, his servauntes come vnto him with these wordes: <hi>Behold now, we haue heard say, that the kings of Israell are mercifull kings: we pray thee therefore, let vs put sacke-cloath about our loines and ropes about our heades, and goe out to the king of Israell, it may be that hee will saue thy life.</hi> They did so, and came to the king, and said, <hi>thy servant Bena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab saith, I pray thee let me liue.</hi> Benadab of late a puissant king, having two and thirty kings in his army, is novv content with the name of a servant.</p>
                  <p>First then you see, there is a perswasion of mercy in the kings of Israell: so there must be a perswasion of mercy in the God of heaven, vvhich the Ninivites were not voide of. Secondly that perswasion was vnperfect, mingled with feare, standing vpon tearmes of doubt, it <hi>may bee hee will saue thy life</hi>: so likewise said the king of Niniveh, <hi>who knoweth if the Lorde will repent</hi>? Thirdlie, vpon this perswasion, such as it is, the Sirians go and entreate the king of Israell: vpon the like doe the inhabitantes of Niniveh cry vnto God: Lastly, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their humilitie, and to mooue him to pitty, they <hi>put sacke-cloath aboute their loines, and ropes aboute their heades</hi>; so doe the people of Niniveh sit in sacke-cloath and ashes, to bewray their contrite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. Now as Aram put ropes about their heades, to shew that for their owne partes they had deserved nothing, but their liues and deathes vvere in the kings handes, either to saue, or hange them; so to fast, or vveare sacke-cloath, with any intention to merite, or satisfie the anger of God, is to abuse the endes of both these servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">22. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 147. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>Conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>to elevate the minde,</hi> and make it more capable of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly revelation: as Daniell in the tenth of his prophecie, after his fasting three vveekes <hi>from pleasaunt breade, flesh and vvine,</hi> behelde a vision.

for sinnes:</hi> which wee can in no case admit: the proofe he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth is from the seconde of Ioell, vvhere we are willed <hi>to turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lorde with all our hearte, with fasting and mourninge and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to rende our heartes and not our garmentes, &amp;c.</hi> VVhat then? It is the manner and vsage, wee graunte, of suppliant petitioners to abstaine from meates, and to teare their garmentes from their backes, not with purpose to satisfie the wrath of GOD, but rather to execute vvrath and vengaunce vpon themselues, and by macerating their bodies, and stripping them of their best ornaments to shew, howe vnworthy they are of the blessings of God, whom by their hainous iniquities they haue so offended. For it is not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and sacke-cloath that pleaseth him so much, nor rending the garments, nor looking vnder the brow, nor hanging downe the head like a bulrush, nor shaving the head and the beard, nor casting dust vpon the face, nor sitting in ashes, nor filling the aire with howlinges and out-cries: but inwarde and hartie conversion to God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of our grievous provocations, confession of our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines by these outward castigations, vnfained repentance, vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to praier, &amp; a faithfull apprehension of his auncient and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med mercies. Therefore it followeth in Ioel, <hi>For the Lord is gracious and mercifull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> slow to anger, &amp; of great kindnes, and repenteth him of the evill.</hi> As much as to say, when you haue sorrowed sufficiently for your sinnes, and signified that sorrow with abstinence and teares, take comforte at the length againe, not in your owne satisfactions, but in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and view of Gods everlasting mercies.
<q>For word came vnto the king of Niniveh.</q>
Some thinke, that the matter herein contained is distinguished from that which wente before in the fifte verse: and that the rulers and warders of the several partes of the city which Ionas had past through, had proclaimed a fast to the people, before the preaching of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet came to the kings eares. Herevpon they inferre, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appertaining to God, we must not tarry the leasure of Princes their license be obtained, for Princes (they say) are slowest to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and farthest from humbling themselues before the maiesty of God when his anger is kindled. I take it to be otherwise, and I am not left alone in that opinion: for most agree, that the former verse is but an index or table to that that followeth. Wherein the repentance of Niniveh is first rough hewen, and afterwardes revised and gone over againe with more speciall explication. For thus it hangeth togither. If you will knowe vvhat the people of Niniveh
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:8475:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did vpon this strange and vnexpected newes, they doubted nothing either of the word, or of his calling that brought it: but from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to the least, olde and young, princes and inferiours, all orders and states of men, they both beleeved the reporte, and became specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to God, and men, and angels of admirable contrition, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themselues in those two thinges especially whereof the whole world might iustly haue condemned them, luxuriousnes of meates, and drinkes, and costlinesse of garmentes: But if you will know their order of proceeding more particularly, thus it was: 1. <hi>Worde came vnto the king,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prover. 15.</note> as to the most excellent power and authority amongst them: 2. the king calleth <hi>a councell,</hi> of the princes and peeres, as being the pillars of his governement: for where <hi>there are many counsellors, there is strength.</hi> 3. the king and his counsaile <hi>make an acte,</hi> touching fasting and praier, and renouncement of sinne, 4. they cause it to bee <hi>proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> in manner and forme as afterwarde followeth: 5. for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente and example to the rest, <hi>the Kinge</hi> is the first man that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himselfe. So that in trueth, their soveraigne and liege-Lord is first made privie to their service intended; wherein, for mine own parte (simply to speake my minde, as one that must giue accompt what I haue built vpon my maisters foundation, whether golde, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, hay, stubble or the like, for both my workes and my words must be tryed by fire) though I make no question, if the prince shoulde be backewarde and carelesse in the worshippe of God, but God must be served, and so I would wish it: yet in a common cause, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the weale and well-fare of the whole common wealth, where it lyeth vpon all sortes of men alike, to doe some extraordinary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God (as the case of Niniveh heere required) I holde it a point of disorder and confusion, that the foot should run without the head, the people or inferiours doe any thing in publique, wherevnto the knowledge and authorizement of the prince is not first had. <hi>Giue vnto Caesar the thinges that belong to Caesar,</hi> and giue him this for one amongst the rest, if Caesar bee willing and ready to ioine with thee in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, leaue him not out. I would not open this gate of libertie, to any subiect or people in the worlde with whome Christ and his kingdome are harboured, that in a common daunger of a country when God is to bee pacified, and the land purdged in generall, the private members thereof may enter into the action, without the vvarrant of the prince both to commaunde and direct the same. If such were the king as Darius was, Daniell, 6. and such his rulers and officers as woulde make a decree to defraude God of his worshippe,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:8475:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>

But if such be the king as Iosias was, or the like, and such his Princes and officers as make decrees for the worshippe of God, and are more wise then thy selfe, to knowe the dandger of the state, and as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to prevent it: whatsoeuer thou doest in private betwixt thy selfe and thine owne spirite, thy selfe and thine owne houshold, yet gather no open assembly, sanctifie no publique fast, call not to sacke-cloath and mourning before the magistrate haue decreed it. It may be a presumption of thine owne zeale, an affectation of singularitye, a commending and preaching of thy selfe vnto the people, but sure I am, it is a censure by consequence, and a iudgement vnder hande, against the rest of thy brethren, that they are over-colde in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a preiudice against the magistrate, that he is to slacke, a breach of obedience to the powers that God hath ordained, and the mother of Anarchie and confusion which within a christian common wealth must carefully be shunned. In many the daungers of our lande both at home and abroade, many the members and subiects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as if our countrey had no more oratours, and there were none to stande in the gappe but themselues, haue assembled togither, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in townes, or in hamlets, and sometimes in a private house to fast and pray before the Lorde. Their humbling of themselues in such sorte, confessing of sinnes, offering of their heartes in devout supplication, singing of Psalmes, prophecying in course from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till evening, as they are plausible exercises in the sight of men, so I vvill not saye the contrary but full of Godlinesse and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But (vnder correction of better knovvledge and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente) I thinke, that obedience and loue, had beene better then all this sacrifice, and that thus to minishe the authority of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, by preventing his decree, and controlling as it were his governement, and to giue sentence against all the children of the lande besides of negligence and vnmindefulnesse in Gods affaires,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:8475:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may more offende, then their service or devotion can doe good otherwise. Much more seemely it vvere, that as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the Corinthians, <hi>not the one to prevent the other, vvhen they come to the supper of the Lorde,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Cor. 11.</note> vvhich is a sacrament of communion and fellowshippe; so in a calamitie of the realme, when all the iointes thereof are disquieted, and haue neede to bee salved and holpen by the saving-health of GOD, that all mighte concurre and agree for seeking that remedie: that the people might stay for the magistrates, magistrates lead the people, the prophets preach and denounce, the king and his counsaile enact, and all put in practise: that a whole burnt offering might bee made vnto the Lorde, from the highest to the lowest, a solemne dedication of every person and state that the land hath. And as Ierusalem was commended for her buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, so we for our praying and fasting, a people at vnity within our selues, vvhere neither the greatest nor the least are excluded. But of the nature of a publique fast hereafter. Meane-while, the dangerous conclusions, that haue, and might haue ensued out of this maxime, to weete, <hi>that in matters belonging to God, wee are not bounde to expect or respect the magistrate,</hi> make me the more warie and scrupulous in handling this point. For I like not in any case, that the least advantage and scope in the earth bee given to the people, against his lawfull and Christian governour. It is as fire to flaxe, an easie and welcome perswasion to busie and catching natures. The least exception once taken against their want of religion, pietie, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice or the like, is so farre followed, that not onely the prince, in the ende, but the vvhole people rueth it. The Anabaptist in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, no sooner entertained this fancie in his braine, that a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse magistrate may bee made away, but foorthwith he granteth to himselfe, that all the magistrates of Germanie are of that kind: and casteth in his heade howe hee may laye his handes vpon the Lordes anointed. Hee beareth the worlde in hand, that God hath had speech with him, and given him a chardge to destroy the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and to constitute a newe vvorlde, consisting of righteous and innocent.

The repentaunce of the king, was in effecte the repentaunce of the whole citty: as it is noted of the ruler: Ioh. 4. when hee hearde the wordes of comforte, <hi>Goe thy waies thy sonne liveth, hee first beleeved himselfe,</hi> afterwardes vvhen hee better knewe the time, and other circumstances, then hee <hi>beleeved and his whole housholde.</hi> You haue hearde alreadye in what life the repentance of the king is described: for whatsoever he had, making, for honour and princelyhood, that hee forsooke; and whatsoever there was on the other side, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade and discountenaunce himselfe in the eies of his subiectes, that hee admitted and endured: <hi>hee rose from his throne, and threwe of his robe,</hi> as much as to say, hee laide downe all his authority, state, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and forgate himselfe to bee a king, and the monarch of the countrey, and more then that, <hi>covered himselfe vvith sacke-cloath, and sate in ashes,</hi> so farre from being a kinge, that hee seemed in his owne sighte to bee lesse then nothinge. The throne and the robe with other royall preheminences, as the scepter, the crowne, and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous attire in difference from other men, haue ever preferred vnto the eies of the worlde, an image of that glorie and honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the kings of the earth are invested.

And there is no question, but the kings of Niniveh, being growen and swollen in pride, were not far behinde these. The stranger it is vnto me, that this golden cup of honour &amp; authority, made him not drunke, and draue him from all sense of his earthlines and mortality: it is so vsuall an intoxication to the rulers beneath, making them forget that God which sitteth aboue them.

The statutes of a kingdome must not be lockt vp in cofers, as the bokes of the Sybils in Rome, nor as the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Pythagoras which no man might write, bee kept from the knowledge of the vulgar sort. In the 1. of Sam. 14. Saul had charged his <hi>people by othe not to taste any thing till night</hi>: vpon an eager intention he had to pursue the Philistines.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the glory of God is proclaimed by such proclamations; as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonosor, Dan. 3. made a decree <hi>that every people, nation, and language that spake any blasphemie against the God of Syrach Misach and Abeduego should be drawen in pieces:</hi> and that it might be knowne abroade, he caused it to be publisht.

Repentance an act of all actes; if they had spent their daies in consulting, this one in steede of infinite thousandes to saue their liues. An enimie did aproach vnto them, a <hi>spirituall</hi> enimye, from <hi>the higher places,</hi> iustice I meane from the throne of GOD, vvhose forces were invisible, and could not be repelled with sworde and target.

                  <p>The ground and provocation of this their repentance is in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ninth verse.

There may be some part of repentance without faith; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, anguish, vexation for sinne, till not onely the heart aketh, but the conscience also is quite swallowed &amp; drowned in the gulfe of it. As there is no question, after that horrible fact of Iudas, but his spirite was as full of griefe, as before of trechery and covetousnes. Let the world witnesse with him, how deepely he rued his malice, vvhen hee

For it there had beene a penaltie to haue taken of himselfe worse than death and damnation, hee woulde not I thinke, haue shunned it. Caine was also as sory for his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fact as ever greedy before to commit it. He felt even a talent of lead vpon his soule, never to be remooved; and therefore vttered a blasphemy against the grace of GOD never to be pardoned: <hi>My sinne is greater than can bee forgiven.</hi>

And I <hi>shall bee hidde from thy face,</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from thy presence, banished from the light and favour of thy gracious countenance. This is the dart that woundeth him to death. For, this received into the minde, that we are hidde from the face of GOD, that wee are so farre in contempte and hatred with his maiestie, that hee vvill not vouchsafe to giue vs the looking on; if all the clowdes in the aire rained loue and compassion, we could not bee perswaded that any of the least droppes thereof should fall vpon our grounde. VVherefore there must be a beleefe to conceiue, and an hope to expect our reconciliation and and attonement with God, and GODS with vs; or it will bee an vnprofitable and vnpossible attempte, to endevour a true repentance.

Such I thinke was the repentance of the Philistines, the first of Samuell the fift and sixt, when they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the arke of the Lorde, and placed it first in Ashdod, and there
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:8475:262"/>
were punished with Emerodes and with death; afterwardes in Gath, and Eckron, and there they could not endure it, It is said of them, not only that they were troubled, and conferred of carrying home the arke againe, but <hi>that they cried, and their crie vvente vp to heaven,</hi> and they sent it backe with a present vnto the Lorde, and with <hi>sinne offerings</hi>: nay their priestes and sooth-sayers saide vnto them, <hi>wherefore shoulde you harden your harts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs</hi>? Such the repentance of Saul, 1. Sam. 15. who having received a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by the prophet, that as he had cast of the word of the Lorde, so the Lord had cast him of from being a king, and that his kingdome was given to his neighbour better than himselfe, though at the first he denied his crime, <hi>yea, I haue obeyed the voice of the Lorde</hi>; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes he confessed, <hi>I haue sinned in transgressing his commaundemente,</hi> and he desired Samuell <hi>to take away his sinne, and to returne with him that hee might worshippe the Lorde</hi>; which when Samuell refused, hee then altered his speech; <hi>yet turne with mee I praie thee, and honour me before the elders of my people, and before Israell.</hi> So that his principall care was not the service of GOD, but honour and estimation in the sight of men. Such the repentance of Ahab, 1. King. 21. who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the wordes of Elias thundering the iudgements of God against him and his house, <hi>hee rent his clothes and put sacke-cloath vpon him, and fasted, and lay in sacke-cloath, and went softlie</hi>; but how tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and feigned his repentance was, may appeare in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by his despitefull dealing with Micheas. Such is the repentance of those who are not rightly perswaded of the pardon of their sinnes: fitter for Philistines and reprobates than Christians, and to be vsed in Ashdod or Ascalon, than at Ierusalem. The coniunction of faith and repentance is so close, that some haue thought it to be a part of repentance. I rather take it to bee the beginner and leader thereof. As the body and soule, though they are ioyned togither in the same man, yet is not the body a parte of the soule, nor the soule of the bodie, but both distinct: so faith, hope, and charitie, if they bee true, they are narrowly lincked one to the other, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and essentially severed. For finall resolution whereof, you may best satisfie your selues by proofe from this place. For although this sentence which I haue in hand, be the last of the mandate, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and disposition of wordes, yet is it first in proposall. For if they had asked in Niniveh a reason of the king and his counsaile, vvhy they shoulde bid them fast, and weare sacke-cloath about their flesh, sparing neither beast nor sucklinges, vvhy they shoulde adde affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:8475:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and miserie to miserie, as if it vvere not sufficient to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by the handes of God, at the time prefixed, but they must plague themselues and their cattle fourty daies before hand, having but a handfull of daies (in comparison) to enioie their liues, and to take their pleasure in earthlye commodities, or why they shoulde cry vnto the Lorde, and not bee hearde, and forsake their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and not bee pardoned; the reason of all this is alleadged in this Epilogue, <hi>vvho can tell if the Lord vvill turne and repent</hi>? It cannot lightly bee worse, it may bee better with vs; the doinge of these dueties to God, will not put vs nearer to our iudgemente, it may sende vs farther of; vvee are sure to bee overthrowen if we repent not, wee may repente, and happily escape it; it is but the leaving of our meate and drinke for a time, who must leaue both belly and meate too; the missing of our better garmentes, who must misse our skinnes and our flesh from our backes; if wee vse our tongues in crying, wee loose nothing by it; and if we wash our handes, and cleanse our consciences from iniquity, we shall goe the lighter to our iudgement. <hi>Who can tell?</hi> it is the nature and property of God to shew pitty vnto the whole world, and although Niniveh bee the sincke of the earth, why not to Niniveh?</p>

They withdraw their obedience, hee his blessinges: and although he bee in the middest of them, nearer than their flesh to their spirites, yet by any demonstration of love, they cannot perceave his presence. God was ever in Niniveh, no doubt, by his essence, his power, his overlooking providence, <hi>for in him they lived, mooved, and alvvaies had their being</hi>; but hee vvas not in Niniveh by grace, by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and goverment of his holy spirit, neither by speciall favour &amp; assistance: hee had fotsaken their citty and consciences, as thorny,

Thus to acknowledge the true and immortal God, is a worke, but a worke of the spirit, both because the spirit of God is the author, and because the spirite of man is the actour and administer thereof. To beleeue, is also a worke of the spirit; for when they asked, Ioh 6. <hi>What shall wee doe that wee might worke the workes of God? Iesus answered them, this is the worke of God, that yee believe in him whome hee hath sent.</hi> GOD sawe all these workes in them, what they thought, howe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, which way the purposes of their heartes were bente; hee sawe their faith: as well as their ceremonies, their iustice Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, aswell as their Legall; hee sawe their whole bodye of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, wherein there was knowledge, desire, iudgement, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, faith, hope, and whatsoever else was requisite to bee vsed in that worke.</p>

The answere is this: he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in such brightnesse of light, as never eye of mortalitye coulde approach vnto, the sight of whole face, to an earthly man is vnsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the knowledge of those <hi>invisible thinges</hi> in the God-head, vnpossible; yet to giue some ayme and coniecture vnto vs what he

Heere it is saide, that <hi>God sawe their workes,</hi> and consequentlye <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of the iudgement, and did it not.</hi> The place hath beene abused and a weapon drawne there hence to fight against Gods grace: that these afflictions of the Ninivites, macerating themselues with fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sackcloth, prepared them aforehand to the easier attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their pardon. Such are the pillers which they builde their workes of preparation vpon; that before a man is iustified, his workes may deserue that favour of God: not of condignity, (they say) worth for worth, but of of congruity; as if it stood not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and conscience that their workes shoulde bee forgotten. If the prophet had trusted our simplicitye herein, and concealed the name of faith, weich heere hee placeth with her open face, as the leader and forerunner to all their other actions, coulde wee ever haue imagined that they woulde haue humbled themselues by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and prayed vnto God on whome they had not first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved? and whosoever hee bee that spendeth his wretched dayes in the wildernesse of this worlde, a wildernesse of sinne, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israell in that wast <hi>and roaring wildernesse of</hi> SIN, Exod. 16. without this cloude by day, and piller by night, to guide him the way to his rest, hee walketh hee knoweth not howe, hee strayeth, stumbleth, falleth, because hee hath not light, hee liveth and dieth in darkenesse, his soule is as a fielde vntilled, or as a vineyard growne wilde, which though it haue store of grapes, they are but <hi>sowre grapes,</hi> his worshippe of God, and workes of common civility, what glasse soever they beare, of honesty and commodity in the eyes of men, they are both vnfruitfull to himselfe, and before the face of God, full of sinne and reprobation.

We never said that faith without workes (barren and empty of her fruits) iustified an vnrighteous soule: but that faith so qualified, doth notwithstanding iustifie without those workes, this we mainetaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst men and angels: so we remooue not workes from faith, but workes from iustifying. Still they followe their mistresse, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, and cloathing the sinner with the iustice of God, therein they giue her the place, and put the burthen of that worke vpon her shoulders. Let Bilha the handmaide supply the defectes of Rahell, and beare children vnto Iacob, but let her ever remember that Rahel is aboue her, and singular in some respect. And let not Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph forget, though he ride in the second chariot of Egypt, &amp; be the next man to the king, yet that the king hath reserved the throne to himselfe.

yet, in performing that act of deliverance, Iudith is alone, her maide standing and waiting at the dore, and not so much as setting her foot within the chamber: So although our loue and obedience bee as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant to faith as ever that servant was to Iudith, yet in performing this mighty act of deliverance, acquiting the conscience fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the curse of the law, pacifying the anger of God, and presenting vs blamelesse before his holy eies, al which standeth in the apprehension of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christ, and a stedfast perswasion that he hath assumed for vs, faith is wholely and solely alone, our workes not claiming any part in that sacred action.</p>

                     <hi>Therefore wee conclude,</hi> saith the Apostle, Rom. 3. <hi>that a man is iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith without the workes of the law.</hi>

What shall we say? is God divided? or is there dissension in the spirit of vnity? or is there more than one truth? Apostle against Apostle, Iames against Paul, in one and the same question deriving a contrary conclusion? Not so. But as the striking of two flintes togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beateth out fire; so the comparing of these their two opinions, will make the truth more manifest. Surely by faith we are iustified, &amp; without the workes of the law. Meane it of ceremonies as some doe, meane it of morall commandements, the position is both waies true. This rocke we must cleaue vnto, this rocke must be published abroad rockes &amp; stones will publish this rocke if we conceale it. <hi>To him that worketh not, but beleeveth on him that iustifieth the vngodly, his faith is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for righteousnes</hi>: Rom. 4. <hi>to him that worketh not.</hi> I will not say that he worketh not at all, but he worketh not in this action, nor with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intent, either to prepare or further his iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the face of God: his workes are not reckoned at that time, nay they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their presence, and hang downe their heades, and are abashed to offer themselues in that service.

when it is made knowne.</hi> So then, there is one righteousnesse imputed, favoured, and cast vpon vs, though it bee not ours; there is another righteousnes exercised, or declared; there is one iustice of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is another iustice of testification; there is one that acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before God, another that approveth especially before man; the one without vs and lent, the other within vs, inhabitant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent; the one in Christ, and from him communicated to vs, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our selues, and to him in some sort recompenced. For such is the nature of faith and loue, as the Auncientes described their graces: the one is in taking and apprehension, the other is in giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration. First, we receiue by our faith, and then by our charitie we returne some-thing. Paule speaketh of the former of these iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Iames of the latter: Paule delivered simply the doctrine, Iames answered an obiection against those that gloried in the name and shadow of faith: Paule instructed the vnderstanding, Iames in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the life: Paule as a Doctor and in the schooles lecturing, Iames as a pastour, and in the pulpit applying; the one handling iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification properly, the other (to speake as properly) sanctification; the one establishing a reall, christian, iustifying faith, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing a verball, devilish, falsifying faith. There is now then but one Lord, one spirit, one truth, one gospell, one tongue, one soule in both these Apostles. Consider the state of the question in this present ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Ninivites. You know what they were, not only aliantes and strangers f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om the covenant and hope of God, but of aliantes &amp; strangers such, whose iniquity streamed into the highest heaven, and called downe vengance vpon them. What should they now doe to redeeme their peace? For if they had fasted till their knees had bowed vnder them, if they had put sacke-cloath about their loines, till the haire and wale thereof had entred even into their soules, if they had spent the day in crying and the night in wailing, and if they had lived besides as iustly to the world, as Aristides did in Athens, who was banished the city for over-much iustice, and had not withall belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I wil not say, but God might haue spared to haue made them notorious examples of his iustice to the worlde, but surely they had remained as aforetime, children of darknes still, and sonnes of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the waies of peace they had never knowne. Therefore to conclude on their parte, they are iustified by their faith, This is it that investeth them into the friendship and loue of God: their very beleeving of him is imputed vnto them for righteousnesse, as it was to Abraham: and to testifie that faith to man, to make it perfect
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:8475:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before God, to seale it vp to their owne conscience, they are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant also in good workes: which is that other iustification vvhereof Iames disputeth. For as in the temple of Ierusalem, there were 3. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions of roumes: the entry or porch where the beasts were killed; the altar where they were sacrificed; &amp; the holiest place of al, whither the high priest entred once every yeare: so in this repentance of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh, there are 3. sortes of righteousnes: the first of ceremony, in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sacke-cloath, and fasting; the second of morality in restitution; the third the iustice of faith,<note place="margin">Osee. 2.</note> and as it were <hi>the dore of hope</hi> wherby they first enter into the kingdome of heaven.</p>

<pb n="534" facs="tcp:8475:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so good workes grow from faith, and that faith liveth in the obiect, the merites and obedience of Iesus Christ, feeding and strengthning it selfe by the sweet influence and sappe of these heavenly conceites, that he <hi>came into the worlde to saue sinners,</hi> and that <hi>he died for her sinne, and rose to life for her iustification.</hi> For as we esteeme the worth of a ring of gold not so much in it selfe as in the gemme that it carrieth; so are we iustified &amp; magnified also in the sight of God by faith in Christ, not for this quality of beleeving, which is as vnperfite as our works, but for the obiect of this quality, Christ our mediatour, which is the diamonde and iewell borne therein. The hand of a leper, though never so bloudy and vncleane, yet it may doe the office of an hand, in taking and holding fast the almes that is given. The giver may bee liberall enough, and the gift sufficient to releeue, though the hand that received it, full of impurity.

This is the plea that Daniell helde in the ninth of his Prophecie, a man of as righteous a spirite as ever the Lateran pallace of Rome helde, <hi>according to all thy righteousnesse; for the LORDES sake; for thy greate tender mercies; for thine owne sake</hi>; and vvith direct exception to their inherente iustice, <hi>for wee doe not present our supplications before thee for our owne righteousnesse.</hi> This plea we must all sticke vnto, Gods mercy in his owne gracious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, Gods righteousnesse in his promises, Gods goodnesse <hi>in the Lorde,</hi> his anointed, his Christ, his Messias.

and reasonablenes thereof vpheld, and means made vnto Ionas in some sort, that if God be gracious to Niniveh, hee will bee pleased fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably to interpret it. The distribution of the Chapter is into three partes. 1. The affection of Ionas vpon the deliveraunce of Niniveh, whither revealed, and by a propheticall spirite discovered before the tearme of 40. daies, or to the expiration of them differred, I cannot say. 2. The reprehension &amp; rebuke which God vseth against him for that affection; both by speech, <hi>doest thou well to bee angry</hi>? and by fact, in confuting him by a reall similitude, of a gourde soone sprunge vp &amp; as easily withered. And as Ionas repeateth his impatience, so God walketh with an even pace by him, &amp; repeateth his reproofes. 3. The conclusion or scope which God referred himselfe vnto. Not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of the city, which was already past, but the iustification of his goodnes therein. For first he did it of fact (as they say,) and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the right of it.</p>
                  <p>The affection of Ionas is generally recited in the first verse, and more particularly displaied in the rest, touching his speech, gesture, &amp; carriage of himselfe in all pointes.</p>

For why is Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas so exceedingly displeased, that God hath spared Niniveh?

The nature whereof is this, that God in his iustice hath apointed it to be a plague to it selfe, and amongst many mischiefes it hath furnished it with one onely profitable quality, that the owner thereof taketh most hurt.

But of that hereafter. Meane-while, the time, and cause, and measure of this anger in Ionas, I thinke, are worthy to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For with whom is he angry? It seemeth, with himselfe: <hi>Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life from me.</hi> Or rather with God; who if he had taken him at his worde, the sun had gone downe vpon his anger, I meane, his life had ended in a froward and furious passion.

But if we be angry with him, there is no helpe for it. <hi>Quis populo Romano irasci sapienter potest?</hi> What man of wisedome can be angry with the people of Rome? much lesse with God.

                     <hi>seeing that all sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whatsoever, is in the nature and kinde of good thinges. Rather those that despite it, vvee must repute rude and vnprofitable altogither, who would bee glad that all men vvere ignoraunt, that their owne ignorance lying in the common heape mighte not be espied. If Philosophie shoulde therefore not be set by, because some haue erred through Philosophie, no more shoulde the sunne and the moone, because some haue made them their Gods, and committed idolatrie vvith them.</hi> It seemeth by the preface of M. Luther vpon the Epistle to the Galathians that the Anabaptistes condemned the graces and workes of God, for the indignity of the persons and subiectes in vvhome they were founde. Luther retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon them. Then belike matrimony, authority, liberty &amp;c. are not the workes of God, because the men who vse them, are some of them wicked. Wicked men haue the vse of the sun, the moone, the earth, the aire, the water, and other creatures of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not the sunne the sunne, and do the others loose their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse because they are so vsed? The Anabaptistes themselues, when as yet they were not rebaptised, had notwithstanding bodies and soules; now because they were not rebaptized, were not their bodies true bodies, and their soules right soules? Say, that their parents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so had a time when they were not rebaptized. Were they not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truly married? If not, it will follow therevpon, that the parentes were adulterers, their children bastardes, and not meete to inherite their fathers landes.</p>
                  <p>Likewise truth is truth wheresoever I finde it. Whither vvee search in Philosophy, or in the histories of the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall scriptures, there is but one truth. If Peter, if the Sibylles, if the devilles shall say, that <hi>Christ is the sonne of the living GOD,</hi> it is not in one a truth, a lie in the other; but though the persons, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and endes bee different, the substance of the confession is in all, the same.

Many things they do perversly, but some things which haue died with themselues, haue caused fruit to abound in vs. And in his 102. epistle to Marcella, he taxeth some, who held grosse &amp; pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable rusticity, (ignorance, lacke of learning) for only sanctity, and bragged that they were <hi>disciples of fisher-men,</hi> as if they were therefore holy, because they knew nothing. And else-where he wrote to Romanus, that he shoulde admonish Calphurnius, if hee vvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted teeth himselfe, not to bee envious against others vvho were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eate, nor to contemne the eies of goates, himselfe beeing a want and starke blinde. To this purpose hee alleageth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the lawe of the beawtifull captiue vvoman taken in vvarre, wherevnto if a man had a minde, he must cause her heade to bee shaven, her nailes pared, and the garmentes, wherin shee vvas taken, put of, and then he might marry her.

                     </gap>ll there finde it, and many things besides which we haue founde no where els. For it shall never bee denied, but that here are the riches and treasures of wisedome; and that the knowledge collected out of the bookes of the Gentiles with this of the booke of God compared, is no more, than the treasure car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried out of Egypt, which to the riches of Ierusalem, especially when Salomon was the king there, was in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as nothing. For as the wine that commeth from the vines of the mountaines, is both finer and pleasanter, than that of the vallies; so the heavenly knowledge which descendeth from the highest hils, &amp; from the throne of God, must needs be sweeter to our tast, than the sowre &amp; vnsavory know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world, which groweth in the valley of teares. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, what things soever, &amp; in what authors soever, were wel spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are ours, I meane the christians; &amp; we may take our own where we find it. Plato is sometimes <hi>alter Moses,</hi> &amp; <hi>Moses Atticus,</hi> an other Moses, and Moses at Athens: wheresoever therefore he speaketh as Moses did, that is ours. Orpheus and Sybilla haue delivered certaine introductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or assaies of propheticall learning; those are ours. What Poet, what Philosopher is there, that hath not drunke at the well of the Prophets? that is ours. Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Alexandrimus calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theeues, &amp; chargeth them to haue stollen their best opinions from holy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; those are ours also. Many things they speake at vnawares, <hi>&amp; tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam per recantationem,</hi> at a fit, as it were recanting their errors, many things <hi>ingratis,</hi> compelled and against their wils, which in them are but ghesses and presumptions, in vs grounded knowledge; these are ours likewise. It skilleth not in what ground the hearbe grew, nor what gardener sowed it, or brought it vp, so it heale. And what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it though the crowne were the kings of Ammon, so it be meete for the king of Ierusalem to take away, and to set vpon his ovvne heade? A country-man of our owne, though an obscure author, wrote not obscurely touching this controversie. For in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his tripartite worke, he giveth a reason why he induceth the lawes of the Heathen. The wisedome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith hee, hath brought the storke, and the kite, and the swallow to witnesse against sinners. VVherefore by his example and assistance, who hath

I haue long troubled you with the opinions of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, &amp; some later Divines, touching these Gentile and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall helpes. But where shall I seeke patrones, if neede be, for these fatherlesse and friendlesse Fathers themselues? for these we also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be spottes in our sermons, &amp; our labours seeme the worse, if the names of Augustine, Ierome, &amp; other reverend Doctours do but sound therein.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first part of this chapter is spent in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fault of Ionas, his vnmerciful affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards this poore people freed from the wrath of God, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should have wished wel if they had beene enemies, as now they were friends &amp; reconciled by appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp; rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have missed this successe which fell out, not only have doubled and trebled his paines, but even have pulled out his eies, &amp; laid downe his life to have saved their lives. Ionas in liew hereof, envieth their mercy received, and is angry against God, the dispenser &amp; carver of that mercy, &amp; angry against himselfe, that hee liveth to behold his expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so contraried. A wound in a prophet so much the more intollerable, that it was but greene after his late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. For being newly raised vp from falling, he dasheth his foote presently against the same stone; rebelling before against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commandement of God, and now, repining, fretting, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulating, &amp; not much lesse then rebelling againe. One would have thought that the salte sea should have purged and washed away all his cholericke distemperatures, and that his daunger so nevvly

endured and eschewed, farther than his hope coulde see into, shoulde wholye have transformed him into a man of mercye. But you see it is otherwise. For the goodnes of God <hi>displeaseth Ionas exceedingly, and hee is angry.</hi> The impatience of Ionas consisting of envy implied, and probably coniectured, (<hi>it displeased Ionas</hi>) &amp; of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger openly expressed, wee haue in generall laide downe in the first verse, &amp; are particularly to pursue in those that follow.

The Iewes accompted themselues by a constant opinion and claime, the peculiar people of God; the Romish themselues the onely Catholiques: they thought there could be no salvation without observing the law of Moses, and the rites of the Iewish Synagogue; nor these without observing the ordinances and ceremonies of the Romish Church: they cried, <hi>powre out thy wrath vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nations and vpon the people that haue not called vpon thy name</hi>; these held them for hereticks, not worthy the aire they drew, that ioyned not themselues vnto them. Nowe lastlie, as it was an odious office in these latter daies to preach vnto any nation or city vnder heaven, that <hi>the foolishnesse of preaching,</hi> and onely <hi>Christ crucified</hi> was able to saue soules, without creeping to crosses, kneeling, knocking, kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, sprinckling, censing, ringing, fasting, gadding, with such like toyes, and the conversion of any parte of Christendome vvith lesse circumstaunce, coulde not but bee a shame, preiudice, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnto Rome in some sorte, that having greater helpes and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances to God, went further from him: so the reclaiminge of Niniveh, by one, when Iury had many prophetes; by the denounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one, when Iury had many prophecies; by a single and short commination, when Iury had the whole law and testimonies; by a compendious course of repentance, when they fasted, and tithed, and sacrificed, and cryed, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, and I know not what; coulde not lesse be than a reproach to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which was so backwarde, and an exception to their whole forme of religion wherein they no better profited.

Whatsoever his reasons were, whither the care of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, or whither affection to his country-men drew him away to that recusancie, (both which are but particular and partiall respects, when God commandeth otherwise) his fault is no way excusable by reason, but that God of his grace, is ready to giue pardon and relaxation to al kinde of sinne.</p>

Sometimes he hath spoken by a burning bush vnto him, sometimes by a cloude of water, sometimes by a piller of fire, that is, he hath beene light to those that were obedient, &amp; fire to those that rebelled; and because flesh is more precious than either bushes, or fire, or water, therefore he hath spoken vnto him by flesh: it was he that spake in Esaias, in Elias, and in all the prophetes, and at length, though he were equall to the Father in maiesty, yet he was founde in the shape of a servaunt, and spake vvith his owne lippes. This gracious instrument of almighty God, to shew the chandges of his notes, both pittieth and chasteneth, entreateth and threatneth, and by threatning best admonisheth, and by speaking roughly, soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest converteth. He that called Adam out of the thicker, (which was the first elementes of this learning whereof I speake) he hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the same through all the ages of the world; hee sent Angels to Sodome, Noah to the old world, Nathan to David, Samuell to Saul, Elias to Ahab, prophets to Iudah and Ierusalem, Iohn Baptist to the Scribes and Pharisees; he reprooved the elders and Princes with many taunting parables, corrected Peter with looking backe, retracted Paule with a vision from heaven, advertised the seaven Churches with epistles sent vnto them. Leprosie, vnto Miryam was a vvriting and skrolle vpon her flesh, engraven in her skinne to teach her obedience; dumbnesse, vnto Zachary was not a dumbe instructour, it taughte him faith against another time; blindnesse, sent vpon Paule, tooke away his blindnesse, and opened the eies of his minde, making him to see more in the vvaies of life, than all his learning gathered at the feete of Gamaliell could haue revealed vnto him. Such are the admonitions that God sometimes vseth, to mollifie our hard heartes, least we shoulde freeze too long in the dregges of our sinnes, and because wee proceede with impunity, and freedome, claime them for inheritance. Beholde therefore, as

to say in your harts, what meane our prophets and preachers to make such bitter invectiues, declamations, out-cries, against the sinnes of our age? their salte is too quicke, and we are over-much seasoned with it, our eares are not able to beare their vvordes; we cannot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende in the wearinge of a garment, in the vse of our money, in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our bread, and drinking our drinke, but the pulpits must present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ring, our ears tingle, and the world wonder at it. God never taught them such roughnesse of speach; it had beene an happier thing for vs to haue lived and sinned in former times, and then to haue beene an adulterer, then a drunkard or extortioner, when God spake himselfe, who knew how to temper his wordes, and to shape his reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in milder sort. He would haue said but thus, Dost thou wel to be angry? well to be prowd, well to be covetous, well to giue thy mony vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsury? he would not haue threatned &amp; stormed as the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of our preachers is. Surely (my brethren) God is the maister of his owne, both speaches &amp; actions: his wisdome is as the great deepe, I cannot finde it out; it may be he saw amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the hart &amp; reines of Ionas, which we cannot do: or he was able by his power to create his spirit a new, &amp; to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dge his hart, that it should be rectified in an instante, as well by one worde, as if he had tyred, and torne his eares with tenne thousand; and hee dealt with a prophet, an anointed servaunt of his, one that was deare in his eies: or he kept him for another time, when his anger should be past, and his heart more capable of discipline and correction: or hee qualified his speach, to schoole and scourdge him the more with actions. Behold then, and rest satisfied with vs: our tongues should be still enough, if we had wormes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund to eate vp your plantes and fruites, or if we could chardge the sun in the sky, or the east winde in the aire to beate vpon your heades, and to grieue your soules, as God grieved Ionas; he spareth him in words, but he paieth him in fact, and though he vexe not his eares, as wee doe, hee vexeth his heade by taking away his shelter, the onelye temporall comforte which he then enioyed. I would we might see those daies wherein our speach might never exceede this compasse, <hi>Doe you well to doe thus</hi>?

This frequencie Ionas avoided, and betooke himselfe to that parte where the vvalkes were most solitaire, and his heart might least be troubled.

Happily he vvent vnto that side by adventure, <hi>quòpes tulit,</hi> as his minde and feete bare him, and it had beene indifferent vnto him to haue appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his body to any other side.

                  <p>But in this 6. verse, (to bring it into order) there are two parts 1. the creation of the gourd, by the hands of God, 2. the acceptation of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.

lightnings, and to fly in the aire, but they haue paid the price of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their foolish harts, I wil be like the most high. 2. <hi>It was made to ascend</hi>; 3. to be a shadow over the head of Ionas; 4. to deliver him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his griefe. The preparing of the gourd had little pleasured Ionas, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse it had ascended to some height; nor the ascending on high, vnlesse it had beene flexible, and bowed it selfe over his heade; nor the hanging over his head, without such quantity of boughes and leaues as were sufficient to shadow it: all these grow and ascend in my text higher &amp; higher as the tree it selfe doth; that we may know how wisely the workes of God are done, and they never misse the end, whereunto they were addressed. Two of these foure mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to weete, the springing and climbing of the gourd, that in a moment of time it was over the head of Ionas, shew the omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t power and providence of the Almighty, who contrary to the rule of the philosophers, that <hi>nothing is made of nothing,</hi>

The latter two declare the goodnes of God towards Ionas in his application of the gourd to so acceptable an end. For by that meanes his body was shadowed, and his soule eased. I knovve there is misery enough in nature, and that <hi>iudgemente sometimes beginneth at the house of GOD,</hi>

And the farther we goe from GOD, the nearer vvee ever
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:8475:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
approch to misery: for neither land, nor sea, nor citty, nor field, nor aire, nor earth, nor any worme of the earth shall favour vs, no more than they favoured Ionas. I am not ignorant on the other side, that all nature is provided for the comfort of Gods elect. And nature shall even be chandged, and made to runne faster than her manner is, to doe them good. The Lord shal not only doe it, but doe it with speed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue little reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to looke after it, sometimes by rule, &amp; sometimes at liberty, sometimes by law, &amp; sometimes by priviledge and aboue his law, sometimes by nature, and sometimes by miracle, but doe it he will, rather than his helpe shall faile. Who thought of the ramme in the bush, when Isaac lay vpon the fagots? the good will of him that dwelt in the burning bush, sent it. Hee came not vpon his feete, but was brought by speciall providence. Who dreamed that an Eastwind should haue filled the campe of Israell with quailes? It had blowne often before, and sometimes hurtfull and vnprosperous blastes, but never quailes. VVho looked for Manna from heaven, when they wanted bread in the wildernesse? Many a dew and frost had they seene vpon the ground, but never with such effecte. Who durst presume to thinke, that Iordan would runne backe, or the red sea divide it selfe, till they saw it fulfilled? Or woulde not haue sworne that the lions woulde haue rent Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell in pieces, and bruised every bone, and the fire of that oven in Babylon, haue burned those three Salamanders to powder, till they saw it otherwise? But these thinges haue bene done, vvee know, and done on the suddaine; the LORDE hath <hi>risen ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye</hi> to doe them, that is, hastned his acte, and set vvheele as it were to his power and goodnesse, to make them speede. And thus was this gourd provided, to the growing whereof were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a spring and sommer at the least, but to such augmentation and largenesse, the space of many yeares. These two companions, the might and mercy of God, betweene which, as before I saide, those 4. members of my text divide themselues, are his two wings, vnder the shadowe whereof wee shall bee safe. And as the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ were sent into the worlde <hi>two and two before his face,</hi> to preach the gospel, and to heale diseases; so these two hath the Lord ioyned togither, and they goe before his face as farre as the earth is bounded, to assist his chosen in all their griefes. And rather than any temptation shal waxe too stronge for them, and put them in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, hee will be <hi>Adonai, Adonai,</hi> twice a God as it were, and double his spirite stronge and, stronge, mercifull and mercifull:
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:8475:316"/>
and as his goodnesse is infinite, so it shall draw forwards his infinite power to some extraordinary and vntimely worke, which nature without leasure and tracte of time could not have produced.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Many things there were which might provoke the reioycing of Ionas. 1. The fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of the leaves, which was a great comfort to a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that sate in the sun, and was parched with the heate, as a cake in the hearth; <hi>for the sunne is a marveilous instrument,</hi> as the sonne of Syrach speaketh,<note place="margin">Eccles. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>it burneth the mountaines three times more than one that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a fornace, it casteth out fierie vapours, and with shining beames blindeth the eies</hi>: &amp; we know that <hi>burning heate</hi> is in the number of the plagues threatned, Deut. 28. &amp; Revel. 16.<note place="margin">Ardor &amp; aestus.</note> 
                     <hi>The fourth Angell powred out his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vpon the sunne, and it was given him to torment men with heate of fire, and men boyled in greate heate, and blasphemed the name of God for it.</hi> This was <hi>the griefe</hi> wherewith it is saide before that Ionas was perplexed; for it is not a meane plague to lie open to the skorching of the sunne without shadow and protection: so much the rather, if (as the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines imagine) the skinne of Ionas were waxen more tender, since his inclosure in the bowelles of the fish than before. 2. The gourd sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/> him the continuall renewing of his booth: for it was likelye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that his naturall house, built by the hands of God, should lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger have continued, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that artificial tabernacle which himselfe had erected of such slender stuffe. 3. It is thought that the colour of his<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>
                     <pb n="618" facs="tcp:8475:317"/>
arbour being greene and fresh, pleased well his eies. 4. That the sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the leaves was not vnwelcome to his nostrelles. <hi>Paulus de Palatio</hi> addeth other reasons of his ioy. 1. He thinketh that Ionas was sicke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> through griefe of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it much revived his soule, to see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the care which God had over him. 2. He imagineth that Ionas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded himselfe even for this miracles sake, that the people of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> would not esteeme him as a false prophet. Lastly hee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to Saint Ierome, and supposeth this tree to have beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Iudaea, and therefore it much delighted Ionas to behold a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> tree of his owne countrey. They adde moreover the sodainnesse of the miracle, and that the gourd was so much the more gratefull vnto Ionas, because it came vnlooked for. But the most of these before alleadged, are but sensible pleasures: and there is no question but that which most affecteth him, was the presence and favour of God, so miraculously, and extraordinarily shewed. For that argument which Gedeon asked of God, <hi>if God be with vs, where are his miracles</hi>? Iudg. 6. to seale vp his mercies towardes him; the same doth the Lord bring in this place for the confirmation of Ionas. That Ionas reioyced for the gourd, I cannot dislike: it argueth that he weighed and esteemed the blessings of God as they deserved. Many, though they fall vpon their heades, as the dew of heaven vpon their ground, yet are more senselesse in them: and as they meete the motes in the sunne-beames, so they entertaine the giftes of God, as if they came by chance, skarsely lending a thought to consider them. Others are ioyfull enough of that which they are possessed of; sometimes inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and prowde, their lookes and their gate have maiesty and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine in them against those who are not so plentifully visited; but they litle regard the authour of those benefites, who hath sent this ticket or remembrance to every man, vpon the face of the earth, <hi>what hast thou, that thou hast not receaved?</hi> Let Naball be the person and parable in whome I report (onely chandging the name,) the history of all worldly men, who having the riches of the earth, take them as inheritance or due debt, and spend them like Lords, to fulfill their lustes; meane-while, not minding either sacrifice to God, or reliefe to the poore, or any way applying themselves to those endes for which they were enriched. Naball, 1. Sam. 25. had riches enough, and mirth enough, <hi>hee made a feast after his shearing like a king, and his heart was merry within him</hi>; the reason was, <hi>for hee was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drunken</hi>: there is the vse of his riches. Besides, the opinion of his mightines and wealth, made him as drunke otherwise. For the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:8475:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of himselfe in the dispensation of his riches, was so base every way, that neither servant, nor wife, nor stranger gaue good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him. The servant vttereth his complaint, <hi>he is so wicked that a man cannot speake vnto him</hi>: the wife concealeth not hirs, <hi>let not my Lorde regarde this wicked man, for as his name is so is hee; Naball is his name, and folly is with him.</hi> David oftentimes fretteth at his churlishnesse, <hi>he hath requited mee evill for good,</hi> who would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a little portion of his substance, to refresh the servants of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>that walked at the feete of their Lord, though they were a wall vnto him, by day, and by night, and safegarded all that he had in the wildernes.</hi> But his end was au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swerable to his deserving; for it is said in the text, <hi>the Lord smote him within ten daies that hee died,</hi> and before that death of his body, <hi>his heart died within him, and hee was like a stone.</hi> The best instruction is, as we reioyce in these temporall blessings of God, so to vse them, that they may be our ioy (for to some they are snares and destructions) to receiue them with thanksgiving, embrace them in measure, and dispense them with wisedome, to the honour of our bountifull God, reliefe of afflicted Ioseph, and a furtherance vnto vs to dischardge those Christian dueties wherevnto wee are bound.</p>
                  <p>Besides the acknowledging of the author, the pleasure which Ionas tooke in the gourd, was a signe that hee felt the sweetnsse and vse of the benefite, which (if you obserue) is a blessing vpon a blessing: for as the wise Preacher noted,<note place="margin">Riches, &amp; power to vse them Eccles. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>to every man to whome God hath given riches and treasure, and giveth him power to eate thereof, and to take his parte, and to enioy his labour, this is the gift of God</hi>: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are his giftes, but this is a double gift.

                     </note>But what meaneth the immoderate and excessiue ioy that Ionas tooke therin? for I come now to the measure of his affection. It is true oftentimes which the Poet hath, <hi>So foolish are we, that while wee avoide one fault, wee fall into the contrary.</hi> Ionas is quickely angry, and quickely pleased, and very angry, and very well pleased. Whatsoever he is, or doth, he putteth full strength vnto it. It is a great maistery, saith Seneca, to play a man kindly. Of one whome thou sawest but ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday, thou maist aske the next, who is this? he is so much chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. VVould a man know Ionas to be Ionas, that had seene him before in his exceeding wrath, and now should finde him so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well pleased? This vvere enough for a childe, whose limber and inconstant passions are every howre altered. Yet Ionas bewraieth his weakenesse in the like mutability of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times boyling like a sea, or like the river in Esay, <hi>mightie and greate,</hi> with abundance of choler, sometimes as strongly over-borne vvith a contrary affection; constant in nothing but in his inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and never moderating himselfe with a milde and sober cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as those <hi>vvaters of Shiloah, that ranne softly.</hi> Peter Martyr vvriting of the affections of man, sorowe, ioy, hope, feare, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the rest, compared them to the vvinds vvherewith a shippe is driven: they may bee helpes to the shippe, and they may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvv it. The passions, I thinke, wherewith Ionas was driven too and fro, vvere more vehement than that winde, vvhich ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the former tempest. For vvhen hee is angry, hee is sore grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; vvhen he is glad, he is over-much apaide; and when he is angry againe, he is <hi>angry to the death.</hi> So he is not only variable in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as Proteus was in his shapes, wrought like vvaxe vpon a suddaine, but he is also as intemperate in them, not able to containe himselfe within the listes of any moderation.</p>
                  <p>That you may knovve what vesselles they are vvhich GOD doeth vse in the mninistration of his holiest vvorke, in bearing his name before the vvorlde, and preaching the gospell of Christ the richest treasure that ever the earth received: they are earthly vesselles, made of clay, and shaped of the selfe-same moulde, vvhereof all mankinde is fashioned. Prophetes they are, but as Moses spake, <hi>like vnto their brethren,</hi> not onely in similitude of flesh, as CHRIST onely vvas, but in similitude of sinnefull and infirme flesh; Apostles they are, and CHRIST chose

We trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the commandement of God more than ever Ionas did, and we are more sleepie than hee was, in the hazard of the ship, that is, in the danger of Christes Church: and our passions of anger, envie, and ioy, beare vs away with more violence.

But I turne to my matter in hand. How exceeding and vnmeasurable the ioy of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas was, appeareth, 1. by doubling the affection, <hi>laetabatur laetitiâ, hee reioyced with ioy</hi>; 2. by adding an attribute, <hi>magnâ, laetitiâ, with great ioy</hi>: so it was ioy, and ioy, and great ioy. Such as Esay describeth in the 9. of his prophecy, <hi>according to the ioy of harvest, and as men reioyce when they divide a spoile: or as one that commeth with a pipe, to go vnto the mount of the Lorde.</hi> The nature of ioy, as also of love and liking to any thing,<note place="margin">Esa. 30.</note> is, to dilate and stretch out the heart; for vvhen it taketh pleasure in the obiect, it openeth it selfe as a friend his bosome and armes to embrace a friend, so this, the chambers and roumes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to welcome that pleasure which is come vnto it.

and to take them to his mercy in peace, let them agree with their adversarie in the vvaie, much more bee at one vvith God, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their heartes nor tongues murmure at his iudgementes. Death (I confesse) is an advantage to some men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but such as with an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heart, and sinewes in their forehead, striue against the Lorde their maker, and goe to lavve vvith one mightier than themselues, not caring to make an ende in time, of the controversies betweene them, their death is a death indeede, and litle profit or ease to bee founde in it. The purpose of this verse in hand, vvas none other than to set forth vnto vs the afflictions of Ionas: and vndoubtedlye they are very great. For as Nahomi aunsvvered her people in the first of Ruth, vvhen they asked, <hi>is not this Nahomi? call me not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homi, that is, beawtifull or pleasaunt, but call mee Marah, for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie hath given mee much bitternesse; I went out full, and the Lord hath caused me to returne empty; why then cal ye me Nahomi, seeing the Lord hath humbled mee, and the Almightie hath brought mee to adversitie?</hi> So Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas might have aunswered to those that had asked, is not this Ionas? call me <hi>not Ionas,</hi> a doue, but call mee a Pellican, or owle in the desarte; I vvas full of pleasure and amaenity, and my heart reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished vvith exceeding ioy, but the Lorde hath emptied me. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things there are in our liues for which vve may change our names, (as Nahomi did) from beawty or pleasure to bitternesse. But if we remember withall, that it is the worke of the Lord to humble vs, and the hand of the Almighty that bringeth vs to adversitie, that one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation will suffice to teach vs patience. For to whome doe we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owe the quietnes and subiection of our spirites, than vnto him, who, as Theodorite somevvhere excellently spake, <hi>both giveth his benefites vnto vs, to teach vs how easily hee can bestow them, and taketh them away, that we may know how litle we deserue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Thus haue the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God evermore begunne their consultations in their <hi>daies of tempation,</hi> and as it were beckoned to themselues for silence, <hi>Dominus est, it is the Lorde,</hi> take heede of repining at his iudgementes; it is not mine enimie, for then I vvoulde haue hid my selfe; it is not the sonne of man, for then I vvoulde haue resisted him; it is not any creature of God, I vvoulde then haue devised some meanes to redresse my griefe: it is the Lorde himselfe, vvho hath more right to my soule, than that he may be contraried: for both he hath beene beneficial vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me here-tofore, &amp; may againe hereafter.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>And God said to Ionas, doest thou well to be angrie for the gourd? &amp;c.</hi> The gourd prepared by God, had a double vse: the one natural and open, to cast a shadow over the head of Ionas: the other typicall and secret, to demonstrate the iniquity of his iudgement, which vse we are nowe comming vnto. In this actual reprehension, which God is framing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, there were many antecedents (I told you) which made the way thervnto: al which we haue already examined. Now we are des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to that end wherevnto God disposed them.</p>
                  <p>The words here spoken by God, <hi>Doest thou well to be angry</hi>? are the same which were vsed in the former insimulation: and the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the words, to weete, the anger of Ionas. Who would not haue thought but one reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue served one kind of sin? but so is sin to the soule of man, in some part of comparison, as Iacob was vnto Esau, Gen. 27. of whom Esau complained, <hi>was he not rightlie called Iacob? For he hath deceived me these two times, first he tooke my birth-right from me, and loe now hath he taken my blessing.</hi> And surely sinne will supplant vs twise and tenne times togither, vnlesse God preserue vs. Ionas offendeth once more in the same perturbation, and the Lorde reproveth him once more in the same forme of reprehension. What else shall I say heereof, but as Ioseph said to Pharaoh touching his two dreames, the one of the kine, the other of the eares of corne, <hi>both Pharaohs dreames are one; therefore the dreame is doubled to Pharaoh the second time,</hi>

                     </note> I wil adde no more than the rule &amp; practise of Bernard, as I finde it me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in his life. His rule or observation is this. <hi>Where there resou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth on both sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the reprover, &amp; him that is reproved, modesty, &amp; mildnes of speech, it is a sweet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; where it is held on the one side only, it is profitable; where both partes lay it aside, it is pernicious; but where there is hardnes &amp; bitternes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, iurgiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est, non correctio, nec disciplina, sedrixa,</hi> it is not correction &amp; instruction, but chiding &amp; brawling: &amp; (to adioine the wordes of Anselme,) <hi>tunc no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> veritas quaeritur, sed animositas fatigatur,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not the truth sought for, but men exercise &amp; weary their stouts harts. Therfore the maner of S. Bernard, because he would be sure to retaine this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty on the one side, was, to be very vrgent vpon him that yeelded, &amp; as yeelding another time to him that resisted. Albeit, Ionas behaue himselfe very vnmodestly &amp; vndutifully towardes God, yet God is otherwise affected towardes Ionas; &amp; rather than the strife betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall vanish without profite, sheweth more mildnesse than Ionas had deserved. His kindnes appeareth in 3. things. 1. In reprooving, &amp; repressing his rage; for which cause David blessed Abigaill, <hi>blessed bee the Lord God of Israell which sent thee this day to meete me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>and blessed be thy counsaile, &amp; blessed be thou which haste kept me this day from comming to shed bloud.</hi> 2. In reprooving him twise for owne thing; who with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry word of his lips could so haue abated his passion at the first, that there should haue beene no place for a second; as Abisai spake to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid of smiting Saul, <hi>let me smite him once to the earth with a speare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>and I will not smite him againe.</hi> 3. In reprooving him so friendly. I am sure, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with their fellow servantes haue dealt otherwise.

Cassiodore expoundeth it thus: <hi>the blessed Prophet permitted that which is vsual and accustomable vnto man,</hi> (which is to bee angry) <hi>but forbad that vvhich in anger is sinnefull.</hi> Others are of opinion, that hee rather counsailed that which is naturall, (allowing it to bee good) than permitted that which is vsuall. Surely to bee angry, is not sinne, but in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance wee may offende; either in regarde of the obiect, vvhich is revendge; as if wee desire revendge against him who hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it, or more than hee hath deserved, or not holding a lavve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full course therein, or not observing the right ende; that is, if wee bende not our selues to the preservation of iustice, and the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of offences, but to execute our malice: either in regard of the measure, when we are angry over-much. For anger is a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affection, if it bee not stayed with lawes; and there is litle oddes betweene it and madnesse. And as hardely are they ordered and pacified, that are throughly possessed vvith a fitte thereof, as men possessed with divels. To the measure of affection we may also adde the length of time. For anger and a sweete conceite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendge may so long bee kept in the vessels of our hearts, til it waxe eager and sower, and bee turned into malice. For anger and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice differ but in age, as newe and olde wine. Chrysostome conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the wordes of our Saviour Math. 5. VVhosoever is angry with his brother <hi>without a cause &amp;c. Qui cum causâ non irascitur, peccat.</hi> Therefore <hi>hee that is not angry, when there is iust cause, sinneth; for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable and supine patience, soweth vice, nourisheth negligence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth not onely the bad and ill disposed, but the good to naughtinesse.</hi> The iustest cause is the cause of God, rather than of man, publique ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than private, when the gospell of Christ is dishonoured, iustice troden vnder foote, falshod extolled, not when our proper iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are pursued. For as anger in the former place conceaved, is not <hi>anger but iudgemente,</hi> and a simple or advised motion of the will, in the vpper part of the soule arising by the prescripte and rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not a suddaine and troublesome passion of the sensitiue and lower part: so, apprehended in the later place for private and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall grudges, whither vniustly, or vpon deserte, it never findeth

He promiseth it vnto Israell, <hi>Beholde, I will multiply vpon you man and beast, &amp; they shall encrease &amp; bring forth.</hi> Abraham and Lot were very rich in cattle Gen. 13. so were Iacob and Esau,<note place="margin">Ezech. 36</note> Gen. 36. the land could not beare them both togither because of their flockes. So was Vzzah the king, 2. Chr. 26. <hi>he built towers in the wildernesse, and digged many cisternes, for hee had much cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle both in the valleyes and plaines. The substance of Iob,</hi> in the first of that booke, <hi>was seuen thousand sheepe, and three thousand cammelles, and fiue hundred yoke of oxen, and fiue hunered shee-asses,</hi> &amp; towardes the end of his daies, all these were doubled vnto him.</p>
                  <p>You see then what reasons the Lord hath vsed in this second mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber of the comparison, for the sparing Niniveh. 1.

Such honour did Turnus giue to Aeneas when he vanquished him,

thou hast overcome me, and the people can beare witnes that I acknowledge thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. With this most sweete and victorious sentence doth Ionas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, or rather breake of his prophecy, as if hee had said, great is thy truth, and prevaileth. Thy mercy triumpheth against iustice, much more shall it triumph against dust and ashes. Let the corrupt affections of man, giue place to thy righteous iudgements, let both greate and small, the infant, and dumbe beast sing of thy lovinge kindnes, <hi>and let every thing that hath breath, say, the Lorde bee praised.</hi> And let this be the end of my labours for this time, The meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that mercy of God, wherin this prophcy is ended, &amp; let the labours of my whole life know non other end. Thus let me end the day &amp; begin the night, end the night and begin the day againe; whither <hi>I</hi> read or write, thinke or speak, or whatsoever else <hi>I</hi> do, let me doe it all with this conclusion; &amp; when I haue run out the race of my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful daies let me rest at that happy marke, wherin the Lord doth giue over his argument, <hi>I</hi> these paines.</p>

Chapters whereof, as those 4. beasts in the Revelation,<note place="margin">Revel. 4.</note>

For where the mercy of God was then but exemplified in fact, 1. to the mariners, 2. to Ionas, 3. to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh in the 3. first chapters, here it is pleaded, maintained, propug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned touching the right &amp; reasonablenes therof, with arguments so strong, as that, I say not the tongue of man, but not the gates of the nethermost hell shall ever be able to prevaile against it. Whilst there is a difference betwixt day and night, &amp; when the covenant of day and night shall be broken, this indifferency betwixt God and man shall stand in force, <hi>shalt thou spare, and shall not I spare</hi>? or rather this difference, if thou sparest not, yet will I spare.

                  <p>I haue sent for you, to this end, that before my departure, I might giue some testimony of that faith wherein <hi>I</hi> haue hitherto lived, and am now to die. <hi>What I haue received of the Lord, that I haue ever delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> I haue red much, written much, often disputed, preached often, yet never could I finde in the booke of God any grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for Popery: neither haue I knowne any point of doctrine received in the church of England, that is not consonant vnto the word of God. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorted me (my colleague beeing then absent) to continue in that building, wherein I had already laide my foundation; and because I was nowe his ghostly father (which was the vnworthy name, a father bestowed vpon me a childe in comparison) required that I would not neglect to repaire vnto him twise or thrise before his ending. I told him, that having often in his life ministred so good comfortes to others, he could not want comfort to himselfe. He gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I replied, that I thought it the best, and I feared would be the last service, that ever I shoulde doe vnto him. Howbeit, the comfortes which I had to giue, I coulde but powre into the outwarde eares; and that it must be the spirit of God, which inwardly comforteth the conscience.

some little comparison, betwixte good king Iosias, and gracious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Queene Elizabeth. 1. They both interpret their names, in rendring and expressing by action the force thereof. Iosias, of the <hi>fire of the Lorde,</hi> with whose zeale he was enflamed, Elizabeth of his rest, both because shee reposeth her selfe in his strength, and for that the quiet &amp; tranquillity of this Land was by her happy governement restored. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Iosias was prophecied of long before his birth, 1. Kings 13. <hi>O altar altar &amp;c. Beholde, a childe shalbe borne to the house of David, Iosias by name; and vpon thee shall hee offer the priestes of the high places &amp;c.</hi> and vndoubtedly they presaged much of the abolishinge of altars and priestes, vnder the raigne of Queene Elizabeth, vvho laboured to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> prevent her government by such manifold practises. 3. Iosias at the age of 16. yeares sought the God of his father David: I never red or heard to the contrarie, but that the child-hoode and prime of our soveraigne Lady, and that glorious blossome her brother of blessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> memorie, were dedicated to true religion. 4. Iosias forsaketh the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry of Amon and Manasses that went next before him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth backe to the faith of David: Elizabeth declineth the path which her sister Mary had troden, the foote-steppes whereof were yet very fresh, and reneweth the waies of her father and brother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> worne out. 5. Iosias had a good priest, a good prophet, a good chauncellour, a good nobility, faithfull vvorkemen. <hi>The king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that no accompte shoulde bee taken of them for they did their worke faithfullie.</hi> It had not beene possible to haue repaired the ruines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced religion within this land, without the advise and assistaunce of as faithfull a Counsaile, and as zealous Priests: of which though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were cast out for a time from their natiue countrey, into Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and other forreigne partes, as a distempered stomake cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to keepe holesome meates in it, yet they vvere brought home againe with honour as banished Ieptha was, and deservedly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the highest dignities of our Church.

                     </gap>is waies by the booke of the lawe: and no other starre guided the heart of our gracious Esther. Iosias caused the booke of the lawe to bee openly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> red: shee the <hi>everlasting gospell</hi> to bee preached throughout all her realmes and dominions. Iosias maketh a covenant himselfe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> taketh a covenant of his people to obserue it: shee also bindeth her people by statutes and lawes, to the true worshippe of God, herselfe not second to any in rendring her vowes. Iosias holdeth a famous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> passeover, the like whereof, from the daies of the iudges &amp; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the daies of the kinges, had never beene seene: And her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty hath purdged the sacraments of Christ, &amp; reduced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their right forme, vvhich I saie not from the time of the Conquerour, but almost since the daies of the Apostles, they vvere never happie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to obtaine. And as Iosias <hi>turned to the Lorde, with all his hearte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> &amp;c.</hi> So whither her beautifull feete haue not taken a contrary course to that vvherein others had walked before her, &amp; turned like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iordan, vvhen Israell vvent over it, not onely the people of this land, but almost of whole Christendome swimming away apace in a full floud of Popish superstition; and vvhither to the Lorde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, Angelles and Saintes omitted, who in the consciences and opinions of men had set their seates by the seate of Almightie God, &amp; said, we will be like vnto him in worship; and vvhither <hi>with all her hearte and vvith all her soule, and vvith all her mighte &amp;c.</hi> whom neither the curses of Popes, nor the banding of the Princes of the earth cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a confederarcie, a confedeacie</hi> against her, nor practises vvithout her realme, nor rebellions within, nor the dissoialtie of male-conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted subiectes, nor trecherie vvithin her Courte and almost in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, did ever affright, at least not shake from her first loue, as they haue done other princes, and cause to deale vnfaithfullye vvith the covenants of God; let all the people of the earth so far as the fame of her constancy might be blowne, vvitnesse with me. Now there are also some differences, heaping more honour and favour vpon the head of our Soveraigne Lady, than befell Iosias. For albeit Iosias began to raigne sooner, yet shee hath longer continued. And where Iosias raigned but 31. yeares, shee hath accomplished the full num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:8475:360"/>
of 37. within few moneths of her fathers time.

From the erecting of the kingdome of Israell vnder the hand of Saul, to their going into Babylon, they saie, were foure hundreth and nineteene yeares. The Consuls of Rome continued 462. the Monarchy flourished 454. Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vvas the seate of the Roman Emperour 489. La Noue vvhen he wrote his military and politicke discourses observed the like number of time in their kingdome of France from the daies of Hugh Capetz.

And since the time of the Norman conquest the seventy and seven weeks of Daniell, that is, 70. times 7. yeares are fulfilled, and God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therevnto, as the fifteene yeares of Ezechias, and as the surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of his loue, onely the happy raigne of our liege Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse that now ruleth. But as the Apostle spake in his Revelation, <hi>Heere is wisedome, If any man may haue wisedome enough, let him accompte the number of kingdomes in this sorte.</hi> For it may bee the number of God himselfe, and hee hath reserved it to his owne knowledge.
