            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

humble way, to speak of His Majesties condition at present, how lightly the Coffers of the Crown are yet ballasted, what vast summes have bin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of them to discharge such indispensable arrears, and how unable he is to do what he so heartily intends, with what convenient speed he may; Then he gives a touch at some Roundheads that were rais'd, who, computed with the Civaliers, are not <hi>one</hi> for <hi>twenty,</hi> which, under favor, holds tru, take all professions together; for go to the Church ther are twenty five Bishops for one; go to Deans, Canons, Prebends, ther is forty to one; go to the parochial Ministers, wherof ther be above 9000. in the Land, ther is above fifty to one; go to the Universities, how many Heads of Houses, and Fellows of Colledges have bin thrust out, and Cavaliers put in their rooms? go to the City, scarce any Roundhead hath receav'd favor. The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Tower and six Commissioners of the Custom house, with divers other Officers, all Cavaliers; go to the twelve Judges ther are ten to two; go to the Sargeants, with other Officers at Law, go to the Army and Life-guard; go to the Court above and below stairs, the odds more then twenty to one holds for the Cavalier: Tis tru, fom few are crept in into Offices, but 'tis for their

               <hi>mon y,</hi> whereof I beleeve the King hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg (and 'tis only God Almighty is <hi>omniscious.)</hi> Touching those <hi>Lords</hi> of the Privy-counsel, I take leave to say, that we stood without the Curtain and could not see what was contriv'd within, for His Majesties coming over, where the Consultation of the said Privy counsellors with other choice Lords and Persons (that were the Kings Confidents to that end) did very much avail to bring the business about; though indeed, as the case then stood, it may be said that no humane wit or power, but it was pure <hi>Omnipoten ce</hi> which did the work: But let it not offend any to remember, that divers great Kings have bin enforc'd to raise and reward <hi>those</hi> that were once their very enemies for a time; The Kings of <hi>France,</hi> at the pacification of <hi>Nants,</hi> and the Treaty of <hi>Loudun,</hi> were, by <hi>Article,</hi> to confer <hi>honors,</hi> in lieu of <hi>punishments,</hi> upon divers who in open Field fought against them; and the last King was to remove his bosomest Counsellor from him, as <hi>Sillery,</hi> and others; that Hee shold approve of all actions pass'd as done for his service, &amp;c. And all this by public Edict, which was <hi>verified by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement.</hi> In such a posture, it seems, were things in our <hi>Edward</hi> the Seconds time, when dining in Westminster-Hall upon a great Festival, ther


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49800:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came a Minstrell-woman on horse-back to shew som sports, and going about the Table she left a paper behind, as <hi>Stow</hi> hath it in his Survey of <hi>London</hi> page 521. as also <hi>Daniel</hi> in his History of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, which paper was as followeth, <hi>Our Soverain Lord the King hath nothing courteously respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His Knights that, in his Fathers time, and also in His own, have put forth their Persons to divers perils, and have utterly lost or greatly diminish'd their substances, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the said King, and he hath enrich'd abundantly such as have not born the weight, as yet, of the businesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the Cordial proceeds then to His Majesties great <hi>clemency,</hi> wherat som seem to except; 'Tis tru in som cases, <hi>That he who spares the guilty wrongs the innocent;</hi> And 'tis as tru, that th <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi> of a Cavalier is to be prefer'd before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> of a Roundhead; But the World knows what Rules of <hi>Mercy</hi> His Father (of ever blessed Memory) prescribes him in his sacred Legacies; Moreover, ther's a world of examples how, after a Civil War, such Acts of Indemnity, such Amne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia's and general pardons were granted of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for if the Law were permitted to pass in such cases, the King might hang up half his Subjects; yet, it cannot be denyed, but that it is a very sad case, that one shold have my Horses in his stables,


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49800:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my Hangings and Housh old-stuff in his House my Oxen in his plough, my Books in his study, my Jewels upon his wifes fingers, which he had rob'd me of, with other things, and that I shold not have the benefit of the Law to recover them; yet, touching <hi>that,</hi> let it be also consider'd how many hundred Cavaliers have bin restor'd since to their <hi>Real Estates, and Offices,</hi> which, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be call'd properly a <hi>Reward,</hi> yet it is a cleer <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> we receav'd by the Kings coming, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit we were in despair of but twenty Moneths since.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Author</hi> goes on with som encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not as if he went about to read a lecture of <hi>patience,</hi> it being not only an unseasonable thing, but a peece of impertinency, to preach patience to those who are upon point of sinking or starving; as, God wot, too many of the <hi>Royalists</hi> are; only He gives a hint, that they shold stil keep up their spirits, ther being no doubt but that His Majesty being so so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sible of their condition, and the Parlement being made up of so many Worthy and discerning Gentlemen, they will put <hi>Him</hi> in a capacity to take <hi>them</hi> into due and speedy consideration, as it is well hoped they will do upon their <hi>Re-accesse,</hi> 10 which purpose that <hi>Cordial</hi> may do more good then they are aware.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49800:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To conclude, he who with a sober and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biass'd judgment will examine that <hi>Cordial,</hi> will find, that ther is never a Line, Word, or Syllable therin, but breaths out the spirit of a perfect Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, as above twenty other several <hi>peeces</hi> of the same Author publish'd upon Emergent occasions, do breath besides, ther is no fretful <hi>drug,</hi> or the least Corrosive <hi>dram</hi> in it, but all gentle <hi>lenitifs,</hi> therfore he wonders how it should stir up such <hi>Malignant humors</hi> in any, unless it were in them, who having somthing lying upon the <hi>stomack,</hi> made wrong use of that <hi>Cordial</hi> to cast it up.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Author of that <hi>Cordial</hi> is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that ther will be such a noble conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had of the Cavaliers, that they shall have cause to say to His Majesty, as the Grave of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemburg</hi> said to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fift after the Wars of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who having don notable exploits in that War, and the Emperour acknowledging it, Sir, said he, <hi>If ther be occasion again, I will feed upon one arm, and fight with the other, to do your Majesty service.</hi>
