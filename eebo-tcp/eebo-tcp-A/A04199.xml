            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT Reuerend Father in God, IOHN, <hi>by Gods prouidence, Lord Bishop of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>William Iackson</hi> wisheth all grace, and true comfort in this life, and <hi>eternall happinesse in the life to come.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>REuerend Father in God, it may in mee (so meane a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) appeare no small pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, leaping out of the dungeon of obscurity, which had inclosed me, now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt your learned iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a few vnskilfull lines: and to eclipse your Lordships aspect from better things. For, I must confesse, (with <hi>Barnard) Quod animarum susceperim curam, qui meam non sufficerem custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire.</hi> And (as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith) <hi>Factum est vt prius docere inciperem, quam discere:</hi> and therefore not sufficiently worthy, to present your iudgement with this vnlearned Treatise: Which is rawly comprised in a few scattered leaues, and as rudely composed in a sort of scribbled and vnlettered lines: and farre from that lordly gift, that <hi>Aconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> offered vnto <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> King of <hi>Aragon.</hi> But howsoeuer, I am not able (with ramping Lions) to runne in with mighty prayes: yet giue mee leaue (with the little Ant) to carie into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb facs="tcp:7913:3"/>
my small wheaten graine. And though I cannot bring gold to the building of the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, yet let my goats-haire be accepted; and what is wanting by my pen, I supply with desire of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: now, <hi>animus in dono, astimandus. Plinie</hi> was wont to say, <hi>Nullum librum tam malum esse, vt non aliqua ex parte prodesses.</hi> Therefore (Reuerend Father in God) first I intreate your Lordship, to pardon my presumption in this attempt: and then a kind acceptance of this <hi>opusculum,</hi> to giue it leaue to feede at your Altar; and gather strength from your greatnesse, (as the Moone doth light from the Sunne) that it may find the more fauour among the vulgar: <hi>Dauid</hi> was safe vnder Gods protection, and this cannot miscarie, through your Lordships patronizing the same.</p>
            <p>Indeed I was purposed, to send it to the broad world, to shift for it selfe, as fearing no man would be god-father to so strange a childe: For it is like the bitter waters of <hi>Iericho</hi> to the sinner, though it bee as the deaw of <hi>Hermon</hi> to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. For as it is <hi>bonis bona,</hi> so it is <hi>malis mala;</hi> not in it selfe, but through their corruption. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues the gallant of pride, the Lawyer of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the Courtier of ambition, the Magistrate of idlenesse, the Vsurer of cruelty, the Broker of theft, the Merchant of ingrossing, the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of deceit, and most of sinne: Whither then should it flee, but to the Sanctuary for refuge? For <hi>amicus certus, medicus</hi> (said <hi>Cato.) Nec quisquam melior medicus, quàm fides amicus.</hi> And here I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire but two of your Worthies, for this naked
<pb facs="tcp:7913:3"/>
Worke, countenance to beautifie it, and power to protect it. And then I haue what I desire: your Lordship to fauour it, the vulgar to obey it, and God to accept it.</p>
            <p>This booke may be compared to <hi>Dauids</hi> song <hi>misericordiam</hi> and <hi>iudicium;</hi> the blessings of <hi>Geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi> and the curses of <hi>Ebal;</hi> the oyle of consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the water of compunction: and, if I may so say, like <hi>Ianus</hi> with his two faces, comforting the good, reprouing the euill: Or, if you please, like <hi>Argus</hi> with his hundred eyes, which beholds the sinnes of this age in euery corner, though without thankes, yet not without profit, (if they would obey it.) I intend here with the good gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, to reuerberate the weeds, &amp; exhilarate the good herbes: The greatest good is to be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and yet not the least reiected. I doubt not but the small light that enters through my little casements, will chase the creking Bats, and staring Owles, (I meane the wicked of this darke age) and in time cause them to eiaculate their sinnes.</p>
            <p>Which would sooner bee effected, if you (to whom God hath concredited both the Word and the sword) should open the eye-lids of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall diseipline, that the filthinesse of sinne may appeare to the heart of the Law: and what our words cannot do with their affections, your swords may worke vpon their maners. <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> saith, that <hi>Censura est magistra vitae, &amp; mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiae:</hi> For, execution of Lawes, and correction of maners, are the sinewes of the Common-wealth, and the lampe of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7913:4"/>
I could wish that our Church were purged of wicked persons, that common drunkards, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, vsurers, and the like, may not be admitted, as members of the Church, till there be a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of them: For it is a great scandall to the Gospell, and no lesse griefe to the godly. And hence it is, that the Separatists speake euill of vs, because these wicked are among vs. But is there no balme at Gilead to cure this sore? Yes, if vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous officers, are not sicke of a golden dropsie: for then it will not bee healed without a siluer plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: and I feare, the Lawes heeles will be tript vp with tricks, the cause vitiated, the purse wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but the sinner sent home as wicked as he came. Therfore this chastening of the sinner is not to be neglected: <hi>Non enim superbia, nisivbi negligitur disciplina, nam disciplina est magistra, religionis vitae, &amp; pietatis.</hi> What is then to be desired, but as there are good lawes, for the punishing of the sinner, so they may be duely executed, and not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed by vitious officers and Proctors: and that the wheeles of their tongues, may not be set a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a weight of bribery, nor a golden addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make the hammer strike to the sinners plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and that mercenary tongues, and money spel'd consciences, may not spoyle our Church, to inrich themselues.</p>
            <p>Also the contempt of Religion: is growen too generall among vs. What a shame is it, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of religion should bee brought foorth in Playes vpon a stage, by prodigious Players, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them? Surely wee had not need to dull the
<pb facs="tcp:7913:4"/>
edge of profession, it is too blunt already, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sharpen the same, with the wetstone of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. It is no maruell though religion come so seldome to our doores, when it hath such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: We haue beaten the shell so long, that the kernell is come to nothing: We haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the hypocrite so long, till we haue chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den away all profession: and yet euery professor is not an hypocrite, though euery hypocrite bee a professor.</p>
            <p>Christ taught, that our works should shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men &amp; for outward profession must accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie inward grace. It is no sinne to haue an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew of puritie, but a vertue; and therefore to be countenanced, and defended from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious spirits of the world: and if I said barking Dogges, I sayd but as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, which hunts out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holinesse into <hi>Obadiahs</hi> caue: that it dare not shew it selfe, for feare it should be brought vpon a stage, or put in verse, or to some other vse, to make themselues merrie withall.</p>
            <p>Shall this be suffered, then religion will be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished ere long: and I cannot blame it, if it walke in obscuritie already, and dare not bee seene. But is there neuer an <hi>Obadiah</hi> in the land, nor <hi>Hester</hi> in the Court, nor an <hi>Ahimelech</hi> at <hi>Nob,</hi> to fauour their profession, and protect their persons? <hi>Non est meae humilitatis diotare vobis:</hi> yet (say as God said to the Iewes) <hi>Though Israel play the harlot, let not Iudah sinne:</hi> Though the Temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate sit still and say nothing, yet let not Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall gouernours keepe silence.

And to vse the Apostles words, <hi>What haue we that wee haue not receiued?</hi> not simply for our owne vse, but for the good of others also: Therefore, that wee may not be found vncharitable, we must giue of our owne, nor vnfaithfull, we must be true in bestowing of others gifts: and then we shall bee twice blessed with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and haue a double portion with <hi>Beniamin.</hi> But to bring this home to the doores of your consciences: Yea, Worshipfull company of <hi>Cloth-workers,</hi> for whome I in particular am bound to pray, not so much for your owne donation vnto mee, as your faithfull pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which others haue giuen for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of religion. Of whom I may say, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did
<pb facs="tcp:7913:6"/>
of <hi>Ierusalem, Many excellent things are spoken of thee, thou Citie of God:</hi> so many excellent things are done by you: Yea, worthy and worship full <hi>Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers,</hi> with <hi>Dorcas</hi> you make coates to clothe the naked: with the <hi>Shunammite,</hi> you prepare houses for the harbourlesse to dwell in: with <hi>Obadiah,</hi> you relieue the Prophets, and much more of this nature, which to set downe in order, would both spend much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and also a wearinesse to my hand: it is sufficient, God knowes them, and will one day reward the same. I speake not this to make you proud, but as my duetie to you, and to encourage others to the same. And so I will conclude with the saying of the: Apostle, yee haue, and doe well, yet I beseach you to increase more and more: whereby your name may bee more spread on earth, and your glory greater enlarged in heauen.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>CHristian reader: I am now to salute thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding with a few lines of exhortation: be thou as willing to embrace them, as they are ready to profit thee: if vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding be thy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and conscience thy lesson. And here I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire but two things of thee, first to reade with diligence, then to marke with iudgement: for thou canst haue no sicknes, but here is physicke: no sore, but here is a plaister for it. It is like <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, one end standing on the earth, the other reaching vp to heauen; It begins at faith and repentance, leading thee along in the path of obedience, and so at the length brings thee to glory. I would not that any should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect against the author, and so vse the child the worse for the fathers sakc: but rather consider that the child may be good, though the father be euill. I will make no apologie in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of it: for it is able to speake in the defence of it selfe. And now I must make an apologie for my selfe, why I haue sent this booke forth into the world; one cause is, in regard I was wronged by euill tongues after I had preached the same; wherefore I now send it foorth to make answere for mee. A second cause why I send it foorth, is this: because the matter therein being of great vse; (and a Sermon is but nine dayes wonder,) would not haue the funerall so soone, therefore I thought good to intreate that fauour of the higher powers to put it in print. And now let me intreate thy affections to embrace it, and thy diligence to practise it. Thus I leaue these fewe lines to thy selfe to be obeyed, and thy selfe to the Lord to be glorified.</p>

               <p>RIght Honorable, and well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our best be loued. I knowe that many haue been the flowers that my brethren the Prophets, haue gathered out of the garden of Gods word: giuing a fragrant smell in this place: so that I know not what flowers to gather, to present you withall: that formerly yee haue not seene. Yet, in this my meditation, I considered of my worthy Auditors, and so fitted my text, accordingly. Some of them, being Iudges, and Magistrats, that fitly I might speake to them, of Iustice. An other part of them being inferiour subiects, that also I might speake to them of obedience. In a word considering that heere are vsually auditours, of all sorts, I haue made choyce of such a text, as doth speake to all persons. I feared to speake of Iudgement, least it should make the weake harted to tremble. Or of mercy, least the wicked should be secure. Therefore I haue ioyned them together.</p>

In the holy Scripture, these two things euer do concurre: <hi>Sententia breuis, res ampla,</hi> A finit sentence an infinit sence, as in a litle mapp we see a world of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, &amp; what the foote cannot measure, in many dayes, the eye passeth ouer in a moment. This text is a little Mappe of the whole body of Diuinitie: &amp; turnes ouer vnto vs a golden lease, whose inke is <hi>Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:</hi> and the penne, the wing of Angels: for the matter expressed is wholly celestiall. <hi>Quis sit finis iustorum it iustificantium iustos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will, in somesort, open the euerlastiing dores, and heere shewe you the King of glorie: and in him, your glorie. Therefore let an holie reuerence possesse your soules, and say with Iacob: <hi>This place is fearfull: none other but the house of God, and the gate of Heauen.</hi> where will appeare the loue of God in his Iudgements, to the sonnes of men: who in promising mercie, omits iudgment, but in threatning iudgment, remembers mercy? as heere in this place.</p>
               <p>And now as you intend to trauell with me, in this way, tye your considerations vnto two generall heads.</p>
               <p>The first is a precept. The second is the consequent. The precept is affirmatiuelie set downe, and is illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a metaphor taken from the husbandman. First, by the plowetime. <hi>Innouate vobis nouale.</hi> Plowe vp your fallowe. Secondly, by the seede time, <hi>Seminate vobis in iusticia,</hi> sowe to your selues in righteousnesse. Thirdly by the haruest time. <hi>Metite in ore misericordiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Euery one of these times, offer 3. branches apeece. First the subiect, the fallowe grownd. 2 The propertie of the worke, <hi>Plowe.</hi> 3 The proprietie of the persons, <hi>your,</hi> Plowe vp your fallowe grownd. Secondly, the seede time. 1 <hi>Sowe,</hi> There is the Propertie of the worke. 2 <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> there is the matter to worke vpon. 3. <hi>To your selues.</hi> There is the extent of it. Sowe to your selues in Righteousnesse.</p>

Thirdly, the haruest time, 1 The action or worke <hi>reape.</hi> 2 The manner, According to <hi>mercy,</hi> this is the precept, and the parts therof, and now the consequent followes: and is amplified thus: first by an argument, taken from their negligence. <hi>For it is time to seeke the Lord:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by an argument taken from the benefit of it, <hi>till he come &amp; raine righteousnesse vpon you.</hi> In the 1 obserue an action, <hi>seeke,</hi> there is the propertie of it, 2 whom, <hi>the Lord,</hi> there is the obiect of it. 3 why, <hi>for it is time.</hi> There is the compelling cause for it is time to seeke the Lord. In the second part obserue how longe <hi>donec ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiat</hi> vntill he come, there is the continuance of it. 2 <hi>Et doceat iustitiam vobis,</hi> and teach you rightcousnesse there is the ende of it. First by the acte, to <hi>teach,</hi> 2 by the qualitie, <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> 3 the persones, <hi>you.</hi> this is the consequent with the parts thereof. so that now if you will take a generall veiwe of these wordes, you, shall finde euery word a sentence and euery sentence, a world of matter it wants but a skilfull workeman.
A Scripture very necessarie for these dayes, and I thinke, not vnfit for this present auditorie. Albeit to them, whose eares are alwayes listininge after nouelties, it may seeme to triuiall, yet I doubt not but to those that come with willing mindes to learne it, will proue very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Therefore you Right Honorable whom God hath vouchsafed his owne name vnto heere vpon earth, with reuerence attend it.
It is the ground of iudgment, therefore ye most worthy Iudges may liften vnto it; it is the end of controuersies therefore yee skillfull Lawyers may take notice of it; Here is matter of ciuill obedience, therefore ye inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours may fitly learne it, also it is the instrumentall cause of faith, and repentance, therefore ye beleeuers may earnestly embrace it. <hi>Shimgnu debar Iehouah.</hi> Thus who so begins, and ends his dayes, shall dye the death of the lighteous: and his last end shall be like vnto his.

So here we must vnderstand him, that hath heauen for his seeling, the earth for his paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Sunne Moone &amp; starres, for his hangings, the creatures for his diat, and the Angels, for his attendants. <note place="margin">Man patt with all creaturs.</note>

               <p>Man of earth is called earth: and I cannot passe this poynt, before I haue fixed your considerations, vpon this obseruation. How the Lord insinuates, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the wicked by cutting off their names, as not worthy to stand in his booke. The mention of which, would be a blur to his sacred leaues. This is the estema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the wicked beare with God. How thinke ye then, that their persons shall sit in his kingdome, whose names may not stand in his booke?</p>
               <p>Thus God crosses the worlds fashion: some times gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them no names at all: As that reall parrable glues the rich man, no name at all but <hi>Diues.</hi> Some times by <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 19</note> cutting off their names, as the seruants of <hi>Dauid,</hi> were serued by the Princes of <hi>Hannon:</hi> Who cut off their garments by the buttocks: and shaued off halfe their beards.</p>
               <p>So God cutteth off halfe their names. <hi>As Aram</hi> is called <hi>Rame: leconia</hi> is called <hi>Conia.</hi> Surely when God takes letters, from their names, he intendeth also, to take blessings from their persons. Some times he giues them a by name: as the <hi>Bulles</hi> of <hi>Basan.</hi> And here the earth or fallow ground: as vnworthy of any other name, or title of Honor.</p>

It is not alwayes true, that, <hi>Quanto ornatior, tanto nequtor. The more adorned the more wicked.</hi> For surely greatnes is the fairest obiect, to the eye of the world, and goodnes to the eye of heaven. There is a glorious splendor, in pompous honor, if it come by the hand of God. For, <hi>They that honor me, I will honor,</hi> (saith the <note place="margin">

               <p n="3">And as it is the strength of man, so it is the salt, that seasons our obedience, whereby it is made acceptable vnto God: for obedience without the heart, is like the sacrifice of a dog, and the hire of a whore. A good worke without the heart, is but a glorious sinne. <hi>Non tamres ipsa, quam hominum affectus spectantur.

               </p>

               <p>Hereby shewing, that the heart must be ioyned with obedience.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7913:18"/>
sinne; or, as my text saith, a heart prepared to sinne: The euill that he suffers is the corruption of nature: which sauours nothing but vice. The Philosopher said, that <hi>the earth was a naturall mother vnto weedes, but a stepmother vnto herbs.</hi> It is true, in this <hi>earth, man,</hi> by a procliuity of his owne naturall inclination, is apt to produce all manner of euill, but can bring foorth no good: God must first play the husbandman with him: There is no Farmer that so labours his ground, as God must our hearts. Wicked men are bad earth, and base minded, and naturally sinke downewards, yea, with a dull and ponderous declination: All his actions haue a low ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; not out of humilitie, but of base deiection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> reporteth one strange thing among the rest of his reports. That there was a people which could not see in the light, but in the darke: A strange report; yet it is here true by experience: The wicked can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see any thing in the light of grace: they haue their light onely in the darkenesse of nature; for they here see and vnderstand through the darke cloudes of nature: No maruell then, if their heartes bee set vpon sinne, when they can see nothing but euill.</p>
               <p>Neither is God in this any way <hi>causa Peccati,</hi> eitheir <note place="margin">God not the cause of sinne.</note> because his whole nature is corrupted, or in with holding grace from him. For the first, the wise man cleareth God, saying. <hi>This haue I learned, that God made man righteous: but he hath found out many inuentions.</hi> For how could a <note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 31.</note> good cause, produce an euill effect? <hi>A Deo perfecto nihil malum, nihil turpe est,</hi> saith the <hi>Heathen; From God that is perfect, commeth neither euill nor foule thing. Deus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum causa non est, cum bonus sit. God is not the authour of euill, when he himselfe is most good.</hi> But as the Lord speaketh by the Prophet. <hi>Perditio tua ex te. Distruction</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hosa 13. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>is of thy selfe O Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As God is not the cause of this corrupted nature, and so not the cause of sinne: so God is not vniust, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his grace from the wicked: as some heretickes
<pb facs="tcp:7913:18"/>
haue reasoned, in this manner. <hi>Priuatio est a Deo to be depriued is from God. Priuatio est Peccatum. To be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued is sinne, ergo peccatum est a Deo, sinne is from God.</hi> But this is easily answered: for it doth not followe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we can doe nothing without grace: that therefore God is bound to giue it. Indeed we are bound to serue him, but he is not bound to bestow his grace vpon vs; it may be illustrated thus. The King can raise a begger to great honour: is hee therefore bound to doe it? no man will conclude it. So it is with God, if he bestowe his grace vpon this man, it is his mercy towards him: if he doe it not to another, it is none iniustice to him. For his grace is free. <hi>I will haue mercy on him, to whom</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I will shewe mercy: and will haue compassion on him, on whom I will haue compassion.</hi> So, though man be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, God in no wise is the cause of his corruption. Then this nature being so corrupt, seeth, and tasteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is euill.</p>
               <p n="2">A second cause or reason proceedeth from <hi>Sathan:</hi> for hee sitteth in the heart of the wicked, as a Prince vpon his throne commanding the same, how and when he will: This way, and that way: as the winds doe the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars in Libanus.</hi> As the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>They are taken prisoners by him to doe his will.</hi> He is a workeman <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>narrow is the way that leadeth vnto life, and fewe walke that way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If his kingdome bee so great, no maruell if his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments be so many: euery subiect therein is a great States-man, for he is of the priuy counsell: and there is neuer a day, but there is a consultation between the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> and the heart of a wicked man: The <hi>Deuill</hi> cannot be without the least of these, but with great danger to his kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7913:19"/>
There is a two-fold cable-roape, where by the <hi>Deuill</hi> drawes their hearts vnto sinne. The first is, the profit of sinning. <hi>Come cast in thy Lot with vs, we will finde riches,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Profit of sinne tempts vs. Piou. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and also fill our houses with spoyles.</hi> Sinne neuer comes emptie handed: for if it dyed, we would reiect it. We haue all earned <hi>Iudas</hi> his lesson, which is, <hi>Quid dabis?</hi> And thus much doth the Apostle intimate in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> where he saieth <hi>What profit had yee then in those things?</hi> Hereby shewing, that the end of sinning, was the <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 10:</note> game of profit.</p>
               <p>The second, is pleasure and delight: of this speaketh the Apostie in his second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonianst</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pleasure of sin tempts vs. 2. Thess. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>They tooke pleasure in vnrighteousnesse:</hi> And this is that, that aggrauates a mans sinne, to sinne, and then to take pleasure in it: Thus hee bindes two sinnes together, 1. 2 finne to doe it, 2. a sinne to loue it. So the <hi>Diuell</hi> began with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah,</hi> to tempt them to sinne, by the pleasure of sinne, saying. <hi>Yee shall bee as Gods, knowing good and euill.</hi> In many arts, the more-skilfull, the more ill-full; <hi>Armis polentior astus: Fraude goes beyond force.</hi> Thus <hi>Sathan</hi> hath stollen trueths garment, and put it on errors backe. And so because the wayes to hell are full of greene pathes and tempting pleasures, many runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, till they come to their owne place with <hi>Iudas.</hi> Sinne is a coach, the Diuell is the carter: then needes must they goe, whom the Diuell driues; they are drawne to hell in pompe with two coatch-horses: Profit, and Pleasure. What makes the wicked to sell insufficient wares, to deceiue by falle waights, but desire of Profit? What makes the luxurious to followe his lustes? the drunkard his pots, and the gallants their apish attires, but Pleasure. If you thinke I speake too bitter? I would it were not worse then I speake.</p>
               <p>Behold the two wormes that eate out a mans life, and make him fall before he is aware into hell. See what an exchange the wicked makes: hee selles himselfe for profite. and his profite for pleasure: So that of all his
<pb facs="tcp:7913:19"/>
labour, hee hath nothing left, but a wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which runs as fast into despaire, as himselfe doth to damnation: not like <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who stroue whether should come first to the sepulcher; but like <hi>Saul,</hi> and his armor-bearer, whether of them should first dye vpon their swords. Wofull companions a wicked man, and a wounded conscience, striue who shall bee at hell first; well, seeing they be in such hast, let them goe: but I wil not let you goe, before I haue taught you to make vse of this point.</p>
               <p n="1">First, here let the godly take comfort: who, how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they sinne, yet they finne not with an intent. For whosoeuer is borne of God, <hi>Peccatuns non facit: wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>not sinne:</hi> That is, as <hi>Piscator</hi> obserues, <hi>Non dat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peram peccato: giues not himselfe to sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">But here more secondly, that the wicked haue made a couenant with hell, and an agreement with Sathan: that they may sinne at their pleasure, and drinke downe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie draughts of iniquitie: But woe, woe, vnto them: God will one day hold the cuppe of vengeance vnto their lippes, and bid them drinke their fill, that are now so thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie after sinne.</p>
               <p n="3">Let me take you by the hand, and leade you as God did the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and shewe you this fallowe <note place="margin">Fallow ground</note> ground: as the Lord did him their wickednesse; O that it lay in my power to preuaile with your affections, as well as it doth with your iudgements: It should not be long, before you would fall to the plowe, to turne vp this fallow ground.</p>
               <p>First, looke vpon the drunkards, that intend to <hi>rise ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to followe drunkennesse, and are strong to drinke wine.</hi> These gallant Epicures, and christened Athests, sit knocking on their benches, calling for more, and more: and yet more drinke; crowning this day with ryots, and blessing the morrow with promised sursets.</p>
               <p>Drunkennesse is one of the good fellows of our time, and most welcome to our doores, and well may he: for
<pb facs="tcp:7913:20"/>
he vpholds the tap-house, the tap house, the brewer: and the brewer, the maulster: and the maulster, the farmer And all these are beholding to the drunkard. Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse was once the shame of beggers: but now it is become, the pride of gallants. Surely they are possessed with some master Diuell: for there is no small resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance betweene those possessed in the dayes of our Lord, and these drunkards. Reade and you shall finde, some falling into the fire, some into the water: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers foming at the mouth; and doenot our Wine-bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the like? as the Prouerbe is. They were all drunke saue I, and I fell into the fire.</p>
               <p>Yet I haue heard of many more that haue fallen into the water, and there haue perished in their drunkennesse: And daily we see them foming, and gorgeing out their owne shame in euery streete. Well might there force <hi>Barnard</hi> say, that <hi>Ebrietas est manifestissimus demon.</hi> Drunkennesse is a manifest Diuell.</p>
               <p>The deuil brought drunkennes into the world, &amp; these vphold it: for he was the first drunkard: The difference is this; he was drunke with pride and enuie, and these with wine, and strong drinke. There be many kindes of drunkennesse in the Scriptures, <hi>A drunkennesse of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: A drunkennesse of blood: A drunkennesse of sinne: A drunkennesse of pride:</hi> Yet all these are nothing to <note place="margin">Deut. 32. Reuel. 17.</note> this drunkennesse, namely, The drunkennesse of the throat. I haue read of a street called <hi>Vicus sobrius Sober streete:</hi> finde such a one in any of the populous townes of <hi>England,</hi> and it shall be put into the Chronicles. This drunkennesse is that, that giues denomination to all the rest; and these drunkards, and wine-worshippers, are at it on their knees, drinking vp healths, from the ground of their hearts, to the bottome of their cups.</p>
               <p>Wee maruell to see bread so deare, yet it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, when it is metamorphosed into drinke; The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> were accounted great drinkers, and small eaters; <hi>English-men</hi> were accounted great eaters, and smal drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:
<pb facs="tcp:7913:20"/>
but now the saying is changed: <hi>English men</hi> are great drinkers, if not as great eaters: This is a very bad fallow, and must be plowed vp.</p>
               <p>Come now to see another kinde of fallow ground, <note place="margin">No trueth in men.</note> namely, of vntrueth and falshood: Trueth is banished from the earth, <hi>In<expan>

               </p>
               <p>Where is it likely to be found? It should be in euery <note place="margin">Hardly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and tradesmen.</note> place, but I feare, hardly any where: It is a guest that is profitable for all, but entertained of few. It comes to the trades-man, and merchant, and seekes there for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, but, <hi>Non est hic:</hi> It must be kept out from them, for the more ready sale of their wares: A darke light, and insufficient wares, false weights, and no true measures, best befit our calling; Sophistry is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for our gaine, then trueth. It is true indeed: for seldome or neuer breakes trueth out of their lips.</p>
               <p>Well, seeing trueth is so hard to be found among mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and trades-men, see we if it may be found among Lawyers, whether it hath any entertainement among <note place="margin">Trueth is not among Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</note> them, or no: for I hope they will not shuffle plainnesse into difficulties, nor finde out trickes to trip vp the heeles of the Law, wher by a mans cause is ouerthrowen, and himselfe goes home robbed of his money, deceiued in his cause, &amp; cousined of his inheritance: and feele cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in their fists, before they will vnderstand them in their iudgements. I hope our lawes shall not bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by meanes of ambitious Lawyers', though they swarme as thicke now, as the Friers in <hi>Rome:</hi> but not so couetous, as they be superstitious. And though these wilfull beggers are maintained of deuotion and charity, I hope most of our Lawyers haue not their maintenance by heaping vp coales, vpon the fire of strife and enuie; for then should our good lawes bee abused, as if Law
<pb facs="tcp:7913:21"/>
had beene made, rather for the enriching of Lawyers, then for the execution of iustice: No surely, to sell iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is intolerable, but to sell iniustice, is either bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or plaine knauery. God grant that none of them be possessed with some master-deuill, and so sleepe in sinnes then it is more dangerous, then profitable for mee to plow them vp: I will therefore pray to God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and amend them.</p>
               <p>Now let vs step among States-men, and Clergie-men <note place="margin">Is trueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong States-men.</note> for trueth; for there if any where, we are like to find it.

Flattery and dissimulation is the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: trueth breedeth but hatred.</hi> Shall trueth for all this faile here? Shall it not dare to shew it selfe, but be kept vnder harches? as too many vse it, (the more is the pitie), that make merchandile of it, and sell it for a little preferment, or a meales meate. And if it bee so, then this is fallow ground, and must be plowed vp. <note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There is a third fallow ground: namely, the field of oppression: A very bad ground, and dangerous to the <note place="margin">Oppression a sallow ground.</note> commonwealth; such is the sinne of Engrossery, that hoard vp commodities of all sorts, and so make a dearth, without a scarcity. These are worse then the deuill; for he had some charity in him, labouring to make a plenty, where there was a scarcity; when hee would haue had Christ, to <hi>turne stones into bread:</hi> But these cormorants cause a scarcitie in the midst of plenty, in turning bread into stones.</p>
               <p>They haue crafty pates, reaching wits, and large pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: <hi>They compasse sea and land,</hi> as Christ sayth, to get all commodities into their hands: And when they haue gotten them, they sell them as they thinke good, not according to the quantity of the commodity, but according to the quality of their minds.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Euery such engrosser, is a murtherer, not with a sword <note place="margin">Engrosser a murderer.</note> of steele, but with a sword of dearth; it is not his hands, but his crueltie that killeth; not his force, but his craft that wounds vnto death. Will you see how he doth it? he seekes out for corne, gets it into his garner, pitches so high a price, that it stretcheth out the hearts blood of the poore to reach it: <hi>who can but attaine to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Is not this murther? yes, a cruell kinde of murther to starue them to death. I haue read of a people that vse to feede their parents when they are in age, with fatte meate to choake them: but I neuer heard of any that did detaine foodel, whereby they might starue the poore. It is true, that <hi>Home malus fera pessima.

               <p n="2">The engrosser is a thiefe likewise: for he steales away the corne that should make the poores-bread; not with <note place="margin">Engrosser a thiefe.</note> the power of his arme, but by the strength of his purse. Hee fightes with a long weapon, that <hi>reacheth to the foure corners of the land,</hi> and robbes them in their owne houses before they are aware.

These are dangerous theeues; They steale more in one commoditie, then the high-way theese in all the yeere; yet these sit and stare the lawe in the face, and no man doth anything vnto them: where the high-way thiefe that steales for necessitie is trust vp: yet these are greater theeues by diuine lawe, and ought of the twaine rather to bee executed. But
<pb facs="tcp:7913:22"/>
what care these for this? they are too rich to be hanged; yet they are theeues for all their greatnesse; it is not their gold that can buy out their fellonious dealing at the day of Iudgement.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:7913:24"/>
murthered, and <hi>Absalom</hi> hanged by the haire. Looke wee into the Histories, and there is the like: <hi>Rodoal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> (sometime King of <hi>Lombardie</hi>) was suddenly struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken dead in the acte of adultery.

With many other like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, both in diuine and humane Histories.</p>
               <p>To that end you may know what adultery is, marke these branches following.</p>
               <p>First, it is committed in thought, when the mind runs <note place="margin">Adultery in thought.</note> after vncleannesse. This, by our Lord, is called adultery, whose word wee may take for currant: and from this kinde of adultery there are few free: Many are restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the outward acte, partly by outward shame, and partly sor seare of pumshment. This is a secret kind <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> of adultery, which no man (ees, but God: For the heart of man is deepe, and who kuowes it, <hi>ani ithouah choker lib: yet I the Lord searcheth the beart;</hi> finding out this <note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> socret adultery, which there seldome stayes, but as <hi>Lis minimis verbis, interdum maxima crescit: Of small wordes sometime ariseth great contention.</hi> Euen so of inward motion, ariseth carnall copulation; <hi>Ex paruo initio, res magna oritur: From a small biginning ariseth a great matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is committed in the behauiour, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <note place="margin">Adultery in lookes.</note> lookes, and attire, which is so reckoned, by the Lord himselfe. <hi>Thou hast a whorish behauiour, Ne dicatis vos habere animos pudices, sihabeatis oculot impudicos,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine: Say not that you haue modest and chaste affections, if you haue vnchaste, and wanton eyes. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitus mentis, in corporis statu cernitur: The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde, is seene in the state of the bodies,</hi> as <hi>Ambrose</hi> obserues. There is a liuely example of this, of <hi>Tamer,</hi> that attired her selfe in some wanton attire, <note place="margin">Gen. 38.</note> whereby she drew <hi>Iuda</hi> to sinne, whereby it appeares, that wanton habit is a load-stone to drawe men to lust.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7913:25"/>
                  <hi>Geradas of Lacedemonia</hi> being demanded of his hoast, what paine adulterers suffered at <hi>Sparta:</hi> made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. <hi>O hospes, nemo apud nos fit adulter, neque fieripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. O hoast, there is none adulterer among vs: neither can there be any; for we neuer come at any Comedies, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Playes: nor in company with any wanton attired persons.</hi> Hereby shewing, that this wanton gefture is a kinde of adultery. <hi>Sophocles</hi> beholding the beautie and behauiour of one, was rebuked of <hi>Pericles</hi> for it, in this manner. <hi>Praetoris est non solum manus a pecuniae lucro, sed etiam occulos a libidino so aspectu continentes habere. Not onely the bandes of him that is a Pretor, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from lucre of money: but also the eyes to bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent from wanton lookes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this kinde of adultery, is common with vs of this land; Such painting the face, laying out the breasts, frisling abroade the haire, and casting aside the eye: All which wanton trickes, are no lesse then the sinne of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. <hi>De adulterio vultiu, meditantur adulterium castita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. By the adulterating of the countenance, they meditate the adulterating of chastitie,</hi> saith <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, adultery is committed by wanton wordes, luxurious songs, vnchast speeches, and filthy ribaldrie: <note place="margin">Adultery in words.</note> whereby the hearers are infected, and their owne lust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed. All which are condemned by the Apostle, and from which he much dehorteth. <hi>Let no corrupt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication proceeds out of your mouthes.</hi> And in the 3. <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 4. he saith the like. <hi>Neither filthinesse, nor foolish talking, nor lesting: which are things not comely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last branch of this adultery, is carnall copulation, the highest steppe of this sinne.</p>
               <p>There is yet another field sowne with the seede of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: Brokers that liue by extortion, lending money vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Brokers a bad fallow ground.</note> pawnes; whose customes are monstrous, and such, as to finde among men improbable, and I thinke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians impossible. Onely I suppose, among deuils incarnate, the like is to bee found. I haue heard
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7913:25"/>
them called the deuils nearest kinsemen, and so, as verely I beleeue it. The vermine of the earth, the corruption of nature, and bred like monsters. It is not long time since this viperous generation sprung vp: I hope autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will take an order to cut them downe before it be long. If I shou'd report vnto you their common vsurie, you would hardly beleeue me; And yet, if I should not tell you I should offend. What I speake is not by relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by mine owne experience.</p>
               <p>Their accustomed manner in their trading is, after a good pawne deliuered, to take for interest, eight pence a moneth for a pound: their bill of sale which is foure perce to them, must bee renued euery moneth: so that the vse of twentie shillings, comes to thirteene shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by the yeere: So after this reckoning, an hundred pound, comes to threescore and fine pound in the yeere. This is monstrous extortion: besides this, the Register hath a fee which the borrower payes: and commonly they lend but halse the worth, and gaine the rest to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the forseit of the pawne. Are not these then the vipers of the world, goawing off the flesh from the poore mans boanes, robbe their estates, grinde their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and sucke their bloods? No matuell if there bee so many poore in this land, when Salirbury-plaine is come so neere.</p>
               <p>I will not accuse them, though I shroudly misdoubt them, that they are little better then theeues. For what difference is betweene them that breake the house, and those that receiue the goods? the one sort robbes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, and the other robbes publikely; or, as I may say, the one by craft, and the other by violence and force. God concluded, that the image-maker, and the image-worshipper, were both as one: and I thinke there is no more difference betweene a thiefe, and a Broker, then (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith) is betweene a lyer, and a flatterer; both speake an vntrueth. To vse the Logitians rule: Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is the cause of a cause, is also the cause of the thing caused.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:7913:26"/>
The Broker makes sale of clothes, and the thiese seeing such good sale of clothes, makes the more hast to steale, as the prouerbe is: If there were none to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, there would be none to steale. What makes the thiese to steale so sast? Because hee can presently put them off to the Broker, and the Broker can as quickly metamorphise them into some other fashion. And now tell me whether the broker be not a thiese? Yes sure, though not equally palpable, yet equally culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble theeues. Hence came that saying: A crafty knaue needes no Broker: as if a Broker were worse then a knaue. Then iudge you what hee is.</p>
               <p>Some of them are gone to Tyborne; a fruit of their calling: And I wish the rest to giue ouer, or amend, lest they follow after.</p>
               <p>There is yet another tough piece of fallow ground, and much adoe there will beeto plow it vp, because it <note place="margin">Walking in the Exchange a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ground.</note> brings such profit as it doth, being as it is. This fielde is sowen with no lesse then beaten Satten, whether mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants or no, I cannot tell, but I am sure they are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-walkers, that walke there for a bootie, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their soules for a little of Mammons inheritance; that a man may almost with as much case, goe thorow Westminster-hall gate in the Terme time, as thorow the Exchange, betweene the houres of eleuen and twelue, on the Sabbaoth day. <hi>Is this a time to receiue vineyards, fields, money, and garments.</hi> Is this a time to talke of <note place="margin">2.

                  </gap>, to hearken after newes, exchange commodities, and conferre of worldly matters? Surely if it be death to steale from man, it is damnable to reb God: for the thest is so much the greater, by how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Let <hi>Dauid</hi> be brought foorth for the condemnation of these, which concludeth, that it is a greater sinne to robbe a poore man then a rich. Where <hi>Dauid</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that hee that had stollen the poore mans sheppe <note place="margin">

should die, you may apply it thus. Man is rich, God is poore: for man hath six dayes allowed him, God but one; what a shame is it then to steale that one day from God? and to appropriate the same to our owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. O great ingratitude that cannot be content to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that vnto God, which cost thee nothing; what wouldest thou doe, if it should cost the somewhat? ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sixe dayes, canst thou not finde in thy heart to let God haue that one day, that hee hath reserued to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. What wouldest thou doe? if God had taken sixe to himselfe, and giuen thee but one: yet euen then it had beene a sinne, to haue taken any part of those daies from him: hen much more now.</p>
               <p>Sinne is tollerable in none, and lesse tollerable in some. The poore hath no law to prophane the Saboath, much lesse the rich: These are rich, if not too rich; and what neede haue veluet coates to steale the Saboath, or any part thereof from God? These are silken theeues, and rather then they will abate any thing, the Saboath shall goe to wracke, God shall be dishonoured, and his word despised.</p>
               <p>If I should tell you that there were man slaughter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Saboath day in the Exchange, you would abhorre it: but I say vnto you there is worse, for the Saboath day is broken, a greater sinne then murther.</p>
               <p>But these will appologise for themselues, that it is after they haue beene at the Church: well, grant it be so: yet tell me whether that be not a breach of the law to wound a man, though he kill him not: or to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen by craft, though he robbe not by force: or to lust, though the adultery be not committed. So then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, though we prophane not the whole day: yet if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part thereof be prophaned, it is a breach of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. And that it may appeare so: turne your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to that of <hi>Esay.</hi> Wherein the Lord teacheth vs <note place="margin">Esau 58. 13.</note> two things, 1. negatiuely, a. affirmatiuely.

You will say that these are strangers that haue their inambulation in the Exchange. Well it is so, and what of that? shall they haue a tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereby to prophane the Saboath? Remember that God made one lawe for the Iewe and the stranger: and by my consent, if they will not be obedient to our <note place="margin">Leuit. 24. 22.</note> law, they should haue no benefit by it: but I must leaue them to authoritie.</p>

Because we are conformalists; so that one herbe of this kinde, shall spoyle the whole pot of pottage. Our conformitie to established orders, shall dull the edge of our endeuours. I know that you will cut and slash me in your censures, as meate to the cauldron: yet, <hi>Dicatur veritas rumpatur inuidia: Let trueth be spoken, and enuie burst her gall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We had neede to doe by, and with you, as the little children did with <hi>Minerua,</hi> the goddesse (so esteemed by them) that ruled the memorie, the storehouse of discipline, and of wisedome: which children, at this <hi>Mineruaes</hi> feast, vsed to carrie new yeeres gifts to their masters: making play dayes of the same, to the seruice of the Goddesse; whereof came this verse of <hi>Ouid,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Pallida nunc pueri tenerique or note puella,</l>
                     <l>qui bene placarit, Pallida doctus erit.</l>
                     <l>Now <hi>Pallas</hi> Temple, youth and damsels fill:</l>
                     <l>He that can please her, shall haue mit at will.</l>
                  </q>
Desire we your good commendations e yea; we would: but then wee must shew our selues refractary to establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed orders: wrangle about formes and shadowes, and shoote squibbes in the ayreat those that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: then we shall please you, and our doctrine shal be embraced: Otherwise we cannot purchase your fauour; for your Motto is, Wee loue such preaching. But let vs see if there bee any iust cause of your calumniations? which if there be, it will appeare, either in doctrine, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, or manners.</p>
               <p>First, that it may appeare that there is none in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, obserue these three points following: First, that <note place="margin">Our doctrine pure.</note> it must be from God: that is, The doctrine vpon which we build our saluation, must be such as God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seribed vnto his Church: For, <hi>Cursed are they that adde
<pb facs="tcp:7913:28"/>
thereunto,</hi> as is manifest by our Lord: <hi>In vaine they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>worship mè, teaching for doctrine the precepts of mens yea, if an Angel should preach any other doctrine then that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>which God hath deliuered, let him bee accursed.</hi> No do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine goes currant in the ballance of the Sanctuary, but such as comes fró the bosome of the Father. Then iudge, if the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth erre, or no, fró this point, namely, retaining that doctrine, and only that doctrine which God hath prescribed. We doe not like the Papists, teach you to build your faith vpon vnwritten verities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it must be from God, so it must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: that is, the whole will of God must be vsed in the Church: <hi>For the whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to conuince, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>in righteousnesse. That the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to euery good worke.</hi> For, not one syllable of Gods word must be kept backe. And in this, the Church of <hi>England</hi> cleareth her selfe, as in the former, not kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping backe any part of Gods word from the Church, but freely teaching, and giuing liberty vnto prosessors; wholly to enioy it. Indeed if we should with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> locke vp the word in an vnknowen tongue, or steale part out from it, as they doe the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, we were then iustly to bee accused.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and lastly, it must bee rightly ordered, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> obserues: For wherein doeth our Church offend in this? For we teach Gods loue, the primary cause of our saluation, Christ his obedience and suffering to be the materiall cause, and faith the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental cause. Againe, we teach first Election, then Calling, then Iustification, then Glorification.</p>
               <p>Therefore if there be the same which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and all that God commanded, and also ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will; then the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not to be condemned, nor refused, for any thing in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereof.</p>
               <p>Seeing you haue no iust cause to complaine in regard
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7913:29"/>
of doctrine: let vs see if there bee any in the discipline, and gouernment thereof. To that end, that wee may perceiue this point the clearer, we will obserue the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in three branches; first, diuine, secondly, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thirdly, indifferent.</p>
               <p>First, diuine gouernment of discipline, is such an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Diuine Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> as is set downe by God in his word, as Prayer, the Sacraments, the excommunicating of wicked persons, gathering of almes for the poore, and Ministers, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the gouernement of the Congregation &amp;c. All which are practised in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> yet they obiect, that the Sacraments are not obserued as <hi>Christ</hi> instituted them: For there is added the surplesse, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the crosse, and the like. But to these I answere thus: First, the time when <hi>Christ</hi> commaunded, or ordeined these in the Church, the Church was not then establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and confined to any place; and therefore orders could not be ordained, before the Church was establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Secondly, they may be answered thus; <hi>Christ</hi> did not say, as oft as yee obserue these orders, <hi>yee shew the Lords death,</hi> but, <hi>as oft as ye eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup;</hi> setting downe the subiect, and leauing the ordering of it vnto the Church, touching outward ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Thirdly, it may bee answered thus: The Church hath not appointed these ceremonies, as any parts of the Sacraments: For then they could not bee Sacraments, but when they should bee so deliuered and so receiued. But now to shew that these outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are no parts of the Sacraments: They are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, sometimes with them, and sometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, at the discretion of the Ministers. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this obserue, that when any are of this opinion, that these are not lawfull Sacraments without the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that then these are denied the ceremonies, though they hauc the Sacrament, to the end they may know these ceremonies to be no part of diuine discipline; for if they were, they could not, nor might be omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:7913:29"/>
In the next place, behold that discipline which wee call necessary; that is, the vse of such things as God hath <note place="margin">Necessary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note> not commanded, and yet they are needfull, and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by consequence from the word of God: As for example; wee haue no commandement for the manner or for me of consecrating the Sacraments; yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, that they should bee consecrated. Moreouer, what commandement haue wee for a forme of prayer? yet it is necessary, otherwise there would be a confusion in the Church. Againe, what commandement haue we for the buriall of the dead? yet it is necessary, that there should be some forme vsed, that there may be some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betweene the buriall of <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>dogges.</hi> Of this nature are, <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> after the first Lesson; and <hi>Benedictus</hi> after the second: And likewise <hi>Magnificat,</hi> and <hi>Nunc demittis:</hi> Also the Collects, and Churching of women, and the like: which albeit, God hath not set downe by way of precept: yet they are needfull and cannot be omitted.</p>
               <p>Lastly, behold that discipline, which wee call indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <note place="margin">Indifferent, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note> that is: the vse of such things as may be vsed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it being no vertue to vse them, nor any vice to omit them. Such are the Surplesse, the Crosse in Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, kneeling at the Communion; wearing a white cloth to be Churched, and sestiuall dayes; which things may be done, or omitted, as occasions may serue: The Church of <hi>England</hi> doeth not like the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tye the conscience to the obseruing hereof: yet because the King, and authoritie hath set these downe, I thinke it fit that they should be obserued.</p>
               <p>But all this is nothing to answere them, mine appolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie is fillipped backe with contempt, and they dispute: but not by reason, yet strong, victorious, and full of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate valour, euen as <hi>Saul</hi> reasoned with <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Euery traytor ought to be put to death,</l>
                  <l>But Dauid is a traytor. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Dauid ought to be put to death.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:7913:30"/>
Well, <hi>Dauid</hi> grants the proposition, that euery traltor deserues to dye: but denies the assumption, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am no traytor, and therefore not to bee put to death.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Saul</hi> prooues it by imagination, takes his spheare, throwes it at <hi>Dauid:</hi> an inuincible argument.</p>
               <p>Thus deale our brethren the professors with vs, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this same manner.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>All Idolaters ought to be detested:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But the Church of</hi> England <hi>is Idolatrons,</hi> Ergo</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>All the members of the Church of</hi> England,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ought to be detested.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>Well, we doe not much stand vpon the maior, but altogether, and truely denie the minor: and say for our selues, that we are no idolaters, and therefore ought not to be detested: yet they wil proue it: whet their tongues open their mouthes, and shoote sharpe headed arrowes at vs. Thus wounding deeper with their bitter words, then the high-way thiese doeth with his sword: an vnanswerable syllogisme. This is for our persons: they haue another for our ceremonies, thus.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>All the shewes of idolatry, are to be auoided.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But the ceremonies of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous.</hi> Ergo,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>All the ceremonies of the Church of England, are to be auoided.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>We answere to this as to the former, that wee stand not vpon the maior, but altogether deny the minor, that the ceremonies of our Church are no shewes of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, therefore ought not to be auoided. But they proue it, reiect them, flye out of the Church, picke out teachers for their humours, and of their owne minde, <hi>nisi quod ip si faciunt nihil recte existimant, they thinke nothing well done, but what they doe themselues:</hi> And these thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rightly taught, but such as these teachers teach.</p>
               <p>But I thinke I speake words in value, for it is a hard
<pb facs="tcp:7913:30"/>
matter to drawe these to a consormitle. Therefore let vs come to take notice of the manners of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And here a question is to be answered, whether a generall disobedience, or particular, makes a Church to be no Church? And answere is; not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but a generall disobedience proued by Scripture: <hi>Vnto the Angel of the Church of Thyatyra,</hi> a Church you <note place="margin">Reuel. 2.</note> see by the testimony of God: <hi>yet thou hast them that maintains the woman lez. ibel;</hi> yet a Church. The like is <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 1. 5. 1. and 6. 6.</note> seene by the <hi>Carinthians,</hi> where their sinne is noted out, first in him that had his fathers wife: and secondly, in contention, and in going to lawe one with another: and yet a Church, as it appeates by the wordes of <hi>Paul</hi> in the beginning of his Booke. Was <hi>Thyatyra</hi> a Church; and among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> a Church? and yet had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate falues: and shall the Church of <hi>England be denied</hi> to be a Church, because there are found winked ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong? I knowe that there are many wicked ones: yet I am assured, that there are thousands that conforme themselues to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that are right <hi>Nathaniels, In whom there is no guile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with iudgement make well the types of the Church from time to time; <hi>Adams</hi> family a type, yet a <hi>Caine</hi> in it: <hi>Noyes</hi> family a type, yet a <hi>Caine</hi> in it: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> family a type, yet an <hi>Ismael</hi> in it: <hi>Dauids</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily a type, yet an <hi>Ismael</hi> in it; And when <hi>Christ</hi> was come, in his family a <hi>Iudas.</hi> Was the Church before Christ, not without some wicked persons? was Christ his family, not without a Deuill? And shall wee looke now to haue the Church free? no, the tares shall grow with the good corne, to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>But these obiect further, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> knowing these to be wicked, suffers them not with stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be in the company of the Saints. The <hi>Maior</hi> of this is false: for the 26. Cannon commands, That none offenders be made pertakers of the ordinances of God. The <hi>Miner</hi> I feare is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that some wicked persons are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7913:31"/>
admitted to the holy ordinance of God: yet impute it not vnto the lawe, but rather to the corruption of such Midisters and Church-wardens, at so suffer them: Or if such persons be presented, and yet not reformed: then impute it to the inferior officers, and not to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and institutions of the Church: And though it be so in some Congregations, iudge it not therefore to bee in all: Search, and yee shall finde to the contrary. Time will not suffer me to dwell long here: therefore let me in a word perswade you, to ioyne your selues vnto the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in regard of the danger that will follow. For while we fall to striuing about things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, the people fall to doubting, what they shall hold, what they shall beleeue: and to whom they shall leane, Thus, that which is but matter of circumstance, is called into question, while matter of substance, I feare is let goe. So busie we are about the question <hi>de modo,</hi> that the Deuill easily steales the matter of Religion out of our hearts.</p>
               <p>And doe not our aduersaries aduersaries, to see vs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the eares for the leaues, that they in the meane time may steale away the fruite from vs. and doeth not this debatelye as a stumbling blocke, to hinder others from embracing the trueth: which are restrained by the varietie of sects that are among vs. It is recorded of a Heathen man which said, I would faine be a Christian: <hi>sed rescio cui adheream, multae sunt inter vo spugnae, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guli tamen dicunt, Ego verum dico: but I knowe not whom to followe; there are so many differences; and contentions among you; and euery one of your say: I am in the right;</hi> and yet there is but one Trueth, one Father, one Faith, one Baptisme, and one body.</p>
               <p>And this proceeding, hath not bin without some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">The end of murmurers.</note> to themselues: for I know by mine owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, some that haue been first members of our Church, after that of the more purer sort, then <hi>Brownists,</hi> and lastly came to be <hi>Anabaptists.</hi> It is iust with God, seeing
<pb facs="tcp:7913:31"/>
they will disobey authority and not obey the truth, that they should be deluded by falshoods.</p>
               <p>Besides, I haue well considered, that this proceeding <note place="margin">Murmuring and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hardly in one man.</note> hath been accounted of God as a sinne, to murmure and to speake euill of those that are in authoritie. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And that ye may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that God doth not sanctifie a part, but the whole, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what the Apostle faith. <hi>Now the very God of peace sanctifie you;</hi> (not in part) <hi>but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout, spirit, soule and bodie.</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> came to cast out the deuils out of the man, of a legion, he left not one. <note place="margin">Thess. 5. 23.</note> When God by his Spirit sanctifies a man, he doth it not by parts, but wholly.

                  <hi>plowing:</hi> All which doe shew vnto vs, that the heart must bee torne vp by repentance; and contrition, as the plow teareth vp the ground. This was the end that <hi>Peter</hi> ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at in his sermon, (when he sayd) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent therefore:</hi> This hee sayd, that the consideration of <note place="margin">Act. 3. 19.</note> their former acte in the murthering of <hi>Christ,</hi> might rent their hearts, as the plow doth the earth. <hi>Poenitentia est verus dolor de offensa in Deum: Repentance is a true sorrow for our offence towards God.</hi> For it is meete that those, who rent God from their hearts by sinne, should rent sinne from their hearts, by true repentance.</p>
               <p>There is no small resemblance betweene the plowing vp of this terrene ground, and the heart: obserue, and you shall find them agreeing in these things, 1. The plow it cuts and teares the earth, one piece from another, 2. It layes open the inward parts of the earth, discouering the rootes within the ground, 3. The turning vp of the earth, causeth the weedes to dye and perish, 4. It makes the mould more tender, and more apt to receiue the seede.</p>
               <p>Now behold the like in the spirituall plowe. First, as <note place="margin">Sinne is to be discouered in the heirt.</note> the plow layes open and discouers the rootes within the ground: in like manner, doth this plowe discouer the weedes of sinne vnto vs: for there must be <hi>Agnitio pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati, ct irae Dei; The knowledge of sinne, and of the wrath of God.</hi> This knowledge is so needfull, that without it, we neuer flee from sinne: witnesse that saying of <hi>Paul: I had not knowne sinne, but by the lawe: for I had not knowen sinne, except the lawe had said, Thou shalt not lust.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> By which it appeareth, that by the iudgement of <hi>Paul,</hi> concupiscence was no sinne, and therefore hee in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,

and blessed estate, as he saith in the 9, verse: iudging himselfe to bee aliue; and therefore sarte from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his concupiscence, because he did not see it to be a sinne: <hi>But when the knowledge of sinne came by the Commaundement, then hee rent his heart with contrition, vers.</hi> 10.

                  <hi>time will giue them repentance, that they may come to the knowledge of the trueth.</hi> The like course <hi>Peter</hi> tooke with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to make their sinnes appeare vnto them, that so he might drawe them to repentance, which hee <note place="margin">Act. 3. 3. 17.</note> could not haue done without the sight of sinne: for the whole neede no. Physitian saith Christ.</p>
               <p>No man will seeke to the Physitian, before he feele his disease: no man will repent, before hee beleeues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a sinner. <hi>Nemofacit Legem, nisi qui credit Legi. No man doeth the Lawe, but hee that beleeues the Lawe,</hi> saith <hi>Ambrose.</hi> Who will grieue for his sinne, before hee sees that hee hath sinned? In this sense a man may say, as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> said (when <hi>Philip</hi> asked him, if he knew what he read) <hi>How can I without a guide:</hi> So may we <note place="margin">Act. 8. 3.</note> well say: how shall sinners repent, before they knowe their sinne?</p>
               <p>Therefore the counsell of <hi>Ieremie</hi> is to be followed: <hi>Let vs search, and try our wayes,</hi> to finde out our sinnes: <hi>for he that hideth his sinne, shall not prosper: but he that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lamen. 3. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>confesseth them, shall haue mercy.</hi> The way to get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne: is first to know them, 2. to repent for them. <note place="margin">Prou. 28. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is the first effect of the plowe to discouer our sinnes.</p>
               <p>To haue an acknowledgement of sinne: these things are requisite.</p>
               <p>First, a skill in the word of God: for there hee hath read a Lecture vnto vs, both of good, and euil: sinne, and vertue, distinguishing the one, from the other, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them both out in their seuerall collours. For that is
<pb facs="tcp:7913:34"/>
it that is able to make it man wise vnto saluation <hi>Dauid</hi> asking this question of God: <hi>Wherewith shall a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>man redresse his wayes?</hi> Answere is made. <hi>By taking heed vnto thy word;</hi> for nothing doeth make sinne manifest, what it is, but onely Gods word. <note place="margin">Psa. 119. 9:</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Deuill can, but he will not. Sinne is the lawe of his kingdome, whereby it is gouerned: and therefore this is to be obserued, that the Deuill neuer taughtman to practise any thing but sinne: as witnesseth the word of God; and therefore farre from making sinne known vnto vs. The like proofe you may haue out of History, as <hi>Augustine</hi> notes. <hi>Does Paganorum nunquam bene ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uendi, sanxisse doctrinam. Those Gods of the Pagans neuer established the doctrine of liuing well:</hi> for they neuer had care of those Cities, that gaue them diuine honour.</p>
               <p>And as the Deuill can and will not, so nature is blind and cannot: Therefore if the blinde, lead the blinde: they both fall into the ditch. There is a kinde of Sympathie, betweene sinne, and nature: onely the word of God can doe it.</p>
               <p>The second thing that is necessary for the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of sinne, is the illumination of Gods spirit, to worke true vnderstanding, and iudgement in vs. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 18.</note> prayes, <hi>that the God of our Lord Iesus Christ, that father of glory, might giue vnto vs the spirit of wisedome: that the eyes of our vnderstanding might bee onlightened, that we might knowe what the hope is of his calling, and what the riches of his glorious inheritance is in his Saints: and what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power towards vs.</hi> So that it is grace that giues vs true vnderstanding, to iudge betweene sinne, and vertue. It is not the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers voyce that serues the turne. <hi>Non verbis hominis fit, vt intelligatur verbum Dei, facit deus vt intelligatis. The words of man, cannot make man to vnderstand the word of God: but it is God that maketh them to vnderstand.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto tend the wordes of Christ. I will send the holy <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 9.</note> Ghost, and hee shall reprooue the world for sinne: no
<pb facs="tcp:7913:35"/>
man sees sinne in others, nor in himselfe that he should reproue it, but by the spirit.</p>
               <p>The third thing necessary, whereby we may come to the acknowledgement of sinne, is a diligene searching, into our selues, and an examination of our actions; as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>I haue considered my wayes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Psa. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>feete into thy testimonies:</hi> for it is not enough for vs to consider sinne in others, as <hi>Horac</hi> saith,
<q>
                     <l>Cur in amicorum vitium, tam cernis acutum?</l>
                     <l>Quamaut aquila aut sorpous Epidarlins?</l>
                     <l>Why doest thou into thy friends ill cariageprie?</l>
                     <l>With a quicke Eagles, or a serpent eye?</l>
                  </q>
No, let the eyes of our vnderstanding bee looking into our selues, as they said to <hi>Dauid; See to thine owne house, O Dauid:</hi> So I say to thine owne heart, O Christian, to finde out thy particular sinnes. Thus you see that the knowledge of sinne is needfull, and you see also how to come to the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Now hauing seene, how the spirituall and terrene <note place="margin">Rent the hear.</note> plow doe agree, in the first part; let vs come vnto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which is, how the, terreno plow, doth teare, and rent the ground: So the spirituall plow teareth vp the soule, that there is <hi>dolor propten peccatum, &amp; offensum Deum, A sorrow for sinne and for offending God:</hi> wherein the heart is, exceedingly greeued; insomuch that no man can expresse the sorrow thereof: For, <hi>awounded spirit who can beare?</hi> (saith the wiseman) <hi>and a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind</hi>

                  <hi>drieth vp the boanes:</hi> And yet this wounded spirit, and sorrowfull mind, wee must endure: For the godly heart is neuer void; <hi>Vuohospite recedoute, alius sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim subintrat: One guest being gone, another straight comes in.</hi> Thus he is vexed, that is to say, haled, and hurried by strong and violent force.</p>
               <p>Of which, <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Nihil est miserius misere, non miser ante seipsum: nothing is more miserable then a miserable soule, not to comprehend her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> miserie.</hi> O great is the sorrow of such a plowed soule: That as
<pb facs="tcp:7913:35"/>
                  <hi>Barnard</hi> saith, <hi>Si msipsum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The consideration hereof teacheth vs, that the dolor of heart is no true marke of reprobation, for then God would not exhort hereunto, as here he doth. Sorrow is the doore into ioy and happinesse: for, <hi>If sinne by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be not presently done away, by the waight it will draw a man to more sinne:</hi> Therefore the onely way, to keepe vs from sinning, is to repent of our former iniquity: for a wicked vse is hardly abolished. Repent, and thou shalt be free from it; but before thou canst haue ioy in the holy Ghost, first thou must vndergoe the smart of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

               <p>Let vs therefore be waile our sinnes, that ought to be bewailed: great sinnes require great lamentation, sweet meate must haue sower sauce: Therefore let vs bee as prone to lamentation, as we haue been prone to sinne.

               <p>Here giue me leaue, not to let this point passe in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, nor the soule in doubtfulnesse: Sorrow is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to the good and bad: therefore I will shew the difference; so then be iudges of your owne estate.</p>

               <p>The reasons to perswade vs to abandon all euill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are these.</p>

                     </gap> hurt.</note> both to God and man; and therefore obserue the Decalogue, and you shall finde, that in the first table, the Lord forbids but one sinne in the heart; <hi>Thou shalt haue no other Gods before mee:</hi> and another in words, <hi>Thou shalt not take my name in vaine:</hi> But hee forbids two in action; first, the making and bowing to false Gods And secondly, the prophaning of the Sabbath. Looke into the second Table, and you shall find the like: first, one sin of the heart. <hi>Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours oxe, &amp;c.</hi> and another of the tongue, <hi>Thou shalt not beare false witnesse, &amp;c.</hi> But there are foure of workes or actions forbidden: first, <hi>Thou shalt not disobey thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:7913:40"/>
Secondly, <hi>Thou shalt not steale.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery:</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Thou shalt doe no murder:</hi> Hereby shewing, that God is most dishonoured, and man oppressed, by outward actions: And this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by that of <hi>Amos, We will make the Ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifie the weights by deceit: wee will</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Amos 8. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>buy the poore for siluer, and the needie for shooes, and sell the refuse of the wheate.</hi> These are all outward actions. The old saying is true in this; Words be but winde, blowes be vnkind, Euill thoughts and words, are blowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the ayre: but actions leaue an impression, behindethem. Not their words, but their ingrossing of corne doth starue the poore; not their thoughts, but their hands robbes their states, suckes their bloods, and grinde their faces.</p>
               <p>Ad as actions doethe most hurt, so doe they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <note place="margin">Sin in actions remaine long.</note> longer then words: Euen as the visage of him who passeth by, is soone forgotten, but if it be pictured, the memorie of it continues long: So sinne in words is like the same, entring in at the one eare, and out at the other. But sinne in action is a picture dayly to looke vpon; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that of <hi>leroboam,</hi> that neuer ceased vntill the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">1. King. 12.</note> ended. Therefore it is good to withstand the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: knowing that the end will bring much euill; that so there may ensue a great happinesse, according to that true saying of the Poet <hi>Virgil:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Foelix quipotuitrerum, cognoscere causas.</l>

               </p>
               <p>Thus, for our conclusion of this branch, obserue, that <note place="margin">Doct.</note> such as are truely plowed by the word and Spirit of God, are dead tosinne, and sinne in them; for they that are <hi>Ghrists,</hi> haue crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts, Likewise the same Apostle saith, <hi>If Christ be</hi>

               </p>

               <p>First let them tell me, by what authoritie from the word of God, they keepe the word of saluation lockt vp in an vnknowne tongue from the people: yea they haue warrant for what they doe, and marke it well.</p>
               <p>First the word is the cause of errors and heresies, (as they say,) therefore not fit to be knowne; Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the want of it, is rather the cause of errors; as the trueth it selfe saith: (whom wee will belecue before them,) <hi>doe ye not erre? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, because ye know</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Marke 12. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>not the Scriptures.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> compareth them to a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne, to light our pathes: if the light thereof be hid, how can they profit vs? for still we are ready to stumble at euery error, and fall into euery heresie. Therefore (saith <hi>Peter,) Wee haue a most sure word, to the which yee doe well that yee take heede, as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place.</hi> But it seemes these men will bee wiser then God: but God shall make it manifest to their confusion that they are fooles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the people cannot vnderstand the word of God when it is translated: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ought not to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated at all; whereas the translation of them, is the way to vnderstand them: and vnderstanding the way to get faith, and faith, the way to heauen; But why doeth not the wise <hi>lesuite</hi> reason as well against saluation it selfe, (thus) Man is not able, though hee haue the meanes, to saue himselfe: <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not fit hee should haue the meanes at all. And now who will not laugh at such an argument? <hi>Augustines</hi> saying shall end this, <hi>Why are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aug. tract. in Iohn 21.</note> 
                  <hi>things spoken, but to be knowen? why are they pronounced, but to be heard? &amp; why are they heard but to be vnderstood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7913:49"/>
Thirdly, the <hi>Iewes</hi> a long time, and in the Iewes <hi>Christ</hi> had not the word in the vulgar tongue: <hi>ergo,</hi> not fit to put it now into the vulgar: They proue it thus. He read the law, that the people vnderstood not: But it is manifest to the contrary; for the text saith, <hi>They read, and the people vnderstood.</hi> And as for that story of <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hood,</hi> which they tel vs of, inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; brought forth of the deuils mint, that the people vnderstood not <hi>Christ</hi> when he said, <hi>Eli, eli, lamah gnazabthani;</hi> therefore the people <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> ought not to haue the scriptures translated. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is ready; first, this replie of the people might be more of flouting, then of ignorance: and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they haue no proofe. Secondly, they were <hi>Romane</hi> officers that put him to death, as appeares by the story; and they might not understand him, because it was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> but the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they vnderstood him. But say, they did not vnderstand him, what is that to proue that the Scripture should not bee turned into the vulgar? It is rather an argument to the contrary, that they should be translated, whereby they might vnderstand them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, holy things must be vsed in an holy tongue: <hi>ergo,</hi> they ought not to be translated. Now what is the holy tongue? <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine?</hi> then why did not <hi>Christ</hi> teach in one of these tongues, but in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> tongue? And why did the Lord cause the Apostle <note place="margin">Acts. 2.</note> to speake so many seuerall tongues, if they were vnholy? And why doth the holy Ghost, make mention of <note place="margin">Reuel, 7.</note> tongues, that could not be numbred? Wherefore wee may conclude, that the language is acceptable, so the persons be good.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Priest, in the time of the Law, went in, and the people stood without: <hi>ergo,</hi> the people must not haue the Scriptures translated. But this is quickly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: First, this was a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> of his entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 11.</note> the holy place, that is, into heauen: therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes not this point. Secondly, it is not prooued that the Priest spake any thing before them, which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb facs="tcp:7913:50"/>
not. But by this time you begin to smile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> these poore arguments, which are like ropes of sand, which are sooner broken then made.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now, to prooue the lawfulnesse of their <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 6, 7, 8, 2,</note> translation, which will appeare by Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Thou shalt write them vpon the postes of thy house, and vpon thy gates:</hi> And why written? for to bee read: and why read: that they may bee vnderstood. So our Lord saith, <hi>Reade the Scriptures,</hi> which they could not, if <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 34.</note> they could not haue them in the vulgar tongue. The like saith <hi>Paul</hi> that the Scriptures ought to bee handled <hi>to the vnderstanding</hi> of the people, and not <hi>in a strange tongue.</hi> And that this is no new doctrine, obserue the <note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>things spoken, but to be heard? why are they ponounced, but to bee heard? why are they heard, but to be vnderstood?</hi> Hereunto tends the saying of <hi>Ierome, Let therefore the holy Scriptures, be alwayes in thy hands, and let them bee vncissantly tossed in thy mind.</hi> Heare then you see, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ambrose ad 1.

               <p>The like warrant haue they for pickpurse Purgatory, If we well consider the places alleadged for the same, and bring them to the ballance of the Sanctuary, they will be found too light.</p>
               <p>First, they thinke that place of the Apostle to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Purgatory; where he saith, <hi>Euery mans works shall be tried by fire;</hi> which they say is the fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: and by straw, wood, and stubble is meant venial sinnes: But the true meaning of the Apostle is this, By straw and stubble, is meant false doctrine, and by gold and siluer is meant sound doctrine: And so doth <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7913:50"/>

                     </gap> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina est: The worke that shall burne, is euill doctrine, not the person, but his doctrine shall be tried by the fire. Fire</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caluine in 1. Cot. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore in this place, is the Spirit of the Lord, which by his triall, maketh proofe what doctrine is like vnto gold, and what is like vnto stubble: The neerer the doctrine of God is brought vnto this fire, the clearir it is: contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the doctrine of mans braine; shall vanish away, euen as straw is consumed with the fire:</hi> So then this is not meant of the fire of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they bring the saying of <hi>Christ</hi> to prooue <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 25.</note> a Purgatory; <hi>Agree with thine aduersary while thou art in the way with him, lest he cast thee into prison; verely thou shalt not come out till thou hast paid the vtmost farthing.</hi> Now here we must vnderstand, that by the world to come is meant a time, as <hi>Matthew</hi> makes it plaine in the words following: for that which hee meaneth by prison, is the same which he meaneth by hell. Againe, here by the world to come, is meant a time ensuing this world: So <hi>Marke</hi> hath it, <hi>He shall receiue an hundreth</hi>

                  <hi>fold more, and life euerlasting in the world to come.</hi> Now then the world to come, being a time after this life, can not then be vnderstood of any Purgatory: For they say, it indureth but in this world onely: But wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not so much as a Purgarory in this worlds time. And as <hi>Augustine</hi> obserues on this place; <hi>Consenti cum aduersario &amp;c.

                  </gap>, god or euill: If accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the body, then what should a Purgatory doe? for the body comes not there, as they themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: wherfore I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, if there be a Purgatory, wherin the soule suffers, then the reward is not after the bodie, but after the soule, and so the Apostle is found a lyar: But if after the body, then there is no Purgatory: And so the Pope is found a lyar, for so he is; for there is no middle place, <hi>Vt possit: esse nisi cum diabolo, qui non est cum Christo: But he must needs bee with the deuill, which is not with Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before wee passe from this <hi>Purgatory,</hi> let vs obserue two things which will ouerthrow all this building. The first is, the place of this <hi>Purgatory,</hi> where <note place="margin">The place of Purgatory not to be found.</note> it should bee, and that they know not: Some thinke it to be neere hell; but then the passage (say others) to heauen, will be too long: Some say it is neere heauen; but this will not passe for currant; for it is not fit that such a place should be so neere heauen: Some thinke it in the mid-way betweene both: Others thinke it to bee euery where; but in the end it will prooue to bee no where.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obserue their disagreement about the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: <note place="margin">The paines of Purgatory not knowen.</note> Some say, the soules are punished by good Angels: Others say no, It is not a worke fit for them, but rather for euill spirits: Some thinke they are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fire; and others say, by water. Now if they are ignorant of their torments, how can they finde a fitte meanes to deliuer them out? for, it is necessarie, that the Physician haue knowledge of the disease, before he can minister a fit remedie vnto the patient. Thus while they disagree about the torments, wee agree in this, that there is none.</p>
               <p>And herein I cannot forget one thing, namely, the vnmercifulnesse of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that knowing the soules to be so tormented in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> would not, out of his Holinesse deliuer them foorth sooner: But now of late
<pb facs="tcp:7913:51"/>
dayes, and though the Pope can, (as they say,) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

               <p>In the third place, let vs see what warrant they haue for their merits, and supererrogations: here they bring the saying of the Apostle, <hi>that euery man shall receiue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>according to his workes.</hi> Also they bring the saying of Christ: (where hee saith,) <hi>great is your reward: Ergo,</hi> our workes doe merit and deserue. But for answere to <note place="margin">Math. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>I might also shewe you the iudgements of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this point; which ioyne with vs in this, that we merit nothing by our workes; but to comprise many in one, and not to totall all in iust account: I say with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, sufficit ad meritum, scire quod non sufficiant meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta: it is sufficient to merit, to knowe that our merits are not sufficient.</hi> Besides, I could shewe some of their owne Doctors, which are of our opinion; as <hi>Paulus Burgenses, Thomas Aquinus, Durandas, Dionisius, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusianus, Belermin</hi> &amp; others; are constrained to confesse the truth of our doctrin: that works are not meritorious.</p>

               <p>I might trouble your eares with their vn written veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <note place="margin">Papists vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vertues.</note> which they affirme to be of as great authoritie as the Scriptures but this I answere briefly.</p>
               <p>First say, that there are many things which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> taught: It followes not therefore, that the Church should seeke for them, because we know them not when wee haue found them, and as soone we may imbrace a lie, as a trueth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, admit that we could meete with the right, yet there, is no neede of them: <hi>For these things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 20. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>that we might beleeue and in beleeuing wee might haue life eternall:</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> notes, <hi>Many things were done which are not written,</hi> (saith hee) <hi>Electa sunt autem quae scriberentur, quae saluti credentium sufficere videbantur, But so much was chosen out to be written, as was thought to be sufficient for the saluation of the faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, God hath forbidden vs to seeke after any thing, saue what is written, <hi>not to adde to the word of God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2. Reuel. 22. 18.</note> It were better for a man to mourne all the dayes of his life, then to make himselfe merrie, with the breach of the word of the Lord, that is, to play with it.</p>
               <p>Againe, what warrant haue they for to take away the second commandement of God, as not worthy to stand in the leaues of his Booke? Sure I am, they ought not so to doe; for, <hi>Thou shalt not take from the word of the Lord.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2. Reuel. 22.</note> The Law was concluded with this, and so was the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; <hi>Thou shalt not adde to the word, nor take ought from the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What warrant haue they for their Free will, whereof they boast? To the contrary saith the Apostle. <hi>It is the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of Free-will. Phil. 2. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord which worketh in you both the will and the deed.</hi> And here wee are to consider a foure-fold will which is in man: One by creation, where the will was free, both <hi>ad malum,</hi> and <hi>ad bonum:</hi> and as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum liberum arbitrium posse non peccare: The first free wil
<pb facs="tcp:7913:54"/>
was to be able not to sinne.</hi> The second is, <hi>Post lapsum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis libertas, fit reliqua ante regenerationem: What free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is remaining after the fall, before regeneration:</hi> and <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> that is a will free to sinne, but not to good, a will, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad malum: onely to euill.</hi> The third is, <hi>Libert as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis post regeneationem: the libertie of the will aftor regeneration:</hi> and this is <hi>partim ad bene &amp; partim ad male operandum: partly to doe good, and partly to doe euill:</hi> So that if we will well, it is of God; if euill, it is of our selues: And as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Suis voluntatibus, sed quas ipse operatus est: Their wills, but such as he hath wrought in them: volunt as humana libertate consequitur gratiam, sed gratia potius libertatem: The will of man doth not by the freenesse thereof obtaine grace, but by grace obtaines freedome.</hi> So then., <hi>velle in nobis est: to will is in our power: bene velle a Deo: but to will well is of God.</hi> And the fourth is, <hi>Libertas voluutatis post glorificationem: The liberty of the will after glorification:</hi> and in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, the will shall be free, <hi>tantum ad bonum, onely to good,</hi> and not <hi>ad malum, to euill.</hi> The summe is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, the will was free to good and euill; by nature free to euill, by grace free in part, and by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfect.</p>
               <p>I must not omitte their pardons, because they inrich <note place="margin">Of the Popes Patdons.</note> the Popes offer, and derogate from the death of Christ: who can forgiue sinne but God? yet the Pope will; and marke well the manner: for first hee pardons, not onely sinnes past, but also sinnes to come, so that hee both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth, <note place="margin">Iohn 8, 11.</note> and pattoniseth sinnes; whereas Christ saith to the contrary: goe and sinne no more. Secondly, hee pardons both <hi>a poena &amp; culpa, from the fult and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we deny not but that the Church may pardon the punishment, but not the fault: for that is proper onely to God. Thirdly, he pardons such as he neuer sawe: and cannot tell whether they haue repented them of their sinnes or no; whereas pardon is to be granted, to such as repent them of their sinnes. And to fill vp the measure
<pb facs="tcp:7913:54"/>
of his iniquitie. <hi>Mandanius Angelis quarenus animas omnium accedentium. Wee commaund the Angels to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all the soules of them that come to</hi> Rome <hi>this yeere out of Purgatory, into Paradise: Et concedimus cruce signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, vt ad eorum vota, duas vel tres animas, quas vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, è Purgatorio liberarent: And wee grant to all those that haue taken vpon them the holy Crosse, to deliuer two or three soules at their pleasure out of Purgatory.</hi> And surely could it bee prooued, that the Pope could forgiue sinnes, I would presently turne Papist.</p>
               <p>And here let mee acquaint your vnderstanding with the author of these pardons; who (as I finde,) was <hi>Gregory</hi> the first: for hee proclaimed, that whosoeuer would come to <hi>Rome,</hi> to visite the Temples, should haue cleane remission of sinnes. Then came <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. and made the yeere of <hi>Iubile</hi> or grace, euery hundred yeeres, with the like promises. Then after him came <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the sixt; and brought it from an hundred yeeres, to fiftie, with the same promises: <hi>Plaenariam indulgentiam, full remission of all their sinnes, apaena et culpa toties quoties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the thing obseruable is this, why so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite <note place="margin">Popes vnmer cifulnesse.</note> as this, (as they say); did sleepe so long before it was knowne? either it could not be found, or they were very vnmercifull, to keepe the people in sinne, and might haue freed them of the same. But now pardons being found, note the manner: not a iot without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for no penny, no pater-noster. And here two things must bee looked vnto: first, that wee keepe the Popes fauour: secondly, that wee haue large purses, or wee may goe without pardons. For conclusion, the true Church of God is taught, that pardons are not to bee bought with gold, and siluer: but with the blood of Christ. <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 18.</note>

               <p>Thus then you see, the Papist walke not after the word of righteousnesse, no; holy Scriptures are reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in stead thereof is come darkenesse: and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath bègot ignorance, and ignorance hath begot error, and his brethren.

But the chiefe ende why God forbids to lend to their brethren, was to shew that in the Church this diabolicall arte should not be vsed. As for idolaters, and enemies to Religion, they might lend to such on vsury, and for the rooting out of these wicked ones; but among themselues it might not be vsed. And <note place="margin">1.

               <p>I haue not yet done with this word of righteousnesse. Gods word is called righteous; first, because of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which is God. <hi>Holy men spake as they were mooued by the spirit of God: and from God that is perfect, there</hi>

                  <hi>is no euill and filthy thing.</hi> And for this ende the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets cryed: the mouth of the Lord, the mouth of the Lord: to shewe that God was the author thereof, which may bee prooued thus, 1. <hi>Est antiquitas, the antiquitie,</hi> which is before all writing, as God is before all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 2. <hi>Hormonia pulcherima, the most sweete hermonie</hi> and consent, betweene <hi>Moyses,</hi> the Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: which though they liued many yeeres differing, yet doe they all agree in one thing, 3. the true accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of those things, spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of by them, 4. the ouerthrow and downefall of those that haue opposed themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their sayings; all which doe plainly demonstrate, that God is the author of them.</p>

And I say, let Gods word be righteous, and the Papists blasphemers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vt sit mandatum a Deo; That it be commanded of God,</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>according to the Scriptures.</hi> Then is it not so much to be inquired, whether it bee good and equall, as whether God hath commaunded the same or no: for sometimes lawfull things are vnlawfull. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, sometimes vnlawfull things are lawfull: As thus, to kill and murther a mans owne child, is vnlawfull; yet if God command it, then is it lawfull: as for example in <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was commanded to kill his-sonne, which, if he had refused, had sinned: and to haue done it without command, had been a sinne likewise. Or thus, It is lawfull to pray one for another; yet when God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, then is it a sinne to pray, not in respect of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of prayer, but because it is a disobedience vnto Gods command, as appeareth by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 7. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, lawfull things done by some, are vertues;
<pb facs="tcp:7913:57"/>
which being done by others are sinne: As thus, It is lawfull for a Magistrate to put a murtherer to death, but for a priuate man it is a sinne: Therefore that is a false rule, that many examine things, by, Whether it be good or equall, and not whether God hath commanded it or no. By this rule the vsurer examines his vsury; In deed, saith hee, God hath forbidden it, yet marke what profit comes hereof: Men that can vse no calling may liue if they haue money. Besides marke what good it doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the borrower: Many are made by borrowing; and to giue ouer the same would doe much hurt. But this is a false rule, if God hath not commanded the same, it is altogether vnlawfull. By the same rule we measure our charitie, saying, If I shall giue vnto the poore, and relieue the needie, then I my felfe may want. Likewise in their callings: If I shall tell the trueth in selling, vse good wares, and true weights and measures, it is the way to be a Beggar, and the like: But this is a false rule. I denie not, but that it is good for a man to keepe his estate, and not to grow into pouertie; yet not by such a meanes, as God hath not commanded. By such a false rule, <hi>Saul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his obedience: Shall I kill the King, and the chiefe cattell? no, I may haue a great ransome for the King; and for the cattell, they will serue for sacrifice, or for breede, or the like; and therefore it is better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the King, and the best cattell aliue. But for all his wisedome, God told him that he was a foole, and had sinned in so doing; and therefore hee receiued a iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense for his desert. It is dangerous to call Gods precepts into question, touching the purity thereof: If he hath said it, or commanded it, it is righteous, and we must obey it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it must be commanded of God, so it must be well done: as it must be <hi>bonum,</hi> so it must bee <hi>bene.</hi> That you may take your worke along with you, obserue, there must be first, knowledge; secondly, faith; thirdly, readinesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="1" facs="tcp:7913:57"/>
1. There must bee knowledge: for euery action is to be knowen before it can be well done; either we shal doe more then we ought, or lesse then we should. The heathen man could say, that he that knoweth not what he seeketh, cannot tell when to finde that which he lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; as <hi>Cato</hi> obserues:
<q>
                     <l>Ignotum tibi nolito praeponere notis:</l>
                     <l>Cognita indicio constant, incognita casu.</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Doe not thou preferre any thing vnknowen, before things that are knowen: Knowen things stand in iudgement, and vnknowen in chance.</hi> As the common Prouerbe is, A blind man may catch a Hare; and as well may an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man light vpon some of the precepts of God; yet seldome seene. <hi>Pithagoras</hi> hath a pretie saying; <hi>He that knoweth not what he ought to know, is a brute beast among men; He that knoweth no more then hee hath neede of, is a man among bruit beast; and He that knoweth all that may be knowen, is a God among men.</hi> And because know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the ground of all Arts, God taught his people <note place="margin">Iosh. 1. 8.</note> first to know, and then to doe; for the way to doe well, is to know the good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It must be done with the heart: that is, in zeale, loue, reuerence, feare, and the like: <hi>Vt sit ex vera fide, That it be of true faith: not so much the things themselues,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Non tam res ipse quam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus spectantur.</note> 
                  <hi>as the affections of men are to be viewed.</hi> Witnesseth that of <hi>Marke,</hi> where the widowes two Mites were more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, then the abundance of the rich men; because they came from the heart. Good things done with an euill minde, are but <hi>splendida peccata: glorious sinnes:</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God said, <hi>O that there were an heart in this people to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>keepe my Commandements:</hi> for where there is no heart in the action, there is no faith; if no faith, it cannot bee well done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It must be done with readinesse: Wee must imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Angels, which are said to haue wings; to note out their readines in executing the will of God. God will haue his worke done, when hee commands; not when
<pb facs="tcp:7913:58"/>
wee please: <hi>While it is called to day, harden not your hearts.</hi> It was the saying of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Zaeheus; Come downe at once:</hi> Delayes must not be made in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; but as <hi>Christ</hi> said in another case vnto <hi>Iudas, That thou doest, doe it quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And lastly must bee faithfulnesse, to doe all that that God commaunds, and no more: for to doe lesse then God doeth commaund, is disobedience; and to doe more, is meere presumption and will worship. It was <hi>Dauids</hi> care and resolution, to haue respect vnto all his commaundements.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it be righteous, it must bee done to a good ende; for to doe good workes, and not to a good ende: is either vaine-glory, or meere hypocrisie; as to instance it thus. It is a good worke to giue almes, to feede the hungry, and cloath the naked; But if these be done to be commended of men, or for the obtaining of credit, rather then for the good of the common wealth, it is not commendable. So we may say, it is <hi>bonum,</hi> in respect of the acte: but not <hi>bene,</hi> in respect of the ende. Therefore to doe good workes to a good end, take these three things along with you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they be, <hi>propter gloriam Dei, for the glory of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How to doe good.</note> 
                  <hi>God:</hi> That is, that the loue and zeale to Gods glory, constraine vs hereunto: as the Apostle speaketh: <hi>doe all that ye doe to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That they bee, <hi>propter nostram salutem, for our saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That they bee done to the good and profit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>that euery thing may mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster grace vnto the hearers:</hi> for whatsoeuer is done is not right, <hi>quod non conducit ad praepositam vtilitatem, which belongs not to an intended profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you see the word of righteousnesse, that it must be the rule of all our actions; as also you see the workes of righteousnesse: and how to doe them. Now before I let you passe from this part, I would haue you to marke
<pb facs="tcp:7913:58"/>
how our aduersaries doe slander vs, (saying,) that the Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth faith without good works, and giueth libertie to sinne: being a doctrine of liscenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to all impietie: insomuch that many are kept from vs by reason of these slanders, falsely laide vpon vs. The consideration whereof at the first sight, seemes like a great mountaine: yet after deliberation, it is lesse then a moule-hill. For if they so blaspheme the holy word of God, it is no wonder they thus slander vs. Besides, it <note place="margin">Slanders of the Papists.</note> hath beene an vsuall thing with them of olde, thus to slander the people of God. They accuse <hi>Wickliffe</hi> that he should say, that <hi>Luther</hi> did hold magistrates not lawfull: that <hi>Caluin</hi> saide, that Christ dispaired on the Crosse; that <hi>Beza</hi> was turned to popery, and so died: (who was then aliue, and by his owne wryting prooued them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;) that <hi>Caluin</hi> fell into blasphemy; with many more of the like nature. But to bring this home to their doores, to pay them with their owne coyne, and to beate them with their owne weapons: for doe not they themselues teach a doctrine of liscentiousnesse? yes, vnspeakeable villaynies, both countenanced, and canonized for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies: as murthers, rapes, periuries adulteries, and the like: as the sruite of such a diabolicall Religion.</p>

And this is the estate of the godly: they pray, fast, giue almes, honour God, loue man, obserue his lawes, doe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, with the like; yet what is to be seene of all this: <hi>What profite hath a man of all his labours,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> Where is the destinction of good and bad, they seeme to bee all one yet; <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> in one field: <hi>Cam</hi> and <hi>Iapha,</hi> in one arke: <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Isaake,</hi> in one family: <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in one wombe: <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> in one company: teares and wheate growne together in one field, good and euill are not yet diser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

               <p>But as yet all our labours are like vnto the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans seede castinto the earth, which seemes to rot, and vtterly to perish.

               <p>The Church is compared to a vineyard, that is first digged, then planted, groweth, bloweth, and afterward commeth the liquor. Sometime also to a shippe that goes to the Sea, and is beaten with the waues, tossed with the windes: and then at the length comes home, full fraughted with Merchandies. Also to a building, wherein there is much hewing, squaring, and great paines taking, before it be a fit habitation. To a fielde that is plowed, sowne, harrowed, growes, ripens, and then comes the haruest. The child of God is a planter, a Merchant, a builder, and a husbandman: but the wine is not yet tasted of, the shippe is not yet returned, the house is not yet inhabited, and the seede is not yet in the barne; Therefore I say vnto you, as the Apostle said to his hearers: <hi>ye haue neede of patience,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

The husbandman cannot so much hope for an ensuing crop, as the child of God hath an assurance of his future glory: His well manured soule, with the grace of God, his sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and good seed of obedience, puts him in such an hope, and giues him such assurance of a blessed haruest, that he will not sell his future estate, for a present Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. <hi>Moyses</hi> had rather forgoe his present dignities, then loose his future hopes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is fitly compared to sowing, because as
<pb facs="tcp:7913:60"/>
one corne brings foorth many, and a little increaieth <note place="margin">Great gaine is in obedience.</note> much: so the seede of righteousnesse brings foorth an vnspeakable weight of glory: Eye hath not seene, care hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man, what God hath laid vp for those that loue him; so <note place="margin">Quod nequit numerari, adeo graeciosa, quod co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patari, adeo diutina, quod nequit termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari.</note> great is the reward, <hi>as that it cannot be numbred; so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that it cannot be valued; so lasting, as that it euer endureth.</hi>

A cup of cold water giuen to a pious vse, shall be put in the Chronicles of heauen, and rewarded with no lesle then a kingdome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly obserue, that out of one hand comes many graines, and cornes, which are dispersed into many parts of the field: So the good childe of God, must bee as plentifull in good workes, doing good vnto many. The seruant is not aboue his Lord. If Christ so sowed, wee ought to follow: For, <hi>omnis Christi actio nostra debet esse instructio. Euery action of Christ, ought to be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> who went about doing good vnto all people. Among the Iewes none might be a Rabbin, till he could speake seuen languages, the tree is not accounted a good tree, till it bring forth much fruit; and who can bee a good Christian, till hee bee found fruitfull in good workes.</p>
               <p>A Christian must be like the tree, that <hi>Clusius</hi> reports of; calling it the Indian figgetree: and <hi>Gorobius</hi> calleth <note place="margin">A strange tree.</note> it the tree of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression. Let it be what it is, it groweth vp with one faire body, the branches spreading themselues very large, reaching downe vnto the earth, taking hold thereof, and springeth vp againe into little trees: that often it comes to passe, that the ground is couered, and ouerspread for the space of a mile, with
<pb facs="tcp:7913:61"/>
the ouer spreading branches. The Christian is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scripture to a figge tree: It seemes that this is the cause of it, to teach the childe of God, to be as farre <note place="margin">Christians are to doe good to many.</note> spreading with his workes. We reade, that when Christ fed the people, he fed them by multitudes; to teach vs to doe good vnto many: <hi>While wee haue time</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>let vs doe good vnto all.</hi> When the ayre hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen influence, the cloudes sent downe the seasonable deawes of grace, and the sunne of righteousnes bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his kindly heat, then a Christian becomes fruitfull. Man is compared to the earth, that brings forth herbes of all colours and fashions, and of seueral smelles. These herbes are as dumbe masters to teach vs our duety, to be plentifull in good workes, of all sorts; as <hi>Peter</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1, 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioyne vertue with faith; and with vertue; knowledge; with knowledge, temperance; with temperance, patience; with patience, godlinesse; with godlinesse, brotherly kindnes; and with brotherly kindnesse, loue:</hi> See what a golden chaine of vertues are here linked together. That which was prophesied of vs, must bee made true in vs; Our roabes (namely our workes) must bee wrought with diuers collours. It must not bee with vs as it was with the <hi>Athenians.</hi> For the more good they did know, the lesse they did: But, <hi>Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter: Thy knowledge is nothing, vnlesse another man know that thou hast knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is fitly compared vnto sowing, because the best seede is to bee put into the ground: to teach man <note place="margin">We must doe the best good.</note> what seede of obedience to sowe, (namely, the best) And to shew the same, God commanded in the Law, they should offer the best of all their cattell, and without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish. It is not the sowing, but the good sowing, that brings this haruest of happinesse: For, the husbandman knowes, if he should cast bad seede into the earth, that either it would not spring vp; or being sprung vp, it would come to bee lanke, and emptie corne. So if wee sowe seede which is not good, it will die, and perish;
<pb facs="tcp:7913:61"/>
or if it doesping vp, to giue vs any comfort, it is vnita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and vanishing. Therefore our seede must be such, as that it will endure the earth, vndergoe the stormes and boisterous weather. When the merchant sets his shippe to the sea, hee lookes that it be sound within and without, and able to endure the weather; or else shee is neuer like to returne home againe; but with losse. Would a Christian send forth his seede of obedience: let it bee good, that it may endure all weathers; otherwise it will hardly returne againe: and if it doe, it will bee with a broken conscience, and a weather beaten spirit.</p>
               <p>God commanded the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> to be made of the best stones, wood, gold, and other things; and the best spices for ointments; principally to teach the people, that their obedience must be of the best sort. Answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereunto, was that of <hi>Marie,</hi> who brought oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that very costly, to anoint <hi>Christ:</hi> Shee knew she ought to obserue the custome of the Law, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the best: as strictly should wee obserue, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this duety, in sowing the best obedience: For, it will be more glorious vnto God, and with greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit returne againe vnto our selues.</p>
               <p>Here I cannot but condole, and wish mine eyes to weepe day and night, for the seede of our dissembling <note place="margin">Dissembling Protestants.</note> Protestants; who like the <hi>Grecians,</hi> speake much, and do little: They beleeue as <hi>Christians,</hi> but liue as <hi>Pagans;</hi> ciuile in speach, rude in their manners: The name of God is in their tongues, but the feare of God is not in their hearts. The Papists call vs <hi>Solifideans,</hi> but our workes doe declare vs rather <hi>Nolifideans;</hi> for the more we knowe, the lesse good we doe: we frie in words, and freeze in deedes; speake by elles, and worke by inches; changing workes into wordes; and godly deuotion into bare knowledge.</p>

               <p>Barrennesse was euer accounted a curse, a shame, and areproch. The first borne of idlesle is to doe nothing, The second, is to doe some thing to no purpose. And the third is to doe that which is pernitious and hurtfull. <note place="margin">The sowing of wicked men.</note> Some will take no paines in sowing; vnlesse the deuill set them a worke, and too many haue wee of these sowers in this land: So that I thinke, there was neuer more filthinesse in <hi>Sodome,</hi> drunkennesse in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Creete,</hi> and hypocrisie in <hi>Iurie,</hi> then is now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in <hi>England:</hi> The custome of iniquity, hath so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed away the shame of sinne, that common wickednesse, is taken for no priuate offence.

Men are more ready to keepe their money then their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and their soules are of lesse credit, then their seales.</p>
               <p>Is this the sowing of our Christians, the practise of our profession, the seale of our faith, and the fruite of our Religion? O remember the tree that had no fruite on it was accursed: how much more when there is euill fruite thereon; as drunkennesse, adultery, swearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, stealing, killing, brybing, &amp;c.

               <p>Idlenesse in humaine affaires is accounted a sinne, but in Religion a double sinne, and many are infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which rather then they will take a little paines to walke in the pathes of righteousnes, that leades to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they will tumble in the greene pleasures of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which leade to hell. The common harlot the world, with her painted amorous face, hath so bewitched the fooles of this age, that they are sicke of loue, and euery one is ready to doe her the best seruice they can. Some are so infected with the silken dropsie, that they cannot tread in the pathes of saluation without a Coatch, and then they goe but like vnto a snaile, least they should

The drunkard sits at ease on his seate, and no sooner calls for one pot, but hee shall haue two; Therefore hee cares not to come into this patly, least their should be no tap-houses in the way: for he cannot goe farre without a draught, and the iourney being long, he faints to thinke of it. My lady lust will not come in this path, because she cannot meete with her companions, and to leaue her whorish trade, and take paines for her liuing in an honest course, shee will not: for she gets her maintenance with more ease, and often, the poxe with all, as an ouerplusse: So she resolues not to goe the way to heauen, and rather then she will take the paines for it, shee will goe without it. The fashion mungers, with their top and top-gallants, thinke this way to be both too narrow, and the seeling too lowe: it will spoile the fashion of their ruffes, vnfrizle their haire, and staine their beautie: yet if they might haue a coach of ease drawne with two horses: pride and pleasure, they are halfe minded to God, but deny them this, and you shall loose their company: the path hard, the iourney long, and the paines great; a worke too hard for these daintie dames: their fingers too tender to handle this seede, and their roundabouts too broade, to enter in at that doore.

               <p>Religion was wont to be a pleasure, now it is recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a labour: it is too hot in summer, they dare not come to the Church then, least it make their heads to ake: in winter too cold, then they refuse to come, because they must not bring a fire with them; so that Religion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in season with these, and they can finde no time to sowe this seede.

Cor. 1. 25.</note> is a super our, the inferiour is to obey the same, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> nots, <hi>cum enim se volunt as relicto superiore ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriora conuertit, officitur mala: For when the will turnes it selfe from the superiour to the inferiour, it is euil:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the words of exhortation be imbraced, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der downe your greatnesse at the footestoole of Gods Maiestie, the originall of all greatnesse; and this shall <note place="margin">Fraerogatiuam genetis simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo morum magis sibi ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, quam or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do maiorum.</note> make you greater.

Therefore maintaine the Gospel by your greatnesse, and he shall maintaine your honours by his power.</p>
               <p>Againe, the inferiour sort are not without their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: The superiour hath not drunke the water of <hi>Nilus</hi> alone, these must needes haue a lappe: For though they breake not their heads against the vpper sieling of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet they stumble at the threshold of basenesse. Either they thinke it a duetie not imposed on them, or that it will not be accepted. But, to take away these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections <note place="margin">Mal. 1.</note> the Lord commanded (when the Tabernacle was to be built) the people to bring from gold, to goats <note place="margin">Exo. 25.</note> haire, to shew that the chiefest obedience must be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that the poorest is not reiected. God regards not man for his greatnesse, nor reiects any for his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Greatnesse raiseth not to heauen, not pouertie casteth downe to hell.</p>
               <p>Inferiority must not hinder vs from Gods seruice and obedience, but rather a spurre to pricke vs forward: <hi>seeing godlinesse hath the promise of this life, and that to come.</hi> Therefore let vs doe as <hi>loel</hi> saith, to walke in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: <note place="margin">Iocl 2. 14.</note> for who knowes <hi>whether God will leaue a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

               </p>
               <p>And there are two reasons hereof. The first, <hi>Proptcr veritatem Dei, for the trueth of God,</hi> which is most sure and firme, and stands like mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that cannot bee remooued: which proceedeth from the eternitie, and immutabilitie of his will: with whom there is no change, <note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> nor shadowe of changing; He that commanded trueth in others, will surely keepe it himselfe, or else hee should not bee omnipotent but impotent. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth thus stile him: <hi>God that cannot lye.</hi> And as the <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2.</note> author to the he brewes saith, <hi>non enim in iustus est Deus, for God is not vnrighteousnesse, that he should forget your</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>worke in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The second reason is, <hi>propter iustitiam Dei: for the righteousnesse of God:</hi> for to punish those that sinne, and not to reward the righteous, might seeme vnrighteous; But verily there is a reward for the righteous: for as those that doe euill <hi>shall haue tribulation and anguish, &amp;c.</hi> So they that doe well, <hi>shall haue peace, glory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 10.</note> Otherwise hee should seeme to be more iust to the wicked, then mercifull to the righteous. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they which serue the Lord in the day time of their life, shall bee rewarded in the euen-tide of their deathes.</p>
               <p>We which are the sweete singers of <hi>Israel,</hi> (and haue <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> sung out the songs of saluation,) shall reape a haruest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our place and worke: for if we conuert ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>we shall shine as the Starres;</hi> Glorious shall their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> be in heauen, whose titles are so great on earth, as <hi>luminae stellae angellae,</hi> and the like. Surely there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble document in the same: namely, that the greatnesse of the titles doe put vs in minde of the worke: therefore not to suffer our hearts to be adulterated with popular applause, but to hunt soules into heauen: and not our selues into fame. And as it puts vs in mind of the worke, so of the greatnes of the reward, which will be glorious.</p>

Marke well the comparisons, that we are compared vnto: to the Sunne, Starres, Salt, and Angels; Obserue it well, though these are the glory of the world: yet haue they beene shaken. The Angels fell, the Starres shorte, <note place="margin">Ministers to teach good doctrine, and keepe good hospitality.</note> the Salt corrupted, and the light obscured. A good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat for vs to be the more vigilant, that our reward may be the greater. <hi>Peter</hi> was three times willed to feede the flocke; that is as <hi>Barnard</hi> obserues, with sound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, honest life, and good hospitalitie; It is both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondable, and commodious for Ministers to preach in the plurall number with good doctrine, and charitable hospitalitie: wordes without deedes auaile little. It is recorded of <hi>Alexander Seuerus,</hi> which said, that he was more mooued to beleeue in Christ by the Christians ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality, then by all <hi>Origines</hi> learned and eloquent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions.

It may be sayde of Magistrates, as it was saide of Christ: they are set for the rysing and falling of many in the land; you are the high <hi>Ceders</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> whose fall is the hurt of many. The Church is compared to a building: we are the builders, you are the side stones, and the inferiour people the filling stones. So long as you stand the people are safe, but if you giue way, they fall out by whole heapes. Twise happy (therefore) shall you be if you stand faithfull to the Lord: and looke how much you are aboue others in the kingdome of grace, by so much shall you shine more then others in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. Thus shall you reape a double blessing with <hi>Iacob:</hi> twise blessed in this world, and double crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the world to come.</p>
               <p>And you my brethren of the lower sort, shall reape a haruest according to your seede; for God will make an

Blessed then shall you be in your persons, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in your actions, blessed in your estate, and blessed in your posterity. And (as Christ saide in another kinde,) all these are but the beginnings: the full croppe is yet to come: Eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, what those things are, which God hath layde vppe for those that sowe this seede. And thus much briefly for the haruest in generall.</p>
               <p>I come now to the more particular parts of this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, which are; first, the property of the worke, <hi>Reape:</hi> Secondly, the manner of it, <hi>According to mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, the propertie of the worke is to reape: Haruest is called <hi>Autumnus,</hi> &amp; hath that name of <hi>Augende, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Haruest of grace of race.</note> For then commeth in store of fruit, that the earth bringeth forth, which fruit is gathered, when the Sunne entreth into <hi>Libra;</hi> which is, when the Sunne is in the right line, that is called, <hi>Linea Equinoctialis:</hi> And so from that time it comes into <hi>Libra,</hi> till it come into the signe that is called <hi>Sagittarius</hi> Now it is no small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the husbandman (after he hath taken great pains, and been at great cost) to see the haruest approach, and the regions to growe white. It is no lesse (but much more) ioy to the child of God (which hath sowed the seede of obedience, all his lifetime) to haue the haruest of promise brought home to the doore of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ready to enter the barne of his soule. But let vs consider this reaping. First, as it is in grace, and then as it will be in glory.</p>
               <p>First, we are to consider (a little) the haruest in grace: For they that reape not in grace, shall not enioy an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest in glory: <hi>Post mercatum solutum nullus negociatur:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7913:67"/>
                  <hi>After the market is ended, there is neither buying nor sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> He that prepareth not things necessary while hee is here, is like to want hereafter: Wherefore follow the counsell of Christ: <hi>Lay vp treasure for your selues in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that when these earthly Tabernacles shall faile, they may receiue you, into euerlasting habitations.</hi> And here for your better vnderstanding, how to reape in the kingdome of grace, consider it, first, Temporall, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Spirituall.</p>
               <p>First, there is an earthly haruest, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, <note place="margin">Terrene har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest. Leuit. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>the threshing shall reach vnto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach vnto the sowing time, and you shall eate your bread in plenteousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> It is no small blessing to dwell in the greene pastures, and to haue our cups to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflow <note place="margin">Psal. 23.</note> with abunance?</p>
               <p>Obserue the seed of righteousnes brings the haruest of earthly blessings. Would a man reape aboundance <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Godlinesse brings gaine. Deut. 28.</note> and ascend to pompous honour? Let him trauell this way, and it will bring him thither: For <hi>godlinesse hath the promise of this life,</hi> as well as of that to come. And this did God teach them, by setting before them a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of these things; vpon condition that they would obey him. The like he saith in another place; that, <hi>they which honour me, I will honour them:</hi> And wee see it as truely performed in <hi>Abraham, Iacob, Iob,</hi> and many more.</p>
               <p>Obedience brings vs within the couenant of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> which euer runnes vpon conditions. If ye doe, if ye beleeue, if yee obey: The condition being kept the promise is ours, as the Apostle notes. Ye haue neede of patience, that after yee haue done the will of God, yee might receiue the promise. If you aske who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord? <hi>Dauid</hi> telleth you, <hi>The man that walketh vprightly, and worketh righteousnes, and speaketh the trueth from his heart.</hi> If you aske who shall enter into glory? <hi>Christ</hi> telles you. <hi>Non auditores, sed facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: Not hearers, but doers.</hi> If you aske me the way to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7913:68"/>
get earthly blessings, I answere with Christ, <hi>Keepe the Commandements.</hi> Christ calleth Loue the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth obedience the end of all, saying, <hi>Heare the end of all, feare God, and keepe his Commandements.</hi> For this is that which makes vs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires with Christ, by everue wherof all things are ours. So saith the Apostle, <hi>All things are yours, and you Christs. Soli habent omnia qui habent habentem omnia. They alone</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>possesse all things that possesse the Possessour of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth not this minister matter of comfort, to those which haue walked in this path of righteousnesse. To <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> whom I may say as Christ did, to the good seruant, <hi>Well done you good and faithfull seruants, enter into your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ioy,</hi> and take possession of these earthly blessings. <hi>Euery one that beleeueth and doth well, confirmeth the Law by his life.</hi> And you knowe (and hardly to bee <note place="margin">Omnis qui credets Chti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto, bene agit, &amp; viuendo le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem confirmat.</note> knowne) what the reward of that is, which no demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in art, no effection in nature, no proportion in the creature, can expresse. Such is the loue of God to them, and their right vnto all things. Therfore, as the Epicures said to themselues, so may I say to these, <hi>Ede, bibe, lude, Eate, drinke, and be merry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now some obiect against the trueth of this point, saying, If, after obedience, we haue right to reape this haruest, why are the children of God in such contempt and pouerty, and the off scouring of all things to this day, as we see? <hi>Eliiah</hi> was persecured, and the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets fauoured: <hi>Michaiah</hi> sinitten, and the lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets honoured: <hi>Diues</hi> rich, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> poore. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto answere is made, that it is no safe concluding; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they possesse them not, they haue no right vnto them: For by the same argument wee may conclude, they haue no right to the kingdome of glory. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is thus framed:

                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> of both these syllogismes is false: For pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of a thing doth not argue aright thereunto; no more doth not possession argue no right. But as a man which hath bought land, payd his money, writings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, deliuered vnto him, hath right to the land, though he possesse it not. So the godly haue right to them though they possesse them not.</p>
               <p>Besides this, it may be the time is not yet come, when God will giue vs these things. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was in prison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to honour. <hi>Iacob</hi> serued many yeeres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had his riches. <hi>Dauid</hi> was persecuted, before he came to the kingdome. <hi>Daniel</hi> in the denne, before he was one of the gouernours. <hi>Mordecai</hi> sate at the gate, before he came to preferment, And all these, in the state of grace, long before they came to taste of this haruest.</p>
               <p>Againe there may bee some cause knowen to God, why he doth not giue these things generally to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Why <hi>Abraham</hi> was rich, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> poore, <hi>Dauid</hi> a king, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> at the gate. Surely there is great difference in the natural qualities of men, and such an antipathie there is betweene the same and riches, that often they steale away our hearts from obedience: and therefore God, as a wise father, giues not what is our right, but what is good for vs.</p>
               <p>I must not forget the wicked; which neuer sowed the <note place="margin">2. <hi>Vse.</hi> The wicked reape that the haue no right to.</note> seed of righteousnesse: yet reape they this earthly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest as fast as the godly: and with carying this crop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their barnes, the deuill is often conuayed into their
<pb facs="tcp:7913:69"/>
hearts. There is no more difference betweene <hi>Iudas</hi> and them, then this: <hi>Iudas</hi> had the bag; and the deuill in it: These haue riches and the deuill with them: For <hi>vnto the impure, all things are impure:</hi> Their meate, apparell, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and honour, are cursed vnto them. For hee that sayd, <hi>What hast thou to doe to take my name in thy month, and hatest to be reformed?</hi> saith also, What hast thou to <note place="margin">Psal. 13.</note> doe, to take this crop into thy possession? And yet who prospers so as these? who so beautifull as <hi>Absalom?</hi> so rich as <hi>Nabal?</hi> so honourable as <hi>Haman?</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish so well as the sonnes of <hi>Belial?</hi> And yet with Iudas they do but bag vp to their owne confusion. <hi>He that is much honoured in the way, at the end of his iourney is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Qui honoratur in via, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentione dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabitur, &amp; quasi per amaena prata in carcere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> venit: qui per prospetitarem praesentis vitae ad interitum tendit.</note>

               <p>Therefore seeing they haue got the houses of God in possession, and the inheritance of the holy ones into their handes: let them bee as sparing as may bee to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and very liberall to others: that seeing they must bee arraigned for theeues, and goe to their owne place with <hi>Iudas</hi> their iudgements may bee more easie.</p>

Will you now know the reason thereof hearken then to the trueth of God, which telleth vs that wee are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by saith, now the nature of faith is, to assure our hearts of the certainty of his promises.</p>
               <p>First in regard of the nature of faith, which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly historicall, to beleeue the story of the Gospel to bee <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> true, but for to assure a man of that which he beleeues to be true, that they are his. And this will appeare to be so, by the Etymologie of this Theologicall faith, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either in the Hebrew, Greeke, or Latine; in the Hebrew it is called <hi>amunah,</hi> which commeth of <hi>aman,</hi> which is firme and sure. And therefore the Apostle <note place="margin">Nature of faith.</note> doth vse this word to confirme the promises of God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All the promises of God are in him</hi>

Also this word <hi>Amen,</hi> signifies a nourcery where trees are planted. Faith is the nourcery where the trees of Gods promises grow: And so to goe from <hi>aman</hi> to <hi>omen</hi> and then to <hi>omeneth</hi> which is in the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine gender: so that faith is both the nource and the nourcery.</p>
               <p>And as the Etymologie of faith in the Hebrew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the trueth of this doctrine: so wee shall see the same in the Greeke. For faith in the Greeke is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>And here let vs see the Scriptures, they confirme this their deuillish doctrine by: and the first is this, <hi>Who can say my heart is cleane:</hi> not that there is none cleane, <note place="margin">Pse. 20. 9.</note> but no man knowes when his heart is cleane: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man can be assured of saluation. But to this it may bee answered, 1. the wise man speaketh against such, as thought themselues to bee meritorious and free from sinne, 2. Bee it granted that no man hath a cleane heart free from it: yet he doeth not inferre hereupon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot be assured of saluation, 3. If none but such as are pure from sinne, can bee assured of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then their Priests are not assured, as they say.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>no man knoweth whether hee bee worthy loue or hatred:</hi> therefore a man cannot be assured of saluation. <note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 1.</note> But this place speakes not of any inward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of glory, but of outward estate, &amp; by the outward estate of man: it is not to be knowne, who is loued or hated of God: because the assurance of saluation, is not in outward worldly prosperitie, but in the inward grace
<pb facs="tcp:7913:71"/>
of the spirit: so this place is nothing to prooue, no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of saluation.</p>
               <p>Againe they bring the saying of the Apostle, <hi>worke out your saluation, with feare and trembling. Ergo,</hi> where <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> there is feare, there can be no assurance, but doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; But marke what feare this is, 1. Feare your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall presumption by which you thinke to be in the state of grace, and are not: feare this, 2. Feare to fall into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and to be deceiued by the craftinesse of men, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lay in waite to deceiue, feare these, 3. Feare in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the reuerence to God: but no feare in doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of saluation.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if this be the best proofe that they can bring to confirme their doctrine, the foundation is weake, their arguments like ropes made of sand, and the building cannot long stand.</p>

If hee bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable which did all, what reward is due to vs then?</hi> Surely none of the blessed promises of God, but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full looking for of iudgement. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle desired not to bee found in the puritie of his owne <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> workes, (because thereby he could not be saued,) but in the righteousnesse of Christ. It is manifest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there is no saftie in our workes, because the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit teacheth vs to flee from them, as not a sure refuge to trust vnto. And to this tends that saying of <hi>Iuda,</hi> where he saith, <hi>we should looke,</hi> (not for the reward of works,) but <hi>the mercy of God:</hi> which as it did initiat vs into grace, so it must consummate vs to glory.</p>
               <p>The trueth whereof will yet more plainly appeare by <note place="margin">

               <p>For how can an euill cause produce a good effect? <note place="margin">Our works not perfect.</note> We know, that, <hi>Qualis causa, talis effectus; Such a cause, such effect.</hi> Man is not so iustified, not so sanctified, <hi>Vt non sit in nob is peccatum, That there should bee no sinne in vs,</hi> and while it is in vs, it is a stayne to our workes, as a little milke changeth the fountaine of water, and a cloud obscureth the light of the <hi>Sunne.</hi> And so what patience without murmuring? what faith without doubting? what zeale without coldnesse? what loue without hatred? what charity without couetousnesse? what knowledge without ignorance? what chastitie
<pb facs="tcp:7913:73"/>
without concupiscence? and what obedience without defect? So saith <hi>Esai, that our righteousnesse is as a stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cloth.</hi> And as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith. <hi>Multum boni facit,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 64. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>sed non perfectum bonum facit. He doth much good, but not that which is perfectly good.</hi> So that wee haue neede, to goe to God, and aske pardon rather for the sinne in the worke, then a reward for the good. Then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Saints reape this haruest, <hi>Non pro merito, not for merit, sed pro gratia, but for grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must not let passe now the doctrine of <hi>Popery,</hi> which teacheth a doctrine contrary to this, namely, that wee <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> are not simply beholding to God, but in some sort to our selues, as to workes. And they make two kindes of workes or merits, the one is <hi>Meritum de congruo, merit of congruity,</hi> which are preparatiue workes, that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iustification, Such were the works of <hi>Cornelius</hi> (as they say) which, though they be not meritorious, <hi>ex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito institiae, by due debt of iustice,</hi> yet do deserue, at Gods hands of congruity. The other they call <hi>Meritum de condigno, merits of condignity,</hi> when the reward is iustly due by debt, and such are the works of the Saints. But this distinction of workes, wee approoue not of; For these workes done before iustification, though they seeme to haue a shew of goodnesse in themselues, yet are they not pleasing to God, because the persons are not iustified; and his worke that is not iustified, is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the sight of God. Secondly they are not done in <note place="margin">Pro. 15. 6. and 21. 27: Rom. 14. 23.</note> faith; and, <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne:</hi> so that these cannot be preparatiue workes. Againe for those workes done after sanctification, we deny not but that they are pleasing and acceptable to God: yet doe they <note place="margin">Quantum ad caeterorum compatationce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pertinet, hi digni sunt, quantum ad rem ipsum omnes indigni sunt.</note> deserue nothing by vertue of their worth, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>In respect of others,</hi> (that is, other men) <hi>they are worthy, but in respect of the thing,</hi> (that is, heauen) <hi>they are all vnworthy.</hi> For, <hi>Quid Junt merita omnia, ad tantam gloriam? What are all our merits to so great glory:</hi> To conclude, neither our works before or after iustification,
<pb facs="tcp:7913:73"/>
are any cause (that is efficient) of this haruest, but the mercy of God; which as it had the initiating in grace, so it hath the consummating in glory. <hi>Non in nostris re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte factis, sed in tua bonitate situm est, It lieth not in our well done deedes, but in thy goodnesse, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Returne we home to our selues, where wee shall finde <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> great cause of thankefulnesse: while the worke is so small, and the reward so great. Do we deserue nothing, and yet inioy so much? Then learne with <hi>Dauid,</hi> to say, <hi>Non nobis Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam. Not vnto vs, Lord, but vnto thy Name giue the glory.</hi> And this is one principall end, why saluation is not of workes, but of mercy; that God might haue all the praise: for, <hi>Hee hath chosen vs in Christ, to the praise of the glory of his grace.</hi> We may all vse the saying of <hi>Bernard, When I was</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Quando igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabam, me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struxit, quando errabam me reduxit, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do steti, me tenuit, qvando cecidt, me cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit, quando ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>ignorant, he instructed mee; when I erred, hee reclaimed me; when I stood, he held me vp; when I fell, he raised me; when I came to him, he receiued me. O quid retribuam, &amp;c? O what shall I giue vnto the Lord for all his fauours?</hi> What? Euen with <hi>Dauid,</hi> take the cup of thankesgiuing, and drinke hearty draughts to the Lord.</p>
               <p>This thankesgiuing consisteth in three things. First, <hi>In cordibus nostris, in our hearts;</hi> for to loue him, as saith <hi>Moses, And now what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to loue him? 2. In operibus nostris in our works</hi> to honour and glorifie him by obedience. <hi>3. In ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis nostris, in our words,</hi> to giue praise and thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>There is another vse to bee made of this, (seeing our <note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> workes are not perfect) not to sit downe in the chaire of content: but to adde somewhat to the building (as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith) <hi>To increase in grace and knowledge.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles case must be ours: We are not yet perfect, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 18.</note> must endeuour our selues vnto that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And as the man said to Christ, <hi>Increase my faith:</hi> So Lord, increase our faith.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this vndeserued loue of God to man, should
<pb facs="tcp:7913:74"/>
be a copy to our hands, and a sputre to our feete, to teach vs to shew the like loue to our brethren, though they deserue not the same at our hands? Which duety was taught by that parable of the seruaunt, which had so much forgiuen him: ought, from the consideration thereof, to <hi>forgiue his fellow seruant.</hi> God is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> vs: Happy are we if we follow after, and yet cursed if we stay behind.</p>
               <p>And thus at the last, I haue passed from the precept, to the consequent.</p>
            </div>

                  <hi>SEeke,</hi> this comes first to our hands according to our former diuision. The perambulation of a Christian, is from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> to seeke the
<pb facs="tcp:7913:74"/>
Lord, in the streetes of contemplation and meditation: Not with <hi>Diogenes,</hi> with a candle and a lanterne, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the streetes of <hi>Athens;</hi> but with our whole hearts, with <hi>Dauid,</hi> to seeke the Lord. We must not thinke that God will follow vs with his blessings, if wee flee from him, as <hi>Ionas</hi> did: For as God seekes vs, so he puts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts a preuenting grace to seeke him. The rich man goes not with his almes to the poore mans house: rather the poore man comes to the rich mans gate. The Lord is rich enough, and needes none of our labour; yet we cannot haue his blessings without paines: for if we will finde, we must seeke. Heauen is not gotten with ease, neither is saluation brought and laid at our doores. No, <hi>the kingdome of heauen comes not by obseruation, and a contemplatiue speculation.</hi> Diligence, that industrious workemaster, must <hi>make our calling and election sure:</hi> For, <hi>Nemo volens malus, nec inuitus foelix: No man is euill with his will, neither is any happy against his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let not this obseruation slippe without your vse: we <note place="margin">Wee must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in our owne person</note> cannot haue the parts of saluation performed for vs by an Atturney: God requireth euery man to performe these things in and by himselfe; other mens faith will doe vs no good: neither is there any thing that doth more hurt then doing these things: <hi>Non perse, sed per a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium: Not by himselfe, but by another;</hi> as many great men thinke to go to heauen by their Chapleins, by whom they are religious in this life; by them also they thinke to be glorious in the life to come: And often wee see, when the Chaplein is out of doores, grace is not to bee seene in the Parler, and godlinesse may not stay within doores. Surely a man may as well see to walke by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans eyes, as to goe to heauen by another mans workes. The question shall not bee, What haue they done? but, What hast thou done? Therefore you (that intend to seeke the Lord, and weare the liuery of Christ) must lay aside all your nicenesse, and bid idlenesse (the mother of mischiefe) adue, and, <hi>put on the armour of

               <p>Obserue, that heauen is not gotten, but with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <note place="margin">Doct.</note> and paines taking; <hi>Qui cupit optatam cursu contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere metam, multa tulit, fecitque miser sudauit &amp; alsit. Hee that desireth first to touch the marke, taketh much paines, sweateth abundantly, and runneth exceeding swist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> For heauen is not promised vpon small tearmes. When Christ told his followers of the bread of heauen, hee commaunded them to worke for it; if they would <note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> haue the same; when he told them of the Pearle, he said they must seeke for the same, before they could haue it. <note place="margin">Math. 13. 45.</note> When <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of a Crowne, hee said they must runne for it, or goe without it: For no <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 24.</note> man is crowned before he striue. We reade in Scripture, <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 51.</note> that the children of God, were watching, not sleeping; working, not idleing; running, not sitting. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is a copie to our hands in this point: which first plowes, then sowes, then harrowes, then weedes, then reapes, and lastly it is fit for bread for his table: but nothing you see without labour. If this terrene har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest requireth such paine how much more the celestiall? yea, it is <hi>Ars artium, the Arte of artes,</hi> truely to seeke the Lord and requires the more diligence.</p>
               <p>First because the way and the markes are obserued by the vapours of errors, and the fogges of darkenesse, by that infernall spirit which hath opened the bottomlesse pit, so that the smoke surgeth vp: whereby the <hi>Sunne</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7913:75"/>
and <hi>Aayre</hi> of knowledge are darkened, that the way is become very difficulte and hard to finde, therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the more vigilancy. It is knowen that the lesse the obiect is to the sight of the eye, the more steadily is the sight fastened vpon the same, that it may aspect it the better, and perceiue it the clearer. The like must you doe in seeking the Lord; seeing the way is so obscure (not in it selfe, but by Sathans malice, and our corruption,) to bee the more carefull in seeking the same. For <hi>Arta est via vere quae ducit adguadia vitae. The way is straight and quickly mist, that leades vs vp to glorious blisse.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligence must seeke it, and vigilance keepe it.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly when we haue, (with the spouse,) found out the way to the Lord: then doth Sathan begin to lay stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems for vs: whereby to stay vs in our ambulation, if Gods assisting spirit and diligence should not preuent him. The deuill neuer suffers man to be at ease: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore regeneration, he sets vs to make bricke, (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the Iewes,) that is to commit sinne; so that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace, is but the deuils slaue. And when we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (that is out of sinne,) he followes with an host of persecutions till wee come at heauens gate. Therefore our life, and the time of grace, is like the state of the Iewes in building the walles of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> which wrought with one hand, and fought with another. Such <note place="margin">Neh. 4. 17.</note> is our military life while we are in this world: that while wee labour to seeke the Lord by faith and repentance, wee must fight against the deuill by prayer and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Is it not then a worke of great labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?</p>
               <p>Let there be a double vse made of this: first, to seeke the Lord more carefully: Secondly, when we haue him, to keepe him with greater vigilancy.</p>

               <p>It was strange that the <hi>Iewes</hi> should forsake the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and loue the <hi>Garlike</hi> and <hi>Onions</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But more strange it is, to see the men of this time, to forsake the word of God, and to loue the foame of mens inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. How are our Sermons now despised, if they bee not garnished ouer with historie or <hi>Philosophie?</hi> How many come hither rather for affected wordes, then to learne how to practise obedience? and to fill their eares with curiositie, rather then their hearts with grace? There is no great difference betweene the foode of the body, and the foode of the soule; for good meate must be set out with floures; good clothes with toyes; and so sound Diuinitie with history: These are seekers; but for deuils diuintie.</p>

               <p>The adulterer is a searcher, not after the Lord, but <note place="margin">The Adulterer seekes.</note> harlots, He seekes all in the darke by owle-light; lest the chaste birds of honestie should see him, and wonder at him; and at length findes a bodie going to the graue, full of sores and a soule going to hell, miserably sinfull.</p>
               <p>The Incloser is a great seeker, but to the poore mans cost, and his beasts destruction: he hedges in the poore <note place="margin">The Incloser seekes.</note> mans Common, and keepes pasture from his beast; and so he is a murderer both of man an beast.

cannot, or will not find the Lord; not so much as set a foote in the path of obedience; like those dogs running by the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> not once giuing a lap at <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well. These seeke not for grace, but graine and commodities; like the <hi>Pharises</hi> that compasse sea and land to fill their ware-houses with commodities. Surely wee neede not complaine for want of bread, were it not for these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closers.</p>
               <p>The ambitious man is a diligent seeker; hee lookes high, and seekes in the ayre; yet not for the Lord, but for the honour of promotion, like <hi>Haman,</hi> that seeke to ride on the Kings horse, and thinke the highest step of promotion too low for them.</p>
               <p>The robbe-Altar, that seekes to drinke in the goblets <note place="margin">Rob-Altar, seeker.</note> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and take away the Ministers sheafe, that should make him bread; and his fleece that should make him clothes. Some of the rob-Altars find whole Churches at once, and yet not so much as the sweepings, will they giue to the minister. But let them take heede, for the stones will goe neere to choake them one day, and the belles ring them a peale to hell; and keepe such a shaking in their consciences; that they will wish they had neuer swallowed them; and then, when it is too late, begin to evacuate themselues of the same.</p>
               <p>The Vsurer is a seeker, not other mens good, but his <note place="margin">The Vsurer seeker.</note> owne profit: Hee seekes to lend, not to enrich others, but himselfe.

               <p>What should I speake of the swearer, who seekes for newe oathes, the proude person for newe fashions, the tradesman for to deceiue, the officer for bribes, and the like: so that as the Apostle saith, <hi>all seeke their owne, but not the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Therefore the longer we haue continued in sinne, the
<pb facs="tcp:7913:80"/>
more cause haue we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">

                  <hi>thoughts remaine within thy heart, and how long wilt thou goe astray?</hi> The like argument is vsed by <hi>Peter,</hi> (for he <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 4.</note> saith,) <hi>it is sufficient that wee haue spent the former time in sinne.</hi> Thus long continuance in sinne must be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vs, to cause vs the more willingly to turne to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">First, <hi>propter gloriam Dei, for the glory of God:</hi> For by how much the more we are wicked and sinfull, by so much the more is Gods mercy seene in the pardon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As (<hi>Moses</hi> saide,) if thou pardon this sinne, then shall thy mercy appeare. And there is nothing wherein Gods mercy doeth more manifest it selfe, then in this: and the greater the sinne is, the greater is his mercy which forgiues it.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, <hi>propter nostram consolationem: for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation:</hi> for the more sinnefull, the more iudgements are prepared. What is to bee done now, to flye (with <hi>Ionas</hi>) from the Lord? that is not the way, (with the fish to leape out of the panne into the fire:) but with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall sonne, to returne to the Lord: that wee may not come into that place of torment. The Lord hath two heraulds of conuersion and obedience: namely, mercy and iudgement; promises and threates: <hi>aut sequeris, aut traheris: either drawing</hi> vs, <hi>or following</hi> vs; and vse is made of both: wherein it will not bee amisse to borrow <hi>Horace</hi> his verse
<q>
                     <l>Oderunt peccare boni, vertutis amore:</l>
                     <l>Oderunt peccare mali, formidime penae.</l>
                     <l>The good from offence, vertues loue doe detaines</l>
                     <l>The euill to offend, feare of paine doth restraine.</l>
                  </q>
These are two good schoole-masters, the one serues a free horse, the other a dull iade. Where Gods mercy will not alure, there his iudgements must compell: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greatnesse of our sinne should cause vs the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:7913:81"/>
to seeke the Lord, that so we may escape the greatnes of his iudgements.</p>
               <p>Here giue mee leaue to cut the vlcer of this sinne in <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> the wicked, which haue not drunke their fill of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and yet you may see the vlceration of these men. The saying of <hi>Dauid</hi> is reuiued againe, <hi>Fourtie yeeres long haue I been grieued,</hi> and yet still doe they continue <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 6.</note> in sinne, to heape wrath vpon wrath. Sinne is said to be darkenesse: and <hi>tenebrae,</hi> commeth of <hi>tenendo, to hold:</hi> for the wicked are held with the chaine of sinne, that they thinke creation, a fable; incarnation, infallible; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, improbable; election, vnprofitable; resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection vnpossible: And then it followes, that there is neither heauen nor hell: so that, <hi>Ede, bibe, lude, post mortem nulla volupt as: Eate, drinke and be merrie for after death there is no pleasure:</hi> Thus doe they diuulge their Satanicall suggestions. These speake stoatly, walke proudly, and liue wickedly: therefore high time to leaue it. O that there should be any soules so tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by any infernall spirits; their reason so blinded, their vnderstanding so darkened, and their saluation so endangered, as still to remaine in sinne,</p>
               <p>Surely these sinners are in a dead sleepe of finne, that neither <hi>Aarons</hi> belles, <hi>Solomons</hi> songs, nor <hi>Isaiahs</hi> trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet can awaken them, <hi>Thou hast smitten them yet haue</hi>

                  <hi>they not felt it. If the wound be such, that it neuer causeth smart, if it neuer ake nor grieue, it is but dead flesh, and to be cut off.</hi> Therefore it is to bee feared, that these are gone too farre downe, to the chambers of death. There are but seuen steps to the bottome; and they are on the last: The first, <hi>Importabile,</hi> cumbersome; then <hi>graue,</hi> heauie; then <hi>leue</hi> light, then <hi>insensibile,</hi> past feeling; after this comes <hi>delectabile,</hi> delight and ioy; then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes <hi>defiderabile,</hi> desire to finne; and the last step is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensibile,</hi> defence of sinne. And here are the men of this age making an apologie for sinne; as drunkards, with a weakenesse in the head; gluttony, with good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
<pb facs="tcp:7913:81"/>
adultery, with a tricke of youth; couetousnesse, with good husbandry; and murder, with manhood. Such are the prodigious sinners of our time, that they haue <note place="margin">Iere. 2. 25.

               </p>
               <p>And seeing these are going with <hi>Iudas</hi> to their owne place, let mee speake one word for their farewell: which is, that seeing they could find no end of sinning, while they were here, they shall haue no end of torments, when they are there: their curse shall be proportioned there, answerable to their sinnes here. For, for euery ounce of vanitie, they wall haue a pound waight of torment. Cursed of God, whose curse is, <hi>Poenarum inflictio the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of affliction;</hi> cursed in themselues, which is, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientia cruciamen, the torment of conscience;</hi> cursed of the deuils, which is, <hi>Poenarum executio, the execution of punishment;</hi> and cursed of the damned, which is, <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum aggrauatio, the augmentation of punishment.</hi> Thus they shall turne from <hi>Snakes</hi> to <hi>Addars,</hi> from both to <hi>Scorpions,</hi> and from all to the vnquenchable flames: Then will they crie when it is too late. And here I cannot but tell you what <hi>Herodotus</hi> tels me, of one that came to the water, and played with his pipe; but the fishes would not dance; then he castin a net, and tooke them out, and layd them on the ground, and then they could dance: but the man made this answere, when I played, you would not dance; but now you dance I will not play. There is a good morall to bee made of it; for God hath piped, and mad a melodious sound, in the preaching of his word, offering his mercies vnto vs, but we would neuer dance after this pipe: Wherefore when wee would dance God will not play: but answere <note place="margin">Luke 7. 32.</note> vs thus, when I pro ered mercy, you refused the same, now you seeke mercie I will denie it: And therefore
<pb facs="tcp:7913:82"/>
                  <hi>seeke the Lord, for it is time;</hi> in regard of your continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in sinne.</p>
               <p>And here let neither the greatnesse of sinne, nor the long continuance in the same, hinder our turning to God; for were our sinnes as <hi>crimson,</hi> yet shall they bee as <hi>snowe,</hi> saith the Lord. And how can it goe ill <note place="margin">Esa. 1. 18. Gods mercy is greater then our sinne.</note> with vs, when there are infinite mercies to finite sinnes? His mercies are deeper then <hi>Hell,</hi> broader then the <hi>Earth,</hi> and higher then <hi>Heauen.</hi> Therefore obserue for your comfort, your persons are not so wicked, nor your sinnes so great, but you may see the like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the gates of heauen. Art thou a drunkard? looke vpon <hi>Lot:</hi> Art thou a murderer? looke vpon <hi>Dauid:</hi> Art thou a swearer? looke vpon <hi>Peter:</hi> Art thou a theefe? looke vpon the Crosse: Art thou a persecuter? looke vpon <hi>Paul.</hi> These are all gone before, and then mayest thou follow after: onely bee not thou more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to goe to God, then he is to come to thee.

Regeneration is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a birth, where first the braine is made, then the heart, after that the liuer, then the sinewes, arreryes, and pipes: and lastly the handes and feete.

               <p n="3">3 Raine, is a maker of peace; for often wee see the windes, and other elements, in an vproare, where by the stout Cedars are bowed to the ground, Towres and Castles trembling, and the waters roaring: But now comes a showre of raine from the cloudes, and mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates

               <p>First, to follow the counsell of Christ, to giue God <note place="margin">To praise God. Matth. 22.</note> the things that belong to God, and to <hi>Cesar</hi> that which belongeth to <hi>Cesar.</hi> If by the ministerie of man you haue gotten some good measure of knowledge, faith, loue, repentance, and the like; forget not your due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the messengers of God: <hi>Haue them in singular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for their workes sake.</hi> Yet (we must say with <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>Thinke not that we by our owne power, or godlinesse, haue</hi>

                  <hi>done you this good;</hi> No, it is the spirit, and grace of God: And therefore we must say (with <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>Non nobis Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, non nobis, Not vnto vs, Lord, not vnto vs, sedno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini tuo da gloriam: but to thy Name giue the glory:</hi> For the principall praise belongs to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, bee not forgetfull of that which <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth. <hi>Take heede to thy feete, when thou entrest into</hi>

And hence it is, that the Church hath appointed prayer to be made before Sermons, that the word may be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto the hearers. It is not to bee forgotten, how God would haue the place of Diuine seruice vpon a mountaine; to teach the people, that while their bodies went vp to the Temple to heare the Lawe, their soules should goe vp to heauen by prayer: And therefore (as
<pb facs="tcp:7913:86"/>
Christ saith) in another kinde; <hi>That which God hath ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, let no man put asunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if you would haue this raine of grace to fall vpon you, keepe vnder the clouds, the Ministers of Gods word: For by, and in the hearing of the same, doth God raine downe these showres of his grace: <hi>For on as many as heard the word, did the holy Ghost fall.</hi> Often <note place="margin">Acts 10. 44.</note> his word goes without grace, but his grace neuer goes without the word. We are called <hi>Starres,</hi> and they are called <hi>Stellae,</hi> of <hi>Stando, to stand:</hi> Ministers must bee like them confined to their stations, not gadding and wandering <hi>Meteors, Comets,</hi> portending delusion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and confusion to themselues. <hi>Starres</hi> are also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sidera</hi> and haue that name of <hi>Considerando,</hi> taking heede, for of them <hi>Astronomers</hi> take heede, and also ship-men by sea. Such and much more heed, ought you to take of vs: for you must seeke the Law at our mouth, and by that the spirit, this gratious raine.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is said to raine, to teach vs what abundance of this grace, and mercie, hee will bestow vpon vs; <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, his name is <hi>Shemen turak, is as oyle powred out:</hi> Answerable hereunto saith God, <hi>I will powre out</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cantic. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>my spirit.</hi> Gods mercies are like himselfe, infinite: so <note place="margin">Ioel 2.</note> sayth <hi>Dauid, I know no end thereof;</hi> they are deeper then the sea, larger then the earth, and higher then heauen, <hi>Hoc mirum, hoc magnum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And haue not wee had good experience of this loue <note place="margin">Gods loue to this land.</note> and fauour of God? yea, <hi>Here is no complaining in our streetes, no leading into captiuity, our children like oliue plants, about our tables.</hi> And hereunto are added the word and Sacraments, with other spirituall blessings; the <hi>milke</hi> of exhortation, the <hi>wine</hi> of compunction, and the <hi>oyle</hi> of consolation. Thus <hi>mercie doth compasse vs on euery side;</hi> his patience in forbearing, his mercie in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, and his constancie in continuance. Hee might haue strucken vs with death for one lye with <hi>Ananias;</hi> stoned vs for one wedge of gold, with <hi>Achan;</hi> and cast
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7913:86"/>
vs out of heauen for one ambition with the deuill. But O the tender mercy of God, that such sinnes: (for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber so many, for qualitie so great, and for continuance so long,) should haue fauour with God. In <hi>hoc demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, virtus &amp; potentia Deinarratur.</hi> Herein is the vertue and power of God declared.</p>
               <p>Let this teach vs that are Ministers, to raine down the words of exhortation, and admonition: &amp; you that are magistrates, to raine down execution of iustice betweene man and man, and you inferiour people, to raine downe mutuall dutie one to another.</p>

no guile,</hi> this is sanctification. Happy men in whom two kisse one another: where the dewes of iustification are destilled down, and the sweet flowers of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe spring vppe. And yet such honour haue all his Saints: iustification, peace of conscience, ioy in the holy Ghost, and sanctification of life. Thus God raines downe his mercies vpon his Saints: which be the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of heauen, the couenant of grace, and the assurance of glory; musicke to the eares, splendor to the eye, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to the smell, daintaies for the tast, pleasures for the sense, and solace for the soule.
