            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Conſiderations Humbly Tendred, Concerning the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company.</head>
            <p>IF the Preſent Charter and Company be diſſolved, a way is paved for our Neighbours to render themſelves Maſters of all that Trade, and this irrecoverably, which will draw with it the Maſtery of the Sea, and all our Safety: For though we may think to Fight for it, while we have Mariners enough; yet it is nothing but Trade which can breed up and retain thoſe Mariners.</p>
            <p>If this Company only be pull'd down and another ſet up, (which muſt be with equal or larger powers) the ſtop and nonplus the new Company will be plunged in for ſome years, will give ſuch opportunities to our Neighbours to poſſeſs themſelves of all that is worth their graſping, that the Error will be ſeen when it is too late.</p>
            <p>If this be done, or (as the Phraſe now in Vogue) the Doors ſet open for new Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what reaſonable Compenſation can be made for the dead Stock, the Forts, Factories, Arms, Ammunition, Phirmaunds and Priviledges, acquired, improved, recovered, and maintained by a vaſt Expence? and with what Equity can this be done without it? whereas the daily practice of buying Stock at the Price Currant, is ſo eaſie to any who have a mind to come in fairly, ſo many dying, or ſelling off to lay out in Lands.</p>
            <p>If finding the ruinous tendencies of theſe Courſes, the Nation be content with reducing the greater Stocks to ſmaller Scantlings, it were as good to turn out Ability, Honeſty and Application from the management of the Stock, thoſe being the ſureſt pledges which can be given for theſe, and then what reaſon that the preſent Owners of the greater Stocks, the moſt whereof have reaped yet no benefit thereby, ſhould be obliged to ſell off to loſs? the leaſt harm that can be done in this caſe, being not to look back, but only to ſet limits for the future.</p>
            <p>But ſtill the Conduct of our thriving Neighbours will be worth obſerving, who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offered at ſuch Reſtraints, nor ever unſettled their once Eſtabliſh'd Company, and who as earneſt Aſſerters as they have ſhewed themſelves of Liberty in every Circumſtance; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of countenancing the inſolent Intruſions of Interlopers, have from time to time enlarged their Charter and ſtrengthned it with all the Authority which they could deſire.</p>
            <p>And this is it which hath enabled them to lay ſuch deep and ſolid Foundations in thoſe remote parts, not only for Traffick but for Empire, and which wait only for the once more diſturbing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, wherein the extravagancy of our Interlopers, and others abuſing the good meaning of many worthy Patriots in the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with their ſpecious but ſhallow Inſinuations and Slanders, does them as much ſervice as if they had hired them to it.</p>
            <p>If it be anſwered, that although the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade were loſt ſome Ships and Seamen might abate but enough remain; let ſuch conſider our Trials with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Naval Preparations of <hi>France;</hi> whoſe Projects in both <hi>Indies,</hi> ſhould they ſucceed, would ſet them up to undertake us both.</p>
            <p>To theſe Conſiderations, take in the want of <hi>Saltpetre,</hi> and the vaſt Expence of <hi>Gun-powder</hi> in the Modern Wars, at Sea eſpecially, which irreparably enſues upon our loſs of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>And then is it fit the Company ſhould be cried down as a Grievance, when it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the Interlopers are the Aggreſſors, inſolently contemning ſo many Warnings, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Proclamations in Vindication of a Charter deriving from the Bleſſed Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Memory was never taxed with Invaſion on our Laws and Properties, and confirmed and reinforced by all ſucceeding Kings for almoſt 100 years, Whereas had this been found to be a Grievance, is it not ſtrange, that ſo many ſucceeding Parliaments to which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might ſo freely have applyed for Redreſs, ſhould never have taken it to Task? But that notwithſtanding the miſcheivous Conſequences of former Interlopers, a few angry ones at preſent (who might as freely have come into the Stock by purchaſe as any others, nay all who are now concerned in it) ſhould thus irreverently aſſume the Courage to bid Defiance to Government, and take upon them to carve for themſelves.</p>
