            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I congratulate you highly in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in that ye have embraced thoſe Patterns of true love, and accompanied (as became you) thoſe who were involved in holy Bands, which are the Diadems of thoſe, who are truly the elected of God, and of our Lord; and becauſe the root of your faith, which was preached to you, continues firm even from the beginning until now, and brings forth fruit unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſuffred for our ſins even to the death, whom God raiſed up, having looſed the bands of death, in whom, having not ſeen him, ye believe, and believing rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory. Into which joy many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99160:8"/>
to enter, knowing that through grace ye are ſaved, not by works but by the will of God through Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore having your Loyns girt about, ſerve God with fear and truth, forſaking empty vain babble, and the errour of many, believing in him who raiſed up our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, and hath given to him glory, and a throne at his right hand. To whom all earthly and heavenly things are ſubject, and every thing that hath breath pays ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who ſhall come to judge the quick and dead, and whoſe bloud God will ſtrictly require at the hands of thoſe, who do not believe in him. But he, who raiſed him from the dead, will raiſe up us alſo, if we do his will, and walk in his Commandements, and love the things which he loved; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from all unrighteouſneſs, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, covetouſneſs, detraction, falſ-witneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, not rendering evil for evil, reproach for reproach, railing for railing, curſing for curſing, but remembring what the Lord ſaid teaching in this wiſe, Judge not that ye be not judged, forgive, and it ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you, be merciful, that ye may obtain mercy, in what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again; it is alſo ſaid, Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, and they, who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99160:9"/>
are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of God. Theſe things (Brethren) I write unto you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Righteouſneſs, not impoſing any commands upon you as from my ſelf, but becauſe ye have moved me ſo to do. For neither I, nor any other like unto me, can attain to the wiſdom of bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious PAUL, who, being amongſt you, and converſing face to face with men then living, taught you exactly and firmly the word of Truth; who alſo being abſent wrote <hi>Epiſtles</hi> unto you, by which, if ye give heed unto them, ye may be built up in the faith, which was delivered unto you; which Faith is the mother of you all, being followed by Hope, and led on by Love, which directs you to God, and Chriſt, and our Neighbour. For if any man is poſſeſſed of theſe, he hath fulfilled the command of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> He, who is poſſeſſed of Love, is free from all ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> is the root of all evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowing therefore that we brought nothing into the world, and that we ſhall carry nothing out, Let us arm our ſelves with the armour of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and teach our ſelves in the firſt place to walk in the Commandements of the Lord. And let us in the next place teach the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99160:9"/>
                  <hi>Women,</hi> that they walk according to that rule of faith, which was delivered unto them, and in love, and holineſs, and that they love entirely their own husbands with all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and all others equally with all conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and that they inſtruct their children in the diſcipline and fear of God. And let us teach the Widows to be ſober and wiſe, according to the faith of the Lord, and to make interceſſion for all without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, keeping themſelves from all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, accuſation, falſ-witneſs-bearing, covetouſneſs, and all evil, knowing that they are as the Altars of God, who obſerves the faults of every one of us; for nothing is hid from him, neither of our reaſonings, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, nor ſecrets of our hearts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know that God cannot be mocked, we ought to walk worthy of his command, and of glory. Likewiſe let the Deacons be unblameable in the preſence of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for they are the miniſters of God in Chriſt, and not of men; Let them not be accuſers, nor double-tongued, nor covetous, but continent in all things, compaſſionate, careful, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was made the miniſter of all, from whom, if we pleaſe him in this world, we ſhall receive a future reward; for he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99160:10"/>
hath ingaged for us to raiſe us from the dead, and, if we have our converſation wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, we ſhall alſo reign with him, as we believe. In like manner let the <hi>Young men</hi> be unblameable in all things, chiefly let them ſtudy chaſtity, and reſtrain themſelves as with a bridle from all that is evil. For it is a good thing to be elevated in our deſires above all the deſireable things of this world, becauſe all concupiſcence of the world warreth againſt the Spirit, and neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, nor effeminate perſons, nor abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of themſelves with mankind ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom of God, nor they, who do abſurd things. Therefore it is neceſſary that ye abſtain from all ſuch things, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> as to God and Chriſt. And let the <hi>Virgins</hi> walk with a blameleſs and chaſte Conſcience. Let the <hi>Presbyters</hi> be of tender bowels, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate towards all, converters of thoſe who are in errour, viſiters of all that are ſick, careful of the Widow, the Orphans, and the indigent, always providing that which is good in the ſight of God and men, not given to wrath, no reſpecters of perſons, not unjuſt in judgement, keeping themſelves far from all covetouſneſs, not haſtily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any thing againſt any man, not raſh
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99160:10"/>
in paſſing judgement againſt any, knowing that all of us are the <hi>debters of ſin;</hi> and, as we pray the Lord would forgive us, we ought alſo to forgive, for we are continually in the ſight of the Lord God, <hi>and muſt all ſtand before the Tribunal of Chriſt, and every one of us give an account for himſelf.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us ſerve him with fear and all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as he hath given in Commandement, and as the Apoſtles have evangelized to us, and the Prophets, who preached before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the coming of our Lord. Be zealous of that which is good, and keep your ſelves from ſcandals, avoiding the company of <hi>falſe brethren,</hi> who carry the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord in hypocriſie onely to ſeduce vain men into errour. <hi>For every one, who doth not confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is Antichriſt;</hi> and he, who doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the <hi>Martyrdom of the Croſs,</hi> is of the devil; <hi>and he, who ſhall pervert the Oracles of the Lord to ſerve his own private luſts, and ſhall ſay that there is no Reſurrection, nor judgement, is the firſt-born of Satan.</hi> Therefore let us decline the folly of many, and their falſe doctrines, and give heed to that word, which was delivered to us from the <hi>beginning.</hi> Let us attend unto Prayers with all ſobrierie, and unto Faſtings with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99160:11"/>
all perſeverance; and in our ſupplications let us pray unto the <hi>Al-ſeeing God,</hi> that he would not lead us into temptation, as the Lord hath taught, <hi>for the ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak.</hi> Let us endure without fainting, reſting our ſelves upon <hi>our hope</hi> and pledge of righteouſneſs, which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; who did bear our ſins in his own body upon the tree, who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> but he patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endured all things for us, that we might live through him. Therefore let us be the followers of his patience; and if we ſuffer for his Name, we glorifie him; for he ſet us ſuch an <hi>Example</hi> in himſelf, as we believe. Therefore I exhort you all to obey the word of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and to exerciſe all <hi>Patience,</hi> as ye have ſeen it exemplified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, not onely in the bleſſed <hi>Ignatius, Zoſimus,</hi> and <hi>Rufus,</hi> but in others among you, in <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, and the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For ye may be confident, that all theſe have not run in vain, but in Faith and Righteouſneſs, and having obtained the <hi>place</hi> due unto them, are now <hi>with the Lord,</hi> with whom alſo they ſuffered; for they loved not this preſent world, but him, who died for us, and was for us by God raiſed again from death to life. <hi>Stand faſt</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99160:11"/>
in theſe things, and follow the Pattern of the Lord Be ſtedfaſt in the Faith, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Lovers of the <hi>brotherhood,</hi> kind one to another, united in Truth, performing all meekneſs each to other, and deſpiſing none. When ye can do good, do not deferre it, for <hi>Alms delivereth from death.</hi> Be ſubject one to another, having your converſation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> that your ſelves may receive praiſe from your good works, and the Lord be not <hi>blaſphemed</hi> by your means. But wo to that man, by whom the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord is <hi>blaſphemed.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teach all men ſobriety, and be your ſelves converſant in it. I am very much troubled for <hi>Valens,</hi> who was made a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> among you, becauſe he is unmindful of his place, which was committed unto him. I therefore admoniſh you, that ye abſtain from <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and that ye be chaſte and true. Keep your ſelves from all evil. But how can he preach this to another, who cannot govern himſelf in theſe matters? If a man keep not himſelf from <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> he will be defiled with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an <hi>heathen.</hi> But who knows not the judgement of the Lord? Do we not know, that <hi>the Saints ſhall judge the world,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth? But I have neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99160:12"/>
nor heard of any ſuch thing among you, amongſt whom bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> laboured, who are alſo in the beginning of his <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> For he glories of you in all thoſe Churches, which onely knew God at that time, for as yet we had not known him. Therefore, my Brethren, I am grieved for him, and for his wife, to whom the Lord give true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And be ye ſober as to this very thing, eſteem not ſuch as as enemies, but reſtore them as frail and erring members, that the whole body of you may be ſaved, for in ſo doing ye build up your ſelves. I truſt that ye are well exerciſed in the holy Scriptures, and that nothing is hid from you, which thing is not yet granted unto me. As it is written, <hi>Be angry, and ſin not; let not the ſun go down upon your wrath.</hi> Bleſſed is he, who ſhall believe, which thing I believe to be in you. Now the God and Father of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the eternal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, and Son of God, build you up in faith, and truth, and in all meekneſs, that ye may be without anger; and in all patience, longanimity, long-ſufferance, and chaſtity; and give you a lot and part amongſt his Saints, and to us together with you, and to all, who are under heaven, that ſhall believe in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in his Father,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99160:12"/>
who raiſed him from the dead. Pray for all <hi>Saints.</hi> Pray alſo for <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Potentates,</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> for thoſe, who <hi>perſecute</hi> you, and <hi>hate</hi> you, and for the <hi>enemies</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> that your fruit may be manifeſted in all, and ye may be perfect in him. Ye and alſo <hi>Ignatius</hi> have written unto me, that, if any man go into <hi>Syria,</hi> he may carry alſo your Letters, which I will either do my ſelf, if I have a fit opportunity, or he, whom I ſhall ſend upon your meſſage alſo. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your requeſt we have ſent unto you thoſe Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which he wrote unto us, and ſo many others of his as we had by us, which are ſubjoyned to this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and by which ye may be very much profited; for they, contain in them faith, and patience, and all that is neceſſary for the building of you up in our Lord. Signifie unto us what ye ſhall certainly know concerning <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf, and thoſe who are with him. I have written unto you theſe things by <hi>Creſcens,</hi> whom I formerly commended to you, and do now commend, for he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant amongſt us unblameably, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was the ſame amongſt you. Ye ſhall alſo have his ſiſter commended, when ſhe ſhall come unto you. Be ſafe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in grace, with all yours.</p>

It is the judgement of learned men, that many Epiſtles are aſcribed to him, which were never written by him, but were the Epiſtles of ſome latter ſuppoſititious writers, who did imitate his Style, which are theſe Epiſtles following. 1. The Epiſtle written from <hi>Philippi</hi> to the Church of <hi>Tarſus.</hi> 2. The Epiſtle written from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi> to the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> 3.

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hitherto given a brief account of thoſe Epiſtles which are ſuppoſed falſe, I come now to make enquiry after thoſe, which are without all queſtion true.

But before I ſet down my Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I ſhall give you the account of Maſter <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> himſelf touching the Edition by him publiſhed, and according to which I have made my Tranſlation, as it here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows tranſlated out of Latine, ſo exactly as I could;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt courteous Reader,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SO it happens (as thou and I may have very often obſerved) that all things, which are either formed by nature, or framed by art, are of ſuch a condition, that the moſt perfect in their kind do ſtill appear the more beautiful, and artificial, as men imploy their ſtudy and indeavours in the contemplation of them. Some ſuch thing hath happened to me touching <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in whoſe Epiſtles, when ever I gave them a ſecond reading, I ſtill obſerved ſomething not obſerved before, from which they challenged my further approbation. So of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (I ſay) as I reaſſumed them into my hands, ſo often did ſomething appear in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99160:17"/>
them, by which I could make diſcovery of the genuine writer of them. One while that elegant <hi>Simplicity,</hi> which was moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the age wherein he lived; another while the verity and harmonie of words and things ſo every way correſponding; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this the zeal and fervencie of the <hi>Martyr,</hi> which as in other of his Epiſtles ſo in that to the <hi>Romans</hi> is moſt conſpicuous. All theſe are a ſufficient evidence unto me for the owning, and finding out of the true Author. Which raiſeth the greater admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in me, that there ſhould be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who do not onely deny theſe to be the very Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but alſo doubt not to affirm that he wrote none at all. Neither do they uſe any other argument to perſwade us to think that <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote no Epiſtles, but onely this, becauſe (ſay they) no ancient Author before <hi>Euſebius</hi> makes mention of them. For they confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that thoſe ſayings of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which are extant in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> were not taken from the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but from his own mouth. Certainly thoſe very learned men took little notice of that place in <hi>Origen,</hi> which is to be ſeen in his ſixth Homily upon <hi>Luke, By chance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I found in an Epiſtle of a certain</hi> Martyr
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99160:18"/>
(I mean <hi>Ignatius</hi> the ſecond Biſhop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> after <hi>Peter,</hi> who in his perſecution fought with beaſts at <hi>Rome)</hi> it elegantly written thus, That the Virginity of <hi>Mary</hi> was a ſecret kept from the Prince of this World. But we ſhall now make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to more ancient times, that ſo the Antiquity and Verity of this our <hi>Ignatius</hi> may be the more apparent, and the errour of thoſe men alſo be the more conſpicuous, who are otherwiſe perſwaded of him. The firſt therefore, who made mention of theſe Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> is <hi>Polycarp</hi> the Martyr, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> whoſe words are theſe, <hi>We have ſent unto you thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of</hi> Ignatius, <hi>which he ſent unto us, and ſo many other Epiſtles of his as we had by us,</hi> according to your deſires, which are all annexed to this Epiſtle, out of which Epiſtles ye may reap very much benefit, for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them Faith and Patience, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is convenient to build us up in the Lord. Now it cannot be doubted by any man, but that <hi>Polycarp</hi> had the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to whom amongſt his ſeven, <hi>Ignatius</hi> did in particular entitle one; which <hi>Polycarp</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives teſtimony of; when he ſaith, Ye have written unto me, and alſo <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Now <hi>Polycarp</hi> was about 60 years ſurvivor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99160:18"/>
to <hi>Ignatius.</hi> So that I propound this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; What appearance of truth can there poſſibly be, that (ſo long as <hi>Polycarp</hi> was alive) theſe true Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſhould be ſuppreſſed, and others ſuborned in the place of them? Did <hi>Polycarp</hi> deſtroy the firſt, that there ſhould be a neceſſity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe others in their ſtead? I think no man will render himſelf ſo ridiculous, as to make an attempt to prove any ſuch thing. Now I proceed. If <hi>Polycarp</hi> had theſe Epiſtles, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Scholar who cited them, had the ſame; and <hi>Origen</hi> received them from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> whoſe Citation out of them we mentioned a little before. And I am of opinion that no man can imagine, that the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> cited by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> were any other Epiſtles then thoſe which <hi>Origen</hi> made uſe of: <hi>Athanaſius, Jerom, Chriſoſt<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, Theodoret, Antiochus, Damaſcen, Photius,</hi> and innumerable others, who all of them made uſe of the teſtimony of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> did follow that Copie, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> had. So that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was never accounted of by any as <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> and yet all the Books of the New Teſtament had not the luck to eſcape ſo, but ſome were queſtioned as to their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and authority. Seeing therefore we have ſuch a continued ſucceſſion of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99160:19"/>
men, who have given their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching theſe Epiſtles, I do not ſee by what argument they can poſſibly defend their opinion, who are otherwiſe perſwaded of them. It is confeſſed his Epiſtles have been corrupted, and abuſed, and been read over with their corruptions and interpola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to theſe preſent times; yet there have not been wanting men of piercing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who have diſcovered truth to be in thoſe very interpolate Epiſtles; <hi>Andrew Rivet</hi> an eminent man makes this out ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. However I now publiſh thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which are genuine, and in all reſpects agreeing with the teſtimony of the Antients; ſo that they, who will deny theſe, muſt deny alſo that this <hi>Martyr</hi> ever wrote any Epiſtles. But let them enjoy their own opinion, for my part I am aſſured that they will meet with very few of the ſame, and none that can be of it with reaſon. But (Courteous <hi>Reader)</hi> thou art indebted to the <hi>Medicaean Library,</hi> that thou haſt theſe writings of <hi>Ignatius</hi> pure, and not counterfeit; and thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the moſt Serene Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ſecond, the great Duke of <hi>Etruria,</hi> through whoſe incomparable Love to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Study I gained an opportunity of having the uſe of that famous <hi>Librarie,</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99160:20"/>
full aſſurance in our Lord; who was truly of the ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh; the Son of God according to the will and power of God, truly born of a <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> baptized by <hi>John,</hi> that he might fulfil all righteouſneſs, and who truly ſuffered for us in the fleſh under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch.</hi> From the fruit of whom we are, even from his divinely bleſſed Paſſion, that he might by his Reſurrection lift up an enſign to all ages, to the Saints, and to all who do believe in him, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> in one body of his Church. For he ſuffered all theſe things for us that we might be ſaved. And he truly ſuffered, as alſo he truly raiſed up himſelf; neither did he ſuffer onely in appearance, as ſome infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels affirm, who themſelves are onely in appearance, and according to their wiſdom ſhall it happen unto them being incorporeal and daemoniacks. For I my ſelf ſaw him in the fleſh after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is riſen. And when he came to thoſe, who were with <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſaid unto them, <hi>Take hold of me, handle me, and ſee me, for I am not an incorporeal ſpirit.</hi> And ſtraightway they touched him, and believed in him being convinced by his fleſh, and by his ſpirit. And hereupon they contemned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99160:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
death, for they found themſelves to be above it. And after his Reſurrection he eat and drank with them as one in the fleſh, though he was in ſpirit united to the Father. Touching theſe things (Beloved) I admoniſh you, however I know ye are already of this perſwaſion. I do it to preſerve you from beaſts in the ſhape of men, whom it is neceſſarie for you not to entertain, but to avoid as much as poſſible. Onely pray for them, if happily they may repent, which is a thing very difficult. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is our true life, hath the power of this. But if theſe things were done by our <hi>Lord</hi> onely ſeemingly, then am I alſo ſeemingly in bonds. And why have I yielded up my ſelf to be put to death? why to the fire, to the ſword, to the beaſts? but becauſe to be nigh to the ſword is to be nigh to God, and to be incloſed with beaſts is to be compaſſed about with God. Only in the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> do I endure all things, that I may ſuffer with him, who is himſelf made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, and now ſtrengtheneth me. Whom ſome ignorant men denie, but they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denied by him, being more the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of death than of truth; whom neither the <hi>Prophets</hi> have perſwaded, nor the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hitherto, nor thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99160:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuffrings of ours, which are according to man. For they are of the ſame mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us. But what would it advantage me, ſhould any man ſpeak in my praiſe, and yet <hi>blaſpheme</hi> my Lord, denying him to have taken fleſh upon him? For he, who confeſſeth not this, hath perfectly denied him, and puts him to death. But I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to write down their infidel names; neither may I make any particular remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, until they ſhall happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent into a belief of the Paſſion, which is our <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> Let no man be deceived. For if things in heaven, and the glory of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Rulers viſible and inviſible believe not in the bloud of Chriſt, it will be even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them condemnation. He who receiveth it, may receive it. Let place puff up no man; for Faith and Charity is All, and nothing is to be preferred before them. But obſerve thoſe who are otherwiſe opinioned of the grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which came unto us, how contrary they are to the judgement of God. They have no regard at all of Charity, they neither care for the Widow, nor Orphan, nor any afflicted perſon be he bond or free, hungry or thirſtie They abſent themſelves from the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> becauſe they will not confeſs the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be the fleſh

of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which ſuffered for our ſins, and which the Father by his goodneſs raiſed from death to life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contradicting this gift of God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting about it they die, but it would be better for them to Love it, that they may riſe again. It is very convenient that ye ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſuch perſons, and that ye have no converſe with them, neither privately, nor publikely. But that ye give heed unto the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and chiefly to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> wherein the <hi>Paſſion</hi> is made manifeſt unto us, and the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is completed. But avoid <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> as the beginning of evils. And be all of you obſervant of the Biſhop, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was obſervant of the <hi>Father;</hi> and obſerve the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> the <hi>Deacons</hi> as the command of God.

ſo every thing, which is done, may be firm and eſtabliſhed. Furthermore, it is a bleſſed thing to grow ſober, and whilſt we have opportunity, to return to God by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is a becoming thing to know <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> He, who honoureth the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> is honoured of <hi>God;</hi> but he, who doth any thing without the <hi>Biſhops</hi> approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, performs a ſervice to the <hi>Devil.</hi> Therefore let all things abound among you in grace, for ye are worthy. Ye have every way refreſhed me, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh you. Ye have loved me both when I was abſent, and preſent, God will requite you; and if ye patiently endure all things for his ſake, ye ſhall enjoy him. Ye did well in that ye gave an honourable recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Philon, Rheus,</hi> and <hi>Agathopus</hi> as the Miniſters of <hi>God-Chriſt,</hi> who have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me for the Word of God. They alſo give thanks unto the Lord for you. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have every way refreſhed them. Nothing, which ye have done to them, ſhall be loſt as to you. I could offer up this my ſpirit upon the ſervice of your Souls, and upon the ſame account carry about theſe my bonds, which ye have neither deſpiſed, nor been aſhamed of; neither will <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the perfect faith be aſhamed of you. Your
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99160:22"/>
Prayer reached as far as to the Church which is in <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> from whence being carried a priſoner for God in moſt venerable bonds, I ſalute you all. And however I am not worthy of ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being the laſt that came thence, yet by the will of God I was accounted worthy, not from any thing which I know worthy in my ſelf, but through his grace, which I pray may be perfectly beſtowed upon me, that through your Prayers I may obtain God. And that your work may be perfected as well on earth as in heaven, it would be an honourable Service very much becoming your Church, which is worthy of God, to appoint ſome fit perſon for the honour of God, and to diſpatch him into <hi>Syria,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate them for their reſtored peace, that they have again received their proper ſplendour, and that their little body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed in ſuch a way as is fit for them. Indeed it ſeems unto me a worthy work for you to ſend ſome perſon from amongſt you with an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to joyn in glory with them, for that tranquilitie, which is amongſt them according to God, and that they are now come to the quiet haven through your Prayers. Being perfect your ſelves mind the things which are perfect. For if ye have but a

The Love of the Brethren, who are at <hi>Troas,</hi> ſaluteth you, whence alſo I write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by <hi>Burrus,</hi> whom ye ſent along with me together with your <hi>Epheſian brethren,</hi> who hath refreſhed me in all things.

                  <p>HAving embraced thy judgement, which is according to God, founded as upon a rock and immoveable, I glory exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I was accounted worthy of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable preſence, which I would enjoy in God. I exhort thee by that grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou art endued, that thou wouldeſt add unto thy race in admoniſhing all men that they may be ſaved. Juſtifie thy place by uſing all diligence both in a carnal and ſpiritual way. Be careful to preſerve Unity, than which nothing is better. Support all as the Lord ſupporteth thee. Bear with all men in charitie as alſo thou doſt. Find leiſure to be conſtant in Prayers. Deſire a larger underſtanding than yet thou haſt. Be watchful, keeping in thy poſſeſſion a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant ſpirit. Converſe with all man by man
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99160:24"/>
as God ſhall inable thee. Like a complete Champion bear the infirmities of all, the more the labour is, the more is the gain. It is not ſo much for thy commendation to love eminent Diſciples, as by thy Meekneſs to bring into ſubjection thoſe who are more pernicious. Every wound is not healed with the ſame Plaiſter. Mitigate their <hi>Paroxyſms</hi> by <hi>Embrocations.</hi> Be in all things wiſe as the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and harmleſs as the <hi>Dove.</hi> For this cauſe art thou carnal and ſpiritual, that thou mayeſt uſe a gentle hand in the managerie of thoſe things, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to thee; praying that thoſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which are concealed, may in time be made manifeſt, that ſo thou maiſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in nothing, but abounding in every grace. This very ſeaſon calls upon thee to deſire the fruition of God, as Governours of ſhips wait for the winds; and he, who is toſſed with the waves, covets after the haven. Be watchful as a Champion of God; that which is depoſited for thee, is incorruption and life eternal, of which alſo thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded. I would in all things freely offer up my ſelf for thee, and theſe my bonds, which thou haſt loved. Let not thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at all aſtoniſh thee, who ſeem to be perſons worthy of Credit, and yet are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99160:24"/>
teachers of ſtrange doctrines. Stand thou firm as an Anvil, which is beaten upon. It is the part of a gallant Champion to be ſtripped of his skin and yet to overcome. And in this reſpect it is neceſſary for us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to endure all things for God, that he may patiently bear with us. Be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent than yet thou haſt been; Conſider the ſeaſons, and wait for him, who is above ſeaſon, not limited to time, inviſible, yet for our ſakes made viſible, not capable of touch or ſuffering, yet ſuffering for us, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every manner of way for our ſakes. Let not the widows be neglected, under God do thou take care of them. Let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done without thy ſentence, and do thou nothing without the ſentence of God, that whatſoever thou doſt may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Let Congregations be gathered more frequently, and take the names of all perſons. Let neither men nor maid-ſervants be deſpiſed by thee, neither ſuffer them to become proud, but let them be more and more ſervants to the glory of God, that ſo they may obtain a better freedom from God. Let them not love the common free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that they may not be found the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Concupiſcence. Flee evil arts, but eſpecially have no conferences about them.

Beſpeak my ſiſters that they love the Lord Chriſt, and that they furniſh their husbands with all neceſſaries both for their fleſhly and ſpiritual eſtate. And in like manner admoniſh my brethren in the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to love their wives as the Lord loveth the Church. If a man can continue chaſt to the honour of the fleſh of our Lord, let him remain ſo, but let him not glory. For if he glory in it, he will be deſtroy'd, and if he would be more taken notice of than the Biſhop, he is corrupted. It is meet that they who marry and are given in marriage ſhould be joyned together by the ſentence of the Biſhop, that ſo the marriage may be according to God, and not according to concupiſcence. Let all things be done to the honour of God. Be mindful of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that God may be mindful of you. I could give my life for thoſe perſons who are ſubject to the <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and wiſh that I may receive my part in God together with them. Labour together one for another, ſtrive together, run together, ſuffer together, ſleep together, awake together as the Stewards, Aſſeſſors, and Miniſters of God. Do things pleaſing to him, whom ye fight for, and whoſe ſouldiers ye are, from whom ye expect
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99160:25"/>
your ſalarie. Let none among you be found a deſertor of his Colours. Let your Baptiſm arm you, Faith be your helmet, Love your ſpear, Patience your whole armour, and your Works your gage, that ye may receive a reward worthy of you. Therefore bear patiently in meekneſs one with another, as God bears with you. Let me enjoy you always. But in that the Church, which is in <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> is at peace through your Prayers, as it is manifeſted to me, I was therefore the more cheerful, and intent upon the things of God without diſtraction, that by any means I may through ſufferings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God, and be found your Diſciple at the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> O <hi>Polycarp,</hi> moſt bleſſed of God, it becomes thee to gather together a <hi>Council</hi> moſt becoming God, and to appoint ſome worthy perſon, whom ye eſteem high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love, whom ye look upon as a diligent man, fit to be called a Meſſenger of God; and that this honour be beſtowed upon him, To go into <hi>Syria</hi> there to ſpread abroad your forward Charitie to the glory of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath no power over himſelf, but is to attend the things of God. When ye ſhall have diſpatched this buſineſs, tho work ſhall be aſcribed to God and to you. For I believe that through Grace ye are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99160:26"/>
prepared for ſo good a work pleaſing to God; and knowing how compendiouſly ye are capable of truth, I have exhorted you in few Letters.

I do not give commands

to you as if I my ſelf was a perſon conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for though I am a Priſoner for his <hi>Name,</hi> yet am I not perfected in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For now I begin to be a Diſciple, and ſpeak to you as my fellow teachers. For it is meet that I ſhould be admoniſhed by you in faith, inſtruction, patience, and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But in regard my charity towards you would not ſuffer me to be ſilent, I have therefore taken the firſt hold of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to exhort you to concur in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. As <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who is our incomparable life, did follow the judgement of his <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the ends of the earth follow the judgement of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore it is a comely thing for you to concur in the judgement of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as alſo ye do; for your <hi>Presbytery</hi> moſt worthy of praiſe, and of God is ſo adapted to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as ſtrings are fitted to the harp, in ſo much that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is celebrated through your Unanimity and Agreement in love.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie,</hi> ye ſhall with one voyce glorifie the Father by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he may alſo hear you, and acknowledge you by what you do to be the members of his Son. So that it is profitable

for you to continue in immaculate Unitie, that ye may always be partakers of God. If I in ſo ſhort a time have gained ſo great a conformableneſs in manners with your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, which is ſpiritual, and not after the manner of men; how can I eſtimate of your happineſs, who are continually united to him, as the Church to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the Father, that all things may be conſonant in unity. Let no man be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. If any man is not within the <hi>Altar,</hi> he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the <hi>Prayer</hi> of one or two is ſo effectual, how much more effectual is the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and all the Church? He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that will not come into one place, (or joyn with the Congregation) is a proud man, and hath ſeparated himſelf, and it is written, <hi>That God reſiſteth the proud.</hi> Therefore let us endeavour to be in ſubjection to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> that ſo we may be God's Subjects. And if any man take notice that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> holds his peace, let him fear and reverence him ſo much the more; for we ought to receive him, whom the Maſter of the Family hath ſent to govern his Houſe, as we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Maſter himſelf, who ſent him. Therefore it is evident that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as the Lord himſelf. But

                     <hi>Oneſimus</hi> doth himſelf very much commend your good Order, which is according to God; for ye all live according to truth, and there is no hereſie amongſt you, neither do ye hear any but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth. Some indeed by an evil deceit have accuſtomed themſelves to carry about his Name, but they do things unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, and theſe ye ought to ſhun as beaſts. For they are like mad dogs biting unawares, whom ye ought to avoid, and have a ſpecial eye upon, being perſons very hard to be cured. There is one <hi>Phyſitian</hi> fleſhly, and ſpiritual, begotten, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, God made in the fleſh, and the true life in death, both of <hi>Mary</hi> and of <hi>God,</hi> firſt paſſible, and then impaſſible. Let no man ſeduce you, as ye are not yet ſeduced, being wholly of God. For ſo long as there is no contention amongſt you, which may be hurtful to you, ye live according to God. I am made as an <hi>Off-ſcouring</hi> for you, and as a <hi>Purgatorie expiation</hi> for you <hi>Epheſians</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to ages.

Pray for them who ſpeak evil of you, keeping your ſelves firm in the faith againſt their errour. Be mild how moroſe ſoever they are; neither be haſty to requite them according to their own examples.

mercy.

For when ye often come together into one place the powers of Satan are rendred fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; and his enmitie is deſtroyed through your Unity of Faith. Nothing is better than peace, by which all hoſtilitie of heavenly and earthly powers is made void. None of theſe things are conceal'd from you, if ye hold perfectly that Faith and Love in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which are the beginning and end of life. For <hi>Faith</hi> is the beginning, <hi>Love</hi> is the end; theſe two united are of <hi>God,</hi> and all other things tending to Honeſtie do wait upon theſe. No man, who hath covenanted into the faith, committeth ſin, nor doth he hate another who is poſſeſs'd of Charitie. <hi>The tree is known by its fruit;</hi> and they, who have ſolemnly engaged to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſhall be ſeen by the works they do.

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:99160:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but it is through the power of Faith, if a man be found to the end. It is better to be ſilent and to be; than to ſpeak and not to be. It is a good thing to teach, if a man do as well as teach. There is therefore one teacher, who <hi>ſpake,</hi> and it was done, and the things alſo, which he did in ſilence, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Father. He, who is truly poſſeſs'd of the word of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> can hear alſo his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that he may be perfect, that he may do according to what he ſpeaks, and be known according to thoſe things wherein he is ſilent. Nothing is hid from the Lord, but our very ſecrets are nigh unto him. Therefore let us do all things as having him dwelling in us; that we may be his <hi>Temples,</hi> and he may be our <hi>God</hi> in us; for whatever is ſhall be made manifeſt to us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we juſtly love him. <hi>Erre not (my brethren.)</hi> They who are deſtroyers of houſes ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Therefore if they are dead, who act ſuch things according to the fleſh; how much more is it death for any man by an evil doctrine to corrupt the faith of <hi>God,</hi> for which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was crucified? Such a one being defiled ſhall go into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire, and ſo ſhall he who hears him. For this cauſe the <hi>Lord</hi> received the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99160:31"/>
unction upon his head, that he might breathe into his Church incorruption. Be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with the doctrine of the <hi>prince</hi> of this world, which hath an ill odour; neither let him lead you captive from the life, which is ſet before you. Why are we not all wiſe having received the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Why are we fooliſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, being ignorant of that <hi>Grace,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> hath truly ſent amongſt us? My ſpirit is the <hi>Off-ſcouring</hi> of the Croſs, which is a ſcandal to unbelievers but to us <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Life eternal. Where is the wiſe? where is the diſputer? where is the boasting</hi> of wiſe men ſo called? For our God <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> was conceived by <hi>Mary</hi> according to the Oeconomie of God, of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> who was born and baptized, that he might through ſufferings cleanſe the water. And the <hi>Virginity</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Child born</hi> of her, and the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> were hid from the <hi>prince</hi> of this world, being three crying <hi>Myſteries</hi> yet wrought up by <hi>God</hi> in ſilence. How came he then to be manifeſted to ages? A <hi>Star</hi> in Heaven appeared, which out-ſhined all the other <hi>ſtars,</hi> and the light of it was ineffable, and the <hi>Noveltie</hi> of it did contain a ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it. All the other ſtars together with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99160:31"/>
the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> were a <hi>Chorus</hi> to this <hi>Star,</hi> which did carry in it a brightneſs and ſplendour above them all. The world was troubled about it, to find out how this <hi>New-Star</hi> ſhould appear amongſt the other <hi>ſtars</hi> ſo unlike unto them; hereupon all <hi>Magick</hi> was diſſolved, and every bond of wickedneſs diſ-appeared, ignorance was taken away, the old kingdom was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, when <hi>God</hi> appeared as man for the renewing of Life eternal. But that, which was perfect with God, took a beginning, and thereupon all things worked together to bring about the deſtruction of death. If <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> through your Prayers ſhall make me worthy, and it be his will, in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond little Book, which I am about to write unto you, I will lay open unto you how I began my Oeconomie in the <hi>New man</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, both in his Faith, Love, Paſſion and Reſurrection, and I ſhall the rather do this, if the Lord ſhall reveal it unto me. Becauſe all of you man by man through the grace of his Name concur together in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> of the ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh, the ſon of man, and the Son of God; and ye are all obedient to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> and to the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> with an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided mind, <hi>breaking one bread,</hi> which is

the <hi>Medicine</hi> of Immortalitie, an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt death preſerving to <hi>Life eternal</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I could give my life for you, and for him whom ye have ſent to <hi>Smyrna</hi> for the honour of <hi>God;</hi> whence alſo I write unto you, giving thanks unto the Lord, loving both <hi>Polycarp</hi> and you.

                  <p>KNowing your moſt excellent Order of Love, which is according to God, I joyfully made it my choice to ſpeak unto you in the faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For being accounted worthly of the <hi>Name</hi> moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming God in theſe bonds, wherein I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it about, I celebrate the Churches, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they may be united in the fleſh and ſpirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is our endleſs life, by Faith and Love, before which nothing is preferred; but chiefly of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the <hi>Father,</hi> through whom having patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured every injury from the <hi>prince</hi> of this world, and eſcaping them we ſhall enjoy God. For I was accounted worthy to ſee you by <hi>Damas</hi> your Divine <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99160:33"/>
the worthy <hi>Presbyters, Baſſus</hi> and <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Sotion</hi> the Deacon my Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, whom I would enjoy, becauſe he is ſubject to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as to the Grace of God, and to the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> as to the Law of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> And it becomes you not to make any uſe to your ſelves of the age of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> but to give him all <hi>Reverence,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power of God the <hi>Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Therefore for his honour, who wills it, it is meet we perform obedience without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. For a man doth not deceive this Biſhop, whom we ſee, but puts a fallacie upon him who is inviſible. This is not ſpoken in reference to the fleſh, but to God, who knoweth ſecrets. Therefore it is meet not onely to be called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but to be ſo. For ſome indeed there are, who own the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in name, but do all things without him. Such men appear to me to be men of no good Conſcience, becauſe they hold meetings not eſtabliſhed by commandment. All works have ſome end, two are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, Death and Life, and every man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99160:33"/>
ſhall go to his proper place. As there are two ſorts of Coyn, one of God, another of the world, and each Coyn hath its proper ſtamp ſet upon it. <hi>Infidels</hi> have the ſtamp of this world; <hi>Believers</hi> in love have the ſtamp of God the Father by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe life cannot be in us, unleſs we can through him voluntarily die into his <hi>Paſſion.</hi> But ſeeing I have in the perſons preſcribed taken a view of your whole multitude in Faith and Love, I admoniſh you to do all things in the unanimity of God; your <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> being Preſident over you in the place of God, and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in place of the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Deacons</hi> moſt pleaſant to me, having the <hi>Diaconie</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> committed to them, who was with the Father before ages, and in the end appeared. Having therefore all received manners like unto <hi>God,</hi> reverence one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and let no man defraud his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour according to the fleſh, but love one another always in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let nothing be amongſt you, which may poſſibly divide you, but be united to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and to thoſe who are <hi>Preſidents</hi> over you, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Type and Doctrine of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Therefore as the <hi>Lord</hi> being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him did nothing without the Father,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99160:34"/>
neither by himſelf, nor by the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> ſo neither do ye act any thing without the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Neither attempt any thing upon your own account how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſonable it may appear unto you. When ye come together into one place, let there be <hi>One Prayer, One Supplication,</hi> one mind, one hope in Love and in imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate joy. There is one <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> than whom nothing is better. Therefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur together as into the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, as to one <hi>Altar,</hi> to one <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who came from one Father, and being one is returned to him. Be not deceived by ſtrange opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor old fables, which are unprofitable. For if we ſtill live according to the Law and Judaiſm, we confeſs that Grace is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For the moſt divine <hi>Prophets</hi> lived according to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and therefore they were perſecuted, being inſpired by his Grace, that they might work a perſwaſion in thoſe, who were not perſwaded, that there is one God, who manifeſted himſelf by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> his Son, who is his eternal <hi>Word,</hi> not coming forth from Silence, who in all things pleaſed him that ſent him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they, who were converſant in the works of old time, came to the <hi>Newneſs</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> not <hi>Sabbatizing</hi> any longer, but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

according to the <hi>Dominical</hi> life of that day, whereon our life did riſe again through him, and through his death (whom ſome deny;) through which myſterie we have received both to Believe, and alſo to endure with Patience, that we may be found the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our onely <hi>Maſter;</hi> how ſhall we be able to live without him, whom the <hi>Prophets,</hi> being his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> looked for in Spirit as their Maſter? and becauſe they juſtly expected him, he, when he was come, raiſed them from the dead. Therefore let not us be inſenſible of his Goodneſs; for if he ſhould retribute to us according to what we do, we ſhould ceaſe to be. Therefore being made his <hi>Diſciples</hi> let us learn to live like <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For he, who is called by any other name than this, is not of God. Therefore put away from you the evil leaven, which is old and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and be ye changed into the New Leaven, which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Be ye ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, that none of you be corrupted; for ye ſhall be diſproved by your ſavour.

But your Prayer to God will perfect me, that I may obtain that Lot to which I was choſen, flying to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as to the <hi>fleſh</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as to the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> We love alſo the <hi>Prophets,</hi> becauſe they preached the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and did hope in him, and expect him; in whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo believing they were ſaved in the Unitie of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> being holy men worthy to be beloved, and moſt worthy of admiration, born witneſs of by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> being his <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and numbred up together in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of the common hope.

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Have known you to have a blameleſs underſtanding, not to be ſevered in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and that not by uſe, but by nature, as <hi>Polybius</hi> your <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath manifeſted to me, who by the will of God, and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and did ſo congratulate me a Priſoner for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that I did view over your whole multitude in him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receiving from him that good diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, which is according to God, I gloried finding you as I had known you the followers of God. For in regard ye are ſubject to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ye appear to me not to live as men, but to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99160:40"/>
live according to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who died for us, that believing in his death ye may eſcape death. Therefore it is neceſſary, as ye do to do nothing without the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> but that ye be ſubject to the <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> as to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Hope, in whom we ſhould be found having our <hi>converſation.</hi> It behooves the <hi>Deacons</hi> alſo, being the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to pleaſe all men every manner of way. For they are not the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of meats and drinks, but <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Church of God. Therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them to avoid accuſations as fire. Let all in like manner reverence the <hi>Deacons</hi> as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> being the Son of the Father; and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> as the <hi>Council</hi> of God, and companie of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi> Without theſe a <hi>Church</hi> is not called. Of whom I am perſwaded that ye are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, (For I have received the <hi>Exemplar</hi> of your love, and have it by me in your <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> whoſe <hi>behaviour</hi> is a great <hi>Diſciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and his <hi>meekneſs</hi> power; whom I think that very Atheiſts do reverence) being ſatisfied that I ſpare not my ſelf.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99160:40"/>
as to many things, yet do I meaſure my ſelf, that I may not be deſtroyed by boaſting. For now it behooves me to be very much affraid, and not to give heed to thoſe, who would puff me up. For when ſuch ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me they ſcourge me. Truly I love to ſuffer, but know not whether I am worthy. For my zeal appears not to many, but I have the greater war within. I have need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>meekneſs,</hi> that by it the <hi>prince</hi> of this world may be defeated. Cannot I write unto you of things <hi>celeſtial?</hi> but I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, leſt I ſhould give you ſome offence being yet but babes. Therefore pardon me, for I would not perplexe you with thoſe things, which ye are not able to bear. For it is not for a ſlightie matter that I am a Priſoner, being acquainted with things <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial,</hi> and the <hi>Angelical</hi> Orders, and their governing Conſtitutions, things viſible and inviſible; and beſides this I am now a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For many things are wanting to you, that we may not fall ſhort of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I exhort you, not I, but the love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to uſe only the Chriſtian nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, and to abſtain from that ſtrange herb, which is <hi>hereſie.</hi> For the times are ſuch, that perſons worthy of credit ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do fold in hereſie with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> like

thoſe, who adminiſter deadly poiſon, and temper it with a drink made of honey and ſowre wine, which the ignorant receives with pleaſure, and ſo dies by an evil delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore preſerve your ſelves from ſuch, and ſo it ſhall be, if ye are not puffed up, being inſeparable from <hi>God, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> He, who is within the <hi>Altar,</hi> is pure; that is, he, who does any thing without the <hi>Biſhop, Presbyterie,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> is of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Conſcience. Not that I have known any ſuch thing among you, but foreſeeing the ſubtilties of the devil, I take care of you before hand being my beloved. Do ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, re-aſſuming your mild diſpoſition, build up your ſelves anew in the <hi>faith,</hi> which is the fleſh of the Lord, in <hi>love,</hi> which is the bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let none among you have any quarrel againſt his Neighbour.

to receive you. And being in bonds for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> I hope to ſalute you, if it be his will, that I may be accounted worthy to continue to the end. For the beginning is well ordered, if thereby I may obtain Grace ſo as to obtain my Lot unto the end without impediment. For I fear your charitie, leſt it prove injurious to me. For to you it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to do what ye will; but to me it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to enjoy God, unleſs ye are the more ſparing to me. I would not have you to pleaſe men, but to pleaſe God, as ye do pleaſe him. I ſhall never have ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to enjoy God, neither ſhall ye be intituled to a better work, if ye can but be ſilent. For if ye be ſilent and let me alone, I ſhall be of God, but if ye love my fleſh, I ſhall be but a voice, and to run again. Ye cannot do better than to let me be ſacrificed unto God, in regard the <hi>Altar</hi> is already prepared. That ye being made up a <hi>chorus</hi> in love may ſing to the Father in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> becauſe God hath accounted the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> worthy to be found, and to be ſent from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> unto the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to ſet and go down gloriouſly from the world unto God, that I may riſe again in him. Ye have never bewitched me in any thing; ye have inſtructed others, and I would that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99160:43"/>
thoſe things may be firm, which ye as teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have commanded. Onely pray for me to be inabled inwardly and outwardly, that I may not onely ſay it, but will it, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but be found ſo. For if I ſhall be found ſo, I may alſo be ſo called, and then be a Believer, when I appear not to the world. Nothing is good which is onely in appearance; For our God <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> being in the <hi>Father</hi> appeareth the more. A Chriſtian is not a work of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion but of greatneſs, eſpecially when he ſhall be hated of the world. I write to all the Churches, and lay my commands upon them all, that I may willingly die for God, if ye ſhall not hinder me. I intreat you that ye would not be unſeaſonably kind unto me. Suffer me to be the meat of beaſts that by them I may enjoy God. I am the wheat of God, and ſhall be ground by the teeth of beaſts, that I may be found the pure <hi>bread</hi> of God. Allure thoſe beaſts the rather to become my <hi>ſepulchre,</hi> and to leave no <hi>reliques</hi> of my body, that when I am fallen aſleep I may not be burdenſom to any. Then ſhall I be the true Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when the world ſhall not ſee my body. Pray to the Lord for me, that by theſe inſtruments I may be found a ſacrifice
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99160:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to God. I do not give you commands as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> they were <hi>Apostles,</hi> but I am a condemned perſon, they were free, but I am a ſervant even until now, yet, if I ſuffer, I ſhall be made the Freeman of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſhall riſe again free; and being now a Priſoner I learn to deſire nothing. From <hi>Syria</hi> even to <hi>Rome</hi> do I fight with beaſts, both by Land and by Sea, by night and by day, being bound to ten <hi>Leopards,</hi> (which are my military guard) which are the worſe for being kindly treated. But by their injurious dealings I am the more made a Diſciple, yet am I not therefore ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. I would enjoy the beaſts which are prepared for me, and I pray that they may be found ſharply ſet, nay I would entiſe them greedily to devour me, and not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to decline the touching of me as they have avoided ſome. But if they ſhun me, and will not, I ſhall provoke them. Pardon me. I know what is convenient for me. Now I begin to be a Diſciple in that I have a zeal to nothing viſible or inviſible, but that I may gain <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let the fire, the croſs, the violence of beaſts, ſcattering of bones, conciſion or chewing of members, grinding of the whole body, buffetings of the devil come upon me, ſo that I may but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99160:44"/>
enjoy <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ends of the world will profit me nothing, nor the kingdoms of this age. It is good for me to die for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> rather then to rule over the ends of the earth. I ſeek him, who died for us, I will him, who roſe again for us. He is the Gain ſet before me. Pardon me, <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> do not hinder me to live, do not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate me by the world, who am willing to be of God, nor ſeduce me by that which is material. Suffer me to receive the pure light, when I approach to that, I ſhall be a man of God. Suffer me to imitate the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my God. If any man hath him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, he may underſtand what I will, and ſympathize with me, knowing what things have taken poſſeſſion of me. The <hi>prince</hi> of this world would ſpoil me, and corrupt my judgement, which is according to God. Therefore let none of you being preſent contribute any aſſiſtance to him, but rather be for me, that is, for God. Do not ſpeak <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and covet the world. Let no faſcination be amongſt you. Neither do I exhort you being preſent to believe me, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe the things, which I write unto you; for I write unto you being alive, yet withal willing to die. My Love is crucified, and the fire, which is in me, deſires no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99160:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But there is one living and ſpeaking in me, who ſaith to me inwardly, <hi>Come to the Father.</hi> I take no pleaſure in the meat of corruption, nor in the pleaſures of this life. I will the bread of God, which is the fleſh of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> and the drink which I will, is his bloud, which is incorruptible love. I would live no longer according to men, and this ſhall be if ye will. Will it therefore that ye alſo may be accepted. I intreat you by a few writings, believe me; but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall manifeſt theſe things to you, that I ſpeak truth. That is no lying mouth, by which the Father hath truly ſpoken. Pray for me that I may obtain. For I have not written unto you according to the fleſh, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of God. If I ſuffer ye have loved me, but if I prove Reprobate ye have hated me. Remember in your Prayers the Church in <hi>Syria,</hi> which in my ſtead hath God for its <hi>Pastour. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſhall watch over it, and your Love. But I am aſhamed to be named from them, for I am not worthy, being the laſt of them, and an abortive. But I may through mercy be ſomething if I obtain God. My Spirit ſaluteth you, and the love of the Churches which have received me for the

Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not as one paſſing by them; for they did not meet me onely on the way according to the fleſh, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me to the Citie.

Of this number was <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who needs not any humane Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, in regard he abounded with ſo much of Divine Approbation, for honourable mention is frequently made of him in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> written by Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> He and <hi>Paul</hi> were <hi>tanquam jugati boves,</hi> as Gods chief yoke of Oxen, ploughing over much ground, and manuring the field of <hi>Chriſtianitie;</hi> He was a perſon of very great Eminencie and Integritie in his Place and Office, often imployed upon honourable Services for the Church, ſometimes alone, and ſometimes in conjunction with holy and bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> and when he had done the Church all honeſt and faithful Service he poſſibly could, and had improved his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to his Maſters glorie, the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and his own, he finiſhed the courſe of his natural life by a glorious <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> and under the power of <hi>Nero</hi> the firſt of <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and worſt of men, was burnt at the ſtake for his Religion, upon the eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> which day is Annually obſerved by our Church to perpetuate his memory, and to advance Gods glorie.

Some years have paſſed over, ſince it was my reſolution to publiſh this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> which I received from the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Salmaſius;</hi> but being prevented by a journey, I could not then perfect what I intended. When I went for <hi>England</hi> to make my ſelf acquainted with that Nation, another opportunity offered it ſelf unto me, whereby I was encouraged ſpeedily to make publike the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> before mentioned, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99160:47"/>
had merited long before to be ſent forth to the publike view. For the Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> was then preparing to publiſh a new Edition of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and when he made it both his requeſt and offer that this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Barnabas</hi> might be printed with his <hi>Ignatian Epiſtles,</hi> I not onely freely conſented to it, but was very glad, that ſo very Antient a Monument ſhould fall into thoſe hands, from which I was aſſured it would borrow not a little ſplendour. And had not a great fire conſumed a great part of the Citie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and deſtroyed all <hi>Exemplars,</hi> we had had long ſince a very fair Edition of this Author. However there were not wanting in <hi>France</hi> ſome learned men, who thought it a very unworthy thing that ſuch a writing as this ſhould be ſo long concealed. Thereupon <hi>Claudius Menardus</hi> of the Order of Saint <hi>Maurus</hi> lately fitted out for us a new Edition; and that he hath very well deſerved of the publike for this act of his no man can deny. Yet he had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited more had it been his good fortune to ſee more Copies For ſeeing that Edition of his was wholly taken out of one only book, it could not poſſibly come forth any other then very faulty. Though fortune
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99160:48"/>
hath not ſo much favoured me as to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter occaſion to any mans envie, yet this happineſs hath been afforded me, to have the uſe of three <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> whereby to correct that Edition; The <hi>Medicaean Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> ſupplyed me with the firſt, and that of <hi>Theatins</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> furniſhed me with the other two; and <hi>Lucas Hoſtenius</hi> an eminent man, who cannot be praiſed according to his deſerts, is the perſon, to whom I am indebted for the uſe of them. What help theſe three <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> have afforded me, he will be beſt able to judge, who can think it worth his while to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with the other Edition before mentioned. But I cannot imagine upon what grounds ſome men ſhould think that this is not the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> whereas <hi>Clement, Origen,</hi> and others aſcribe it to him. Learned men (I believe) may take offence at ſome unuſual Expoſitions of his, made upon ſome places of <hi>Scripture;</hi> but they can have nothing whereon to ground a perſwaſion, that thoſe places ſhould be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted by a man of ſo great authority, whom the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> make ſo frequent mention of, and who was always an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Companion of the <hi>Apoſtle Paul,</hi> and himſelf one of the <hi>Minor Apoſtles.</hi> But
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99160:48"/>
who could expect all kind of Science and Learning from thoſe firſt <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> and think that they might not as well be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken as their Relatives, eſpecially in things not appertaining to Faith? Do we not meet with many things as ſtrange in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Clement?</hi> which <hi>Epiſtle</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by <hi>Patricius Junius</hi> the Kings Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Keeper, and an eminent man, to whom I am ſo much a debtor, that he cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly oblige me more. For who can well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt that fable of <hi>Clement</hi> about the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and his many worlds beyond the <hi>Ocean?</hi> neither do I believe that ſome will eaſily admit of that Expoſition about the <hi>Scarlet thred</hi> of the Harlot <hi>Rahab,</hi> that it ſhould be a Type of the bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and other things of this nature which I could reckon up, but they are not ſo proper for this place; yet was this <hi>Clement</hi> called an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> by as good right as <hi>Barnabas</hi> was. Therefore no perſons ought to find fault with that in the one, which they excuſe in the other. It is known to every one how very myſtically, ſuperſtitiouſly, and almoſt impertinently, thoſe firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did interpret the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Therefore if ſome things ſhould be met with in this Author, which may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Learned, let them rather impute
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99160:49"/>
it to the manner of expreſſion uſed by thoſe ancient <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than entertain the leaſt thoughts that this writing is ſuppoſititious. Nor let any perſons therefore like the worſe of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Barnabas</hi> becauſe <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and other Greek Writers of a later date, have placed it amongſt the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. For they did not queſtion the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, only they approved not of thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Interpretations of his, made upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of <hi>Scripture.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon many works of <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and of <hi>Origen,</hi> were accounted <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal,</hi> whereas it was never yet doubted of, whether thoſe very works ſo accounted of were their genuine works. And certainly if we ſhould reject all Writings, which have at any time been accounted <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> we ſhould reject the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Jude</hi> the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and that of <hi>Clement</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> which thing ſhould we do how abſurd would it ſeem to any man? Others have given out that they have diſcerned this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to be ſpurious both from the Style, and manner of Writing, and they have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the very ſame things of the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> but they, who boaſt of ſuch things, would ſeem more accute than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99160:49"/>
them. For it is not ſo eaſie to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſpurious writings from genuine, as it is to know true Pearls from counterfeit. When true Stones are compared with counterfeit, the <hi>fucus</hi> of the counterfeit ſoon appears, as a true people will diſcover a falſe one; which is a thing ordinary in other traffique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commodities. But from what is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for theſe men to take the ground of their conjecture, who deny theſe to be the very <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Barnabas?</hi> Have they ſeen other Writings of theirs? Certainly not. Therefore how come they to know what Style <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> uſed? Yet they go on and ſay, that what they think to be true, they know to be true, and if it be ſo with them, I will not adde one word more about them.</p>

               <p>MY <hi>ſons</hi> and <hi>daughters,</hi> in the Name of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, I wiſh you much joy and peace. Knowing that there is in you an abundance of the great and comely Graces of God, I am rejoyced above meaſure by your bleſſed and excellent ſpirits; for by this means ye have received a natural grace. So that I am hereby very much comforted, hoping to be ſet at liberty; becauſe I verily perceive that the ſpirit is infuſed into you from the honourable Fountain of God. And ſeeing I am of this perſwaſion, and know it the more fully ſo to be, in regard that, whilſt I am converſing with you, many things have ſucceeded well with me, according to the equal way of the Lord; therefore is it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily <hi>Brethren</hi> in my thoughts to love you
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99160:51"/>
more than my own ſoul; becauſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith and love dwelleth therein, and the hope of that other life. Thinking of this (and becauſe it was my care to impart ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto you of what I have received) that it would be a ſufficient reward to do ſervice to perſons of ſuch a ſpirit, I made it my proper buſineſs, as allotted to me, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſend unto you ſome few things, that together with your faith ye may have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo perfect knowledge. There are alſo <hi>three Conſtitutions of the Lord, The hope of life, the beginning, and the conſummation.</hi> For God hath made before-hand things plain to us, by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> who are paſſed, and hath given unto us the beginnings of future things. But, as he hath ſaid, <hi>It is a more honourable and high thing to approach to his Altar.</hi> Yet I ſhall not as a Teacher or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, but as one of you, ſhew you a few things, by which ye may be the more joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in many. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>Seeing</hi> therefore that the days  are moſt wicked, and that the <hi>adverſary</hi> hath the power of this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to make enquiry into the equal ways of the Lord. <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> are the <hi>Coadjutors</hi> of your <hi>faith;</hi> and the things, which fight for us, are <hi>Longanimitie</hi> and <hi>Continence.</hi> Where theſe remain pure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to the Lord, wiſdom, underſtanding, ſcience, knowledge rejoyce together with them. For he hath laid it open to us by all the Prophets, that he will not uſe our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, victims, nor oblations, ſaying in this wiſe, <note place="margin">Iſai. 1.</note>
                  <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord, I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of lambs; I delight not in the bloud of goats and bulls. Neither do I regard you, when ye come to appear before me.</hi> For <hi>who hath required theſe things at your hands? neither ſhall ye tread my courts. When ye bring your courſe bread</hi> it is vain, <hi>your incenſe is an abomination to me. Your new moons, and ſabbaths, and great day I cannot endure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your faſt, idle time, new moons, and feaſts my ſoul hateth.</hi> God hath therefore made theſe void, as the new Law of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is without the yoke of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, hath made void the humane oblation. The Lord ſaith again unto them, <hi>Have I commanded your fathers, when they went out of the land of Egypt, that they ſhould offer unto me ſacrifices and victims? but this I commanded them, ſaying, Let every one among you bear no malice towards his neighbour, and let no man ſwear falſly.</hi> Seeing therefore that we are not without underſtanding, we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99160:52"/>
ought to underſtand the counſel of the goodneſs of our Father. For he being willing to ſeek us alſo going aſtray, hath told us how we ſhould come unto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The ſacrifice of God is a contrite heart, and one that is humbled, God doth not deſpiſe.</hi> Therefore (Brethren) we ought to enquire more certainly concerning our Salvation, that nothing may have entrance into us, which may turn us away from our life. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>God ſpeaks</hi> again unto them as concerning  theſe things, ſaying, <note place="margin">Iſai. 58.</note>
                  <hi>Wherefore do ye fast to me, that your voice may be heard on high, as this day? I have not choſen ſuch a faſt, nor a day for a man to afflict his ſoul; neither ſhalt thou bow down thy neck like a bulruſh, nor ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under thee, nor ſhall ye call this an acceptable faſt.</hi> But to us he ſaith thus, <hi>When ye ſhall faſt, Looſe every bond of iniquitie, diſſolve the obligations of violent contracts, ſet the oppreſſed at libertie, make void every injurious obligation; break thy bread to the hungry; bring the poor that are without ſhelter into thine houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when thou ſeeſt the naked clothe him, and hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh; then thy light ſhall break forth as the Morning, and thine health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily; and thy righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee; the glorie of the Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:99160:53"/>
                  <hi>ſhall be thy rereward. Then ſhall thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; thou ſhall cry, and he ſhall ſay, Here I am: if thou take away from the midſt of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and ſpeaking Vanity, and ſhall give thy bread to the hungry with all thy ſoul.</hi> Therefore in this (brethren) God is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and merciful, in regard the people, whom he hath acquired to his <hi>beloved,</hi> ſhould believe in ſimplicity, and he hath ſhewn to all us, that we ſhould not run as <hi>Proſelytes</hi> over <hi>to their Law.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And <hi>it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns</hi> us to write much of the things in hand, which cannot heal. Let us flie every work of iniquitie, and hate the errour of this time, and love things future. Let us not give liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to our ſoul, nor ſuffer it to wander with moſt lewd men and ſinners. For the trail is conſummate, as it is written, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>it is at hand.</hi> For this cauſe doth the <hi>Lord</hi> divide times and days, that his <hi>beloved</hi> may haſten to his inheritance. So ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note>
                  <hi>Ten kingdoms ſhall reign upon the earth, and a little king ſhall ariſe, who ſhall depoſe three into one.</hi> Concerning the <hi>kingdoms,</hi> and this very thing <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith again, <hi>I ſaw a fourth beaſt dreadful and terrible, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtrong, having ten horns, and another little horn grew up in the midſt of them, before</hi>

                  <hi>whom there were three of the firſt horns plucks up by the roots.</hi> Therefore we ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and I intreat you again, as one of you, loving you above mine own life, that ye would take heed unto your ſelves, and that ye would not be like unto thoſe, who heap up their ſins, and ſay, That their <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is alſo ours.</hi> But ours it is, for they have for ever deſtroyed that which <hi>Moſes</hi> received. For the Scripture ſaith, <hi>And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was in the mount fasting fourty days and fourty nights, and he received the teſtament from the Lord, the tables of ſtone written with the hand of God.</hi> But they being turned unto idols deſtroyed that, for the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Go down quickly, for thy people, which thou broughteſt out of the land of Egypt, hath tranſgreſſed. And Moſes caſt the tables of ſtone out of his hands, and their Testament was broken,</hi> that the love of <hi>Jeſus</hi> might be ſigned upon your hearts unto the hope of the faith of him. Therefore let us give heed unto the <hi>laſt days;</hi> for all the time of our life and faith ſhall profit us nothing, if we do not endure unjuſt things, and future temptations, as the Son of God ſaith, <hi>Let us reſiſt all iniquitie, and hate it.</hi> Conſider therefore the works of an evil life. Ye ought not to ſeparate your ſelves as being
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99160:54"/>
juſtified, but meeting together in one, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what may be in common profitable and convenient for the <hi>beloved.</hi> For the Scripture ſaith, <note place="margin">Iſai. 5.</note>
                  <hi>Wo to thoſe, who are wiſe in their own eyes, and prudent in their own ſight.</hi> Let us being ſpiritual, be made a perfect <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> as much as in us lies. Let us meditate upon the fear of God, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep his Commandements, that we may rejoyce in his judgements. The <hi>Lord</hi> accepting no mans perſon judgeth the world; every man ſhall receive according to his deeds. If he be good, his goodneſs goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; if wicked, the ways of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs follows after him. Take heed leſt at any time being called, and at eaſe, we do not fall aſleep in our ſins, and the wicked one getting power over us, do not awake us out of our ſleep, and exclude us from the Kingdom of the <hi>Lord.</hi> Underſtand a little more; Having ſeen the great ſigns and wonders among the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the <hi>Lord</hi> doth ſo leave <hi>them;</hi> therefore let us take heed, leſt happily we be found, as it is written, <note place="margin">Matt. 22.</note>
                  <hi>Many called, few choſen.</hi>  
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> endured to deliver up his body to death, that we might be ſanctified by remiſſion of ſins, that is, through the ſprinkling of his bloud. For it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99160:54"/>
is written of him to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to us, in this manner, <note place="margin">Iſai. 53.</note>
                  <hi>He was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, bruiſed for our iniquities; by his ſtripes we were healed. He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, and as a lamb before the ſhearer dumb, ſo opened he not his mouth.</hi> Therefore we ought exceedingly to rejoyce in the <hi>Lord,</hi> becauſe he hath ſhown unto us things paſt, and hath made us wiſe, neither are we without underſtanding of things to come. But he ſaith, <hi>The net ſurely is ſpread in vain in the ſight of any bird.</hi> This he ſaith, in regard that that man ſhall juſtly periſh, who hath knowledge of the way of truth, and yet will not refrain himſelf from the dark way. Moreover, the <hi>Lord</hi> endured to ſuffer for us, and yet he is the <hi>Lord</hi> of the world, to whom he ſaid upon the day before the world was conſummate, <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note>
                  <hi>Let us make man according to our image and ſimilitude.</hi> Learn therefore how much he endured, who would ſuffer this from men. The <hi>Prophets</hi> having the gift from him <hi>propheſied</hi> of him; and he, that he might aboliſh death, and make manifeſt the Reſurrection from the dead, endured, becauſe it was neceſſary for him to appear in the fleſh, that he might make good the Promiſe to the <hi>Parents.</hi> And preparing a <hi>new people</hi> by his being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Then he choſe <hi>proper Apoſtles,</hi> who ſhould preach his <hi>Gospel,</hi> who were ſinners above all ſin, that he might ſhew that he <hi>came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Then he manifeſted himſelf to be the Son of God. For had he not come in the fleſh, how could men looking on him have been ſaved? For the Sun, which is the work of his hands, men cannot look di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon with their eyes intent upon the beams of it. Therefore the Son of God came in the fleſh, that he might conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the ſins of thoſe, who perſecuted his <hi>Prophets</hi> unto death. And for this he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. For God ſaith, <note place="margin">Iſai. 53.</note>
                  <hi>By the ſtripe of his fleſh all are healed.</hi> And again, <note place="margin">Zech. 13.</note>
                  <hi>When I ſhall ſmite the ſhepherd, then ſhall the ſheep of the flock be ſcattered.</hi> He would thus ſuffer, and it was neceſſarie that he ſhould ſuffer upon the tree. For he ſaith, who propheſied of him, <hi>Thou ſhalt deliver my ſoul from the ſword.</hi> And, <hi>Faſten my fleſh with nails, for the congregations of wicked men are riſen up againſt me.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I have given my back to ſcourges, and my</hi>

He ſaith, <hi>Let one he made an execration.</hi> Mark how the figure of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is manifeſted.

And <hi>Jacob changed his hands, and put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim the ſecond and the younger, and bleſſed him. And Joſeph ſaid to Jacob, Put thy right hand upon the head of Manaſſes, becauſe he is my firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born ſon. And Jacob ſaid to Joſeph, I know it my ſon, I know it, but the Elder ſhall ſerve the younger, yet he alſo ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> See which of theſe he hath appointed to be this <hi>firſt people,</hi> and <hi>heir</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let it be remembred that through <hi>Abraham</hi> we have a greater perfection of our knowledge. Therefore what ſaith he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99160:65"/>
to <hi>Abraham, That</hi> becauſe <hi>he believed, it was counted to him for righteouſneſs? Behold, I have made thee a father of nations which ſhould believe in the Lord through uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions.</hi> But let us now enquire, whether he hath performed the <hi>Covenant</hi> which he ſware to the <hi>fathers,</hi> to <hi>this people?</hi> He gave it, but they were not worthy to receive it, by reaſon of their ſins. For the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>And Moſes was fasting in the mount Sinai fourty days and fourty nights, that he might receive the Covenant from the Lord for the people; and he received of the Lord the two tables, written with the finger of the Lord's hand through the ſpirit:</hi> and when <hi>Moſes</hi> had received them, he brought them down to deliver them to the people. And the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes; Moſes, Moſes, go down quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for thy people have tranſgreſſed, which thou broughteſt out of the land of Egypt.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> underſtood that they had made them molten idols, and he caſt the tables out of his hands, and the tables of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> were broken. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, but they were not worthy. Learn now how we received them. <hi>Moſes</hi> received them as a <hi>ſervant,</hi> but the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf gave them to us, who ſuffering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for us was made manifeſt, <hi>that</hi> they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99160:66"/>
                  <hi>might be conſummate in their ſins,</hi> and <hi>we might be the people of the inheritance,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Covenant by the heir Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith again, <hi>Behold, I have ſet thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou maiſt be for ſalvation to the ends of the earth, ſaith the Lord God who redeemed thee,</hi> who was prepared for this very thing, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king diſcoverie of our evils deſtructive to death, and how wholly we were given up to the tranſgreſſion of errour, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from darkneſs, and put his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in us by the Word. For it is written how that the Father commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from darkneſs, and to prepare for himſelf an holy people. Therefore the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>I the Lord thy God have called thee in righteouſneſs, and I will hold thy hand, and will ſtrengthen thee, and I have given thee for a Covenant to the nations, and for a light to the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, and to deliver thoſe that are in bonds, thoſe that ſit in darkneſs from the priſon-houſe.</hi> Know therefore how we were delivered and redeemed. Again the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me, and ſent me to preach the glad tidings of grace to the humble, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach liberty to the</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:99160:66"/>
                  <hi>captives, to open the eyes of the blind, and to call an acceptable year of the Lord, and a day of retribution, and to comfort all that mourn.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11:"/> It is alſo written concerning the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the <hi>Ten words,</hi> wherein he ſpake in the <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> face to face to <hi>Moſes; And ye ſhall ſanctifie the Sabbath of the Lord with pure hands, and with a pure heart.</hi> And in another place he ſaith, <hi>If their ſons ſhall keep my Sabbaths, then will I put my mercy upon them.</hi> He calleth it a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Creation. And God made in ſix days the works of his hands, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed upon the ſeventh day, and reſted on it; and ſanctified it. Sons</hi> obſerve what he ſaith when he ſaith, <hi>He finiſhed in ſix days.</hi> This he ſaith, <hi>That God the Lord will finiſh all things in ſix thouſand years; for a day with him is a thouſand years,</hi> He himſelf witneſſeth it, ſaying, <hi>Behold this day, A day ſhall be as a thouſand years.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Children, in ſix days, in ſix thouſand years all things ſhall be finiſhed. And he reſted on the ſeventh day,</hi> This he ſaith, <hi>When his Son coming ſhall finiſh the works of his time, and ſhall judge the ungodly, and ſhall change the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, then he ſhall reſt honourably upon the ſeventh day.</hi> In fine this he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſanctifie</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:99160:67"/>
                  <hi>it with pure hands, and a pure heart.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how can any one now <hi>ſanctifie the day, which God hath ſanctified, unleſs he be of a pure heart in all things?</hi> Let us not be deceived. <hi>For if he reſting gloriouſly doth ſanctifie it, we being juſt, and doing juſt things ſhall be able to ſanctifie it, when we have received the Promiſe of iniquitie ceaſing, all things being made new by the Lord. Then we ſhall be able to ſanctifie it, when we our ſelves are firſt ſanctified.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ſaith to them, <hi>Your new Moons and your Sabbaths I cannot away with.</hi> See how he ſaith, <hi>That the Sabbaths which are now are not acceptable unto me.</hi> But in that he reſted, he made all things which he had made the beginning of the <hi>eighth day,</hi> that is, the beginning of <hi>another world. Therefore we obſerve the eighth day with alacrity of mind, whereon Jeſus roſe from the dead, and being manifeſted, aſcended up into the heavens.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> I ſhall moreover ſpeak unto you concerning the <hi>Temple:</hi> How they being in miſerie did erre in their hope upon the way, for they did not hope in the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> who made them, but in the <hi>Temple</hi> as being the Houſe of God, for almoſt, like the very heathens, they confined him within the Temple; but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99160:67"/>
learn what the Lord ſaith making void the Temple. <hi>Who hath meaſured the heavens with his palm, and the earth with his fiſt? Is it not I?</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>Heaven is my throne, and the earth my footſtool; what houſe will ye build unto me? and what is the place of my reſt?</hi> Know that theirs is a vain hope. After this he ſaith again, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they who deſtroy this Temple, ſhall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves build it.</hi> It is done. For when they warred it was deſtroyed by the enemies; and the miniſters themſelves of thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall build it. Again he hath opened, How the <hi>City</hi> and people <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be delivered up. For the Scripture ſaith, <hi>And it ſhall be in the laſt days, That the Lord will deliver up the ſheep of the paſture, and their fence and their tower to deſtruction.</hi> And it is come to paſs as the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſpoken. Therefore we ſhall enquire whether there be a <hi>Temple</hi> of God. There is where he ſaith he would make and finiſh it. For it is written, <hi>It ſhall be when a week is finiſhed, that the Temple of God ſhall be built glorious in the name of the Lord.</hi> Therefore I find that there is a <hi>Temple.</hi> But how ſhall it be built in the name of the Lord? Learn. Before we believed God the dwelling of our heart was corrupt and weak as a <hi>Temple</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:99160:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
built truly by the hand; for the houſe was full of Idolatry, by Idolatry it was the houſe of devils, ſo that we did whatever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God. But it ſhall be built in the name of the <hi>Lord.</hi> Learn, that a glorious <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall be built: But how? Learn; we receiving remiſſion of ſins, and hoping in the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> were made anew, and created again as from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. So that in our houſe, that is, in us, God truly dwelleth. How? The word of his Faith, the calling of his Promiſe, the wiſdom of his judgements, the commands of his doctrine, he himſelf propheſying in us, he himſelf dwelling in us, opening to us the gates of the <hi>Temple,</hi> who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſervants of death, that is, opening that mouth which gives repentance to us, hath brought us into the incorruptible <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And he, who deſires to be ſaved, minds nothing but him dwelling in him, admires nothing but him ſpeaking in him, deſires to hear nothing but the words ſpoken from his mouth. <hi>This is the ſpiritual Temple built unto the Lord;</hi> ſo far as he would in power and ſimplicity manifeſt it unto us. My Soul hopeth with deſire, that I have omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing convenient for you, and conducing to Salvation. If I ſhould write unto you of

               <p>Let us now paſs over to another kind of knowledge and doctrine: There are <hi>two ways</hi> of <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> either of <hi>Light</hi> or of <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> and great is the difference of theſe two ways. Over one are appointed the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>light;</hi> Over the other the <hi>angels</hi> of <hi>Satan;</hi> over the one is the <hi>Lord from ages to ages;</hi> over the other the <hi>prince of the time of iniquity. The way of light is this;</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If a man would walk to the place deſigned, he will make haſte by his works. Therefore Knowledge is given to us that we may walk in it, which is this. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Maker. Thou ſhalt glorifie him who redeemed thee from death. Thou ſhalt be ſimple in heart; and being rich in the ſpirit, thou ſhalt not joyn thy ſelf with thoſe who walk in the way of death. Thou ſhalt hate to do that which is not pleaſing to God.

Thou ſhalt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt thy ſelf, but be of an humble mind. Thou ſhalt not aſſume glorie to thy ſelf. Thou ſhalt not take evil counſel against thy neighbour.

                  <hi>to thy ſoul. Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, nor fornication, nor buggerie. Thou ſhalt not refrain to correct the impurity of ſome by that word, which cometh from God; and when thou reprooveſt tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt not reſpect perſons. Thou ſhalt be meek and quiet, trembling at the words, which thou haſt heard. Thou ſhalt not remember evil things againſt thy brother. Thou ſhalt not be of a double and wavering ſoul, doubting whether thus or thus. Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord in vain. Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour above thy ſoul. Thou ſhalt not deſtroy the child by abortion, nor kill it when it is born. Thou ſhalt not take away thy hand from thy ſon, nor from thy daughter, but from their youth ſhalt teach them the fear of the Lord. Thou ſhalt not deſire thy neighbours goods, nor be a covetous perſon. Thou ſhalt not adhere in thy ſoul to proud perſons, but be numbred amongſt the juſt and humble. Thou ſhalt embrace temptations, when they happen, as good things. Thou ſhalt not be of a double mind, nor a double tongue; for a double tongue is the ſnare of death. Thou ſhalt be ſubject to the Lord, to Maſters, as to the type of God, in reverence and fear. Thou ſhalt not command thy maid or man-ſervant with bitterneſs;</hi>

For he came not to call men by their perſons, but thoſe whom his ſpirit prepared. Thou ſhalt communicate to thy neighbour in all things; and ſhalt not call any thing thine own; for if ye are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative in incorruptible things, how much more in corruptible. Thou ſhalt not be haſtie in tongue, for the mouth is the ſnare of death. Keep thy Soul as chaſte as thou canſt. Do not ſtretch forth thy hands to receive, and ſhut them when thou ſhouldſt give. Thou ſhalt love every man ſpeaking to thee the Word of the Lord as the apple of thine eye. Mind the day of judgement night and day. Seek out every day the perſons of holy men, and ſearching by the Word go forth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and meditate to ſave a ſoul by the Word. And thou ſhalt labour by thy hands for the redemption of thy ſins. Thou ſhalt not doubt to give, nor murmur when thou giveſt. Give to every one that asketh of thee, but know withal who is the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſer of the reward. Keep the things, which thou haſt received, neither adding to nor taking from them. Hate a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the end. Judge juſtly. Make no Schiſm.
