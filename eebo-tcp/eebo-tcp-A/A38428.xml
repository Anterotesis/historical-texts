            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58794:3"/>We cannot poſſibly conceive what your Parliament can do now to remedy any of theſe miſeries; they humbly ſeek your conſent in vaine; the offenders legally proceeded againſt are defended from them, yea thoſe that your Majeſty hath proclaimed ſuch; that is denied them which is yeelded to every the loweſt court of Iuſtice they deſire nothing more then your preſence and concurrence; and we know if humble Petitions or loyall affections would procure it there would not have been ſo long a diſtance.

            <p>But if all this were nothing, yet we know your Majeſty hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Act for the continuance of this Parliament: and ſure that Act muſt needs mean a Parliament with its power and authority, and not the meer name and carkaſſe of a Parliament; Its not only that they ſhall ſtay together in <hi>London,</hi> and doe nothing, or no more then another Cour<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if your Majeſty hath enacted the continuance of a real Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in its power, who ſeeth not that you have thereby joyned with them your Royall Authority, though not your perſon.</p>
            <p>Doth not your Majeſty in your Expreſſes oft Mention your ſelfe a part of the Parliament? and that the Head without which the Body cannot live? and is the Parliament valid without your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>

If not, how can they ceaſe to be your <hi>Parliament?</hi> neither let the fault be laid on part of them; for we all know the major part hath the Authority of the whole; and if it were the <hi>minor</hi> part, why did not, or doth the <hi>major</hi> over-vote them.</p>
            <p>And we beſeech your Majeſty, blame us not to think our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and all lyes at the ſtake while we look back by what a train Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery had been almoſt brought upon us by that party, and ſee them ſtill the chief in favour and when ſo many Papiſts <hi>Engliſh</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign have been in Arms againſt us, and know no one Papiſt in the Land that is not zealous in the cauſe.</p>

Your Majeſty know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there is a King and a Judge above you; before whom You muſt very ſhortly ſtand and give account of your Government; We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you in the preſence of that God, to think, and think ſeriouſly, and think again how ſad it will be, to have all this bloud charged on your ſoule; Can your Maj. think of this when you are dying? Can thoſe Councellours that have ſet you on then bring you as ſafely off? Your Maj. may deſpiſe wha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> judge us your enemies becauſe we tell you the truth, &amp; ſpeak as dying men in the ſorrow of our ſoules; but you cannot ſo put by divine juſtice, or quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at the laſt: As true as the Lord liveth, your Maj. will one day know that Blaſphemers and Flatterers are not your friends; but plain dealers, who do aſſure you, the ways you have taken, tend to the utter ruine and deſtruction of your Kingdome. And can your heart endure, or can your hands be ſtrong in the day the Lord will reckon with you for his people committed to your charge? O think of the low condition your Majeſty is now in, how your friends have left and forſaken you; and in ſtead of commanding three Kingdoms, confin'd to a petty Iſland. Suppoſe you now heard the bloud of your people already ſpilt, crying in your ears, &amp; ſaw the many thouſands yet living a life worſe then death, lying in their ſorrows at your feet, crying for pitty, help, O King help, or we loſe our liberties, laws, lives and Religion; help, that you<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>GOod Friend, We would have you know this Remonstrance was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only for his Majesties view, but becauſe plain dealing is ſeldome well taken, and his Majesty ſo guarded from the requests of his Subjests, we are therefore forced to ſubmit it to your common view, and to turn it out, in hope his Majeſty may light of one Copy, and ſeriouſly read it, and lay to heart the diſtreſſe of the miſerable: if you cenſure it as the work of ſome few diſcontented perſons, Know you it is the ſenſe of the North and North weſt of</hi> England, <hi>and if you will promiſe us freedome, and hopes of ſucceſſe, wee'l ſoon return it you with the hands of</hi> 1000000. <hi>If you condemn us for ſpeaking too plainly, know that miſery makes men forget good manners, and dying men uſe not complements; We are in the caſe of the Lepers,</hi> If we ſit ſtill we periſh; <hi>therefore, we will move in the way of hope, and go in to the King, though it be not according to law, and</hi> if we periſh we periſh. <hi>Yet know, we will come far ſhort of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of better perſons and times,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7. 1 King. 18.18. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
