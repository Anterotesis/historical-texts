            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T this notable season and great <hi>crisis</hi> both of Church and State, in which Parties are so high, Factions so restless, and Discontents so general, I know none so likely a means to resettle and confirm our shaking Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, as to disabuse the People, and to redeem their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings from a Captivity to those guides, who have Preached and Lectured them into these miseries and confusions. I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though it be <hi>true</hi> Piety alone that must save men, yet it is the <hi>shew</hi> and pretence of Piety that governs them. A <hi>maxim</hi> so veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the late transactions among us, that the great Basis and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of all the Villany that has been acted upon the stage of these miserable Kingdoms, has been to beget and fix in the People this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the great Design drove on by the Actors of it, was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb facs="tcp:62657:4"/>
of the Purity of Religion, and the Power of godliness. So that the People were brought at length to digest Civil War, the cutting of Throats, wresting away Estates, and the Murder and Banishment of Princes, so long as all this was called <hi>Reformation</hi> But since it is not imaginable, how men could quit the first infusions of honest educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and debauch the known Principles of Nature and Religion, so as not at first to tremble and start at these Villanies, it follows that they must needs have been insensibly wrought up to them by some predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Perswasion, that by degrees lessened, and at length totally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued those preconceived Dictates of Nature and Religion to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with such Practices: And this was no other than a blind and Furious Opinion of the extraordinary <hi>Piety</hi> of those Teachers, who pretending more intimate acquaintance with God, and immediate pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session by his Spirit, as Plenipotentiary Commissioners, and Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors from Almighty God, animated the People to the late Rebellion. And still they endeavour to captivate their Pity, by a bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent insinuation of these two things, <hi>That they are the People of God,</hi> and <hi>That they are persecuted.</hi> For experience shews that the Opinion of Persecution naturally moves men to Pity, and Pity presently turns into Love, and whom men love, they are easily brought to defend. But I doubt not to any unprejudiced Reader so to divest them of these pretences, and stripping them of their sheeps cloathing to represent them as naked as Truth, &amp; as deformed as Error &amp; Seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the first of these, <hi>Their being the People of God.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether true Piety is consistent with the known abetment of <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> directly contrary to the law of Nature, and the word of God: and then whether the Preaching taking up Arms, and raising a War against our Lawfull Prince, be not a sin deeply dyed
<pb facs="tcp:62657:4"/>
with both these Qualifications. That the latter of these is undeniable, and the former justly chargeable upon them, let the ensuing System of <hi>Principles</hi> speak, which they vented from the Pulpit, and their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Commented upon by all the hideous massacres since acted by them in the strength of those <hi>Doctrines</hi> and assertions. I say, let men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially read them over and see, Whether that Religion can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pure,</hi> that is so far from <hi>Peaceable.</hi> And for a further Test of their Piety; I demand Whether an <hi>Oath</hi> be not the most sacred and dreadfull Obligation that can be fastned upon the Conscience of man: and whether their Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> were not such an one? upon which Concessions, I demand further, what strain of Piety could warrant these Ministers to send their Congregations (as the chief of them did) with full discharge from the Bonds of that Oath, to wage war against their King? what Prerogative in Religion could autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise them to obtrude an Oath and Covenant contradictory to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Oaths, upon those Consciences, that groaned with horror and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy under the sense of their former Obligations? Till they can here either deny the matter of Fact, which has been writ in Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of bloud legible to all the World; or can reconcile these matters of Fact to Christianity, I demand of them in the presence of <hi>God</hi> and man, what account they will give before the great Tribunal of God for having with so much solemnity of Prayer, shew of Piety; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Zeal, deceived the People into these execrable practices, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to stink the <hi>Protestant</hi> name out of the World; and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the clear light of Reason, and of the Word, can leave to those who resigned themselves up to be deceived by them? But as the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being once broken up, easily lyes open to any after Breach: So they having deflowred it with the first perjury of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> stuck
<pb facs="tcp:62657:5"/>
not much at the <hi>Engagement,</hi> a Promise as contradictory to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the Covenant it self had been to their Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Canonical obedience:</hi> and lastly their recognising and doing homage to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who had setled himself with the Power, though not the Title of <hi>King,</hi> and with an House of <hi>Lords,</hi> seemed no less to throw off, and contradict their Engagement. We see here the compass of their Religious swallow. All oaths could down with them, but none hold them: out of all which they could with the greatest facility find a way to creep forth, and <hi>interpret away</hi> the obligation of an Oath, as easily, as if it were an Act of Parliament. But the only thing these thorough-paced swearers at length stick at, is the <hi>Subscription</hi> lately required by Law, made and enacted by Parliament, and confirmed by the Royal as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that is, by all the legislative Power this Nation owns. This they cannot subscribe to: why? because they cannot renounce an Oath imposed by part of a Rebell Parliament, without, and against the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al assent, and by which they swore off all former lawfull Oaths, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves to prosecute that Rebellious War. This they will not, they cannot renounce; and therefore desire only for a while to be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with,</hi> and <hi>Indulged,</hi> till they come to be in a capacity once more to put it in Execution. How far Persons owning such an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ion, and venting such maxims and <hi>Doctrines</hi> as are here faithfully and truely represented out of their <hi>printed Sermons,</hi> are like to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or perhaps at all to comport with, the Peace of the Kingdom, is left to the serious Consideration of those, with whom the preservation of that Peace is entrusted, &amp; whose Prudence being alarm d with such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>fire-balls,</hi> will (we hope) begin to look about, &amp; to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Conscience &amp; Contempt.</hi> If any should now plead their being instrumental to the reduction of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> for their vindication from
<pb facs="tcp:62657:5"/>
the charge of these assertions, too notorious to be denyed, and too impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be defended; though I could answer, that I am not at all behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> for setting that leg, which he himself first put out of joynt: yet I desire them to remember that they never attempted the Restauration of his Majesty, till they were visibly in the very jaws of the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> who were then seizing upon their Tythes and Churches, the last morsell of the spiritual Revenue; so that it is shrewdly to be suspected, that had not the Tythe-pig cryed lowder in their ears, than either their <hi>Conscience,</hi> or the <hi>word</hi> of God, they had never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened to attempt that, which since it has been effected, so many of them have not obscurely repented of. And so much may suffice to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their Pretences to <hi>Piety,</hi> and the power of Godliness. To their next plea, <hi>that they are now persecuted,</hi> I shall only make this reply; That I desire the World to take notice, that those Persons, who turned almost all out of their livings, that adhered to their lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; who sent suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, with their Wives and Families a begging, as durst not deflower their Consciences with down-right Perjury; and having sworn <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> to the most Reformed Church in the World, durst not by a contrary Oath, swear and endeavour its extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. Those also who procured that murdering <hi>Order</hi> from a bloudy Tyrant and Usurper, that every <hi>Episcopal</hi> Divine should not only be uncapable of a Benefice, but also disabled to exercise any act of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Function, as Preaching, Baptizing, or the like, nor yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to get some little subsistence by teaching School: no, nor lastly to live in any Gentlemans house, who out of Pity might take him in to keep him from Starving. All which are such unheard-of Instances of barbarous Tyranny, that the Spight of the Heathen <hi>Neros, Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, Julians,</hi> (all circumstances considered) was much inferiour to
<pb facs="tcp:62657:6"/>
them. Now, I say, I desire the World to take notice, that those who were partly the Authors, partly the Procurers of these hideous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morseless Actions, are those poor, gentle, suffering Lambs of Christ that now bleat out <hi>Persecution.</hi> Having thus answered their pleas, or rather their Noise, I shall in a word or two give an account of the following book. It presents us first with a short Collection of the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the great Leaders and Abetters of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Reformation, of their pious and peaceable <hi>maxims,</hi> which like razors set with oyl, cut the throat of <hi>Majesty</hi> with so keen a smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and then to bring up the rear of this spiritual Brigade, and withall, to shew further, that the cause of our <hi>Church</hi> is so united to that of the <hi>Crown,</hi> that the same who malign one, strike as boldly at the other, I have thought fit to bring the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Hobbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> upon the same Stage, as venting Doctrines no less pernicious to the Civil, than to the Ecclesiastical State. For a testimony of which, I have here given a Taste of each of them: of the first, out of Mr. <hi>White:</hi> of the second, out of the Author of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and great Propagator of the Kingdom of Darkness. I selected the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> as being the most Compendious and effectual way of Probation. For if He who writes, and pretends enmity against the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> for being Disturbers of the Peace of States and Kingdoms, and underminers of the Prerogative of Kings, and so by this, catches at the reputation of being moderate; I say, if this Person shall yet be found a pestilent assertor of such <hi>maxims</hi> as eat out the Rights and Titles of all lawfull Princes, then let men take an estimate of their known Treasons and King-killing Doctrines, from the Poyson and Viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their very moderation. And therefore I earnestly entreat the Reader diligently to peruse that Paragraph that exhibits to him
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62657:6"/>
the collection of Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Principles. I have this now in the last place to add, that the Reader must not here expect a full rehersal of thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> mens Doctrines, but only a Taste, or Specimen. He that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the raking of Dunghils longer than I can, let him have recourse to their Writings, let him lanch out into the Ocean of the Presbyterian Pamphlets and Sermons, an Ocean in which the Papists may see the face of their disloyal Doctrines, as in a Glass, and in which the Leviathan himself may sport, and take his pastime.</p>
            <p>There seems to be a more than ordinary Significance in that Saying of the Prophet, <hi>that Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft,</hi> and that, I conceive, not only for its equal malignity, but also for its peculiar Analogy and cognation: for if we reflect upon the late Instances of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Selves, we shall find that the People could never be brought to Rebell, till their Preachers had first Bewitched them.

            <p>p. 9. That all those that fought under the Kings banner, against this Parliament, fought themselves into slavery, and did endeavour by all bloudy and treacherous waies to subvert Religion and Liberties.</p>
            <p>p. 12. That the King, that should have been a head of gold, was an iron head to crush its own body in pieces.</p>
            <p>p. 18. Those that made their peace with him at <hi>Oxford</hi> (by returning to their Loyaltie,) were <hi>Judasses</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and it were just with God to give them their portion with <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>p. 13. Those that ingaged in this Cause, and in the Covenant (which was an oath for their goods,) were unjustly charged with Rebellion.</p>
            <p>p. 38. That it was Gods cause, and it shall prevail at last.</p>
            <p>p. 29. That it is commendable to fight for Peace and Reformation, against the Kings command.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have heard a worthy Gentleman of the House of Commons, it is desired by this grave and Reverend <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> that <hi>three</hi> of the Ministers of this <hi>Assembly</hi> should likewise speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you concerning this <hi>great</hi> business, and notwithstanding my indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body, being required by them, though that Gentleman of the House of Commons hath spoken so abundantly to the purpose, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I am here come to speak something, the rather to declare my willingness to appear in this Cause, that is every way so just, and every way so honest, and so good, that I may truly say, as the Martyr did, <hi>that if I had as many lives, as I have hairs on my head, I would be willing to sacrifize all these lives in this Cause;</hi> You know the story of <hi>Craesus,</hi> that though he never spake in his life, yet when he saw his Father ready to be killed, it untyed the strings of his tongue, and then he cryed out, that they would not kill his Father; you are not ignorant that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> lye a dying, and though I never appeared in this place, yet I bless God that hath given me that health, this day, to speak something in this Cause, for the reviving of the dying condition of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> It is such <hi>a Cause</hi> as is able to make a very Infant eloquenr, and a dumb man to speak that never spake in all his lise; The matter I am desired to speak to, is, concerning the <hi>Contribution,</hi> to perswade you to be liberal towards the bringing in of the <hi>Scots,</hi> to help us in this our great necessity; The truth is, it is a great shame that <hi>England</hi> should stand in need of another Nation, to help it to preserve its Religion and Liberties: That <hi>England,</hi> that hath been enriched with the Gospel of Peace, and the peace of the Gospel for so many years; that <hi>England,</hi> that hath been blessed with so many rare Ministers of God, so many precious, and powerful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that have preached the Word of God in season and out of season; that <hi>England,</hi> that hath professed the Gospel with so much power and purity; that <hi>England</hi> should stand in need of the help of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for to preserve that Gospel that they have professed so many years; I confess to me it seems a very strange Prodigie, and a strange wonder; but it hath pleased Almighty God for the sins of <hi>England,</hi> for our great unthankfulness, and for our unthankfulness under these means,

            <p>What would the <hi>Kings party</hi> do, if they could engage another Nation to their help? 21000. if they could engage them to our ruine, what would they not do?

               </gap>y carried themselves, and when they had done their work, how willingly they went away without doing any hurt, and I doubt not of the same faithfulness, nay, you ought all to believe, that they will likewise, when they have done the work they are calle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I am assured that the great hope at <hi>Oxford</hi> is, that they will never prevail for the getting of Money for to bring them in; and if they once see the matter of Money effected, and if they once hear of the <hi>Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I foresee there are many <hi>Objections</hi> that may be brought to hinder this work, many mountains of opposition that will lie in the way: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that the <hi>Malignants</hi> will buz many things in your ears, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to put some great rub in the way, to hinder the effecting of this work but I hope, the love you have to God, and to your Religion, and to the Gospel, and to your wives and children, will sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>llow down all these objections, and conquer them all; Ile name some <hi>few</hi> objections, and give you some short answer.</p>
            <p>Some it may be, will put you in mind, to call in question the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of contributing towards the bringing in of the <hi>Scots</hi> to this Nation; But for this, Ile give you an easie answer, Certainly Gentlemen, it is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Parlament to call in our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their help, as it is lawful for me, when my <hi>house</hi> is on fire, and not able to quench it my self, to call in my neighbour to quench my house, that is ready to burn down; The Kingdom is all on fire, we are not able with that speed to quench it, as we wish, we call in our brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> to help us to quench the flames that are kindled among us; It is as lawful as it is for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62657:10"/>
the <hi>Master</hi> and Mariners of a <hi>Ship,</hi> when it is ready to sink through a mighty Tempest, to call in other Mariners to help to keep the Ship from sinking; It is the condition of our Kingdom now, it is ready to sink, and it is our desire that our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> would come in to our aid, to keep it from sinking.</p>
            <p>Others it may be will object and say to you, it is <hi>rebellion,</hi> especially <hi>to call in another Nation</hi> to your help. But I beseech you give me leave to put you in mind, that when the <hi>Scots</hi> came last into <hi>England,</hi> there was a <hi>Proclamation</hi> out against them, wherein they were called Rebels, and there were prayers to be said in our Churches (as you well remember) in which we were to pray against them as Rebels, and there was Money likewise contributed then, for to hinder their coming in, and to raise an Army to drive them out of the Kingdom, and I doubt not but you may remember, all the ill-affected did contribute Money to keep them out of this Kingdom, and from tarrying in; but it pleased Almighty God through his great mercy, so to change and alter the state of things, that within a little while, the Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> even by Act of Parlament, they were proclamed and made the true and Loyal Subjects of the King, and in those Churches in which they were prayed against as Rebels, even in those very Churches, they were pronounced the good Subjects of the King; this I doubt not but you remember, and I doubt not, but through the mercy of God, the Lord raising up our hearts, I doubt not but the same effect will come of their <hi>second</hi> coming into this Kingdom; and they that now tell you they are Rebels, and you do an act of Rebellion, in the contribution to the bringing of them in, I doubt not but you shall see an <hi>Act of Parlament</hi> to call them his <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> (wherein I hope our <hi>King</hi> will concur with his Parlament) and likewise <hi>Prayers</hi> made, nay, a day of <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> as was after their first coming, a day of Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the mercy of God, in stirring up their hearts to be willing to come unto our help.</p>
            <p>But it may be some others will object and say, why should <hi>we</hi> that are <hi>Ministers,</hi> engage our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lves so much in this business? to see a <hi>Reverend Assembly</hi> of grave Ministers to appear here in so great an Assembly. This it may be, will be a mighty objection to some, but I beseech you give me leave to give you a short answer; did I not think that that shall be said this day, would mightily conduce to peace, for my part, I would not have been the <hi>mouth</hi> of the Assembly; did I think any other way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a solid and a setled peace, a Religious peace, I that am a Minister of peace, an Ambassador of peace, I would not have been a <hi>Trumpeter</hi> to this business this day: the truth is, if you would have peace with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,

a Peace with slavery; if you would have a <hi>Judas</hi> peace, or a <hi>Joab</hi> his peace, you know the Story, <hi>he kiss'd</hi> Amasa, <hi>and then killed him;</hi> if you would have a peace that may bring <hi>a massacre</hi> with it, <hi>a French peace,</hi> if you would have such a peace, it may be had easily; but if you would have a peace that may continue the Gospel among you, and may bring in a Reformation, such as all the godly in the Kingdom do desire, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under this, and am confident that such a peace cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contribution towards the bringing in of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for the promoting of this peace, this blessed peace, that we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared here this day: and me-thinks (Gentlemen) the very sight of these worthy <hi>Divines,</hi> methinks so many Divines, so many Orators, so many silent Orators to plead with you, to be willing to engage your selves to the utmost to help forward the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> to come to our help. And likewise I would put you in mind of the 10 <hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> there you shall read that <hi>there were two silver Trumpets;</hi> and as there were <hi>Priests</hi> appointed for the <hi>convocation of their Assemblies,</hi> so there were <hi>Priests</hi> to sound <hi>the silver Trumpets</hi> to proclame the War. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the 20 <hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> you shall finde there, that when the children of <hi>Israel</hi> would. go out to War, <hi>the sons of Levi,</hi> one of the <hi>Priests,</hi> was to make <hi>a speech</hi> to encourage them. And certainly, if this were the way of God in the Old Testament, certainly much more in such a Cause as this, in which Cause Religion is so intwin'd, and indeed so interlac'd, that Religion and this Cause, they are like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his twins, they must live and dye together. And (Gentlemen) if <hi>Religion</hi> were not concerned in this Cause, and mightily concerned; and if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion did not live and dye with it, we had not appeared this day; And I hope this will be a sufficient answer unto this Objection.</p>
            <p>But there is another <hi>Objection</hi> which I will answer, and then briefly give leave to my other Reverend Brethren, that likewise are prepared to speak here. The great Objection of all is this, <hi>that the City is already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,</hi> and so much money hath been lent already, that there is no hope of lending any more; this is the grand Objection. But truly (Gentlemen) for my part, this is one of the chief Arguments I have to perswade you to lend a little more, because you have lent so much: give me leave to put you in mind of that Story, in the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. the Story of King <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O (saith he) <hi>I have not yet shed my blood for Jesus Christ;</hi> Jesus Christ he emptied himself of his Divinity, to make us rich, he became poor, and shed his blood for you; You have not yet made your selves so poor as Jesus Christ was, that had no house to lodge in, and he did all this for your sakes; You have not yet shed your blood for the Cause of Christ; We read that <hi>Moses</hi> was willing to be <hi>blotted out of the book of life,</hi> for the <hi>Cause</hi> of God; and we read of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Religion hath produced all the wealth you have, all your wealth is but the child of Religion; we have a saying, <hi>Religio peperit divitias, &amp; divitiae devorarunt matrem;</hi> Religion hath begot wealth, and the Daughter hath devoured the Mother; <hi>&amp; filia devoravit matrem;</hi> but give me leave, and I hope (through Gods blessing) you will invert this saying, Religion hath got you all the wealth you have, you Gentlemen, and I hope the Daughter now will preserve the Mother; I hope Riches will preserve Religion, and not destroy Religion. A famous example of <hi>Polanus No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> that when he had given all that he had away, and being asked, why he would give so much to the poor? he gave this answer, <hi>Ut levius ascenderem scalam Jacobi,</hi> that I might the easier get up <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder; And let me assure you, <hi>in the word of a Minister, the contributing to this Cause for Gods sake,</hi> and for the glory of God, and for the peace of the Gospel, (I say) <hi>will be a means to make you the sooner ascend up</hi> Jacobs <hi>Ladder;</hi> not for the giving of the money, but for the evidence of your Faith, through the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ, by your giving of the money; And certainly that man will never get up <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, that hath the rust of his money to bear witness against him, at the day of

that <hi>Methushelah</hi> had forsaken his righteousness, all he had done before, had been quite forgotten; but God hath made a promise, never to forsake his Children, and that grace he hath begun in them, he will finish, and I doubt not but that God, that hath put it into your hearts to be so liberal already, and do so much in this Cause, and to be so cordial, and so real, and to exceed àll other parts of the Kingdom, I hope that same God will now finish that good work he hath begun, and will crown all his Graces in you, with the Grace of Perseverance; and that God that hath been the Author of all the good you have done, I doubt not but that God will be the finisher: and I beseech God to give a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to that hath been spoken.</p>

            <p n="3">III. <hi>He calls it</hi> a false supposition, 1. That the Soveraign power was onely in the King, and so that it was an absolute Monarchy. 2. That the Parlament had but onely the proposing of Laws, and that they were Enacted onely by the Kings Authority upon their request. 3. That the power of Arms and of War and Peace was in the King alone. And therefore (<hi>saith he</hi>) those that argue from these false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, conclude that the Parlament being Subjects, may not take up Arms without him, and that it is Rebellion to resist him; and most of this they gather from the Oath of Supremacy, and from the Parlaments calling of themselves his Subjects; but their grounds (<hi>saith he</hi>) are sandy, and their superstructure false. <hi>Pag. 459, &amp; 460.</hi>

he endeavours to justisie the late Rebellion, and his own more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary activeness in it. For,</hi>

            <p n="4">IV. Where the Soveraignty (<hi>saith he</hi>) is distributed into several hands (as the Kings and Parlaments) and the King invades the others part, they may lawfully defend their own by war, and the Subject lawfully assist them, yea though the power of the Militia be expresly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the King, unless it be also exprest that it shall not be in the other. <hi>Thes.</hi> 363.</p>
            <p>The conclusion (<hi>saith he</hi>) needs no proof, because Soveraignty, as such, hath the power of Arms and of the Laws themselves. The Law that saith the King shall have the <hi>Militia,</hi> supposeth it to be against Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not against the Common-wealth, nor them that have part of the Soveraignty with him. To resist him here is not to resist power, but usurpation and private will; in such a case the Parlament is no more to be resisted than he. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. If the King raise War against such a Parlament, upon their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the dangers of the Common-wealth, the people are to take it as raised against the Common-wealth. <hi>Thes.</hi> 358.</p>
            <p>And in that case (saith he) the King may not only be resisted, but ceaseth to be a King, and entreth into a state of War with the people. <hi>Thes.</hi> 368.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Again, if a Prince that hath not the whole Soveraignty be conquered by a Senate that hath the other part, and that in a just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive War, that Senate cannot assume the whole Soveraignty, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that government in <hi>specie</hi> to remain, and therefore another King must be chosen, if the former be incapable, (<hi>Thes.</hi> 374.) <hi>as he tells us, he is,</hi> by ceasing to be King, <hi>in the immediately precedent</hi> Thes.</p>

Yea, though they had been never so much in fault, and though they had been the beginners of the VVar, for he tells us in plain and express terms,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That if he had known the Parlament had been the beginners of the War and in most fault, yet the ruine of the Trustees and Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, and so of all the security of the Nation being a punishment great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any faults of theirs against the King could deserve from him, their faults could not disoblige him (<hi>meaning himself</hi>) from defending the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. <hi>Pag.</hi> 480.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that he might do this lawfully, and with a good Conscience, he seems to be so confident, that in his Preface, he makes as it were a challenge, saying, that</hi> if any man can prove that the King was the highest power in the time of those Divisions, and that he had power to make that war which he made, he will offer his head to Justice as a Rebel.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. <hi>Finally Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us, Pag.</hi> 486. That having often search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his heart, whether he did lawfully engage into the War or not, and whether he did lawfully encourage so many thousands to it; he tells us, I say, that the issue of all his search was but this,—That he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet see that he was mistaken in the main cause, nor dares he repent of it, nor forbear doing the same, if it were to do again in the same state of things. <hi>He tells us indeed in the same place,</hi> that if he could be convinced he had sinned in this matter, he would as gladly make a publick recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he would eat or drink: <hi>which seeing he hath not yet done, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident he is still of the same mind, and consequently would upon the same oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62657:16"/>
do the same things,</hi> viz. <hi>sight, and encourage as many thousands as he could to fight against the King, for any thing that calls it self, or which he is pleased to call</hi> a full and Free Parlament: <hi>as likewise that he would own and submit to any Usurper of the Soveraignty</hi> as set up by God, <hi>although he came to it by the murder of his Master, and by trampling upon the Parlament.</hi> Lastly, <hi>That he would hinder as much as possibly he could the restoring of the rightful Heir unto the Crown.

            <p>HE propounds this Quaere, Wherein lyes the Power which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the mouth of these Babes? His answer is, There are <hi>sive</hi> things, which all are the fruit of the mouth, &amp; by them the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e Babes have overcome the enemy and the avenger, 1. Preaching, 2. Confessing or Professing, The Name, Truth and cause of God, and his Christ. 3. Praising, Singing out Praise, &amp;c. 4. Praying, and 5. Covenanting. Then he brings in an Objection, If these be all the weapons and strength whereby the Saints do overcome, why do you use any other means to overcome your enemies? Why rest you not contented with this? either these are not all, or you are not Christians, nor true to your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;—Time was when <hi>Preces</hi> and <hi>Lachrymae,</hi> Prayers and Tears, were all the weapons which the Church did use; but now when you have spoke all these things of the power of Preaching, and Praying, and Consessing, and Covenanting, you are glad to betake your selves to Arms, to see what they will do, to help those out, whence it's apparent, you dare not rest in these as sufficient helps.

               </gap> to declare to all that shall read these lines, what I have done to manifest my repentance, and let Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Burton</hi> then judge whether it be a repentance to be repented of, or no.</p>
            <p>First, I went to <hi>Bury,</hi> and there made in a Sermon, a <hi>recantation, and retraction</hi> of what I had done, in the hearing of thousands. And this I did before the times turned against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> not out of discontent, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was disappointed of my expected preferment at Court.</p>
            <p>Secondly, After my coming to <hi>London</hi> at the beginning of this <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> I was one of those that did joyn in making <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> which was the first deadly blow to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of late years.</p>
            <p>

I was the first that openly before a <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Parlament</hi> did defend that our <hi>Bishops</hi> were not onely not an <hi>Order</hi> distinct from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but that in Scripture a <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were all one. I blush to speak of these things, but the judicious Reader will consider how I am provoked to it, and will pardon me.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> let M. <hi>Burton</hi> know, that at a meeting at my house, it was resolved by above a hundred Ministers, after a long debate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers weighty considerations, that all that could in their judgements submit to the reading of some part of it, should be intreated for a while to continue so to do. To this our dissenting Brethren, then present did agree, and one of them made a speech to manifest his concordance. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to give any man satisfaction for the <hi>late</hi> laying of it down.</p>

            <p>Their Liberties are setled, why they, though on the other side of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> they are not therein satisfied, to sit still, but are willing to come themselves, and come into the brunt, and hazard themselves, for the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>What warrant have we to take up Arms to maintain Religion? that is not at present to be discussed, but onely this, to satisfie and stop all their mouths with one word: Thus far none can deny it, but it is lawful to take up arms, to maintain that Civil right we have to our Religion, and this we do; For we have not onely a right to our Religion, by the Law of God, but we have a Civil right to this our Religion, that other Christians have not had.</p>
            <p>If it shall be said, I, but a great deal is done, but to little purpose all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62657:31"/>
this while; O (my brethren) say not so, it is an unthankful voyce, this, for much hath been done, there hath been a check given to the adversary, the stream of tyranny and slavery it hath been stopped, your lives have all this while been preserved by what hath been done.</p>
            <p>Little cause have we to be discouraged, for those we have to deal with, their spirits are base and vile; why should we fear those uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised <hi>Philistines?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you say, Well, but were it not better we bent all our forces to some Accommodation? To that we answer you thus: You have to deal not onely with his Majesty, but with a Popish party that are about him, and what security you can ever have of your peace, (as was worthily said before) except the Scotish Nation comes in for to fasten it, it is easie for any one to judge. I will tell you but one story about that, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is suitable unto you, I will therefore relate it here: It is a Story that I find in the Chronicles, that in the days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, King <hi>Edward</hi> sends to this City for assistance against the Lords; and the Lords send to the City for their assistance likewise; and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Councel was called, (I suppose in this place,) and there stands up, as the story saith, a wise discreet Citizen, in the Common-Councel, and makes this speech unto them; First, he acknowledges that the cause was right for the Lords, for the Kingdom, though it were against the will of the King, because the King would not then put in execution those Laws that should be, but hindered them, but yet (saith he) let me remind you of that that I have read in <hi>Fabians</hi> Chronicle, (it was one <hi>George Stadley</hi> that stood up, let me remind you of that) when there was a fight between the Lords and the King, the <hi>Lords</hi> send for assistance to the City, the City granted their assistance, the Lords prevailed, the King was taken, and his Son a Prisoner; afterwards they were both released upon Composition, and amongst other things, this was one, that howsoever the City should be preserved, that the City should suffer nothing for what they had done; and this Composition was confirmed by Act of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but (saith this Citizen) what came of it? did the King forgive? No, nor forget, for afterwards all our Liberties were taken away, strangers were set over us, for our Heads and Governours; the bodies and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the Citizens were given away, and one misery followed after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and so we were most miserably persecuted; and here was their Accommodation.</p>
            <p>Have not many of you spent your blood in this Cause, yea, how many young ones in this City have lost their blood? Me-thinks a spirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation should rise in you, to vindicate the loss of the blood of your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62657:32"/>
Servants and Children, many precious ones, that might have lived many years, to have done good service for the Lord.</p>
            <p>Know there shall come a day, wherein you shall be calling and crying to God for mercy; the success of this evenings work will be recorded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that day, when you shall cry for mercy.</p>

            <p>THe Oath of Allegiance, as you know, did bind all men as Subjects in Law, to be true and faithful to the Kings Person, to his Heirs and Successors, as they were invested with the authority which the Law did give them: nor was it ever meant by the Parlament which Enacted the Oath of Allegiance, that any should be absolutely bound to the King and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62657:32"/>
his Heirs, as they were men, to be true and faithful to their Personal Wills; but onely to them and their Wills, as they had a Legal stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that is, to the Authority conferred upon them by the consent of the People, which was testified in and under a Law; whereunto the King and his Heirs were bound for the Kingdoms good by Oath. So that the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of King and Subjects are mutual, and must needs stand and fall together, according as the condition by which they are begotten is kept or broken; which is nothing else but the Law, according to which he and his Subjects agree, that he shall be their King, and they shall be his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For as you were sworn to the King, so he was sworn to you; as you were bound to be faithful to him, so he was bound to be faithful to his trust; nor is he your Liege further than he is faithful thereunto. If then he be found unfaithful to his trust, you are <hi>ipso facto</hi> absolved from your Allegiance unto him; and if, according to Law, he receives not his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, you are not in Law his Subjects at all. Now the just and natural foundation of all Laws, is the Reason of the Body of every Nation in their Parlament, which hath the sole Right to propose and chuse the Laws by which they will be Ruled. Where it hath been (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) a perpetual custom in this Nation, for the Commons at all times, to ask and propose the making of Laws; and for the Lords and King to give their consent thereunto: The Lords as the <hi>Judges</hi> in cases of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and the King as the Executor and publick Trustee for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the common good and wealth thereby; for in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there is a Common-wealth, as the intrinsical substance of the Being thereof; for which all things are to be done by King and Lords, as the publick servants thereof; and Ministers not Masters of State therein. If the King then should set himself wilfully to be above this Reason of the Nation, which is the onely Original of the Law, and refuse obstinately the Laws which they shall chuse to be setled, he puts himself <hi>ipso facto,</hi> out of the capacity of being a King any more unto them; and if this can be made out, to have been the way wherein the late King set himself, and that it was the design of the House of Lords, to uphold and enable him to follow that way, it is evident, that so far as he did by that means actually un-King himself, as to this Nation, so far also they that assisted him in that design, did un-Lord themselves in the State thereof; and if this was the guilt of the House of Lords, by other practices and proceedings more than by an indifferencie and compliance with the <hi>Hamiltonian</hi> invasion, to help the King to such a power, I know not what to answer for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62657:33"/>
to the sense of the Oath of Allegiance, but altogether agreeable thereunto. What then the meaning of that Article is, must needs also be the true sense of the Oath of Allegiance. That Article then doth oblige you, to preserve the Right and Privileges of the Parlament, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdom in your Calling, absolutely and without any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but as for the Kings person and Authority, it doth oblige you onely thereunto, conditionally, and with a limitation; <hi>Namely, in the preservation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties of this Kingdom.</hi> If then the King did not give to the Representatives of the Nation that assurance which was satisfactory and necessary that their Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties should be preserved, none of his Subjects were bound either by their Allegiance or Covenant, to defend his person and the Authority which was conferred upon him. The Oath of Allegiance therefore was bottomed upon the Laws, which the Representatives of the Nation in Parlament had chosen to be observed concerning their Religion, and the Liberties of the Kingdom; which he refractorily either casting off, or seeming to yield unto, in such a way that no trust could be given him, that he would keep what he yielded unto; the Parlament did actually lay him aside, and voted, that no more Addresses should be made unto him, from which time forward he was no more an object of your Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, but to be look'd upon as a Private man: and your Oath by which you were engaged to be true and faithful to the Law, by which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberty of the Kingdom was to be preserved, did still remain in force: which if it may be the true substantial sense of the present Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you think is contradictory to this Oath and to the National Covenant, then you are to look well to it, that you be not mistaken; for to an indifferent eye, it may be thought so far from being opposite to the true sense of either, that it may be rather a confirmation of the ground, for which both the Oath of Allegiance, and the third Article of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant was then binding.</p>
            <p>And then also this I am confident of, to be able to let you see further, that although you may think that the effect of this Engagement is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially contrary to some intention which you had in the third Article of the Covenant; yet that by the Act of the Engagement, you are so far from breaking your Covenant, that except you take it, and observe it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, you will not onely materially, but formally break that very Article of the Covenant, for which you scruple the taking of the Engagement.</p>

            <p>Now this is that which the Engagement doth directly also require; for which cause I say, that by vertue of this very promise, you are bound to take the present Engagement; and if you take it not, that you make your self a transgressor of that very Article which you pretend to keep; for if you refuse to be true and faithful to the Common-wealth as it is now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, you do what in you lyeth to make the remaining Knights of Parlament, and the beginnings of our settlement void; which though at first it was not intended to be without a King, yet it was cleerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed in the Article it self, as possible to be without him, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that although he should not be, yet that the Common-wealth by the Rights of Parlament and the Liberties of the Nation should be preserved, which is all that now is sought for by the Engagement.</p>
            <p>Where you may take notice, that although you and I as private men, ought not to make our selves judges of the rights which superiors pretend to have, in and to their places; yet that they are not without a Judicature over them in those places, for the subordinate Officers belonging to a State, are bound to judge of the Rights of those that are over them; both by which they stand in their places of Supremacy, and by which they proceed in their actings toward Subjects, lest they be made the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Arbitrary power and tyranny, and then also the law-making power, which in all Nations resides by the Law of Nature in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Representatives of the whole body of the people (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be made up of the heads of families, or of chosen Deputies, who are intrusted with a delegated power from all the rest) doth make or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make Rights, in all places and persons within it self, as it from time to time doth see cause.</p>

            <head>Of the dispossession of a Supreme former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of his Right, by Mr. <hi>White</hi> a Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist, pag. 132. &amp;c. in His Grounds of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>NOw, our Question supposeth the Governour not to have come to that extremity: but, either to have been good or innocent: or that it is doubtful whether his excesses deserved expulsion: or, at least, if they did deserve it of themselves, yet the circumstances were not fitting for it; but the expulsion hapned either by the invasion of a stranger, or the ambition of a Subject, or some popular headless tumult; for, these three ways a Magistrate comes, forcibly and unjustly, to be outed of his power.</p>
            <p>And first, if the Magistrate have truly deserved to be dispossessed; or it be rationally doubted that he hath deserved it, and he be actually out of possession: In the former case it is certain, the Subject hath no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hazard for his restitution, but rather to hinder it: For, since it is the common good that both the Magistrate and the Subject are to aim at; and clearly, out of what is expressed, it is the common harm, to admit again of such a Magistrate; every one, to his power, is bound to resist him.</p>
            <p>The next case is, if he be innocent and wrongfully depos'd, nay let us add, One who had governed well and deserved much of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: yet he is totally dispossess'd; and so, that, it is plain, in these circumstances, it were better for the common good to stay as they are, than to venture the restoring him, because of the publick hazard. It is clear, in this case, there is comparison between the general good of the Common-wealth, on the one side, and the particular of this man or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily on the other. Let us, then, put the case on his part; and see, If he be generous, if he hath setled in his heart that every single man ought to prefer the Common Interest before his particular safety, profit, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; if he be fit for a Governour, that is, one that is to espouse the common good as his own individual; what he will, in honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, resolve: whether he be not obliged absolutely to renounce all right and claim to Government; and, if he does not, he be not worse than an Infidel: For, if he that hath no care of his Domesticks, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted so; with how much more reason, he that is ready to plunge a whole Nation in blood, for his own Interest?</p>
            <p>Let us cast the accounts on the other side; and see, that the Subjects
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62657:34"/>
aim ought to be the publique peace, and quiet enjoyment of their lives and interests: It will appear that, if he be bound to renounce his claim, they cannot be oblig'd to maintain it: and besides, that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blind, if, where the whole concernments of themselves, their wives and children, lie at the stake, they will venture all for an aereal fancy, without regard to the <hi>end</hi> of Government, publick peace; meerly for the <hi>means,</hi> this mans Government, without whom the End may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. It cannot, therefore, be rational on either side, for a dispossess'd Governour to be restor'd with hazard.</p>
            <p>But, the capital in this matter is, that truly there is no justice on either the Magistrates or Peoples side, to bind to the restoring him: both these depending on the promise made, and the force of the promise being none, since the ground of it is changed. For, the substance of the promise made to a Magistrate, is, To obey him as a Magistrate, that is, as far as is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the Common-wealth and peace; he being nothing but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the common good: Now, take away that fitness for the Common-wealth, and that which gave strength to the promise is gone, and the promise it self is no more a promise, nor can any obligation arise from it. Who knows not, that the promise of any man depends on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, his intention on his knowledge, his knowledge reacheth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his consideration and present memory when he maketh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise? So that, in nature, a promise reacheth onely to presupposed and thought on circumstances: and who, when he sweareth to a Magistrate, expecteth to see him dispossessed and turned off?</p>
            <p>So that, this is manifest, a Magistrate actually dispossessed hath no right to be restored, nor the Subject any obligation to seek to restore, but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him. For, what is man, or rather mankind (for, so we have styled a nation) better than a herd of sheep or oxen, if it be to be owned, like them, by masters? What difference is there between their Masters sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Butcher, and obliging them to venture their lives and livelyhoods for his private Interest? We know it is natural, that the part should venture for the whole; but that the whole should venture the loss of it self to save the part, I cannot understand. The Governour is the highest and noblest part, yet but a part; the People is the whole, the End, (though not by office, yet by worth and dignity) the Master and Lord, for whom those who are Lords by office are to be vested and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in Lordship, when it is necessary for the common good. Who thinks otherwise, deserves not the name of a man.</p>

            <p>WHen the structure of the Common-wealth is dissolved, that is, disjoynted from him, then any who hath suffered wrong in the fore-declared manner may be party against him and proceed as if there were no Common-wealth; by the Law, which, in a Wilderness, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth us to kill a Tyger or Robber that seeketh to kill us, not pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law for our action, but that it is manlike and rational. Neither ought it be called punishment that is done against a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>spossessed Magistrate, but rather revenge, or some other name that includeth no order to Law.</p>
            <p>We must proceed upon other principles, that is, the forelaid and main <hi>basis</hi> of our discourse, that the common good ought to be the rule of the Magistrates Title, and the Subjects Obedience.</p>
            <p>Out of which this followeth, that when ever (considering all things) the common good is cleerly on the possessors side, then the dispossessed hath no claim. Neither ought we expect till we have assurance, that it will not be better for the subject if the late owner (after great dangers,) gaineth his former power: For, first, this it self is uncertain; secondly, the success of endeavours to restore him must be hazardous; thirdly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great mischiefs, during the time of the attempt, are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable; and all this to be ballanced against those uncertain hopes. Nor, again, must we expect that the wills of all the Subjects concur, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to the acceptance of the new Governour: For that is either impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, or of so long expectation, as to ruine all by dissensions and jealousies in the mean time: Nay, the vulgar sort are so easily led by fancy, that they understand not the common good, nor what they should wish.</p>
            <p>But you may demand, How shall it be known when the common good holdeth it self on the possessour's hand? I answer, we must first see who are the common, whose welfare is to be preferred before private interests. And presently it appeareth that, dividing the whole people into Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and governed; the governed part is the Publick to whose good the Governours are to direct their paines: And that these are they that spend their lives in seeking their own profits, either by improving the Land, or in Arts and Handicrafts: Whence, it followes, when their good stands on the possessours side, then cleerly he begins to gain right and power; and this is plain to be, when the Merchant, the Husbandman, and Tradesman, with their appendices, are in an undisturbed practice of their functions, and begin to be afraid of change upon the noise of an invasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62657:35"/>This resolution could not be doubted, were it not that one might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, That what is said seems true, abstracting from circumstances; but it ought to be considered, that such men see nothing but the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of what passes in humane negotiations, and so there may many circumstances lye hidden from them, which would make them think or with otherwise if they knew them: As, for example, home-discontents and forein conspiracies; which if understood, would make these honest men preferr a war, after which there is to follow a peace far exceeding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent quiet, and such a one as deserves the intervening disturbance and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</p>
            <p>And indeed, I allow these men understand not such mysteries of State, nor penetrate the value of the hazard: But, if they do not, why are they not also exempted from engaging on those motives? and then the rest of the Common-wealth will be but so many private men, who must follow the common. Again, if they think themselves well, they manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the present Government, and therefore cut off the title of the dispossessed Governour. Besides, who can answer they shall be better by the retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n of the dispossessed party? surely, by common presumption, the gainer is like to defend them better than he who lost it.</p>
            <p>But what if an open Enemy should come, could or ought the Subjects joyn against him with their new Magistrate? If not, the whole publick must perish: If they may, then the case is the same against their old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate; since his right stood upon the common peace, and that is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from him to his rivall by the title of quiet possession.</p>
