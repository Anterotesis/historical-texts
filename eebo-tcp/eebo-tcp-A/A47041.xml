            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. <hi>DAVID JONES</hi>'s VINDICATION Againſt the <hi>Athenian Mercury</hi> CONCERNING USURY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPon <hi>March</hi> the 5th you took upon you to anſwer that part of Mr. <hi>David Jones</hi>'s Farewel Sermon that related to Uſury. But in reality you have done no ſuch thing. For, if you had: Then in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt place,</hi> You muſt have anſwer'd</p>
            <p>His Challenge, <hi>Pag. 35. I do here openly make this Challenge to all the Patrons of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury; if they will bring me any one approved Author among the Ancients that has defended <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, I will bring them Fifty, I will bring them Hundreds, yea, I will bring them whole Councils and Fathers that have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly condemned it.</hi> And certainly that muſt needs be a very great Sin
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33189:2"/>
that, among all the Ancients, has no Patron that dares appear in it's Defence, but has All againſt it with one conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And likewiſe,</hi> What he there quoted out of Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon.</hi> And till you do ſo, all your Anſwers will be nothing at all to his Sermon. And I do verily believe, that neither You, nor all Men living, will ever be able to anſwer him as to that particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You muſt have anſwer'd</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The 17th Canon of the firſt</hi> Nicene <hi>Council</hi> (which is referred to <hi>Pag.</hi> 35.) whereby all Uſurious Clergymen were degraded from Holy Orders. Which I am credibly informed, was never done but for a Mortal Sin. And therefore, Biſhop <hi>Bedel</hi> (that moſt excellent Reformer of Clerical Abuſes in the Church of <hi>Ireland) thought the degrading of a Biſhop was too Sacred a thing to be done meerly upon Politick Conſiderations;</hi> which I would have writ in Letters of Gold. <hi>Bp. Bedell's Life, Pag.</hi> 145.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As likewiſe the 20th Canon of the</hi> Elibertin <hi>Council</hi> (which is referred to in the ſame place) whereby all Uſurious Lay-men were Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in their Life-time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As likewiſe the</hi> Lateran <hi>Council under</hi> Alexander <hi>the Third,</hi> where it was Decreed that all manifeſt Uſurers ſhould be deprived of Communion and Fellowſhip of Chriſtians in their Life, and of Chriſtian Burial after Death, till their Heirs had reſtored their Uſury. At which Council this Queſtion was put by <hi>Panormitan</hi> an Archbiſhop, Whether Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might not be diſpenſed with for the Redemption of poor Chriſtians taken Captive by the Saracens? And the Anſwer he had was to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Since both Old and New Teſtament deteſt the Crime of Uſury, no Diſpenſation was to be admitted for it, no, not for ſo charitable a Work, as the Redemption of Chriſtian Captives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As likewiſe the 109th Canon of our Church,</hi> where Uſury (not <hi>only</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Uſury, any more than exceſſive Adultery, but all Uſury in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>the leaſt as well as the greateſt)</hi> is thought a ſufficient Crime to keep any Man from the Sacrament. And there, you muſt have reconciled the Canon and the Statute-Law, the one of which <hi>ſeems</hi> to allow of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and the other Excommunicates any Man that is guilty of it. And that you might eaſily have done thus. The Statute-Law does not <hi>Allow</hi> Uſury, but only <hi>Stints</hi> and <hi>Limits</hi> it to Six in the Hundred, and ſo far gives way to it, for the preventing of greater Miſchiefs. And this is not enough to excuſe the Uſurer in the Court of Conſcience. And thus the Jews deceived themſelves in the matter of Polygamy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce: They thought <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law had allowed them in thoſe Sins: But our Saviour ſhew'd them plainly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them only a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them for the hardneſs of their Hearts. The very <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or Permiſſion of a thing, ſhews its Badneſs. For if it were Good, it might be done without any Toleration or Permiſſion at all. And therefore we find in the 21 <hi>of King James the Firſt,</hi> That no Words
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33189:2"/>
contained in the Law about Uſury, <hi>ſhould be Conſtrued or Expounded to allow the practice of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury in point of Religion or Conſcience.</hi> And therefore, notwithſtanding the Statute-Law does ſtint and limit Uſury for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of greater Evils; yet <hi>it does not, it cannot,</hi> exempt the Uſurers from Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, but leaves them to be Excommunicated by the 109 Canon. And therefore, <hi>Dominicas à Soto de Juſt. &amp; Jur. l. 1. qu. 6. Art.</hi> 2. is in the right on't, when he ſays, <hi>Stews are permitted to prevent Adulteries, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury to avoid Theft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As likewiſe,</hi> Ezek. 18. 8, 13. Where <hi>All <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> and <hi>All</hi> Increaſe that way, <hi>though never ſo little,</hi> is ſaid to be ſo great a Sin, that whoever is guilty of it, ſhall ſurely dye for it, and his Blood ſhall be upon his own Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As likewiſe,</hi> Jer. 15. 10. Where it is plain, that if the Prophet had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken or given upon Uſury, every one in the whole Earth might lawfully have Curſed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, You muſt have ſhew'n,</hi> whether, if Uſury be at all lawful; it be ſo lawful as to make a Trade of it; as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s former Hearers in <hi>Lombard-Street</hi> do. And there you muſt have anſwered what Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſays, <hi>Pag. 37. If any thing can make a Calling <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer's Calling cannot be Lawful.</hi> And therefore, have a great care leſt you by countenancing Uſury after your Ability, do harden any Man in his Sin, and thereby do become guilty of his Sin, and ſmart for it at the Day of Judgment. He that approves or defends what Wicked Men do, is worſe than thoſe Wicked Men that do thoſe wicked things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32.</p>
            <p>And this, (if you will give me leave to ſpeak freely, without thinking me Proud for preſuming to direct your Society,) is what you muſt have done, if you had anſwered Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s Sermon. But inſtead of this, let us now ſee what it is that you have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> You have pick'd Two or Three Lines out of <hi>Pag.</hi> 34, 38, which you repreſent as His. Whereas, if you had that <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>Reſpect to Truth</hi> you profeſs, you would have repreſented them as they really are in effect, the Words of God, by his Prophets <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> whoſe joynt Authority he there quotes for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have premiſed Two things, namely, <hi>That you do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to juſtifie the Rich, who exact from the Poor; nor thoſe who immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire Gain or Increaſe, who are Idolaters.</hi> And yet, thoſe very things ſome of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s former Hearers in <hi>Lombard-Street</hi> are notorious for: As you may gather from <hi>His Sermon upon Family-Duties,</hi> Pag. 19. Where he ſeems to tax ſome of them with <hi>Robbing of Orphans, Oppreſſing Widows, Grinding the Face of the Poor, Griping <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> and <hi>Suing out Pardons from the State for Extortion.</hi> And if you had loved their Souls as well as he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33189:3"/>
does, <hi>notwithſtanding all their Injuſtice againſt him,</hi> you would have told them ſo as well as he did. <hi>Namely,</hi> you would have told them in plain terms, <hi>that whatever you writ in your</hi> Mercury, <hi>was not at all deſigned to Juſtifie their making <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury their Calling.</hi> Which, even thoſe few Modern Writers that are falſly eſteemed Patrons of Uſury, have always Condemned. And if a Man does not deal thus plainly with them, he does nothing at all. Their Jewels and their Precious Stones do ſo dazle and gliſter, and dart ſuch a luſtre upon their Eyes, that they are <hi>perfectly Blinded;</hi> inſomuch that they can ſcarce ſee and know themſelves, when they are told to their Faces, <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And God grant that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s Succeſſor may deal with them as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially as he has done: To which purpoſe I would deſire him to read the excellent Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> upon 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> p. 121. <hi>But what ſpeak I of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers of the Church? There was never any Religion, nor Sect, nor State, nor Degree, nor Profeſſion of Men, but they have diſliked</hi> Uſury. <hi>Philoſophers, Greeks, Latins, Lawyers, Divines, Catholicks, Hereticks, all Tongues and Nations, have ever thought an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer as dangerous as a Thief. The very Senſe of Nature proves it to be ſo. If the Stones could ſpeak they would ſay as much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we had as Zealous Clergy now-a-days, Uſury would be thought as <hi>Deteſtable a Sin now,</hi> as it was in the 13 <hi>of Eliz.</hi> and in the Reign of King <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. <hi>Where all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury or Increaſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was puniſhed not only with the Forfeiture of Principal and All, but with Impriſonment and Ranſon at the Kings Will and Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Pag. 144. After a long Diſcourſe againſt Uſury, he has theſe Words; <hi>Thus much I thought expedient to ſpeak of the loathſom and Foul Trade of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury. I know not what Fruit will grow thereby, and what it will work in your Hearts. If it pleaſe God, it may do that good I wiſh: I have done my Duty, I call God for a Record unto my Soul, I have not deceived you. I have ſpoken unto you the truth: If I be deceived in this matter, O God thou haſt deceived me. Thou ſayſt,</hi> Thou ſhalt take no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury: <hi>Thou ſayſt,</hi> He that taketh Increaſe ſhall not live. <hi>What am I, that I ſhould hide the Words of my God, or keep them back from the Hearing of his People? The Learned Old Fathers have taught us,</hi> It is no more Lawful to take Uſury of our Brother, than it is to Kill our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Pag. 145. I hear there are certain in this City, which wallow wretchedly in this Filthineſs,</hi> (to wit Uſury,) <hi>without Repentance; I give them warning in the Hearing of you all, and in the Preſence of God, that they forſake this cruel, and deteſtable Sin. If otherwiſe they continue therein, I will open their ſhame, and DENO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NCE EXCOMM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NICA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION againſt them, and publiſh their NAMES in this place before you all; that you may know them, and abhor them as the PLAG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ES and MONSTERS of the World: That if they be paſt all Fear of God, they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33189:3"/>
may yet repent and amend for Worldly Shame.</hi> And this I humbly offer to Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s Succeſſors Conſideration. If he does not Preach againſt this Sin in <hi>Lombard-Street,</hi> he will be guilty of their Blood, and their Blood will be required at his Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You ſtate the Queſtion thus, <hi>Whether it be abſolutely unlawful to Receive,</hi> (I ſuppoſe you mean by Contract, not by way of Gratitude,) <hi>Any increaſe of Any for the uſe of their Monies?</hi> To which you give this Anſwer, <hi>In the true ſignification of the Word, 'tis certainly Damnable; but in the Senſe you now uſe it, 'tis very lawful and neceſſary.</hi> That is, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury in its true ſignification according to <hi>God's Word,</hi> is certainly Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but in its <hi>falſe</hi> ſignification according to <hi>Man's Invention,</hi> it is very lawful and neceſſary. And here I would fain know of any Man,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> Which is to take place, its true or its falſe ſignification? God's Word, or Man's Invention? Truth or a Lye? Chriſt or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would fain know, whether if Uſury be not abſolutely Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: Yet, its being of <hi>Bad Report,</hi> and its having the <hi>Appearance of Evil,</hi> is not enough to hinder it from being made a Calling? Certainly, no Man can deny, but there are a great many things, which though they be not abſolutely unlawful, are yet abſolutely unlawful to be made a Calling. No Man can deny, but that Uſury is of <hi>Bad Report;</hi> for all Ages have decry'd it: And all the Earth may lawfully Curſe an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 10. And no Man can deny, but that Uſury has the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil,</hi> if it be not Evil indeed; for it always <hi>appears</hi> in Bad Company: It <hi>appears</hi> with <hi>Lying, Backbiting, Deceit, Wrong and Bribery, Pſal.</hi> 15. It <hi>appears</hi> with <hi>Idolatry, Oppreſſion, Adultery, Cruelty, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Poor, Blood-ſhed and Murther,</hi> Ezek. 18. And it <hi>appears</hi> with <hi>the Profanation of Holy things, the abomination of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, and the unnatural Sins of Inceſt,</hi> Ezek. 22. And 'tis St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Obſervation upon it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: It always <hi>appears</hi> in the midſt of the greateſt Evils. And therefore certainly, though it ſhould not be <hi>abſolutely</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, yet it is ſo unlawful, it is of ſuch <hi>Bad Report,</hi> and it has ſuch <hi>Appearance of Evil,</hi> that no <hi>Honeſt</hi> Man who avoids <hi>both</hi> upon pain of Damnation, will ever adventure to make it a Calling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You affirm that <hi>the true Signification of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>is Extortion or grinding the Face of the Poor.</hi> And you affirm alſo, <hi>That it being allowed the Jews to take <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury of Strangers; Therefore it is not Morally Evil.</hi> From whence I make this Obſervation. All Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Extortion and grinding the Face of the poor are Morally Evil
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33189:4"/>
and Simply unlawful. And conſequently, Scripture-Uſury being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion according to you; and Extortion or grinding the Face of the Poor being Morally Evil according to all: It neceſſarily follows ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to you, that God never ſo much as allow'd the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take Uſury even from Strangers, (which has more truth in it, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, than both your Propoſitions.) For ſay you, <hi>He never allows that which is Morally Evil.</hi> And conſequently, either your Firſt, or Second, or both your Propoſitions are all falſe. And indeed ſo they are. For the Proof of which I only premiſe thus much.</p>
            <p>Extortion in our Land with relation to Uſury, (in the Senſe you ſay you now uſe it) is the Exacting of more Uſury than the Law allows. <hi>That is,</hi> It is the Exacting of more than Six in the Hundred. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt Propoſition,</hi> (which holds that Extortion or Grinding the Face of the Poor, is only meant by Scripture-Uſury) is all falſe. For Uſury in the Scripture Language is not the exacting of more than Six in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> The Exacting of One in the Hundred in Scripture-Uſury, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 11. where <hi>Exacting the Hundredth part of the Mony</hi> lent is called Uſury. And <hi>v. 12. Requiring Nothing</hi> is oppoſed to it. And conſequently, He that requires any thing, tho never ſo little, for the Uſe of Mony, is a Scripture-Uſurer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law ſays, <hi>Levit. 25. 36. Take thou No <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury or Increaſe from thy poor Brother.</hi> And the Prophet ſays, <hi>Ezek. 18. 8. He that hath not given forth upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, neither hath taken Any Increaſe.</hi> From whence it is plain, that whoever taketh any Increaſe, tho never ſo little, and not only he that taketh above Six in the Hundred, is a Scripture-Uſurer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Extortion, <hi>that is,</hi> If taking above Six in the Hundred, be only meant by Scripture-Uſury: Then, it was lawful for the Jews to take Six in the Hundred even of their poor Brother. Which I believe, no Man of common Senſe can with any Modeſty affirm. From whence I conclude, That your firſt Propoſition is all falſe. And your</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Propoſition</hi> (which holds, that God never allowed the Jews any thing that is Morally Evil) is all falſe too. For, God has allowed the Jews ſome things which are Morally Evil, for the Hardneſs of their Hearts, as in the Caſes of Polygamy and Divorce, which were not ſo from the beginning, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 8. Not to mention the allowance they had to ſpoil the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which has ſeveral ſort of Anſwers given it by Learned Men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 36.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33189:4"/>
The Sum of which is this, <hi>If both your Propoſitions are true</hi> (as they are really falſe) <hi>then, they do utterly overthrow each other. And conſequently, for all that you have hitherto ſaid, Mr.</hi> Jones'<hi>s Sermon is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs there are a great many things more to be anſwer'd in your Mercury. Of which, God willing, you ſhall have an account in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sheet ſometime next Week. My Ordinary buſineſs is ſo great that I cannot well prepare above a Sheet a Week for the Preſs. And therefore, I hope, you'l excuſe me for not giving you a full Anſwer at preſent.</p>

            <p>I Have oftentimes been forced to vindicate Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> in ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies upon the account of Uſury. And I have found that this <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Objection</hi> has been frequently made againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. If we may not Lend, what will the King do, who is forced to take Mony upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury?</hi> To which I humbly crave leave to give you Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s own Anſwer to it. For, it is that which he ſent to the Preſs as a Poſtſcript to his Farewel Sermon, and had been then Printed, had not all the Copies been wrought off before it came, and that he was deſired to put it off to ſome other Opportunity. And if it give any juſt Offence to the preſent Government, he does now retract it, and heartily beg Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Don't Lend the King <hi>upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> but Lend him <hi>Freely.</hi> Let it be your Free-will Offering. Let it be your Voluntary Oblation. You can never Lend it better. You lend it to fight the Lord's Battles againſt the Mighty. What is now become of all thoſe Your <hi>Lives and Fortunes</hi> that you lately ſo prodigally proffer'd for the Support of Popiſh Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Arbitrary Government? Would you have <hi>Given All</hi> to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your Liberty, your Property, and your Religion?</hi> And will you <hi>Lend No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſecure them all?</hi> Is it not enough for the King to <hi>Hazard his Life,</hi> who, as <hi>David</hi>'s Men ſaid of him, <hi>is worth Ten Thouſand of us, 2 Sam.</hi> 18. 3. Is it not enough for him to <hi>Hazard his Life,</hi> but muſt he alſo <hi>Pay <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury for your Deliverance?</hi> To whom is Tribute due? To him or to you? For what do Men pay Uſury? For their own Mony, or that which is lent them? And can you then offer to make the King pay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33189:5"/>
Uſury for his own Mony? Yea, and make Him pay Uſury to you for it? Who <hi>(if it were in any caſe Lawful)</hi> ought rather to do ſo to him; becauſe you do not bring him in Mony ſoon enough for your own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. What if He were as backward to help you, as you are to be helped by Him? <hi>What if this ſhould be the laſt ill Conſequence?</hi> Which God forbid for Chriſt his ſake! <hi>
