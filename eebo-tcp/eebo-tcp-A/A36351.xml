            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Since which time ſome others have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken without my privity, to Publiſh Relations of what I then Depoſed; In which upon peruſal of the ſame, I find ſome things omitted, others miſtaken, or not ſo fully and particularly related as I could wiſh. And ſo, reſolving with my ſelf, that ſince I was the firſt, and am hitherto the ſole profeſs'd Diſcoverer of the ſaid Deſign, and Conſpiracy; it would be very Satisfactory to all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to receive a particular and exact Relation of the Deſigns that were
<pb facs="tcp:52261:3"/>
Formed againſt themſelves, from my own hand; I ſet pen to Paper, and digeſted what I then Depoſed, into this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe; in which I have not omitted any thing, that is material of what I was ingaged in, or otherwiſe admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the knowledge of; but have given a faithful Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, as they followed in courſe of time; to the end that all ſuch as are concern'd for the Welfare and Proſperity of their Religion and Country, may be the more fully convinced, how much it is for their intereſt, to endeavour the diſappointing all future Contrivances of that Party, that is ſo active and induſtrious to promote their own intereſt, under a pretence of Religion; which is the benefit that I hope will accrue by the Publiſhing of this Narrative, to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

            <p>ABout the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> laſt paſt, one Mrs. <hi>White,</hi> who had been a Priſoner divers times in <hi>Newgate</hi> and Convicted, was releaſed out of Priſon by one Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier;</hi> And the ſaid Mrs. <hi>White,</hi> in regard I had been very inſtrumental for her Enlargement, came divers times to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where I was Priſoner alſo, to viſit me; where ſhe diſcover'd, That I did profeſs the <hi>Roman Catholick Faith,</hi> and likewiſe, That ſome difference had ariſen between Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> and me, upon which I had ſworn a Revenge. From that time I began to make it my buſineſs to inſpect his Uſage of Priſoners, where I found ſome ground for drawing up Articles againſt him; which accordingly I did, and acquainted Mrs. <hi>White</hi> with it, who told me, I did very well, and That ſhe would bring a Lady to me, who would give me great Incouragement in that Affair. And about two days after, ſhe brought the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> who was very friendly to me, and after a ſtrict inquiry into the Cauſe of my Confinement, as alſo concerning my Religion, Parentage, Education, and Travels, demanded, If I were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of undertaking Buſineſs? I anſwered, Yes; then ſays ſhe, For the preſent let me ſee how you can draw up thoſe Articles againſt Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and thereupon gave me ſome Inſtructions for the ſame in Writing.</p>
            <p>But it is to be ſuppos'd, That Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and Mrs. <hi>White,</hi> from whom ſhe had taken the ſaid Inſtructions, had throughly conſulted my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Capacity before Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> came to me; and as I was inform'd Mrs. <hi>White</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> ſoon after they were acquainted, made diligent enquiry after the Priſoners in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and asked, If it were not poſſible to find a Man of Courage amongſt them, and one who would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? and the ſaid Mrs. <hi>White,</hi> having ſuch an opinion of me, made this the chief occaſion of Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Viſit.</p>
            <p>But I drew up Articles, purſuant to the Directions I had received, which, together with thoſe which I had drawn from my own Obſervation, amounted to ſo conſiderable a Charge, as, if the Particulars could have been ſufficiently proved, it muſt certainly have been very prejudicial to Captain <hi>Richardſon.</hi> The Articles are too long, and not worth while to be here inſerted. So I refer the Readers, if they deſire to ſatisfie their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52261:5"/>
Curioſity, to the <hi>Coffee-houſes,</hi> where they are to be ſeen at all times. At the ſecond time of Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s coming, I had finiſhed them, and ſhe peruſed the Papers, and liked them well, and expreſs'd much ſorrow for my Misfortunes, ſaying ſhe would uſe all poſſible means for my Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and told me ſhe had ſomething of far greater moment for me to undertake than that, but in the mean time adviſed me to complain to Mr. Recorder of Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> for his hard uſage of me in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and told me, That ſhe would immediately go to Alderman <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> and make, by Alderman <hi>Jeffreys</hi> his means, ſuch Intereſt with Mr. Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> could not oppoſe; and that my Requeſt ſhould be granted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sunday</hi> following I went to the Recorder, where I found all performed that Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> had promiſed; and I no ſooner moved for any favour, but it was granted, eſpecially that of having better uſage, whilſt I continued in Priſon, which accordingly I found.</p>
            <p>The next time Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> ſent her Maid to me; who in her Miſtreſſes Name bad me be of good courage, for I ſhould in a ſhort time be at Liberty; about two days after, her Miſtreſs came, and told me, Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> the Solicitor was employed, to get me Let out upon Bail, but in the mean time, that I ſhould want for nothing; and bad me as often as I had occaſion for Money or other neceſſaries, to ſend to her Houſe in <hi>Arundel-Street,</hi> and I ſhould be Furniſhed, as I often did do and was ſupplied accordingly.</p>
            <p>About two days after, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> ſent her Maid to me with a Meſſage, that her Miſtreſs was gone to <hi>Peterley</hi> in <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary buſineſs, but would return in a day or two, which buſineſs, might if I were willing, be much to my advantage: the ſaid Maid came to me every day after that, either to bring me Money, or to enquire of my health and condition.</p>
            <p>When Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> return'd to Town, ſhe came to ſee me (I being ſtill in <hi>Newgate)</hi> and ſaid, within a day or two I ſhould be inlarged; and at the ſame time at my entreaty, ſhe gave one <hi>Godfrey</hi> a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and a Priſoner, Money to relieve him, and has ever ſince allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a weekly Penſion; the next day, ſhe ſent her Maid with my Diſcharge under Mr. Recorders hand, who had taken Bail for me, and deſired to know what the Charge of the Houſe came to; which I caſt up and ſent her; and immediately after, the Maid returned with the Money, I paid the Charges of the Priſon, and was abſolutely Diſcharged from thence, but immediately, or before I was well out of thoſe rude limits, I was Arreſted and carried to the <hi>Counter,</hi> which Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> was much troubled to hear of; and the next day ſent her Maid to me to know the cauſe of it, which I told her, and how much Money would purchaſe my Liberty, with this the Maid went to her Miſtreſs, and immediately return'd with Money and this Anſwer,</p>
            <p>That her Miſtreſs had ordered buſineſs for me to do within two days, of great conſequence, and if I could get out by that time, ſhe would purchaſe my enlargement at any rate; but if not, her Miſtreſs could not tell whether ever I ſhould be freed by her or no.</p>
            <p>Now upon theſe words, I being as deſirous of the freſh Air, as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could be who had ſuffered a years Impriſonment, as I had done, ſent for a Solicitor, and (it being within the Term) gave order for a <hi>Habe as Corpus,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52261:5"/>
which was proſecuted with ſuch expedition, by one Mr. <hi>Scarlet,</hi> that the next, being <hi>Munday</hi> morning, it was allowed, and I brought to the <hi>Kings Bench Bar,</hi> and from thence turn'd over (according to the courſe of that Court) to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> from whence I ſent Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> this following Letter:</p>

            <p>By the Maid ſhe oblig'd me to return this Letter again, and all others which I ſhould at any time receive from her, during the time of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement there; which I did, and was much ſatisfied with the Contents of Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Letters. The next day Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> came in diſguiſe to the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> and told me, I ſhould be well provided for; and gave me 20 <hi>s.</hi> and promis'd me every Week as much, and that if that were not enough, I ſhould have more. This, as I underſtood by the Maid, was about the time, when, by reaſon of Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>'s making Search after Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> ſhe was forc'd to quit her own Houſe, and retire to <hi>Powis-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-fields;</hi> and, I ſuppoſe, her putting her ſelf into that Diſguiſe in which ſhe came to me, was upon the ſame occaſion. Then Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> promis'd before Mr. <hi>Banneſter,</hi> to provide Clothes and ſuch other Neceſſaries as I ſhould want, againſt I came abroad; and that I ſhould not lye long there; but however, that I could do as much good there as if I were abroad, and ſhe walked with me in the Garden, and diſcourſed to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>We are informed, ſaid ſhe, that one <hi>Stroud,</hi> a Priſoner here, has been a Converſant formerly of <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s, and that <hi>Bedlow</hi> now writes ſeveral Letters to him, and ſends him Money, which Letters he brags much of when he is drunk, and often has ſworn to Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kemeſh,</hi> That <hi>Bedlow</hi> was fearful of him; and that to prevent the coming to light of ſomething that <hi>Stroud</hi> could diſcloſe againſt him, he ſent him ſo much Money <hi>per</hi> Week; but <hi>Stroud</hi> ſwears, If ever he gets abroad, and that he may have any to ſupport him, he will quickly bring Matter enough to hang <hi>Bedlow;</hi> nay, and that he has it in his Pocket, and will frequently pull out a Pacquet of Letters, and ſometimes pretend, in paſſion, the Lords
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52261:6"/>
in the <hi>Tower</hi> were much to blame, to ſuffer ſuch a Villain to give Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt them, ſaying, If they would be rul'd by him, <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſhould do them no hurt. This, ſhe told me, was very material, and that <hi>Stroud</hi> knew much of <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Life and Converſation; and that my buſineſs was, to obſerve <hi>Stroud</hi> and get acquainted with him; and that it would much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the making my Fortune, if I could by any means know the bottom of <hi>Stroud,</hi> or if I could bring him over to be a Witneſs for the Lords, or by any means perſuade him to ſhew me any, or all the Letters and Papers he had in his Pocket which concern'd <hi>Bedlow;</hi> which I promis'd I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to accompliſh, and forthwith make the Attempt, telling her withal, that the thing was already half done, for I had been familiarly acquainted with <hi>Stroud</hi> ſome years ſince, and therefore had the greater hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Then Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> recommended to me the Advice of one Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> and <hi>Kemiſh,</hi> both Prieſts and Priſoners there, very good religious Men, as ſhe ſaid, who would not only adviſe me how to proceed, but give me an account more at large of the whole Deſign, and alſo give me good Inſtructions in matters of Religion, if I deſired it; which advice I promis'd to follow: then ſhe left me, ſaying, She would give Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> notice to ſpeak to me; and about two days after, I being in the Garden, Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> ſpoke to me privately, and bid me follow him into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which I did, where I found Mr. <hi>Kemiſh</hi> alſo. They told me what a good Character they had received of me, and that I had ſuffered much in <hi>Newgate</hi> for the ſake of my Religion, and many ſuch like ſtories; and that Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> had given them an account by Letter, That I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſaid <hi>Stroud,</hi> and upon that account the more fit to manage the buſineſs. Then they told me, <hi>Stroud</hi> had divers Letters about him, that concern'd <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and ſome which <hi>Stroud</hi> had received from him ſince the time of his Impriſonment, and deſired me to drink with <hi>Stroud;</hi> but firſt asked me, If my Head would bear Drink? to which I anſwer'd, Yes; If not, ſaid <hi>Munſon,</hi> I will give you a Preparative that ſhall enable you; but I did not ſtand in need of any ſuch thing, but treated with <hi>Stroud,</hi> to very good purpoſe, of which I will ſhortly give you a full Account, for whatever he ſaid at any time, that was material, I put into Writing. Then I again went to <hi>Munſon</hi> and <hi>Kemiſh,</hi> and told them what progreſs I had made in the buſineſs with <hi>Stroud;</hi> they ſeemed to be well pleaſed with it, and highly commended my diligence, and withal, the better to incourage me, ſaid, They had that day received a Letter from the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> which concerned me, but it was committed to the flames, (for they were cunning enough to keep no Papers by them of any Importance, as being liable to Searches that were likely to be made there on the leaſt ſuſpicion) but promiſed to ſhew me the next that ſhould come; which they accordingly did, for there came one from the Counteſs about two days after, and then Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> gave me a private Sign to go to his Chamber, which I did; and there he and <hi>Kemiſh</hi> read the Letter, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whereof were (in part) as followeth:</p>

Soon after I went to Confeſſion to Mr. <hi>Munſon,</hi> and went into <hi>Kemeſhes</hi> Room, where he was reading Maſs, and of him I received the Sacrament, and from that time was admitted into their Church (though I had for ſome years before profeſſed the ſame Religion) then I went into <hi>Munſon</hi>'s Chamber, where I had ſome little Diſcourſe not worth mentioning here, after which he gave me free Toleration to drink with <hi>Stroud,</hi> but I ſcrupled whether it were ſafe for me, who had that day received the Sacrament to drink, and perhaps be Drunk, with <hi>Stroud</hi> or any other; to which he repli'd, that inaſmuch as he had given me leave, I ſhould not ſin in ſo doing, eſpecially ſince it was for the Good of the Cauſe. And farther told me, if <hi>Stroud</hi> were forward in diſcourſe, I ſhould offer him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or two hundred pounds; then I ask't what the conſequence of it would be, if he ſhould accept of the propoſal and I not be able to make it good? I ſaid I was afraid it might ſpoil the whole Deſign, nay ſaid he, let me alone for that, if he can but be induced to comply with us, I am ſure the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> will perform the conditions; and as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered for my next Attempt upon <hi>Stroud,</hi> I took that courſe, but to little or no effect. In a day or two after this (I having firſt given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> of the bad ſucceſs I had with <hi>Stroud,</hi> and that I could gain nothing upon him worth the time and the money I ſpent with him;) one Mr. <hi>Henry Nevel</hi> alias <hi>Paine,</hi> was removed by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from the <hi>Fleet-Priſon</hi> to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> (which as Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> afterwards told me was on purpoſe to have him trie ſome experiment on <hi>Stroud)</hi> who often was viſited by the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cellier;</hi> but at laſt, after they had well conſulted the buſineſs of <hi>Stroud, Nevel</hi> writes a Letter to me, to put me upon a new Method of Pumping <hi>Stroud,</hi> or get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Papers from him, the Contents of which Letter were as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>

            <p>At the ſame time he ſent me, written by his own hand, the <hi>Danby</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, deſiring me to write out ſome Copies of them at my leiſure; which I did, and ſent ſome to him; and others, by the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi>'s ſervant, to Miſtreſs <hi>Cellier,</hi> and ſometimes the Counteſs uſed to ſend her ſervant to me for them; and once by the ſame ſervant ſhe ſentme five Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to encourage me.</p>

ſame the next day, by Mrs. <hi>Cellier's</hi> Maid; but I ſuppoſe either <hi>Munſon,</hi> or <hi>Kemeſh,</hi> or both, had ſent to <hi>Blaredale</hi> before, otherwiſe he would not have ſent the Potion to me, being an abſolute ſtranger to him, but when the Maid brought it in a ſmall Phial, I left her in my Chamber, and went and ſhewed it to Mr. <hi>Munſon,</hi> who together with Mr. <hi>Kemeſh</hi> did again di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me how to uſe it; They bid me take him (meaning <hi>Stroud)</hi> into the Cellar, and drink him ſtoutly with <hi>Burnt-Brandy,</hi> and when I found him merry, take my opportunity to put the <hi>Opium</hi> into his Cup; which I did; but it only made him ſomewhat drouſie the next day, and did not operate according to expectation; then <hi>Munſon</hi> and <hi>Kemeſh</hi> ſent to the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> to let her know what I had done; and as Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Maid told me, her Ladyſhip gave order to <hi>Blaredale,</hi> to ſend me another Doſe; and <hi>Munſon</hi> told me for the Colour of the thing, I muſt ſend the Maid my ſelf to <hi>Blaredale</hi> for it, which I did; and he ſent by the ſame Meſſenger about as much more: then, by all their advice, I made the ſecond At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and invited <hi>Stroud</hi> to Dine with me that day; and there being a Tankard of ſmall bitter Beer, fit for the purpoſe, I put the <hi>Opium</hi> into it; but when <hi>Stroud</hi> taſted it, he ſuſpected it was not fit to drink, and threw it away, ſaying, or ſwearing, He believed he ſhould be poiſoned before he ſhould be ſet at liberty: of this I ſent Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> an Account by her Maid, (who expected another Story) and, as I underſtood ſince, ſhe was very angry with <hi>Blaredale,</hi> the Apothecary, for not ordering the Compound aright. This Project not taking effect, they bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of another Device; which was, That I ſhould drink him on the ſquare, and obſerve well his Diſcourſe, and put it immediately into Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; ſo that if he ſhould come to be made uſe of, as a Witneſs for the King, what he had then ſaid might be given in evidence to invalidate his Teſtimony. This way pleaſed me better than the other; and I proceeded as I had opportunity, inſomuch, that I had gotten from <hi>Stroud</hi>'s mouth ſome things that were material, but ſpoken careleſly by him, who ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not my Deſign, nor heeded what he ſaid. Theſe Writings I took Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of, and ſent the Originals to Mrs. <hi>Cellier;</hi> ſhe carried them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to the Lords, who liked them very well, as ſhe told me; but all this was thought no very conſiderable ſtep. By the way I will give a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Account of <hi>Stroud</hi>'s Diſcourſe, which was as follows; <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the <hi>16th.</hi> 1679. he told me, That about fifteen years ſince, he knew <hi>Bedloe,</hi> who was then in a mean condition; That when Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> came to view the Priſoners in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> he ſpoke to Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and told him of ſome former Paſſages; and that from that time he ſent him Money every week.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the <hi>17th. Stroud</hi> told me his Wife, in the Country, had in a Cabinet divers Papers that concern'd Mr. <hi>Bedlow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day <hi>Stroud</hi> told me, his Allowance from Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> was the larger, becauſe he was to obſerve the Motions of ſeveral Prieſts which were Priſoners there and their Correſpondence.</p>
            <p>Now, according to the uſual improvement which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make of anything, tho' never ſo inconſiderable, that does but in the leaſt appear to be for their advantage, I will ſhew you what Uſe they would have made of theſe Paſſages. They would have engaged me to Swear to ſome Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs which Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> framed out of thoſe Papers, and dictated to me; which were as follows: <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52261:7"/>
               <hi>That</hi> Stroud <hi>told me his Enlargement was at hand; and if ever he had it, ſome in the World ſhould ſoon feel the Effects of his Fury. I demanded, who he meant by that? he anſwered,</hi> Bedloe.</p>
            <p>Stroud <hi>alſo told me, That one Mr.</hi> Johnſon, <hi>then a Servant of the Right Honourable the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>had been with him divers times, to perſuade him to become a Witneſs for the King, againſt the Lords in the</hi> Tower; <hi>and in order to it, offered him a conſiderable Sum of Money; but that he demanded, What he muſt Swear, and who it was muſt Inſtruct him? Mr.</hi> Johnſon <hi>replied, You ſhall not want for that; and I am very glad to find you ſo ingenious: But hold, ſays</hi> Stroud, <hi>I will not Perjure my ſelf for the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe two laſt were additional Paragraphs to the former, but ſuch as were to be Depoſed upon Oath. But <hi>Stroud</hi> not being able to give any account of the then <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, this Deſign fell; which was no ſooner laid aſide, but another was taken up; which was thus laid by the five <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords in the <hi>Tower: (viz.)</hi> That <hi>Stroud</hi> and I ſhould Write a Letter to <hi>Bedloe</hi> to this effect; <hi>Here is a Perſon</hi> (meaning my ſelf) <hi>whoſe Travels in</hi> Flanders, France, Spain, Italy, <hi>and divers other parts, have given him the opportunity of Inſpecting the Actions of the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Gang, by whom you may be inform'd of ſomethings that may be of great Importance; therefore you will do well to take Care he may be Examin'd.</hi> This I wrote with my own Hand, by <hi>Munſon</hi>'s order (but did not ſend the Letter) who was as urgent as the Lords to have me do ſome Service to the Cauſe; For, indeed, I was not very forward to be concern'd on that manner with Mr. <hi>Bedloe;</hi> and ask'd Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> and <hi>Kemeſh,</hi> What Service I ſhould do the Lords by it? They told me, The Service I ſhould the Lords, would be by Declaring ſome things that they would tell me before I ſhould be Examin'd; which would make for them. For I was firſt to be Sworn a Witneſs for the King, and then to Swear ſuch other Matter as they ſhould direct me: but this did not take, in regard they could not contrive any ſecure Story, or ſuch as I (who was to be the Actor) could approve of.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Nevel</hi> ſent me a Letter, and adviſed me, to uſe all the Care and Diligence I could, to Compound my Debts, and get out of Priſon; and to let me know how eaſie it was for me ſo to do, told me, The Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> and Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> had allowed Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> Money for that purpoſe; and did particularly deſire, when I was out, That I ſhould be forthwith brought to them in the <hi>Tower,</hi> as I afterwards was.</p>
            <p>Then, the ſame day I received a Letter from Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> by the hand of one <hi>Gifford,</hi> one of the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes; which Letter was much to the ſame effect with that which I had before received from <hi>Nevel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I went for all, or moſt of my Creditors, whoſe Actions amounted to near 700 Pound, and in a ſhort time I brought them to Compound with me for their Debts, and paid them the Compoſition agreed on, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Money by Mrs. <hi>Cellier:</hi> then I immediately obtained my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and went to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Houſe, in <hi>Arundel-ſtreet,</hi> as I was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but not finding her there, the Maid directed me to <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> (and to make ſure, ſent <hi>Gifford</hi> with me) where, with much ado, I found Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> for ſhe was ſtill forced to abſcond from Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi> I having preſent occaſion for Money, as not having paid the Fees of the Priſon, I pray'd Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to let me have 5 <hi>l.</hi> ſhe went into a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52261:8"/>
Room, and talked with a perſon, whom I afterwards diſcovered by Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> to be the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> who gave her the Money I deſired; ſaying, Here, do you give it him; 'twill be better from your hand than mine. Then I went and diſcharged the Houſe, and return'd, according to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Order, to <hi>Powis-houſe</hi> again; where, being by one of the Servants brought into the Gallery, I found Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> who left me, and promis'd to come preſently, as ſhe did; and told me, I muſt ſee the Counteſs of <hi>Powis;</hi> then ſhe left me again, to divert my ſelf with the ſight of ſome Pictures, and return'd, bringing with her the Counteſs, who very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thanked me for my diligence in the <hi>King's-Bench;</hi> and there promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on her Honour, for that I had acted ſo faithfully there, it ſhould make my Fortune, provided I would undertake the Management of other Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which I promiſed to do; and after a long and ſtrict Charge given me by her Ladyſhip, Firſt, To be ſtedfaſt in the Principles of my Religion. Secondly, To go once a Week to Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> to Confeſſion; which I alſo promiſed to do, we parted for that time: (this was about the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1679.) But in the Afternoon of the ſame day, the Counteſs met me again in the Gallery, where her Ladyſhip told me, That for me to be entertained there (that is to ſay, in <hi>Powis-houſe)</hi> would not be convenient, in regard of the buſineſs I was to be employ'd about; For, ſaid ſhe, ſome of Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi>'s People may watch you to my Houſe, and by that means you would give an Obſtruction to our Buſineſs, and become uncapable of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing therein; for prevention whereof, ſhe propoſed a Lodging in <hi>Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> at the Sign of the <hi>Goat;</hi> And, ſays the Lady, when I have any Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, I will ſend ſome of my Servants in Diſguiſe to you: but your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Neighbour (ſays the Lady) is one Mrs. <hi>Prince,</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and a good Woman, and one that always has good People in her Houſe, (meaning by that, as I ſuppoſe, Prieſts:) the Counteſs adviſed me to Viſit her, the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Prince,</hi> ſometimes; which I did; but I underſtand ſince, ſhe never knew any more of me, (from that time, to the time of my Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) but that I was imployed in the buſineſs of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſhe having been told ſo by Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and others; but notwithſtanding my Lodging was at the <hi>Goat,</hi> yet I was often ſent for to <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> to be employed in Buſineſs; firſt, as a Solicitor, I was to endeavour to get out ſome of the <hi>Catholick Party</hi> from their Impriſonments, upon Bail; but the Counteſs told me this would only be preſent Buſineſs, and during the Term; but there were other Affairs cut out for me: from that time I went about the Enlargement of five or ſix Prieſts in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and got two or three out, one of which was <hi>Mackarthey,</hi> who is ſince committed for a new, but worſe Matter. All this time I was every day, from ſix or ſeven a Clock in the Morning till ten or eleven at Night, abſent from my Lodging; which made the People not a little wonder at my conſtant abſence. By this time th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Counteſs had writ a Letter to the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and I was ordered to carry it; whereupon I went to the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi>'s Lodging at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Croſs,</hi> and delivered him the Letter; who, after his Lordſhip had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed it, received me very kindly, and then and there promiſed to make my Fortune, if I would uſe my Endeavours to ſupport the <hi>Catholick Cauſe,</hi> as I ſhould be directed: I promiſed I would. (Now 'tis to be ſuppoſed, his Lordſhip was no ſtranger to the Tranſactions in the <hi>King's-Bench.)</hi> Then I waited till his Lordſhip had writ a Letter in Anſwer to that which I brought: which being done, I returned with it to the Counteſs, who called

            <p>By the <hi>Youths</hi> is meant the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, who were lodged at Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Houſe, and were Inſtructed once in two days by the ſaid Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> all the time of their being in Town; nay ſome of them wanted their Leſſons even at the time of the firſt Tryal of the five Jeſuits at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> and were there again Inſtructed; but 'tis apparently known how weakly they behaved themſelves.</p>
            <p>At the time when I returned from the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> with the Letter to the Counteſs, ſhe adviſed me to burn all Papers whatſoever, after I had peruſed them; which Rule I always, even to the laſt, obſerved, otherwiſe I could have been able to have proved the whole Matter upon them, by their own Hand-writings.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, I was ſuſpitious of Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Maid, that ſhe took more notice of Affairs than was neceſſary, and told the Counteſs I did not like her; ſo her Ladyſhip adviſed Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to put her away, and take a Boy in her room, who would be more convenient for carrying Letters from place to place; this was done; and about a day or two after, the Counteſs told me I muſt go into <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Webs,</hi> at a place called <hi>Peterley,</hi> with a Letter to one Mrs. <hi>Jeane,</hi> and that I muſt alſo adviſe with her in ſome buſineſs of weight; Mr. <hi>Web,</hi> the Gentleman of the Houſe where I was to go, was himſelf preſent, when the Counteſs put me upon going the Journey, and adviſed me, leſt the cauſe of my going ſhould be diſcovered, to bring his ſon-in-Law with me when I came back; for ſaid he, I have deſigned to ſend him to <hi>France</hi> long ſince, and this will not only be a good Excuſe for you, but very convenient for his journey alſo: Then the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> adviſed me to go forthwith, and order one of the Grooms to hire a Horſe for me, not that her Ladyſhip wanted Horſes, but leſt it ſhould be known that ſhe ſent me, and ſo I be diſcovered; then Mr. <hi>Web,</hi> who was preſent likewiſe when the Counteſs gave me the Pacquet (for I was to carry a Pacquet with me) adviſed me to put it in the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Skirts to ſecure it, ſo that if I were taken, the Horſe being a Hackney, I might come off, by denying the thing; his giving me ſuch advice, made me ſuſpect he was privy to the buſineſs contained in the Letters; but I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his advice, and that day took my Journey, and when I arrived at <hi>Peterley,</hi> which was that night late, I delivered a Letter to Mrs. <hi>Web</hi> from her Husband; the Contents whereof, as I ſuppoſe, were, to have her make ready the Child againſt the next morning, and to entertain me kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to bring me to that Mrs. <hi>Jeane,</hi> which ſhe did, as ſoon as ſhe had read the Letter; for ſhe deſir'd me to follow her (as I did) through divers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52261:9"/>
Rooms, and up and down ſeveral pair of Stairs, till at laſt, ſhe brought me into a Chamber, and bid me ſit down, ſaying, I will preſently ſend the Lady to you; then ſhe left me, and ſent in a man into the Room, which did not a little ſurprize me; but after ſome uſual Greetings, he told me, that for ſecurity of his perſon theſe dangerous times, he was forced to retire there; and uſe the name of Mrs. <hi>Jeane,</hi> for the Superſcribing, and Subſcribing of Letters, in ſome ordinary kinds or caſes; but in ſhort, when he had read the Letters, he proved to be a Prieſt, for immediately after, he would have me confeſs, and receive the Sacrament, to be true to the Cauſe. I told him I had been drinking on the Road, and was not in a condition then, and pray'd it might be defer'd till the morrow; but he told me, that muſt not be, I was well enough, and muſt do it then; for I muſt be gone early in the morning, whereupon I did as he bid me, and took my leave till the morrow; then Mr. <hi>Web,</hi> when I was ready to come away, took me up to Mrs. <hi>Jeane</hi> again, and left us together the ſecond time.</p>
            <p>Then he told me, that he had ſate up all night to anſwer thoſe Letters; and that he would now conſider by what Method to proceed in the Plot againſt the Presbyterians; and that the ground-work of the whole thing was amongſt thoſe Papers which I was to bring to <hi>London,</hi> but he did not offer to ſhew it me, neither did I expreſs any deſire to ſee it; but he told me withal, that it muſt be enlarged on, and drawn into ſeveral parts, by the five Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nevel;</hi> and ſo after ſome little admonitions, I came away with the Pacquet, the Child, and Mr. <hi>Cellier,</hi> who is his Grandfather: When I came to <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> I found the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs and Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> together, they both told me they were not in a little Fear for me, leſt ſome misfortune ſhould have befallen, not me, but the Papers; but ſince I was ſo well return'd, they asked what anſwer I had brought, and how I was entertained? I told them; and delivered the Papers to the Counteſs, who opened and overlookt them all, but took up one, and read it to me, which was to this Effect, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good ſtore of Pamphlets muſt be Writ, and ſpread about the Town againſt the</hi> Presbyterians; <hi>perſons muſt be employed to go to</hi> Coffee-houſes, <hi>and rail againſt the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Party, and if they meet with any that offer to contend, matter of Treaſon or ſome ſuch thing may eaſily be laid to their Charge, to have them ſecured; but there muſt be many perſons ſo employed, and it will be great prudence not to let them know one another, nor to let any one know more than his own part; and in the ſame Letter, he blamed them for letting me know ſo much as I did; but ſaid he, I have bound him faſt enough, and beſides that, I have a better opinion of him than I had of the other (who was Mr.</hi> Gifford <hi>the Prieſt, as Mrs.</hi> Jeane <hi>told me) Theſe are the people that muſt do the work, and you let them lye in Priſons and ſtarve, which makes me wonder at your great negligence in ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Affairs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe were all the Contents, that I was then made privy to: they were ſoon carried to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and afterwards ſent to <hi>Nevel</hi> to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52261:9"/>
as he thought fit, for he was the chief Pen-man, and did all that ſort of drudgery for a long time, till I came in to relieve him, Firſt by Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing divers Papers after him: Secondly by ſetting up for my ſelf, in Scribling of Pamphlets, and ſuch little things as I was capable of, to further the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>By this time the Tryals of the five <hi>Jeſuits</hi> came on, and I had not time, as it was deſigned I ſhould, to inſtruct the Witneſſes; but the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> ſtill continued in that employment himſelf, and gave, to ſome that had ſhort Memories, Breviates or Leſſons; others he adviſed with, ſometimes at his own Lodgings, other times at <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> or at Mrs. <hi>Celliers;</hi> this was as common amongſt the Youth as going to School, for ſometimes when they had been ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over their parts, and miſtook, then would they preſently cry, <hi>oh I am out, I muſt go to my Lord</hi> Caſtlemain <hi>to be adviſed, or inſtructed again.</hi> Then I was ordered by the Counteſs to attend on the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> at the <hi>Seſſions</hi> held at the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> and <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> which I did accordingly, and the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> deſired me to take Care of the Youths, and keep them together, leſt the Rabble, out of inveterate hatred ſhould offer them any injury; this I did, and ſecured them, ſo that not above one received any hurt</p>
            <p>Then I was ordered to get into Court, and take ſome Notes of the Tryals; which I did till they were over; the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> read them, and ſent me to the <hi>Tower</hi> to her Lord with them, to whom I ſhewed the little imperfect Remarques I had taken, he ſeemed to like them well; and, to encourage me to be induſtrious in other buſineſs, commended me highly for this, though I deſerv'd it not; and gave me far better encouragement than I ever had, either from his Lady or any body elſe, promiſing on his Honour to make my fortune if I would be ruled: then his Lordſhip ſent me to ſhew them, or rather to ſhew my ſelf to my Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> and the other Three Lords; but I being a ſtranger, and not well knowing where to find their ſeveral Lodgings, took with me one <hi>John Porter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Butler, who went with me to each of the other Lords Lodgings, to whom I privately ſhewed the Remarques; they all deſired they might be Printed, and gave money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, one a Guiney, another Fifty Shillings, one half a Guiney, another fifteen or ſixteen ſhillings; and when I returned to my Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> I told him what the other Lords had done, and he alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, and told me the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> ſhould do ſo too; and at the ſame time his Lordſhip told me, ſome perſon employed by them had taken the whole Tryals, and they were at one <hi>Turners</hi> a Book-Seller (but a Catholick) to be Printed, and ordered my Notes to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his, and one intire Relation to be compoſed out of both, as was afterwards done; then was the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> come to Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Lodging, and the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> deſired his Lordſhip to come into his Bed-Chamber where I was, and as ſoon as Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> eſpied me, he did me the Honour to lay his hand on my head, and promiſed I ſhould be well rewarded for all my diligence; and at the ſame time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52261:10"/>
Lord <hi>Powis</hi> asked me whether I had a faculty of Writing abuſively, and like a Satyriſt, and was Maſter of ſuch a Style as would look well in Print; for, ſaid his Lordſhip, that Sot <hi>Nevel</hi> is ſo very delatory, it is not to be endured, therefore if you dare undertake the Writing of ſome ſound Pamphlets, it might be of very great Uſe to us; to which I replied, that I was not a competent judge of my own abilities, but would do my beſt.</p>
            <p>Then Lord <hi>Powis</hi> told me Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> ſhould be allowed Ten ſhillings <hi>per</hi> week to Dyet me, and his Lordſhip would allow me three pound <hi>per</hi> week for my expences in buſineſs; and what ever hapned to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, I ſhould put into a Bill, and bring or ſend it to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and I ſhould forthwith have it paid; the ſaid Three pound ten ſhillings <hi>per</hi> week was conſtantly paid me, whilſt I ſerv'd them.</p>
            <p>Then I was adviſed by both the Lords to lodge at <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> which advice came very ſeaſonably; for I knew very well, that I had given my Landlord juſt occaſion to harbour ſtrange thoughts of me, and conceive ſuſpitions to my diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>About the eighteenth of <hi>June,</hi> the Counteſs, who knew that I was then lodged in <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> and by her Lords order, ſent me with a Letter to the Lady <hi>Tukes</hi> Lodgings in <hi>Scotland-yard;</hi> which Lady ſeemed to take particular notice of me, and was pleaſed to ſay ſhe liked me very well, and gave me two Guineys, and demanded if I durſt undertake a deſperate Enterpriſe? I anſwered yes; then ſhe went into her Cloſet, and wrote a Letter for the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> and gave it me to carry her, and ſo I took my leave.</p>
            <p>In my Return, I went to wait on my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> who asked where I had been? I anſwer'd, at the Lady <hi>Tukes,</hi> and ſo told his Lordſhip how ſhe received me; at which he ſeemed to be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and ſmiled; and demanded if the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> had not delivered to me her ſelf, or cauſed to be deliver'd ſome Papers relating to a buſineſs of <hi>Oates,</hi> for which one <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> were in Priſon in the <hi>Gate-Houſe.</hi> To which I anſwer'd no; Then ſaid he, I will write to the Counteſs about it, and order you Money, and give you directions how to proceed in it: There I waited till his Lordſhip writ a Letter, which I carried to Lady <hi>Powis;</hi> but firſt being ſent for up, I gave her Ladyſhip the Letter, who, before ſhe opened it told me, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> would give me Money to get <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> out of Priſon. I then asked what they were in Cuſtody for? The Lady modeſtly anſwered, 'twas by <hi>Oates</hi>'s means; but if I could get them out he ſhould not reign long in his Roguery. From thenceforth I undertook it, and had all the buſineſs, and Papers delivered me, by one <hi>Lawſon</hi> an Attorny of <hi>Clement's-Inn,</hi> who had been endeavouring two Terms to remove them by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> but could not: I forthwith went to the <hi>Gate-Houſe,</hi> and found means to ſupply them both with Money, though they were cloſe confin'd; and, by a courſe that I took upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52261:10"/>
advice with the Prieſts, there they had Pen, Inke, and Paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them both; but eſpecially <hi>Lane,</hi> who writ the firſt Letter, which was to this effect,</p>

            <p>This Letter was taken from <hi>Lanes</hi> hand under the door, by one <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> then a Priſoner in the <hi>Gate-Houſe;</hi> and by him given to one Mrs. <hi>Ayry,</hi> who brought it to me at <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> and I ſhewed it the Counteſs, who was more tranſported with joy than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; and breaking out as it were into a Rapture, Has God given us this unexpected help ſaid ſhe? Well, we will (God-willing) employ it to the beſt advantage, charging me to uſe all expedition to get them both out; and then I withdrew. But as I underſtood the next day, the good Counteſs, was the greater part of that day on her knees, to render thanks to Almighty God, for this new occaſion of ſtrength, that ſhe ſuppoſed he had been pleaſed to bleſs their Cauſe with.</p>
            <p>From that time I was very induſtrious in this buſineſs; and had ſeveral Motions in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> before I could get either of them to the <hi>Bar;</hi> but at laſt I brought <hi>Lane</hi> out upon Bail, to the great ſatisfaction of the whole <hi>Catholick</hi> Party, but <hi>Knox</hi> I could not get out; but have ſince been inform'd by himſelf, that <hi>Nevel</hi> told ſome Friends of his, that he did it; and had Money from the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now when I had got <hi>Lane</hi> out, the Counteſs ordered me to bring him to <hi>Powis-houſe;</hi> and lodge him there for the preſent, and ſhe would allow Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> Ten ſhillings <hi>per</hi> week for His Dyet alſo, as ſhe did for mine; then came Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> the Counteſſes Gentleman, one day, and ſaid his Lord had ordered that <hi>Lane</hi> ſhould go by the name of <hi>Johnſon,</hi> as he did afterwards, during the time he continued there, which was about three weeks; and Lady <hi>Powis</hi> in my Hearing gave order to the Porter, that he ſhould bid the reſt of the ſervants take care that Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> went not abroad, for they were in a thouſand fears, and Jealouſies concerning him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, leſt Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould find him, and clap him again in Priſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, leſt he ſhould run away of his own accord to Mr.

               <hi>Oates,</hi> and be prevail'd with to give ſome Teſtimony againſt the Lords, and</p>
            <p>Thirdly, leſt the whole Deſign of this Plot ſhould miſcarry thereby; for they thought it concerned them as much, to invalidate the King's Evidence, and render the perſons of his Witneſſes infamous; as to act any other part whatſoever.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> gave order for the altering of <hi>Lanes</hi> name, I gave him a Bill of <hi>Lanes</hi> Charges to carry to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which amounted to near twenty pound, about fourteen days after, the Lords had other occaſions for raiſing a contribution; and amongſt other Money, this was then collected, and paid to Mrs. <hi>Cellier;</hi> for ſhe had furniſhed me with Money for <hi>Lane,</hi> as ſhe did for my own buſineſs, to the value of near one hundred pound; and that very night that <hi>Wood</hi> paid Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> the twenty pound, (for that was the Sum he brought) he ſmiled on me; and told me, it would not be long ere the worſt was finiſhed; for, ſaid he, the Lords have conſulted, that before <hi>Oates</hi> is indicted there muſt a rumour be ſpread abroad of a Plot amongſt the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> and ſomething of it muſt be made appear, to beget a belief in the people of it; the management of it he told me, or at leaſt a great part of it, would be for me in a little time.</p>
            <p>But after <hi>Lane</hi> came from the <hi>Gate-Houſe,</hi> and before <hi>Knox</hi> could get out, one Mrs. <hi>Ayry,</hi> who went to <hi>Lane</hi> before, went then to <hi>Knox,</hi> or rather to the Prieſts; for they were ſo cloſe confin'd, that 'twas very difficult, and dangerous to ſpeak with either of them themſelves, but ſome of the Prieſts there conveyed Pen, Inke, and Paper to him under the door, with which he alſo wrote; and as he has told me ſince, he had that convenience of writing the Papers againſt Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> which he ſaid, were all Pen'd by himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Knox</hi> was releaſed out of Priſon, he came alſo to <hi>Powis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> by the direction of Mrs. <hi>Ayry,</hi> where by the Counteſſes order he treated with Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> about the Indicting of <hi>Oates;</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> did by Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Requeſt enter into a correſpondence with me; and a while after deliver'd me the Papers, which <hi>Lane,</hi> and <hi>Oſborn</hi> had given the ſaid <hi>Knox</hi> at firſt, before either of them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: thoſe Papers I ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from thence they were ſent to <hi>Nevel</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> who made what alterations in them, he thought fit; and ſent a Letter to me by Mrs. <hi>Cellier's</hi> Boy (who uſed to carry Letters between his Mrs, and me, and <hi>Nevel,</hi> and the <hi>Tower, &amp;c.)</hi> with directions to draw up an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> for <hi>Lane</hi> to Swear (which I did accordingly) before Sir <hi>James Butler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little after this, <hi>Nevel</hi> ſent <hi>Knox</hi> his Papers to Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> to peruſe, and make what additions, or alterations his Lordſhip ſhould think fit; He ſent them to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> who gave them me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52261:11"/>
to <hi>Knox,</hi> which I did; and he has ſince out of thoſe Papers, drawn an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> and perſuaded one <hi>Oſborn,</hi> lately a ſervant to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> to ſwear the ſame before Sir <hi>William Dolbin</hi> Knight, and theſe are the Papers, out of which an Indictment was to be framed againſt Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> the Contents of the ſaid Paper I cannot remember, farther than the bare matter of Fact, which was,</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was to be Indicted, firſt for <hi>Perjury;</hi> and if he were nor Convicted upon that, then a ſecond Indictment was to be preferr'd againſt him for a <hi>Buggery</hi> pretended to have been attempted on the perſon of <hi>John Lane,</hi> who I ſuppoſe now offers to Swear the ſame: though the Indictment was drawn by the moſt venomous Pens of Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and his true Second, <hi>Nevel;</hi> and what he ſhould Swear, was by them, and others put into his Mouth.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Knox</hi> had prevail'd with <hi>Oſborn</hi> to Swear the ſaid <hi>Affidavit,</hi> he came to ſhew it me; and offered to let me take a Coppy, but I being employed in other Affairs of greater importance, had not then time to Tranſcribe it, only I told the Counteſs what <hi>Knox</hi> had done, who was very glad of it; and then believed what I ſaid to be truth, (though now her Ladyſhips opinion of me is much alter'd) and the Counteſs at the ſame time asked, if <hi>Knox</hi> were in a Condition to defend his Tryal. I told her I ſuppoſed not, for that he had divers times deſired me to lend him Money, then the Counteſs promiſed he ſhould have Money; and bid me tell him ſo, to encourage him, (which I did) and the Counteſſes farther Command was, that if <hi>Knox</hi> did at any time want Money, I ſhould furniſh him; and place it to account, and that all the Money, which ſhould be Collected for him ſhould paſs through my name, and as Money lent him by me, leſt any thing ſhould be diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>About the Fourteenth of <hi>July,</hi> I went to the <hi>Tower;</hi> for their Lordſhips had ſent for me, where I received orders to have <hi>Lane</hi> ſent out of the way from <hi>Powis-houſe;</hi> for, ſaid the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> I am informed that <hi>Oates</hi> is making enquiry after him, which if it be true, and he ſhould be found at my houſe, 'twould ruine us all; but I being employed in other buſineſs could not ſend him away immediately, according to his Lordſhips Order.</p>
            <p>About a day or two after, the Counteſs, amongſt other things, earneſtly deſired me to ſend <hi>Lane</hi> into the Countrey; for ſaid ſhe <hi>Oates</hi> is buſtling about after him. The next day Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> brought me Money, which I gave to <hi>Lane;</hi> and ſuch neceſſaries as he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for, and I ſent him down to <hi>Greys</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and promiſed to ſend him ten ſhillings every week (for that was his conſtant allowance.) Soon after, he ſent me word, that <hi>Oates</hi> had by ſome means or other heard where he was; and therefore he deſired to be removed to ſome other place; then by the Counteſſes order I took horſe, and went to him, and ſent him to Town again to <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> where he continued
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52261:12"/>
two or three days longer. Then when I was at leiſure, I ſent him to the <hi>White-Hart</hi> at <hi>Tottenham,</hi> where he ſtayed; whilſt he was there, the Counteſs ſent me with a Letter, to the Right Honorable the Earl of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> Lord Privy-Seal, who was then at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> whither I rod on one of Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s horſes, and a Groom with me, and there had admittance to his Lordſhip; and according to the Counteſſes Command, I firſt delivered the Letter, and then ſhewed his Lordſhip <hi>Strouds</hi> Papers, and ſome other little things of the ſame nature; the Contents of the Letter, as I ſuppoſe by the ſlight Anſwer I had from his Lordſhip, was to beg ſome favour on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Munſon</hi> the Prieſt, but when I returned, and told the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs his Lordſhips Anſwer, ſhe ſeemed to be very much troubled, and What have we no friends, ſaid ſhe, has God wholly left us to our ſelves? I thought verily I ſhould have gooten Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> out of Priſon; but ſince we can do no better than we can, you are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that muſt do all our Buſineſs, meaning me: by this I find <hi>Munſon</hi> was to be the chief Agent in managing the New Plot, if they could have got him out of Priſon, and I only to have been his Inſtrument. But, if I miſtake not, he has taken as ready, and as ſure a Courſe to come to the Gallows, notwithſtanding his Confinement, as he could poſſibly have taken, had he been at large, as we were.</p>
            <p>Now from that night, by the Lords order (brought me by Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier)</hi> I began to go to <hi>Coffee-houſes,</hi> and had from <hi>Nevel</hi> an account which to go to, and which were moſt factious, as ſhe called them: <hi>(viz.)</hi>

            </list>
            <p>I choſe <hi>Farr</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, (for there were other perſons employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the reſt) whither I went every Night, till there happened a Quarrel betwixt one Mr. <hi>Keneſtone</hi> and my ſelf, about the Subject of my Diſcourſe, which was to be (as was order'd by the Counteſs, when ſhe came from the <hi>Tower)</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfry</hi>'s Death: I was to inſinuate, That my Lord <hi>Danby</hi> was privy to it; That he took part with the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and was confederate with them, to ruin the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> and ſuch like ſtuff.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52261:12"/>
At another time the Counteſs ſent a very great number of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, among which was that, call'd, <hi>The</hi> Danby <hi>Reflections,</hi> and many other Seditious Books, to <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> and ordered, That I ſhould take care for the diſperſing them into all parts; which I did: for ſome I put under Covers, and directed into the Country, to the Gentry there; others I ſent to little petty <hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> about the Town; and ſome I would venture to drop in the Streets, and in all Houſes where I could, inſomuch that I had like to have drop'd into <hi>Newgate</hi> again, for doing ſuch a Trick in an eminent Citizen's Houſe, which made me more cautious, and leſs eager of practiſing in that kind for the future. The ſaid <hi>Danby Reflections,</hi> and divers other ſcandalous Books were written by <hi>Nevel,</hi> now a Priſoner in the <hi>King's-Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two days after this, Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was brought to his Tryal; that being on the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> where I was order'd, by the Counteſs, to attend, and take what Notes I could, which I did, and ſent them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> by Mrs. <hi>Cellier;</hi> who, at her return, told me, The Lords liked them well; and ordred her to ſend me to them the next day: accordingly I went; where I received Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Command, To ſend for <hi>Lane</hi> out of the Country, and leave him to ſhift in Town on 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Week, which ſhould be conſtantly paid him by me; for from the time that <hi>Lane</hi> was enlarged, they were very fearful, leſt he ſhould do them a Miſchief himſelf, or be made uſe of by Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> to their diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> ordred me to attend one Mr. <hi>Dormer,</hi> a reputed Prieſt, who was one that Wrote Pamphlets; as <hi>The transforming Trayters into Martyrs,</hi> and divers others: and frequented the <hi>Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes</hi> for the ſame end that I did: 'twas alſo his Lordſhips farther or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That I ſhould converſe with one <hi>Turner,</hi> his Lordſhips Prieſt, (who, I ſuppoſe, is in the <hi>Tower</hi> to this day) and one Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> a Prieſt, at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Munſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kemeſh,</hi> and <hi>Nevel,</hi> and to follow their Orders in all Matters whatſoever, which I did: but firſt began with <hi>Nevel,</hi> who ſent me divers Papers, Pamphlets, and Letters, to Tranſcribe; amongſt which were 40 Liſts of Names, each Liſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about 800 Names.</p>
            <p>At another time I went into <hi>Southwark,</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Dowdwell,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Ayry,</hi> having received a Letter from <hi>Nevel</hi> to that purpoſe, but I knowing him to be very cautious, leſt any notice ſhould be taken that he and I correſponded, I forbore going to him my ſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired theſe perſons to enquire what Buſineſs he had with me; and withal I told Mr. <hi>Dowdwell,</hi> I would ſtay at a <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi> in the <hi>Mint</hi> for him, which I did; and when he return'd, he brought with him twenty ſeven Letters, moſt of them Writ by <hi>Nevel</hi>'s own Hand, and under one Cover. Theſe were to be Tranſcribed with all ſpeed: at the ſame time <hi>Nevel</hi> ſent, as many by Mrs. <hi>Ayry</hi> to the <hi>Tower</hi> as I ſuppoſe; the Contents of thoſe I know not, nor much of the twenty ſeven he ſent me, for I had not time to read
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52261:13"/>
them all, but what I did read I will here give you an account, to the beſt of my remembrance.</p>

            <p>The Third only mentioned the Names of ſome Perſons of Honour, of whom it is not convenient for me to give an Account here. Theſe pretended Letters were the Falſefies they intended to Alarum the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> with.</p>
            <p>When the 27 Letters were Tranſcrib'd, I ſent them by one of the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Servants to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and when the Servant return'd, he acquainted me, That he had deliver'd them to the Counteſs.</p>
            <p>Then I attended Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> his Lordſhips Prieſt, who was then at <hi>Powis-houſe;</hi> and deſired Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> at the ſame time, to find out ſome that were <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to write out ſeveral Copies of ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that he then had by him, that required an immediate diſpatch: then I asked him, If he had any thing of moment for me to do? he anſwered, Not yet.</p>
            <p>By this time had Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> provided one <hi>Sing,</hi> a Writer, and a School-Maſter, (whoſe Name I know not) to proceed in this ſcribling Affair, which they did; and the ſaid <hi>Turner</hi> found them and himſelf (and ſometimes Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> and my ſelf, when we were at leiſure) buſineſs for at leaſt a Week. The Contents of any of thoſe Papers I cannot remember, only that in general, they were in order to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the New Plot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52261:13"/>
But at that time I my ſelf was ſo employed with giving an Account to Mrs. <hi>Jeane,</hi> at <hi>Peterly,</hi> of the preſent poſture of Affairs, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with <hi>Munſon, Kemeſh, Sharp, Knowls,</hi> and others, (and amongſt the reſt, the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain)</hi> that I could not ſpare much time to write.</p>
            <p>'Twas about this time that Mrs. <hi>Ayry</hi> and Mr <hi>Dowdwel</hi> uſed to carry ſuch Papers and Letters as concern'd the Deſign in hand, to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and other Priſons about Town, to have the advice and conſent of the Prieſts and <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> there; for, as Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> told me, the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> refuſed to meddle in the thing, unleſs it were generally approv'd of, as it was ſoon after; for all that either ſaw or heard of it, agreed in opinion, that it was a very ſound thing, and, if well manag'd, would turn to very good account in a little time.</p>
            <p>Perſons were to be employed to carry theſe into all parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſome means or other uſed to Lodge them in the Houſes of ſuch as were the moſt eminent of the <hi>Presbyterian Party:</hi> Then others were to obtain Warrants upon other pretences, to make Search in thoſe Houſes, and to get the perſons committed, in whoſe Houſes they were found; this they hop'd would occaſion ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion throughout the whole Kingdom, that at laſt every body would be glad to ſave himſelf, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> come off upon the ſame terms that others did; but God would not ſuffer that, as you may perceive by the bad Succeſs all their Deſigns and Attempts had.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this was in agitation, there was a Rumour, That Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was ſought after upon ſome new Matters (which proved, as I ſuppoſe, to be more his fear, than any thing elſe) but for his better ſecurity, he was conveyed by night to Mr. <hi>Stamford</hi>'s Lodgings, in the <hi>Hay-Market</hi> (who is the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi>'s Reſident) and himſelf, as ſoon as he had received Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> into his Houſe, came to <hi>Powis-houſe</hi> to ſeek for Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> but being inform'd we were both in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Gardens,</hi> he came thither, and after ſome diſcourſe about Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s Buſineſs, told me, There had been faſtned on the Door of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Houſe, in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> a Paper, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a Menace; which was to this effect:</p>
            <p>Wakeman, <hi>Though you have eſcaped at your Tryal, think not your ſelf beyond the reach of Juſtice, &amp;c.</hi> or to this effect.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Stamford</hi> took Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> with him, to adviſe with Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> about his being conveyed into <hi>Flanders;</hi> but which way was not agreed on; but Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> came home, and told me, I muſt go early the next Morning to Mr. <hi>Stamford;</hi> which I did, and he brought me to Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> with whom I conſulted about his Paſſage to <hi>Flanders;</hi> I propoſed divers ways, but he did not approve of them; then Sir <hi>George,</hi> going into another Rome, Mr. <hi>Stamford</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52261:14"/>
and I contriv'd another way, which he afterwards refuſed; but then Mr. <hi>Stamford</hi> told me, the Queen's Majeſty had furniſhed Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> with 500 <hi>l.</hi> in order to his departure from <hi>England;</hi> And, ſaid he to me, you ſhall be at neither Charge nor Trouble in this Affair, but what you ſhall be gratified for: then I parted; and the next time that I came to Sir <hi>George,</hi> I adviſed him to go down to <hi>Rumney-Marſh;</hi> For, I ſaid, it was like he might meet with ſome <hi>French</hi> Shallop or Boat there, that might run him over to that Coaſt; but this Advice he did not then approve of: though he bethought himſelf afterwards, and went the next day out of Town, in order to it; yet when he was gone, he deſired, by Letter, That ſome other way might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted; which Letter Mr. <hi>Stamford</hi> ſhewed me, and deſired my advice; which was, That Sir <hi>George</hi> ſhould ſend a perſon in the Pacquet-Boat from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Calice;</hi> which perſon ſhould hire a Boat there, to come back to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt with him, and take Sir <hi>George</hi> in: this courſe was taken, and ſome four Miles to the Weſt of <hi>Dover,</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> took Boat, and ſailed for <hi>Flanders;</hi> where, in nineteen hours, (as I was ſince informed, by one of his Letters) he arrived ſafe at <hi>Newport.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time I had received by one of the Counteſſes ſervants an order to go to the <hi>Tower</hi> the next day, which I did, and after ſome diſcourſe with Lord <hi>Powis</hi> about Sir <hi>G. W.</hi> his Lordſhip told me that one Mr. <hi>Doyley</hi> had ſeen or heard of me, the laſt time I was with his Lordſhip; and had ſaid in the hearing of one of his Lordſhips ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, if ever he ſhould ſee me there again, he would have me ſecured, whereupon, Lord <hi>Powis</hi> deſired me, to come thither no more; but return to <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> and be careful of my buſineſs, and not go much abroad; and farther told me, that when any thing was ready, I ſhould hear of him by his Lady, who ſhould give me directions how to manage Affairs; and then he commanded me to go to Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> his Lordſhips Prieſt, and take directions from him, how to ſend Letters to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Holder</hi> his <hi>R. H.</hi> Auditor; the Letters contain'd an account of the whole Deſign; and were writ by the Counteſſes own hand, moſt earneſtly deſiring his good advice in an Affair of that weight, as being unwilling to do any thing without it; and pray'd his ſpeedy Anſwer; this Pacquet was made up by Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> and I Superſcribed it (by his direction) thus; For <hi>Tho. Holder</hi> Eſquire, at Mounſieur <hi>Keneydays,</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reſident in <hi>Bruſſells.</hi> This I ſent by Mrs. <hi>Cellier's</hi> Boy, to Mrs. <hi>Catherine Holder</hi> living at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; and deſired the ſame might. be ſent with all care, and ſpeed to her Unkle, which was done.</p>
            <p>I alſo remember I read part of one Letter, in which Mr. <hi>Holder</hi> was deſired to employ ſome ingenuous perſon there, to Cut, and Ingrave the impreſſions of divers Coats of Arms; the Patterns had been taken in Wax, from the Seals of the perſons to whom the Cotes belonged; as I believe, and were ſent over encloſed in the ſame Letter, being faſtned with other Wax to the Margent of it.</p>

Some time after, the Counteſs having received Anſwers to the Pacquet I cauſed to be ſent away, ſhe being then at <hi>Powis-houſe,</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Letter out of her Pocket; and deſired me to hearken, in which as I remember, ſhe read as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If you had taken this Courſe ſooner, much Innocent Blood might have been ſaved, but I doubt 'tis now too late; and fear the St.</hi> Omers <hi>Witneſſes being ſo Baffled as I hear they were, has much blaſted our Endeavours, but yet to my power I will aſſiſt; and do adviſe you to go on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Letters to the ſame purpoſe with thoſe, came the ſame time to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> who ſhewed them to me; and would highly applaud this Gentleman, for his great Wit and Courage in all their buſineſs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once, that if he had not been very careful, the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> had not been now alive.</p>
            <p>Then the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> about the end of <hi>July,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> did adviſe Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to go home to her own houſe; and as ſhe told me, the Lords gave her the ſame advice; and for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, They expected <hi>Powis-houſe</hi> would be ſearched by an Order of Council, and if any perſon more than their own Family ſhould be found there, it might be very prejudicial to the Lords.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That now Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was better adviſed, and they did believe he would be more mild for the future, in his proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions againſt the <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Current of Affairs, they ſaid, was now in a manner ſtopt; and the people began to ſpeak favourably of their Party, (but in that his Lordſhip was much miſtaken, or miſinform'd at leaſt, for in all my buſineſs I could not meet with any <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that did ſo.)</p>
            <p>Then I alſo removed my Lodging; and a little after, went to Lodge at Mrs. <hi>Cellier's</hi> houſe, where I had been about four days; where there came an expreſs Order to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> for me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe my ſelf as well as I could; and come forthwith to the <hi>Tower,</hi> I wondred at this, having been caution'd by the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> the laſt time I was there, to the contrary; but when I conſider'd of it, I did not believe it was about a matter of ſmall conſequence; and thereupon changed my Habit (as I often uſed to do on other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) and went that day to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and the better to avoid ſuſpicion, took my Boy with me, this being the firſt time of his going there.</p>
            <p>I went up ſtairs to Lord <hi>Powis</hi> by his Order; and after much diſcourſe (about the Opinions I met with in <hi>Coffee-Houſes)</hi> with his Lordſhip in the Dining-Room, he bid me follow him; which I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52261:15"/>
did, into his Lordſhips Bed-Chamber, where his Lordſhip alſo Diſcourſed me, about my thoughts of the times; and asked if I had any hope of alteration. I Anſwered yes, if the Deſign took ſuch effect as I wiſht it might; then from the Window, at the farther ſide of the Bed, came the Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> who, as I ſuppoſe, had been reading a Pamphlet there, or ſome ſuch Book; they both diſcourſed me above half an hour, and asked, If I had ſeen the five good men (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the five Jeſuits) and Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> Executed? I anſwered, Yes; and told them, They all Died with ſo much conſtancy and courage, as much amazed the Spectators in general, and my ſelf in particular: who had been commanded by the Counteſs, to go and ſee them die, that from their Sufferings, I might take the more reſolution, and become better ſetled in Matters of Religion. Their Deſign in this was, to make me eſpouſe the Cauſe with the greater Zeal: and certainly, had I followed their Lordſhips Orders, I had run a great hazard of ſuffering Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as they; But I thank God for having by his Providence delivered me from that Deſtruction, and, I hope, preſerved me for better Work than I had fooliſhly engaged my ſelf in.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> began to diſcourſe of Buſineſs more cloſely, and demanded, If I would do any thing to make my Fortune? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, Yes; (tho' I thought I had done enough for that already, but it ſeems his Lordſhip was of another mind) I would do any thing: Well then, ſaid he, Will you venture to Kill the King, for a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? At that I ſtood amazed, and my Countenance altered, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his Lordſhip took notice of it, and (after I was gon) told my Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> I had a great deal of Grace, in regard of my Bluſhing; which ſeemed ſtrange to his Lordſhip: who uſed to converſe, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with perſons that could both talk of and contrive ways how to Murder Kings (without Bluſhing.) My Lord, ſaid I, I ſuppoſe your Lordſhip is but in jeſt. No, ſaid he, I am in earneſt; and repeated his Queſtion: I was amazed ſtill, and knew not what to ſay; For I began to be afraid of my own Life, if I ſhould utterly reject the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; and, at laſt, made anſwer, That to ſerve them, I was willing to be the death of any perſon whoſoever, but the King and his Royal Highneſs. When he preſs'd it upon me the third time, I deſir'd time to conſider: then ſaid Lord <hi>Powis</hi> (who was preſent all the time) No, no, come; Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> only does this to try you:—And pray, my Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> ſaid he, what is it worth, or what would you give him for doing it? 'Tis worth, ſaid Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> 2000 <hi>l.</hi> No more ſaid Lord <hi>Powis?</hi> Piſh, away; if he will kill my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> he ſhall have 500<hi>l.</hi> for his Reward. All this while I ſtood mute, not knowing what to ſay, finding their Deſigns ſo bloody; but at length I enquired, Why they deſired the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Life; and how he might be diſpatch'd? they both replied, The thing would be eaſie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough: For ſaid Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> my Man <hi>Wood</hi> was there two Nights ſince, upon pretence of an Errand; but his buſineſs was, to view the Houſe, and obſerve what convenience there was for making an Eſcape, after the Fact done: he ſaid moreover, That <hi>Wood</hi> found the thing ſo feaſible, that after he came back, he ſaid, he was very ſorry he had not been
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52261:15"/>
provided to have done it then: And the reaſon, ſaid he, why we ſhould be glad to have him out of the way, is, becauſe we take for granted, if we were rid of him, (as they were of Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey)</hi> we ſhould find it no hard matter, to bear down all the reſt of our Oppoſers. After this, with much perſuaſion, I promiſed to undertake the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> (then Lord Preſident of his Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy Council;) and immediately, to perfect the Bargain, Lord <hi>Powis</hi> took me by the hand, and gave me Ten Guineys in earneſt, and wiſh'd me good Succeſs, but expreſly commanded me not to ſtir in it, till farther order, but told me, (one Mr. <hi>Reagaut,)</hi> a <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchant, of Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s acquaintance, ſhould come the Sunday following to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Houſe, to adviſe with me about the moſt dextrous way of putting the Deſign in Execution, and to ſecure the Payment of the 500 <hi>l.</hi> Upon which I took my leave, and went thither no more, (as I remember) leaving the two Lords toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who, I believe, were more concern'd at my rejecting my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi>'s Propoſal of killing the King, than pleas'd with my embracing the Overture made by them both, of Murthering the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> and, I believe, ſome perſons were employed to watch which way, and whither I went from the <hi>Tower;</hi> for they could not chuſe but be jealous of me, in regard my Colour went and came ſo often.</p>
            <p>The next day I went to wait on the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> whom I found in his Study, writing the <hi>Compendium;</hi> and I had time to read ſome part of a Paragraph, as it lay before him, on the Table, before he ſpoke to me: at laſt, riſing in a haſty poſture, and caſting an angry look upon me, <hi>Why were you ſo unwilling,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to do what you were taken out of Priſon for?</hi> whereupon, not knowing what his Paſſion might tranſport him to, I laid my hand upon my Sword, His Lordſhip made no Approach towards me; but his Paſſion ſeeming to continue, I thought it beſt, to retire, and accordingly went down ſtairs; and, in a rude manner, left him, and went home; and told Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was very angry with me; and that I would never come at him more. <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>'tis his manner to be angry one hour, and reconcil'd the next: and Men of that Temper are generally the beſt, and moſt fit for Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> adviſed me, to go to Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> the Prieſt, at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> and Confeſs, and Receive, (for then <hi>my Kettle wanted ſcouring</hi> more than ever, in regard of my late Promiſe in the <hi>Tower)</hi> I went to him accordingly the next Morning, where I Confeſs'd, and received the Sacrament: but, as I was coming away, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> who (it ſeems) had been informed how I behaved my ſelf to the ſaid Lord <hi>Powis</hi> and Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> and had heard of my refuſing to kill the King, would ſcarce ſuffer me to depart on thoſe terms, but told me, I ought to do Penance, for refuſing to ſerve God in what the Scriptures taught me was my Duty: whereupon I deſired to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, Whether or no they taught me any ſuch thing as to kill my
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52261:16"/>
King? He anſwered, Yes, if he were firſt Excommunicated and Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church: Then he made me kneel down the <hi>2d.</hi> time, where he gave me an Admonition of half an hour long, and enjoyned me for my Penance, that every Night twice, for 5 Nights following, I ſhould walk bare-footed (at a certain time of night fit for the purpoſe) from <hi>Powis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> to <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Back-Gate,</hi> and back again; which I did accordingly; and that every Morning, for five Mornings, I ſhould diſcipline my naked Shoulders with ſome <hi>Franciſcan-Cords,</hi> which he then gave me, and bid me be ſure to follow his direction, if I were minded to eſcape Damnation: then I took my leave of him, being extreamly confounded in my thoughts, and at a loſs how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my ſelf in this Affair, (for now I ſaw through all their Deſigns, and found both their Principles and Practice to agree with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> give of them:) I was then about to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to his Majeſty, and diſcover all I knew, or had been privy to; but when I debated the Matter within my ſelf, the Devil prevail'd, and I went home, where I found the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cellier;</hi> when the Lady ſaw me, ſhe ſent for me in, and laughed; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then more ſerious than I had been for ſome years before, told the Counteſs, 'twas not a laughing Matter: <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>do you know what I laugh at?</hi> I told her, I ſuppoſed I did; then her Ladyſhip en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into ſome Diſcourſe not worth the rehearſing; but, e're long, turning her face towards Mrs. <hi>Cellier, Well, well,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>Mr.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby <hi>will be honeſt, and do us no hurt, I am ſure.</hi> By this I found I was liable to ſome ſuſpicion; for the clearing of which, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make a ſmall Apology for my ſelf: we entred into other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, the Lady bidding me ſit down; and, amongſt other things, her Ladyſhip told me, His Royal Highneſs would be in Town ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, which would help to qualifie the Rage of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and produce another face of things; And, ſaid ſhe, there's one Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Payton,</hi> who intends to come over to the Duke's Intereſt; and asked me, If I knew him? I anſwered, No: then the Counteſs told Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> ſhe muſt take ſome care to provide a place for Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> to treat with the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> about his coming over: (for ſo they termed it) Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> anſwered, That no place was ſo fit as Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Houſe; becauſe he was the perſon who had firſt propoſed the matter to Sir <hi>Robert Peyton;</hi> and did from time to time uſe all his Endeavours to effect it; So that, ſaid ſhe, we ſeem, for ought appears as yet, to owe Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi>'s coming over, chiefly to Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Perſuaſions and Solicitations. The Counteſs was well pleas'd with Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Propoſal; and order'd me to go the next day to the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and acquaint his Lordſhip with this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Sir <hi>Robert Peyton.</hi> I replied, His Lordſhip knew me not; and ſo perhaps might not be apt to give credit to what I ſhould ſay: To make ſure, the Counteſs replied, ſhe would go home, and write a Letter to the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and ſend it by one of her Servants; (for the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> was return'd from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and was then in <hi>London,</hi> or at leſt aboutthe Town) then the Counteſs took Coach, and left us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52261:16"/>
Now in the Afternoon of the next Day, I went to <hi>Mill-Bank</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Houſe is, to wait on his Lordſhip: but being informed by the Servants, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Dined that Day either at <hi>Lockets</hi> or <hi>Lambs,</hi> which are both Eating-Houſes at <hi>Chearing-Croſs,</hi> I went thither, and found his Lordſhip; having firſt ſent up word by his Page, that there was one to wait on his Lordſhip from the Lady <hi>Powis.</hi> Then I was brought into the Room, and there gave his Lordſhip an account of my Buſineſs; and alſo told him, that Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> would meet his Lordſhip at Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Houſe on <hi>Tueſday</hi> next, at Five a Clock in the Evening.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip was very well pleaſed, and promiſed to be there at the time and place appointed: And he farther told me, One of the Counteſſes Servants had juſt before I come, brought his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a Letter, to the ſame effect, of which his Lordſhip ſhewed me the Superſcription.</p>
            <p>So I took my leave, and went directly to Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> at his Houſe in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (for ſo Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> adviſed me to do) that he might alſo have Notice of this Meeting, and let Sir <hi>Robert Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> know that the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> would not fail to be there according to appointment. Which Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> did, and ſeem'd to be very well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Then he and I entring into diſcourſe, I perceived his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance change; and looking very angerly on me, he told me, That he wondred I would offer to diſpleaſe the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and eſpecially the Lord <hi>Caſtlemaine,</hi> (who was then out upon Bail) who deſigned to advance me in the World, and help me to make my Fortune.</p>
            <p>I was not a little ſurpriz'd to hear ſuch Words from him, and asked him, If he knew the ground of their diſpleaſure?</p>
            <p>He reply'd, Yes, yes, he did: And falling into a great paſſion, ſaid,</p>
            <q>'Twas becauſe I would not Kill the KING.</q>
            <p>—I admire (ſaid <hi>Gadbury)</hi> at your Ingratitude, that when you could not propoſe to your ſelf any poſſible way of getting out of Priſon, and were like to have continued there as long as you lived, (had not the Charity of good People reliev'd ye) you ſhould notwithſtanding offer to refuſe it: (Telling me withal, 'Twas to engage me to make that Attempt that I was helpt out of Priſon.) Nay, (ſaid he) you might have done it with all the Security in the World; for no manner of Hurt could have befallen you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52261:17"/>
Why, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> would not Death unavoidably have been the Conſequence of it?</p>
            <p>No, ſaid he, not if you undertook it: For before you were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed out of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Priſon, I had an exact account from Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> what Year, Month, Week, Day, and Hour, you were born in; and the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> ordered me to Calculate your Nativity.</p>
            <p>(Now I do remember that when I was in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Hands of Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Maid a Letter, in which her Miſtriſs deſired me to give an exact account of the time of my Birth; which I did in my next Letter to her: But wondering what her meaning might be in deſiring it, I read the Letter to the Maid, thinking that ſhe might poſſibly be able to give me ſome light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: But ſhe pretended ſhe knew nothing of the matter; ſo I ſent her away.)</p>
            <p>And what I have told ye, ſaid he, appear'd to be ſo clear and demonſtrable, that you were by all (meaning, I ſuppoſe, the Lords in the <hi>Tower)</hi> adjudged, A Perſon deſign'd by Heaven for that bold and daring Enterprize.</p>
            <p>But I was ſoon weary of his Diſcourſe, and as ſoon as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently I could, I took my leave of him, and returned home to Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe, where I then lodged; and after ſome Diſcourſe of the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> I told what Diſcourſe had paſſed betwixt <hi>Gadbury</hi> and me, and how he had entertained me with Frowns; at which ſhe fell into a great Laughter, and ſaid,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Gadbury <hi>was in his Heart a good</hi> Catholick.</q>
            <p>This <hi>Gadbury</hi> was the Author of the Ballad of the Popiſh Plot, which was pretended to be writ by a Woman; and many other Seditious Pamphlets.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt underſtand, that after <hi>Gadbury</hi> had firſt Chaſtiſed me for not undertaking what the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> propoſed to me, I found him to ſmile in another occaſion, which made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Gadbury</hi> knew of the Deſign to Kill the Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> came Mr. <hi>Regaut</hi> the <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> Merchant, that the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> promiſed ſhould Treat with me about Murthering the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and Dined at Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> that Day: Before Dinner we had no Diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Buſineſs; but afterwards he told me of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and what I had promiſed at the <hi>Tower</hi> to the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> and the Lord <hi>Arundel;</hi> which I wondered at, not thinking him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52261:17"/>
to have been the Perſon: For I had divers times ſeen him at <hi>Powis</hi> houſe, with Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> but never thought or heard, that he was privy to any of our Buſineſs: (but now there is reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his knowledge of the whole) There he opened the manner of the thing to me, demanding how I would order the Money to be paid, when I had accompliſh'd that (bloody) Deſign, or if it ſhould be brought in Guineys, and left with Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> for me? I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, No, not ſo, for divers reaſons, but deſired when he heard of the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s death, and ſhould receive a Note from me, that the Money might be immediately paid for my uſe, which he promiſed ſhould be done; and deſired Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to let me know where he liv'd when I ſhould have occaſion to ſend to him. Then he told me I muſt adviſe with one Mr. <hi>Dormer,</hi> Mr <hi>Sharpe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knowls,</hi> Mr. <hi>Munſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Remeſe,</hi> and ſome others, about the manner of doing the Buſineſs, which I promiſed to do; that was all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I had with him then; ſo I having buſineſs in the City that night, I took my leave, leaving Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and him toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>On Monday morning I went to Mr. <hi>Dormer</hi> at Madam <hi>Dormers</hi> in St. <hi>John</hi>'s, where I told him my Reſolution about my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and he embraced me very kindly; but ſaid, he could wiſh that might be ſuſpended for a time: For ſaid he, there are ſome Prieſts that are falling (that is to ſay) troubled with remorſe of Conſcience, and were upon the point of diſcovering the Deſigns they were engaged in) their names were one <hi>Southerne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clay;</hi> the latter is now lodged at Mr. <hi>Blazedale</hi>'s houſe the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary in <hi>Arundol</hi> Street.</p>
            <p>Theſe perſons being thought dangerous, he demanded if I would venture to hire a ſmall Veſſel, and endeavor to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport them to any part of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Flanders?</hi> I promiſed I would, and he told me he would furniſh me with Money for it at his own Charge.</p>
            <p>Then I came away, and the next time I ſaw him, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome better way: For, ſaid he, Mr. <hi>Southerne</hi> I have ſent to a ſecure place in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clay</hi> is placed at Mr. <hi>Blazedale</hi>'s, who will be very careful of him.</p>
            <p>Then we diſcourſed of putting in execution the Deſign againſt the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpoke a great deal upon the Subject, but little to the purpoſe in my opinion: at laſt finding that I gave but little heed to what he ſaid, he took his leave; but on the Monday morning I went again to him to St. <hi>John</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52261:18"/>
After which I went according to order to Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> the Prieſt to Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>He lodged then at a Coffee-houſe in <hi>White-Fryers</hi> that has a Back-door into <hi>Water-lane.</hi> Of him I received the Sacrament; and had his advice about Murdering the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> which was ſo ſilly and weak, that I ſhall not mention any part of it here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowles</hi> ſent me to the Lady <hi>Abergaveney,</hi> telling me ſhe was a witty Lady, and held a great Correſpondence with the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and therefore was the more fit to give me advice.</p>
            <p>So I left him, and went to that Lady, who then lodged at one Mrs. <hi>Griffins</hi> houſe in <hi>Holborn-Row</hi> in upper <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was admitted into her Chamber, and let her Ladiſhip know who I was, and whence I came. She told me ſhe had heard much of me, and gave me thanks for my diligence in the Cauſe; but coming to treat about the main Buſineſs with her, ſhe told me 'twas as eaſie to Kill the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> as a Bird on a Tree. I asked her how? then ſhe propoſed ſeveral ways, but this amongſt the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I ſhould pretend to have skill in Curing the Gout, and be recommended by her to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and having acceſs to him for that purpoſe, ſhould watch my opportunity.</p>
            <p>She ſaid ſhe had advis'd with Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sharpe,</hi> and they had agreed upon that way as the beſt and moſt ſecure that could be.</p>
            <p>Then I went to <hi>Powis</hi> houſe, where the Counteſs was, to whom I repeated where I had been, and what diſcourſe I had with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the aforeſaid perſons, but particularly that Project of the Lady <hi>Abergaveneys.</hi> Which her Ladiſhip thought but a very weak Contrivance, but ſaid that perhaps it might do. So I parted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any orders to proceed as yet.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday in the evening Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> went to <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s a little before the time appointed, to diſcourſe with the Lord <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> and <hi>Gadbury</hi> about Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> as I ſuppoſe; and when ſhe went from home, deſired me to call at <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s for her, that we might go together to Mr. <hi>Stamfords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly I went to Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s, where I found her, and from thence we went to the place beforementioned; where Mr. <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> told us he had been informed from very good hands, that Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> had at that time employed a conſiderable number of Writers to deſcribe the whole manner of the Plot; but, ſaid he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will acquaint
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52261:18"/>
the King with it, and tell His Majeſty my thoughts, which are, That the deſign of it is to direct <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and the reſt, how to proceed, and carry on the preſent Plot, (meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I believe, their own) againſt the poor Catholicks; but I do not know whether he informed his Majeſty of it or not.</p>
            <p>From thence Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and I went home, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſent me to <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s, to enquire how the Lord <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> entertained each other.</p>
            <p>At their meeting, <hi>Gadbury</hi> told me they agreed very well, and ſtayed there ſeveral hours; but what they treated on he did not yet know, for he withdrew, and left them together.</p>
            <p>Then I returned and told Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> what he ſaid, who was very well pleaſed that their endeavors ſeem'd to ſucceed ſo well.</p>
            <p>Soon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after I met the Counteſs at Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> houſe, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me that the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> had given her Ladiſhip an account of all that had paſſed between him and Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> and alſo told me there were great hopes of him; but at the ſame time ſhe ſaid I muſt go forwards with all ſpeed to ſet ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue on foot againſt the Presbyterians; for his Royal Highneſs either was already come to Town, or would be here the next day; and ſomething muſt be done to make his Royal Highneſs believe the Presbyterians were carrying on a Deſign againſt the King and Government.</p>
            <p>Then we conſidered what courſe to take in order thereunto; but could not agree without better Judgments (or at leaſt then mine was.)</p>
            <p>So the Counteſs went away, and the next day ſent for Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> to the Tower; who, when ſhe returned, told me the Lords had ordered that I ſhould uſe all the ſpeed I could to find out ſome idle perſons that appeared well in apparel, and give them Money to go to the Coffee-houſes, and make enquiry of all the Clubs and Meetings that were about the Town, and get the names of ſuch as frequented them, and endeavour to learn how things went in all parts of the Town. This I promiſed to do; but not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with many ſuch perſons, whom I durſt truſt in ſuch an Affair, I employ'd only two or three, of whom I had a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion then of the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Bedford,</hi> by ſome called Captain, though he never was in Commiſſion, to him I gave 40 <hi>s.</hi> in <hi>Cliffords-Inn</hi> Garden, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make him ſenſible what it was for, and he was to proceed. He entred into a ſolemn Promiſe to uſe his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to give me ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52261:19"/>
Soon after I employed one <hi>Curtice,</hi> and gave him Ten Shillings Earneſt, and told him his buſineſs; who alſo promiſed to uſe his utmoſt Endeavour.</p>
            <p>Then was I my ſelf very buſie in viſiting moſt Coffee-Houſes about Town; where I found all things very ſuitable to our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Deſigns, and many Perſons very hot againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, ſome ſaying, The Plot was now moſt apparently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be theirs.</p>
            <p>This Rumour was very induſtriouſly ſpread about by all our Accomplices, as <hi>Wood, Dormer,</hi> the <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchant, my ſelf, and many others, perhaps unknown to me.</p>
            <p>By this time his Royal Highneſs was returned from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> ſent for me to give the Duke an account of this New Plot; by which it appears that his Lordſhip had heard ſomething of it before: And his Lordſhip has ſince declared to the King and Council, That Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> had given him an account of one <hi>Willoughby,</hi> as alſo of his behaviour in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſome part of a Presbyterian Deſign that was then on foot.</p>
            <p>But at that time when his Lordſhip ſent for me, I was unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and ſent the Counteſs word of it; who appointed me to wait on her at <hi>Powis</hi> Houſe that Night, at Four a Clock: which I did, and found her Ladyſhip there; who bid me ſit down and write: which having done, ſhe dictated, and I writ: and this which follows is the Abbreviation of that which was found by Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> in the Meal-Tub, for that was the Original, and what the Counteſs dictated.</p>

            <p>Then the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> the next Day by Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> recommended me to the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and deſired him (by a Letter that Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> carried then, as ſhe told me) to take me to his Royal Highneſs.</p>
            <p>In order whereunto, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and my ſelf were commanded to go directly to his Lordſhips Lodgings in the Stone-Galery at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> where we were told he would come to us, as he did, and told me I ſhould preſently ſee the Duke: But in the mean time, asked me, What I would ſay to his Royal Highneſs? Or if the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> or any Perſon elſe, had inſtructed me what to ſay?</p>
            <p>We were carried then into his Lordſhips Cloſet, where I ſhewed him my Buſineſs in Writing, and told him what I had to acquaint his Royal Highneſs with by word of mouth; which his Lordſhip well approved of, and highly commended me. Which gave me great encouragement to proceed: For had his Lordſhip not been too Credulous of the ſaid Story, it muſt certainly have been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered long before it was; for, as I ſuppoſe, his Credit and good Character of me to his Royal Highneſs, brought me to the Honour of Communicating the whole matter to His Majeſty, to whom I did deliver it as a Real thing, though indeed it was an abſolute falſhood, and only a Story contrived and conſented to in general, by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52261:21"/>
Party, and intended for a Mask, hoping whil'ſt the King, (if His Majeſty ſhould believe it) was preparing for the ſafety of His Sacred Perſon and the Government, againſt the pretended Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the Presbyterian Party, that they might have the more time to move on with their own Plot, which was ſtill to poſſeſs the the King with the real belief of the ſaid Sham-Plot.</p>
            <p>There we waited till his Royal Highneſs came from Supper, (for 'twas that time of Night) then the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> bid us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, where we were brought into his Royal Highneſs's Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and immediately the Duke came in, and had ſome diſcourſe with Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs was to acquaint his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about Sir <hi>Robert Payton;</hi> then turning to me, I fell on my Knee, and had the Honour to Kiſs his Royal Highneſs's Hand.</p>
            <p>I preſented the Duke with the Paper of my Buſineſs; and to the Queſtions which his Royal Highneſs asked me, I returned ſuch Anſwers as I was directed.</p>
            <p>Then the Duke told Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> he would ſtay there till Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Payton</hi> came: whereupon we both withdrew, and returned to the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Lodging, where we waited till his Lordſhip came, which was not till above an hour after.</p>
            <p>When we left his Royal Highneſs, the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> to the Duke, where, as his Lordſhip told us afterwards, Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> did behave himſelf much to the Duke's ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>He told me likewiſe, That his Royal Highneſs liked me well, and had promiſed his Lordſhip I ſhould be Encouraged; and then he told Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> had promiſed upon his Troath to employ all his Intereſt for the Duke's Service: And that his Lordſhip had moved her Buſineſs to his Royal Highneſs, (which was, That his Royal Highneſs would grant an Order for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome Money due to her Husband, which Order ſoon after was granted, and at Sir <hi>Allen Apſelyes,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and her Husband received One hundred Pounds, part of the ſaid Debt.)</p>
            <p>Then turning again to me, his Lordſhip alſo promiſed to aſſiſt me in the making my Fortune for the good Service I had done, and was ſtill like to do; and he bid me proceed in the ſaid Diſcovery; and from that time his Lordſhip called me Captain <hi>Willoughby:</hi> And as Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and I were coming away, his Lordſhip called in ſome of his Servants, and ordered that at what time ſoever either of us ſhould come to enquire for his Lordſhip, they ſhould be ſure to let him know it forthwith; which they promiſed to do, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home; where Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> could not reſt till ſhe had ſeen the Counteſs, to let her know what had hapned, and how we were received.</p>
            <p>And in order to it, the next morning early ſhe went to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and related the whole matter to the Lords, (as at her return ſhe told me) who were extreamly ſatisfied, and ſome of them were pleaſed to ſay, They hoped to find me an honeſt and an active Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52261:21"/>
Soon after this, the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> told me, I muſt go again to the Duke; to whom I was again brought by his Lordſhips means, and his Royal Highneſs told me I muſt wait on the King, (to whom he had delivered the Paper I had before preſented him with) and gave His Majeſty an account more at large of the Contents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and his Royal Highneſs then told me the King would order me money to proceed in the ſaid Diſcovery (of that new Plot) and then with his own hand gave me twenty Guineys to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me, and alſo promiſed (provided I could produce a clear proof to make good the account I had given of it) to make my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And I did really think that his Royal Highneſs did believe there was truth in this Sham-Plot.</p>
            <p>Then I returned home, and told Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> I had been with the Duke; wereupon ſhe perſwaded me forthwith to ſend the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> word of it, for 'twould be great ſatisfaction to him and the reſt of the Lords.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I diſpatcht my Boy to the Tower with a Letter that contained the whole Relation, and likewiſe deſired that ſince I was to wait upon His Majeſty the next day, their Lordſhips would be pleaſed to give me ſome Directions how to behave my ſelf there.</p>
            <p>That night I received no other anſwer then that the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> would be with me the next day at three a Clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. So ſhe was, at Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> houſe, where I received from her theſe following Directions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I ſhould be ſure to lay all the burthen I could upon the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by terians but particularly upon the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſerick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Colonel <hi>Blood,</hi> and ſome others, and that I ſhould explain to His Majeſty the meaning of the ſeveral contents of the Paper I had before preſented to the Duke and how the Presby terians were reſolv'd to uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavors for the reducing the preſent Government and ſetting up a Commonwealth once more, and ſetling the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in it; and that the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and other Perſons of Quality were iſſuing out Commiſſions to that purpoſe, and had promiſed ſome to divers perſons.</p>
            <p>This was the Story I was to tell the King, as I did, and then I thought His Majeſty believed the ſame to be true; but His Majeſty has ſince been pleaſed to declare in Council he did not give Credit to it, for that it was ſo impoſſible a thing; but yet to ſhew that he would not wholly ſlight it, till better ſatisfaction, was pleaſed to order me money by Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me in the farther diſcovery thereof; and ſoon after I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Colonel <hi>Halſel</hi> 40 <hi>l.</hi> but when he paid it me, he told me I muſt endeavor to make things a little more plain, or the King would not be well pleaſed; which I promiſed to do, and took my leave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52261:22"/>
Then I came home and told Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> what had paſſed, who went immediately to the Tower to let the Lords know, I had not only given His Majeſty a ſatisfactory Account, but had likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 40 <hi>l.</hi> by His Order to encourage me, which they were glad to hear, and then, I ſuppoſe thought fit to prepare ſomething that might induce a ſtronger belief, and gain more credit to the diſcovery but deſired me to go no more to Colonel <hi>Halſel;</hi> for it ſhould ſeem they had ſome reaſon to be afraid of him, leſt he might trace the Buſineſs till he had diſcovered it.</p>
            <p>This Order I followed, for I went no more to Colonel <hi>Halſel,</hi> though I had been commanded by the King, as often as I made any new progreſs in the Buſineſs, to give Colonel <hi>Halſel</hi> an account of it.</p>
            <p>When His Majeſty was at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> I was adviſed to ſend an account of ſome new Diſcovery made ſince the former; and this I was to deliver to Colonel <hi>Halſel</hi> to be ſent; for it was before I had received the 40 <hi>l.</hi> from him, and an Order from the Lords to apply my ſelf to him no more.</p>
            <p>The Paper I ſent was to this Effect. <hi>viz.</hi>

Soon after the King returned from <hi>New-market,</hi> which when the Lords heard of, they ordered me to wait on His Majeſty with a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Story, but much to the ſame effect with my former, and to apply my ſelf to Maſter <hi>Cheffinch</hi> to be brought to His Majeſties preſence, (Col. <hi>Halſel</hi> being the perſon that had brought me to him before) which I did, and His Majeſty ordered Mr. <hi>Cheffinch</hi> to bring me to Him, where I related my buſineſs, and withdrew; then I met the Counteſs again at Mrs. <hi>Celliers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> houſe, and gave her an account of my having been with His Majeſty: To which She anſwered, <hi>The next time I ſhould carry ſomething of greater moment;</hi> but that in the mean time ſhe ordered me to make diligent enquiry after one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Mansfield</hi> (for ſo ſhe ſaid his Name was) which I did, and with ſome difficulty found by <hi>Curtice</hi> where he lodged, and ſent word by Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> of it to the Tower; who when ſhe came back told me, The Counteſs ordered I ſhould be at home in the Afternoon, and her Ladiſhip would come to me; but in the mean time that I ſhould go to Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> to Confeſſion, and receive the Sacrament, (which is a cuſtom the Roman Catholicks conſtantly practiſe, either before the undertaking or after the effecting ſome damnable enterpriſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both, that their Father Confeſſor may palliate the thing to them under a colour of Religion, ſo as to make it appear meritorious, be it never ſo criminal) for the next Orders I ſhould receive would be for the putting in execution what had been reſolv'd on with relation to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> on this I took ſome time to pauſe, but at laſt did go to Father <hi>Sharp</hi> and Confeſs, and Receive; after which according to his uſual cuſtom, he conjured me by all that was good, to uſe all the poſſible ſpeed to ſtabb the ſaid Lord; after I had received Orders from the Lords ſo to do, I promiſed I would, and ſo left him. About three dayes after that, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> had received a Letter from the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> which made mention, that that very night I ſhould make my ſelf ready and go to Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s houſe in <hi>Alderſgate</hi> ſtreet, and deſire to ſpeak with him privately; but from Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> her ſelf I received a particular charge not to enter into any diſcourſe with my Lord, when I had him alone, but after a little Apology for my coming to his Lordſhip, (though an abſolute ſtranger to him, and neither ſent nor introduced by any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and deſiring to know whether if it ſhould fall out to be in my power to ſerve him, I might have his Lordſhips favour, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to do my buſineſs and come away. Then ſhe gave me a ſhort French Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as I ſuppoſe 'twas by the make, I asked whence ſhe had it, ſhe anſwered, that on Sunday laſt the <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchant had brought her three or four ſuch, and out of a Cubbord in the ſame room took the reſt, and bid me chuſe which I liked beſt, but I kept that which I had already, and made no further choice, and went directly to Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s houſe, where I was admitted, but there being divers perſons in the Room where his Lordſhip was, I deſired privacy leſt ſome of them might know me, and I be diſcovered; then his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſent me with one of his Gentlemen up ſtairs, whither his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip came to me in a little time; I repeated my ſtory to him, and his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52261:23"/>
Lordſhip ſeemed deſirous to have entred into ſome farther diſcourſe, but I was not willing to engage my ſelf in any, neither had I oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do what I went for, for there were ſome perſons at the other end of the Room; but if they had been away, it pleaſed God to ſtrike me with a ſudden fear and horrour of mind, inſomuch that I was utterly diſabled to have done him any miſchief, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of being diſcovered was ſo terrible to me, that I was in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be gone: So that I took leave, and came home, putting on the beſt countenance I could, leſt my face ſhould diſcover to Miſtreſs <hi>Cellier</hi> the great dread and terrour I was poſſeſt with; then ſhe was very earneſt to know what progreſs I had made, I anſwered I had been at Lord <hi>Shaftsburys,</hi> and diſcourſed with him, but there being more perſons in the Room, I thought it not ſafe to attempt any thing at that time; but withall pretended 'twas eaſie enough to be done, and promiſed to do it the next time I went.</p>
            <p>The next morning early ſhe ſent my Boy to the Tower with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to give an account to the Lords, that I had entered my ſelf at Lord <hi>Shaftsburies,</hi> and promiſed not to fail the ſecond time. The Counteſs her ſelf wrote an Anſwer to that Letter, and Ordered me to go to the King, and acquaint His Majeſty, that I had been with Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> in order to ſome farther Diſcovery of the New Plot, and tell His Majeſty <hi>verbatim</hi> what I had ſaid to the Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> and I was alſo to tell the Kings Majeſty, that his Lordſhip had promiſed me an Imploy, and that he would take care of me: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I went the next Morning to <hi>Whitehall</hi> to Mr. <hi>Cheffinch,</hi> and he brought me to the King, to whom I repeated my Leſſon; and the King bid me proceed.</p>
            <p>About two days after, I met the Counteſs at Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe, whom I told I had been with the King, and done according to order, then ſhe told me, I muſt repair to Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> that night to make the ſecond attempt, and frame a diſcourſe to him to this or the like effect, <hi>viz. That I was now come with ſomething that very nearly concerned both his Lordſhips Honour and Perſon,</hi> to wit, <hi>that if his Lordſhip ſhould be ſent for before the King and Council, and there have ſeveral Accuſations of High Treaſon brought in againſt him, and thereupon be committed to the Tower, and that the Evidence to maintain thoſe Accuſations ſhould prove to be Letters written by his Lordſhips own hand, that then I hoped his Lordſhip would believe I was his faithful ſervant.</hi> This I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do, and in the dusk of the Evening (Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> having delivered me a Dagger) I went the ſecond time, and ſent for Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> one of his Lordſhips Gentlemen to the door, and deſired to ſpeak privately with his Lord; he went in and returned, deſiring me to come in, which I did, and he took me into a Room, which I ſuppoſed to have been his Lords Cloſet, and deſired me to ſtay there, and ſaid his Lord would come to me preſently; but aſſoon as the Gentleman was gone, I looked about the Room and found another
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52261:23"/>
door, beſides that at which I came in; and open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>g it I found that it led into the Room where I had been with his Lordſhip before; then I concluded, if his Lordſhip had come into the Cloſet, that my way would have been to have Stabbed him, and having my chocie of two ways out, to have put out the Candle, and pretended to go ſome where to light it; and if any of the Servants ſhould have ſeen me with the Candle unlighted, to give it him or them, and tell them their Lord was in the dark, and they muſt make haſt up with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, by which means I might have opportunity to make my eſcape. But as providence had better ordered both for his Lordſhip and my ſelf, he came not into that Room, but ſent for me into the next: but before I ſaw him I had waited near two hours in the Cloſet, where in a Table-drawer I found many Papers and Letters, ſome of which I put into my Pocket; which when they came to be peruſed proved to be Letters from Sir <hi>Richard Bulſtrode,</hi> His Majeſties Agent now at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> but the Contents imported no more than the preſent poſture of Affairs in that Country. When I was ſent for into the next Room to his Lordſhip I was feiz'd with the ſame trouble and confuſion of mind that I had upon me the firſt time I came: then I began to conſider with my ſelf which of theſe two courſes it would be moſt adviſable for me to take, whether to yield obedience to the laws of an infinite God, who had power to ſave or damn my Soul, or to the commands of my Lords and Maſters in the Tower, who treated me as the Devil does his Vaſſals, putting me daily into new methods of Deſtruction, and incurring Everlaſting Damnation: But through the grace of God, I then made a wiſe choice, and reſolved to obey God rather than them. I was about to hint ſomething of danger his Lordſhip might be in, but other Diſcourſe ariſing it went out of my memory. So I left his Lordſhip to meditate on this confuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtory which I had repeated, and returned home with ſuch a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance, that Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> laughed and ſaid he has done the buſineſs; but when I anſwered I had not, but would take ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, ſhe ſeem'd not a little concerned, and the next morning ſent my Boy with a Letter to the Tower, to relate the ſtory I had told her, and in the Letter incloſed Sir <hi>Richard Bulſtrodes</hi> Letters which I brought from the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s with me the night before: I ſuppoſe the Lords were no leſs concerned than Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> was, for they aſſur'd themſelves that the thing would be done as certainly as that of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey</hi>'s was already done. But ſoon after my Boy came back, who returned without any anſwer, came Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> and told me, <hi>his Lord admired that I of all people ſhould be ſo great a Coward, &amp;c.</hi> but it was his Lords pleaſure to try me once more; and in the mean time that I muſt make haſt and go to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and tell the King all the diſcourſe I had with Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and ſhew His Majeſty theſe Letters of Sir <hi>Richard Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrode</hi>'s that he might give the more credit to me, and leſt Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſhould ſuſpect me, and be with the King before me, which he ſaid might be more prejudicial to me perhaps than I was aware of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that I muſt tell the King that a great quantity of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52261:24"/>
Papers very dangerous, and relating to the deſign of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> were in the Lodgings of one Mr. <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and pray a Warrant to ſearch the ſaid Lodgings. Preſently after I went to Mr. <hi>Chef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch,</hi> who placed me in a Room which his Majeſty was to paſs through: the King ſeeing me asked what I had to ſay to him? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I repeated what I was bid to ſay, and humbly prayed a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; his Majeſty commanded me to go, and acquaint Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> with the thing, and ſaid he would make me out a Warrant; ſo I went to Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> and acquainted him with it, and told him 'twas the Kings pleaſure that I ſhould wait on him for a Warrant, but Mr. Secretary refuſed to grant one, unleſs I would make Affidavit that there were ſuch Papers, and wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Contents of them were, which I could not do, for I knew not of any Papers in his Chamber then; for I ſuppoſe they were to have been put there after the Warrant granted; and if the Papers had been there at that time and I had been able to ſwear the Contents, it would have been plain that they were of my putting there, for elſe how was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to know the Contents of Letters in a Gentlemans Chamber whom I never exchanged two words with in all my life? ſo that I concluded the ſafeſt way for me was to let it alone.</p>
            <p>Then I returned home, where I found Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> who ſent me to the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s, to let him know what had happened, and how I had been twice at Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s, who had received me kindly, and told me he would take ſome care of me. I went accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to his Lordſhip, and acquainted him; who ſeemed to be well pleaſed that I had been with Lord <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> and his Lordſhip told me, When any Forces were raiſed, he would put in for a Regiment of Horſe, and would give me a Troop in the ſame, but withal his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip bid me be ſure to do his buſineſs the third time (meaning the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s:) Whereupon I went home, and juſt as I came in, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> came from the Tower, and told me, Some Perſons had been with the Duke, to deſtroy my credit with him, by giving him an Account of my Life; but ſaid ſhe, That ſtorm is over; for the good Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> have both waited upon the Duke, and not only perſwaded his R. H. not to believe it, but prevailed with him not to ſpeak of it to the King, which, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> told me, his R. H. had promiſed not to do.</p>
            <p>By this time Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> had been divers times with Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> at <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s, and once at leaſt (if not oftner) at Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s; and Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> had ſeen and ſpoke with his Royal Highneſs the ſecond time: and Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> told me the Duke had promiſed Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> to treat with the King about putting Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> and ſome others into the Commiſſions for the Peace again, which they had been formerly put out of by His Majeſties Order.</p>
            <p>Then the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> came to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s, and deſired to ſpeak with me, which I hearing of, came down out of my Chamber,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52261:24"/>
expecting to be chid ſeverely; but the Lady was very mild, and only enquired how His Majeſty reſented my going a ſecond time to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s, and of bringing the Letters from thence, and if I had gotten a Warrant. I told her, The King, I thought, was well pleaſed with me; but I could not by any means get a Warrant, unleſs I would make <hi>Affidavit</hi> that I had ſeen the Papers in <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s Lodging, and knew the Contents of them; which I ſaid I could not do. Then the Counteſs and Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> were both very angry with me, for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to make oath that there were Papersthere, and the Contents of them ſuch, as that the Secretary might think fit to iſſue a Warrant to ſearch for them: And began to argue the caſe with me according to the uſual equivocating way of that Party; Firſt telling me that I might have ſaved my Oath, for that I had formerly ſeen and been at the writing of ſome of them. Secondly, It could be no Perjury, if Oath were not made in'Court of Record. And laſtly, That I was by my Religion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to part with my life for the good of the Cauſe, and much more to ſwear a thing that was not inconſiſtent with truth.</p>
            <p>Then the Counteſs endeavoured to perſwade me to go the third time to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> which I refuſed, telling her, that I had ſuch a diſcompoſure in my mind, for having been there twice already, that I ſhould not be eaſie in a little time: then, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Counteſs ſtruck me gently over the hand with her Fann, and ſaid: <hi>Away, cowhearted Fellow, I my ſelf will go—No, Madam,</hi> (ſaid Mrs. <hi>Cellier) that ſhall not be, for I will go, and let the World know that ſome of our Sex are brave and more daring than the men;</hi> and promiſed to do the Work the firſt time, or dye upon the Spot. At the ſame time the Counteſs complain'd that all their Men of Courage were ſent out of the World, or ſecured in order to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Then the Counteſs asked me, If I knew where Mr. <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s Lodging was? I anſwered, Yes; and that I had been much troubled to find it out; then ſaid She, You timorous Perſon, here, will you take theſe Papers, and convey them privately into ſome part of his Cloaths, or into his Coat Pockets, or into any part of his Room, or his Trunks? I anſwered, 'Twas impoſſible for me to do that, becauſe I knew him not. The Counteſs told me, I muſt find ſome way to be acquainted with him, and take him to a Tavern, and drink ſmartly, and then take an opportunity to lodge the Papers in ſome part of his Cloaths, and immediately, upon pretence of his having ſpoke Treaſon, or ſome ſuch thing, call a Conſtable, and have him apprehended and ſearch'd, and carry the Papers to the King and Council, and ſo have him committed. For this was to be the Introduction to their real Plot.</p>
            <p>If this had been done, the whole Plot had gone on, and I was to have moved the King and Council to have impowered me to make Search in many other Gentlemens Lodgings and Houſes, both in City and Country. Then the Counteſs adviſed me to go and take a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52261:25"/>
ſome where, near his, and endeavour to inſinuate my ſelf into his acquaintance; and take my own way for the management of the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas that her Ladyſhip gave me fifteen Letters, and a Liſt of Names, one of which Letters, and the Liſt, being writ by her own hand. She deſired they might be tranſcribed, which I offered to do; But She told me that muſt not be, for the King had ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks already under my hand, and would know it again, and ſo we might be diſcovered, for theſe muſt be brought to the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Then She gave me order to go to a Scrivener over againſt <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-houſe,</hi> (becauſe I had no perſon that I durſt make privy to ſuch a Secret) and bid me to leave them with him, and pay the perſon for writing them; then She went away, and I went to the Scrivener, and got the Papers tranſcribed, and brought them back, and finding Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> together by the fire, I took the Letters out of my pocket, and ſhewed 'em them, telling them thoſe were the papers I had that day of the Lady <hi>Powis;</hi> they both peruſed ſome, if not all of them, and wiſh'd me good ſucceſs, and warranted me I ſhould be well rewarded for what I did in that buſineſs. Now the next Day being <hi>Wedneſday, October</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> 1679, I went into <hi>Ax-Yard</hi> in <hi>Kingsſtreet, Weſtminſter,</hi> and enquired for Lodgings, and being met by ſome that lived thereabout, I was directed to Mr. <hi>Alexander Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>'s Houſe, which was the place where the ſaid <hi>Mansfield</hi> lodged, where, under the feigned Name of <hi>Thomas,</hi> I enquired for Lodgings; the people readily took me into the houſe, to ſhew me what Rooms they had, but none would pleaſe me, but the two Rooms on a floor one pair of Stairs high, one of which being diſpoſed of, the Gentleman could not be diſpoſſeſſ'd without his conſent; which could not then be obtain'd, becauſe he was out of the way: So that for that time I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>I had then many Irons in the fire, and ſome of them, if I were not very nimble, would cool, for I was not to take a ſtep without directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from my great Maſters in the Tower, which having received, I went again on <hi>Fryday, Octob.</hi> 17, and agreed for thoſe two Rooms, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Gentlewoman of the houſe her price: for a little mony, I thought, muſt not break ſquares in an Affair of that weight, and Colonel <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> (for that is his true name) was willing to remove one pair of Stairs higher, that he might not hinder the houſe of ſo beneficial a Lodger as I appear'd likely to be. When I came that Day, the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Houſe being abroad, I was conducted by a Woman into the room whither <hi>Manſel</hi> was to remove, and there I was left alone for about half an hour; at which time (as appears by my own Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) I lodged the treaſonable papers behind the Beds head. I promiſed to come that Night, with my Friend for whom I pretended to have taken one of the rooms; but having an opportunity to let the Lords in the Tower know what I had done, and how I proceeded, they orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, by Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> to go again to the King, and deſire a Warrant
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52261:25"/>
to ſearch; whereupon I went to Mr. <hi>Cheffinch,</hi> and was brought to His Majeſty, whom I earneſtly entreated to let me have a Warrant: His Majeſty ſent me again to Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry:</hi> But no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant could be obtained; of which I ſent the Lords word: Then they Ordered Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to direct me to ſome of the Cuſtom-houſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who had power to ſearch the houſe; that I might pretend to inform them where a conſiderable quantity of prohibited Goods that had been imported were concealed: The next day being Saturday <hi>Octob.</hi> 18. I went to the Lodging, and enquired if my Trunks were come, but they heard of none; after ſome diſcourſe I departed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to come and take poſſeſſion the next Night, (for that Night I could not, my Friend being out of Town) but I failed then alſo. On Monday 20. I viſited them again, and enquired whether my Trunks were yet come, and being anſwered in the Negative, I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't again. On Tueſday Night, (having by that time got full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions how to proceed) about ten of the Clock at Night I went again with one <hi>Bedford,</hi> (who I told the Houſe was that Friend, for whom I had taken the other Lodging;) but that Night we both lay together in one Bed in the Room one pair of ſtairs forward.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday between ſeven or eight a Clock in the morning, <hi>Manſel</hi> being gone out about his Occaſions, came two Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe, with a Conſtable, according to my appointment, to ſearch for prohibited or uncuſtomed Goods: They firſt went into the Chamber where I and my Friend lay, and from thence were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by me into <hi>Manſels</hi> Chamber, where they made a thorow ſearch, breaking open the Trunks and Boxes, examining the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes, and at laſt, after intimation given by my ſelf, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remove the Bed, which they did three foot from the wall, or more, but could find nothing till I went behind it, and there eſpied a packet of Papers, (he that hides can find) and preſently asked, <hi>What's that there?</hi> The Officer having firſt taken them down, I with great haſt ſnatched a Paper out of his hand, and cryed out, <hi>Here's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon!</hi> It was a Liſt of Names, ſome at length, others only the two firſt Letters. The Searcher opening another paper, and beginning to read, I again cryed out, <hi>There's Treaſon againſt his Majeſty,</hi> (and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Papers, but the Perſon in whoſe Room they were found if he were preſent, ought to be ſecured:) The Officers knowing better what belongs to their own Office, than that of a Juſtice of Peace, took the Papers, and carried them not to a Secretary of State, (as I directed them) but to their own Maſters at the Cuſtom-houſe; then I left the Houſe and returned to Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> and ſent word by my Boy to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> that the Papers were ſeized by two of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe Officers; then the Lords fearing leſt there might be ſome trick played, Ordered me to go forthwith and tell the King the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how I cauſed the Papers to be ſeized; which I did: And His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſent me for Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> to give ſome Order in it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I returned to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> and told her, I had the honour to be in a Room with His Majeſty alone; <hi>Oh!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>What an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi>

               <hi>have you let ſlip!</hi> And ſoon after the Counteſs of <hi>Powys</hi> came, to whom I related the ſame thing, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> being then preſent, the Lady looked on her, and ſaid, <hi>How bravely might he have killed the King if he had been provided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time Mrs. <hi>Harris</hi> being in great perplexity at this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſurprizing ſeizure, ſends her Brother, and preſently follows her ſelf to find out <hi>Manſel</hi> at the ſign of the Cat in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, where he left word when he went out he might be ſpoke with at Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Clock; ſhe met him juſt going to the place, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Pen, ſhe relates to him in a great aſtoniſhment, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Affair, and out of her tender care for his ſafety, adviſed him to take lodgings in the City, promiſing to ſend him the reſt of his Goods; but he rejected her well intended, but in it ſelf pernicious Counſel; for his withdrawing would have been interpreted a flight, which would have argued guilt, and his perſonal guilt would have involved hundreds of Innocent Perſons in the ſame Condemnation: He told her therefore, that he was not conſcious to himſelf of any crime, and that he would go to the Cuſtom-houſe to know by what Authority his Box was ſeized, and learn what was become of theſe pretended Papers; accordingly he went thither, where he met with one Mr. <hi>Boſtock</hi> who was one of thoſe that had ſearcht his Chamber. He told him, That one Mr. <hi>Willoughby,</hi> the Monday before, came and informed them of two thouſand pounds worth of <hi>Flanders</hi> Silver and Gold Lace that had been imported, and was ſtowed in ſuch a place. But here <hi>Manſel</hi> underſtood that his Papers were all return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more than his own, for the Treaſonable Papers were return'd with them; and accordingly when he was come back to his Lodging he found the Box reſtored, and the Papers lying on the Dreſſer, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſcribed by the Maſter of the Houſe, For Colonel <hi>Manſel.</hi> Theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers he opened in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> deſiring him to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, and how many there were; and deſired Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> to ſet a mark on them that he might be the better able to ſwear they were the ſame when they ſhould come to be examined before Authority, which he reſolved they ſhould preſently be: In order to which he carried them with him to adviſe with a Friend what to do in the Caſe, who perſwaded him to go forthwith to a Secretary of State, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have done, but not finding my Lord <hi>sunderland,</hi> or any of his Clerks at the Office, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> being alſo from home, he addreſt himſelf to a Worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Warcup,</hi> to whom he laid open the whole Affair; and having got together the Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe, the Maſter and Miſtreſs of the Lodgings, and whatever other Evidence they then had, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> was pleaſed to take their Depoſitions: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter it appeared to have been a Malicious Deſign of mine, and thereupon he made out a Warrant to apprehend me, which having delivered to a Conſtable, they went along with him to Mr. <hi>Celliers,</hi> who is a French Merchant, and a Papiſt, where I did then,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52261:26"/>
and the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Boys formerly had lodged; there the Juſtice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Warrant found me.</p>

Col. <hi>Warcup</hi> anſwered me, That if I would find ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to appear at the Council-Board next Morning by Nine of the Clock, he ſhould give me no further trouble at preſent: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly Mr. <hi>Cellier</hi> the French Merchant, and Mr. <hi>Blaſedale</hi> the Apothecary entering into Recognizance for my appearance, I was Bail'd.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday October</hi> 23. in the Forenoon when the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned attended the Council in the Lobby, I met with a very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Rencounter, for as I was going down the Stairs of the Lobby, I met with one Mr. <hi>D'oiley</hi> an Officer belonging to the Mint, who had formerly known, and proſecuted me for uttering falſe Guinies. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying him, and being conſcious to my ſelf of my former Crimes, I began to Curſe without any provocation, and demanded, what <hi>D'oiley</hi> had to ſay to me, threatning if I had him out of the Court to cut his Croune; and that whenever I ſhould meet him in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, I would be revenged on him; at which, I ſuppoſe, <hi>D'oiley</hi> was ſurprized.</p>
            <p>But my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North</hi> paſſing by towards the Council, and overhearing what words paſſed betwixt us, Mr. <hi>D'oiley</hi> made his application to his Lordſhip, and preſently Mr. Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> was ſent for in, and ordered to take Mr. <hi>D'oiley</hi>'s information againſt me, and a Meſſenger was likewiſe ordered to take me into Cuſtody. Mr. Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> directed the Meſſenger to take me to the <hi>Kings-Head Tavern,</hi> whither he promis'd to come himſelf as ſoon as the Council was up: during our ſtay there I writ a Note to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to go to the Lord and Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and acquaint them that I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for they knew what: This Note the Meſſenger would not ſuffer the Boy to carry till himſelf had read the Contents of it, and then he diſmiſt him, who carryed it according to direction.</p>
            <p>That Morning the Council had before them the affair of Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> ſo that when Colonel <hi>Warcup</hi> had delivered in the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he had taken the day before about me, we were all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to appear in the Afternoon at Four of the Clock.</p>

In the Paper that I read were words to this purpoſe, <hi>I wonder at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and that the Four Lords have left us, for now the Tyrant has declared himſelf a Papiſt:</hi> At which words, I cryed out, <hi>Did not I tell you theſe were Treaſonable Papers?</hi> They ought to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and the perſon whoſe Chamber this is, if he had been here, and carryed either before the Council or a Secretary of State. <hi>Stretch</hi> alſo Swore theſe to be the ſame Papers, that were taken from behind the Beds-head, and that he did verily believe they were put there by me.</p>

               <p>The Council being met, Mr. <hi>Manſel</hi> put in his Petition, That the reſt of his Witneſſes might be heard; upon which His Majeſty was pleaſed to Order the Cauſe to be heard the next Council-Day.</p>
               <p>Then I moved, that till then I might be Bailed; the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Ordered, that I ſhould be taken into the Meſſengers Cuſtody, with which Order the Meſſenger acquainted me.

But the Meſſenger inſiſted upon his Order, and demanded my Sword, which I refuſed to deliver, but to another Meſſenger; then I was conducted to the Meſſengers Houſe. But before my departure thence, I did endeavour to prevail with Col. <hi>Warcup,</hi> by offer of a reward to Bail me a third time, deſponding of my ſucceſs in that ill affair; but Mr. Juſtice refuſed my impertinent offer.</p>

               <head>Monday October 27. 1679. <hi>At the Council-Board.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>About Five or Six of the Clock in the Afternoon, Mr. <hi>Manſel</hi> and I were called in, where after a ſhort Repetition of the Charge againſt <hi>Manſel,</hi> which was grounded upon thoſe Papers, I prepared to make my defence, having received freſh inſtructions how to manage it, and addreſſed my ſelf to His Majeſty, affirming, That there were in all Sixteen Papers found in his Chamber, and deſired to know what was become of all the reſt beſides thoſe Nine? And likewiſe what was done with the Box of Treaſonable printed Pamphlets, and two or three hundred Letters? Adding that <hi>Manſel</hi> had got together a Company of Witneſſes to diſparage the Kings Evidence, and to palliate his own Treaſonable practices; then I deſired I might have leave to ask him ſome Queſtions, which being granted, I proceeded thus,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether he did not frequent a Club held at one <hi>Streets</hi> Houſe, a Chandler in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Market?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether he did not know one <hi>Diſney, Grange, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Liſle,</hi> and one Captain <hi>Brown?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether he did not bring into that Club one Night, a Scandalous Pamphlet, called <hi>A Word without Doors,</hi> and there publickly read it?</p>
               <p>And Fourthly, Whether after he had read it, he did not utter Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious words againſt his Royal Highneſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52261:28"/>
                  <hi>Manſel</hi> owned that he knew many of the Gentlemen that I had named, but that they were all very honeſt Gentlemen, and good Subjects, and all of them Inhabitants in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſaving only Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Brown,</hi> who had been Lieutenant to Major <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Troop of Horſe, in his Royal Highneſſes Regiment; But all Treaſonable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them or any other he did utterly diſavow, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon commanded to call the reſt of his Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Harris</hi> firſt appeared, who Witneſſed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there were not Sixteen Papers, but Nine only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boſtock</hi> teſtified the ſame thing, and further, That theſe Papers, then before the Honourable Board, were the ſame Papers found behind the Beds-head, and that he did verily believe I had placed them there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stretch</hi> being ſick, did not appear, but his Depoſitions were read, tending to the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Bedford</hi> was called in, who gave a full relation how I came to him on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night before, to deſire him to Lodge with me at ſome new Lodgings that I had lately taken. He confirmed the Evidence of Mrs. <hi>Harris,</hi> and the reſt, as to the manner of ſearching the Chamber, and finding the Papers: Adding further, That he went to Mr. <hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe to ſpeak with me, and told me what an ill thing I had done, and how I had not only injured Mr. <hi>Manſel,</hi> but himſelf, by engaging him in ſo vile a buſineſs, which now was ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid open: And therefore deſired me to diſcover the whole truth to him, and who had put me upon it: To which I replyed, (not caring to enter into diſcourſe with one who I knew had given Teſtimony againſt me) That I doubted not but to come off; for the Greateſt man in <hi>England</hi> had ingaged me in it; That he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me whom I meant? whether I meant the King? To which I made no anſwer: That he further told me, he underſtood I held Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> in the Tower, and that he had ſeen the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> her Coach the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, ſtanding before my Lodgings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D'oiley</hi> was the next Witneſs that was called in, who Depoſed, That he had proſecuted me at two ſeveral Seſſions held in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> for uttering falſe Guineys. I was askt what I could ſay to that? and anſwered, That indeed I had been twice proſecuted there by <hi>D'oiley,</hi> but all was out of pure malice. I confeſſed that I had been Fined fifty pounds for the firſt offence, and had obtained His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Gracious Pardon, but was acquitted the ſecond time; ſo that I hoped thoſe matters would not be remembred againſt me now. The Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> demanding of me, Who had ſollicited His Majeſty for my Pardon, I anſwered, Captain <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52261:28"/>
Afterwards <hi>John Cook,</hi> my Boy, was examined, who teſtified, That he was ſent with a Meſſage, and a Note from me when I was in the Meſſengers hand, to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> deſiring her to acquaint the ſaid Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> that I was taken in Cuſtody for the old buſineſs that he knew of. That two Months ſince, I had lodged in the Lord <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> his houſe in <hi>Queen-ſtreet.</hi> That he had ſeveral times waited on me to the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> his Lodgings in the Tower, which he deſcribed to be in the <hi>Mint.</hi> That he had rode behind the Coach to attend me thither. That he had ſeveral times carried Letters or Papers from me to the ſaid Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and brought me Anſwers back. And laſtly That the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> had ſeveral times been at Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s, and that particularly on <hi>Saturday</hi> was ſevennight, the ſaid Lady had been alone with me in a lower Room, in private Diſcourſe above half an hour.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor was then pleaſed to ask me, <hi>Whether I had been at the Lord</hi> Shaftsbury<hi>'s?</hi> To which I anſwered, <hi>That I had been ſeveral times with him, and had diſcourſed with his Lordſhip:</hi> And I there repeated part of what paſſed betwixt us: To which the Lord Chancellor replied, <hi>That I was a fine Fellow, to come firſt to His Majeſty, and tell him one Story; then to the Lord</hi> Powis, <hi>and from thence to my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury<hi>'s, and diſcover to one what Diſcourſe I had had with the other: and bring one Story to the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and another to the Council.</hi> Then all were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to withdraw, there being no need of the reſt of Mr. <hi>Manſel</hi>'s Witneſſes in a matter ſo plain and clear: And preſently a Warrant iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Board to commit me to <hi>Newgate;</hi> and Order was given to Mr. Attorney General for my proſecution. Here follows the Council Warrant for my Commitment to <hi>Newgate.</hi>

                  <hi>The Inſtructions which the Lady</hi> Powis <hi>delivered to me in the Stone-Gallery in</hi> Whitehall, <hi>were as followeth. (viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I am ſuſpected to have put the Letters behind the Bed when I went to take the Rooms, I can eaſily make that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52261:29"/>
improbable; For I neither knew what Room <hi>Manſel</hi> would lye in, nor that I my ſelf ſhould lye there at all: And when I was told which Rooms were to be let, it appears I did not deſire <hi>Manſel</hi> ſhould quit his Lodging to give me place. And after I had taken the Lodgings, there is no proof that I was any more in <hi>Manſel</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings till the ſearch was made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Stretch</hi> ſwears, That whilſt he was ſearching, I went round the Bed, and he believes I then put them there, becauſe I eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them firſt. But 'tis ſtrange that the Miſtreſſes Brother, one Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger more, and others that were then in the Room ſhould not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any ſuſpicious behaviour in me, as well as <hi>Stretch.</hi> I am like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuſpected, becauſe he ſwears I declared the Letters to be treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Papers before I ſaw the inſide of any one of them, and that none of them was ever read to me. Which that it is falſe, Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> can witneſs for me. I deſired them to ſeize all the reſt of his Letters and Pamphlets, which were of great conſequence, and a conſiderable number of both, and bring them immediately to the Council; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I went, expecting to find them, but it ſeems they were carried to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and afterwards ſent to Juſtice <hi>Warcup;</hi> and five or ſix of the Letters found behind the Bed taken out, and all the Pamphlets, and two or three hundred Letters more, and a Parchment or two with great Seals, returned to Mr. <hi>Manſel</hi> again, and only ſuch as were thought fit produced here.</p>
               <p>I deſire alſo to know when and where the Writings were delivered to him again, and why they are not all produced as well as ſome?</p>
               <p>And why they were not forthwith carried to ſome Secretary of State to peruſe?</p>
               <p>And by what authority he had examined the Boy?</p>
               <p>And why he gave him Wine?</p>
               <p>And why the Boy was threatned to be ſent to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Conſtable?</p>
               <p>And why he was afterwards encouraged, and ſpoke kindly to, and commended for the prettieſt Boy they everſaw?</p>
               <p>Now if the Boy (who if asked can declare I never fore inſtructed him in the leaſt) would not tell the truth (as they call it) without threats and careſſes, I humbly conceive little credit will be given to what he ſays, but if it were truth and had come freely from him (as it did not) he is not of age to underſtand an Oath.</p>
               <p>Let Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> be asked, If this <hi>Manſel</hi> did not uſe to go to a Factious Club in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Market? And if he did not bring a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Pamphlet thither, call'd <hi>The Word out of Doors,</hi> and read the ſame there, and applauded it?</p>
               <p>I deſire to know whether he is not acquainted with Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> Mr. <hi>Diſney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alſop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kenniſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wray,</hi> Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whittaker,</hi> and others of the ſame Faction about the Town? And if he has not frequented their Meetings? If he has, he may juſtly be ſuſpected; for theſe are moſt notoriouſly Factious Perſons, and diſaffected to that degree, that they cannot endure to hear any ſpeak well of His Majeſty, or the preſent Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52261:29"/>
Now I would fain know how <hi>D'oiley</hi> could be ſo well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, as to know my Name to be any other than <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and what Authority he had to Examine the Boy, and when he ſaw me at the Tower, and how often? And how long he has had the Counterfeit Guiney, and from whom? And how he came to attend the Council juſt that morning I was there? And if I miſtake not, he has ſince declared, if I had not ſpoke to him he would have ſaid nothing to me; why then ſhould Mr. <hi>D'oiley</hi> now pretend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Counterfeit Guiney againſt me? Or why not when he ſaw me in the Tower, or ſince? for he has met me divers times in the ſtreets: Can this appear to be any other than meer malice, or ſome mercenary act procur'd by <hi>Manſel,</hi> or ſome of his party to invalidate my Teſtimony, and colour their own deſign?</p>
               <p>Now my Lords, I humbly conceive, that to counterfeit Guinies is Treaſon, and if Mr. <hi>D'oiley</hi> knew me the Authour of it, it muſt be miſpriſion of Treaſon at leaſt in him to conceal it thus long.</p>
               <p>He alſo went divers times to one <hi>William Leigh</hi> a priſoner in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> (whom himſelf had apprehended for Clipping and Coyning) and offered for ſixſcore pounds to procure him a Pardon, and that he ſhould be diſcharged without ſo much as being Indicted for the Crime, which had been done, had not others prevented it; and the like propoſals he made to divers others that were to be tryed in <hi>York-ſhire.</hi> By all which Circumſtances it ſeems to be very plain and clear, that they have uſed all poſſible means to deſtroy me. But I know I am before a Juſt and Wiſe King, whom I humbly deſire to conſider my honeſt-endeavours to do Your Majeſty Service.</p>
               <p>The <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> made a ſearch in the Houſe of Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> where in a Meal Tubb he found that Book which contained the Model of the deſigned Plot againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, which hath been already mentioned.</p>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>To the Depoſition of Mr.</hi> Jolly <hi>a</hi> Taylor, <hi>her Ladyſhip ſayes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſhe had two or three ſhort notes from me, as alſo a great pacquet of papers brought by <hi>Jolly</hi> from me, but looking them over, ſhe found them very inſignificant things: That once or twice ſhe had ſome ſhort notes from me, but was much ſurprized to receive them.</p>
               <p>She affirms that I never told her of my having been alone with the King; though ſhe was indeed told it by Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> but for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52261:33"/>
any ſuch anſwer, as to lament that I was not then prepared to Kill the King, ſhe never gave it, and abhors any ſuch thoughts, having never heard of any ſuch thing, or any other Treaſon in her life.</p>
               <p>That for my Lodging ſo long at her houſe, all the ſervants are able to teſtifie, That it was without her knowledge, and when ſhe came there I ſtill endeavoured to keep out of her ſight.</p>
               <p>I ſaid that after I was to make my firſt appearance at the Council, Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> went to her Ladyſhip to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to frame an excuſe touching forty ſhillings that ſhould have been lent me by one of her Ladyſhips ſervants. Her Ladyſhip anſwered, It was true Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> came to her with a ſtory in her mouth of about forty ſhillings ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one of her ſervants, but her Ladyſhip chid her ſeverely, and told her ſhe would keep no ſervant that would be guilty of ſuch a thing, her Ladyſhip added, that ſhe never ſaw me but twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mrs. Cellier</hi> being called in, and askt whether ſhe had not been at the <hi>Tower</hi> with the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> to frame ſome excuſe for me, flatly denyed the ſame, but being told that the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> had even now owned it, ſhe then confeſt that on <hi>Thurſday</hi> ſeven-night ſhe was there, and told her Ladyſhip how her Husband and her Son <hi>Mr. Blazedale</hi> were bound for my appearance, when Juſtice <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup</hi> came and took me from her houſe.</p>
               <p>That I did indeed adviſe her to ſay ſomething touching money due to a ſervant of the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> but that her Ladyſhip hearing thereof, was diſpleaſed at it, then ſhe railed at me.</p>
               <p>And being told of her induſtry to get my Nativity caſt, ſhe ſaid that I having deſired the ſame, ſhe got <hi>Mr. Gadbury</hi> to do it, but I affirmed <hi>Mrs. Cellier</hi> ſent her maid <hi>Margaret,</hi> whileſt I was in Priſon, for the time of my Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bedford</hi> was then called in, who referred himſelf to the account he had given of his Correſpondence with me by Information, to Mr. Juſtice <hi>Warcup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further ſaith, That he went about with me to ſeveral Clubbs.</p>
               <p>That he went with me alſo to <hi>Thompſon</hi> in <hi>Fetter-Lane,</hi> who was then Printing the <hi>Presbyterian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmaskt:</hi> That I have often brought with me to the Coffee-Houſe papers freſh and wet from the Preſs: That I went to pay moneys to Mr. <hi>Dormer</hi> in <hi>St. Johns</hi>'s: That I enquired of him after Clubs; and that he naming the <hi>Kings Head</hi> Club, thither I went, and would have got a Liſt of the Names, but the Drawer refuſed. The like happened at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52261:34"/>
place; but at the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> we got a Liſt of about Eighty Names of ſuch as uſed to meet there.</p>
               <p>Afterwards we went to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Ship Taverns,</hi> to enquire if the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had not been there the Night before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
               <p>That I told him how by <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s means I was acquainted with <hi>Sir Robert Peyton,</hi> and by him was getting into the <hi>Kings-Head</hi> Clubb, but that <hi>Sir Robert</hi> diſſwaded me upon the account of the Charge, for that they did ſometimes make a Purſe of one or two Guinneys a man about ſpecial ſervice.</p>
               <p>That I lay for a time at the Goat near <hi>Exeter-houſe,</hi> and that going with him thence to drink Cock-Ale, it ſo flew up into my head, that going into a Coffee-houſe I raiſed a great quarrel there about a Word relating to Sr. <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> the Matter of which had been heard by Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> That I ſhewed him a Paper called <hi>The State of the Three Kingdoms,</hi> that I told him, that the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tounge, Sir VVilliam VValler, &amp;c.</hi> had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings about <hi>Fox-Hall</hi> about the Plot, and that it was there hatched by them, and that I had Lodgings at <hi>Mrs. Celliers,</hi> and lamented once unto him my wanting of Twenty Pound for ſome great deſign; that I had been at the Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s, whom I complained of as a Dilatory man.</p>
               <p>That I asked <hi>Bedford,</hi> if at their being together in <hi>Cliffords-Inn-Garden,</hi> he did not receive from me a Gift of forty ſhillings, and if I did not diſcourſe to him ſo and ſo concerning the D. of <hi>York,</hi> and the D. of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and about <hi>Scotland,</hi> and touching three hundred Horſe that were to be raiſed by <hi>Sir VVilliam VValler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bedford</hi> denyed any Gift of forty ſhillings in the Garden, but that he borrowed forty ſhillings at two other times.</p>
               <p>That he never ſpake to me of either of theſe Dukes, or of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And as to the three hundred Horſe, he ſaid he had given an account of it to a Miniſter of State.</p>
               <p>I replyed, That as to this of the three hundred Horſe, he ſpoke it alſo to <hi>Mr. Stanford</hi> the D. of <hi>Newburgh</hi>'s Agent, who if called upon, was able to teſtifie the ſame.</p>
               <p>Mr. Juſtice <hi>VVarcup</hi> coming in, acquainted the Board, that <hi>Mr. Cellier</hi> and his Son-in-Law <hi>Blazedale</hi> the Apothecary did both attend, and that there were yet wanting the Examinations of ſome of their ſervants: Upon which the Lord Preſident directed him to take thoſe Examinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52261:34"/>
                  <hi>Blaſden</hi> called in and Sworn, ſaid, That <hi>Margaret</hi> brought him a Note for <hi>Opium</hi> to cauſe Reſt; but he refuſing to follow that Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he mixed ſomthing that was leſs Dangerous, which the Maid afterwards told him ſignified nothing; and therefore ordered him to mix ſomwhat a great deal ſtronger.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cellier</hi> being asked about the Paper of the Nativity, ſaith, He read it not himſelf, but that his Daughter read it to him; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred only ſomthing of Propheſie, or a Man's Fortune: That there were in it the words <hi>Horoſcope, Venus, Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. That the Man ſhould be Hang'd at laſt; but he knew no more of it, or of whom it was, but that he burned the Paper, and Owned, That he was a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Merchant.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Blaſden,</hi> in whoſe Houſe the Paper was read, ſaid, It ſet forth, How that his Adventures ſhould be very various, and that he ſhould come before ſome Judge, and be in Danger in a Sea-Fight.</p>
               <p>Then I asked <hi>Cellier,</hi> if he did not remember when in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Wife, I ſaid, I was then come from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury?</hi> This he deny'd, and alſo that he heard any Diſcourſe extraordinary between me and <hi>Rigaut,</hi> but that <hi>Rigaut</hi> had been twice at his Houſe, and that I and he played at ſome Game together: He denied alſo that he ſaw any Dagger in his Houſe, or that ever any was hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Beds-ſide: He acknowledged to have ſeen the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> at his Houſe, but not ſix times in all.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Blaſden</hi> ſaid, He had ſeen her Ladiſhips Coach a dozen times, which he could ſee plain from his Shop; but did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen her Ladiſhip go into Mr. <hi>Cellier's</hi> above twice.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> was called in, and having been told what was Objected againſt him as having encouraged me at his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Houſe, to go again to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and to be ſure to Diſpatch him the third time: His Lordſhip flatly denied any ſuch thing; and then in a large Diſcourſe appealed to the known Method of his Life and Converſation, his Conſtant Services to the Crown, and how little he had been concern'd in this Matter, as being known by all Good men not to be capable of ſuch a Thing: That as to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> he came lately Over with great Expectation of his aid and favour in Parliament; touching an unhappy Difference ariſen with a great Ally (meaning his Son-in-law's Father.) And that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had already teſtified ſo much Countenance in this matter, that he came over full of Inclinations to do that Lord greater Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices than he can well expreſs.</p>
               <p>That before his Daughter was diſpoſed of in Marriage, a very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady, the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> who had teſtified very great Inclinations,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52261:35"/>
to have her Married to her Ladiſhip's Nephew; upon which Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he then grew Intimate with the ſaid Lady, and being a Perſon that is not wont to forget his Friends in their Afflictions, had often gone to that Lady, to give her the beſt Comfort he could; That wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her Ladiſhip when he came lately from <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him juſt at parting a very Charitable Woman, one Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> unto whom the late Dutcheſs of <hi>Tork</hi> was a Debtor in 5 or 600 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That his Lordſhip being one of the Duke's Commiſſioners, did promiſe to further her Buſineſs: That in further Recommendation of this Woman, the Lady added, That ſhe was a great Servant to the Duke and alſo to the King: And alſo being a Woman of great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and getting Acquaintance by her Opportunity of being a Midwife, into many conſiderable Families, ſhe had wrought about ſeveral Incenſed Perſons to be of better Principles and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both to the King and the Duke. And more particularly, that this Woman had now found out a Man who was very able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any dangerous Practices againſt the King.</p>
               <p>That Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> came ſoon after to his Lodgings, that ſhe gave a great Character of one <hi>Willoughby,</hi> who had much improved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abroad in the Service of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and under the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa;</hi> that this man coming over and reſorting to the Coffee-Houſes, was much Suprized at the Rebellious diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that he heard; but that concealing his thoughts, he grew Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with the moſt Mutinous, who liked him ſo well, that they carried him to their Clubs and private meetings, and being admitted to their Secrets, he found that great and dangerous things were preparing againſt the Parliament.</p>
               <p>That ſhe deſired his Lordſhip but to procure a Warrant for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Search, and that all the whole matter would be Plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but ſhe deſired that this Warrant might be obtained without the King's knowledge: That of all this Information, his Lordſhip gave an Account to the <hi>Duke,</hi> who refuſed to have any thing acted therein without the King's knowledge; That I came with Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to his Lodgings where the Duke ſaw me, and I was afterwards handed to the King.</p>
               <p>That when I came afterwards to his Lordſhip, I mentioned the difficulty of getting a Warrant; and Complaining of want of zeal in the King's Miniſters, I ſaid I would yet do my buſineſs without a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and by the Cuſtom-houſe way.</p>
               <p>That as concerning my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> I told him that there was ſome Woman about the Duke that Writ to the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> all the dangerous things ſhe could Invent; and to make proof of this, came afterwards to ſhew two Letters, which his Lordſhip
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52261:35"/>
preſently ſaw were Written in Sir <hi>Richard Bolſtrode's</hi> hand; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing touching the Duke, but ſuch matters of Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> as he himſelf or any other man might fitly write.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he ſaid, I pretended to him that there was a third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater Importance, which he had loſt; but as to thoſe two Letters, his Lordſhip ſaid they were given to the King.</p>
               <p>Soon after this I came to him at Midnight, and ſaid I was going to Priſon; To which his Lordſhip could only ſay, That if I were guilty of any Crime, he knew not how to help me; but if I were to ſuffer by miſtake, the King's Miniſters would ſoon diſcover it, and ſet me again at Liberty.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip upon my queſtion owned, That he being at Dinner at <hi>Lamb's,</hi> I came there to him about a Meeting to be had at Mr. <hi>Gadburies</hi> with Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> and perhaps it might be upon a Letter from the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> as I had affirmed.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip did acknowledge, That he gave his Servants charge to admit me when ever I came; And that he did alſo call me Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Willoughby:</hi> but the occaſion was, that I telling his Lordſhip, that I hoped his Majeſty would gratifie and provide me as good an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment as I had refuſed from the other ſide; his Lordſhip did ſay, Doubtleſs His Majeſty will provide for you, and that when ever any Forces were ſent abroad, I ſhould not neer to fear but that I ſhould have a Company.</p>
               <p>That he did not wonder at all at my confident Words, ſince they had been the beſt Cards I had to play for my Life: but that his Lordſhip's actions have been ſuch, as will except him from any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reflection that can happen by ſuch a Creature as I.</p>
               <p>As to the buſineſs of Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> he would conceal nothing that the Council deſired to know. And firſt he ſaid, he knew not that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was Privy to any thing relating to me, but that Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> telling him (as he ſaid before) the good Offices ſhe had done the King and Duke, with ſome that were Inflamed againſt him, ſhe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> for One, who told her, That if he could be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given what was paſt, he would come in and help the Government; but that his greateſt fear was from the Duke, who was thought to be a Perſon of Animoſity that could not Forgive: That when his Lordſhip aſſured Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> of the contrary, ſhe told him that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> would not be willing to meet at any Publick Place, but at <hi>Gadburies</hi> he would; where accordingly they met, where Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Peyton</hi> declared, He would come into the Kings Service to all Purpoſes; that he ſeem'd to complain of ſome hard Meaſure, and doubted much of the Duke's reconciliation; but his Lordſhip going
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52261:36"/>
far towards Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s ſatisfaction, he afterwards met the Duke at his Lordſhip's Lodgings, and had all the Aſſurance he could deſire; which is all that he knew or could ſay concerning Sir <hi>Robert Peyton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I did acknowledge, That I told his Lordſhip of an Ill Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Duke's Family that correſponded with the Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and I had loſt one of the Letters.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip told the Board, That he could not but be troubled to have his name mentioned by ſuch a Perſon as I was; but yet if any whoever ſhould come to morrow to him again and tell him of any dangerous Practices againſt the King, and the Government, whether by the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> or any other Lord whatſoever, he ſhould hold himſelf bound in duty to Hearken to any ſuch Perſon, and to Indeavour to diſcover ſuch danger by all the waies he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Webb</hi> of <hi>Miſſenden</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> being call'd in, ſaid, He knew me, but remembred not when I went down to his Houſe, but that I was ſent by Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> and not by my Lady <hi>Powis;</hi> That he knew nothing of any Letters ſent down by me, or of one Mr. <hi>Jean,</hi> or any other Prieſts at his Houſe; that I only went down to fetch up a Child.</p>
               <p>Then I Objected, That he knew <hi>Jean</hi> ſo well, that at his laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from home, he brought him a Letter from <hi>Jean,</hi> being then at Mrs. <hi>Cellier's. Webb</hi> denying this, the very Letter found by Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was produced and read; upon which, Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> ſaid, It was poſſible, but he had forgot it. And I ſaying, That Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> was by when that Letter was delivered to him, <hi>Cellier</hi> denied it. But I replyed, That <hi>Webb</hi> knew all, as well as what he would now excuſe.</p>

at all of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Plot, mentioned by me, and ſaies he never carried to the Tower the Pamphlet called, <hi>Traytors tranſform'd into Martyrs;</hi> but that indeed he had one of thoſe Books, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he gave it to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> meeting her once with me in <hi>Tower-Street.</hi> He owned that he ſaw me once at the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffee-Houſe, and there pull'd off his Hat without ſpeaking to me; That he had ſeen the Danby-reflections, but knew not who writ them.</p>
               <p>Being asked, if he had heard any thing of the Murder of the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury?</hi> he ſaid, That ſeveral Moneths ago there was ſuch a report; And that one <hi>Adamſon</hi> a Watchmaker with a Barber and others in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> were concern'd in it; but that he never heard any thing elſe thereof, much leſs ever conſulted ſuch a thing with the Lady <hi>Abergaveny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he knows <hi>Turner</hi> the Bookſeller, and had the Pamphlet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, from him; but denyes that he ever writ the ſame, or that he ever delivered Five Pounds to one <hi>Sharpe,</hi> to pray for any man's ſoul.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Woodman,</hi> who lives in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> at the Corner houſe of <hi>Parker's Lane,</hi> being called in, ſaid, That <hi>Margaret,</hi> formerly Maid to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> had been without attending, but would be gone; though ſhe adviſed her to ſtay, and that being out of ſervice ſhe knows not where to find her.</p>
               <p>The Lords bid her tell <hi>Margaret,</hi> if they met, that a Meſſenger ſhould take her in Cuſtody, unleſs ſhe would attend the Clerk of the Council of her own accord.</p>

                  <hi>Friday, Novemb.</hi> 7th, 1679. in the Afternoon.</head>
               <p>I was ſent for to Council, and in my preſence <hi>Margaret Jenkins,</hi> formerly Servant to Mr. <hi>Cellier,</hi> being Sworn, and Interrogated by me, anſwered,</p>
               <p>That ſhe carried Money to me in <hi>Newgate,</hi> but remembred not how much it was. That I was afterwards in the <hi>Counter,</hi> and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly to her Miſtriſs to get me out, ſhe ſent the Examinant to me with 50 s. But the ſame not being ſufficient, ſhe brought it back again, and 3 l. was afterwards ſent.</p>
               <p>She acknowledged, That her Miſtreſs bid me get out by <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and that being out, I ſhould preſently come to her.</p>
               <p>That ſhe did carry ſeveral Letters between me and her Miſtreſs, but knew not what they concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52261:38"/>
That ſhe did carry two ſmall Vials to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> but knew not what was in them, nor whether the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that Advice.</p>
               <p>That after carrying the firſt Bottle, ſhe went next Morning to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and that I ſent for a ſecond Bottle, it being in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vial Glaſs.</p>
               <p>She owned, That I ſpake to her about ſending to Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and told her alſo of my acquaintance with <hi>Strode,</hi> for that we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been Padding together.</p>
               <p>That ſhe once brought Money to me to give to <hi>Monſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> did acquaint the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> of my deſire to ſee Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi> To which her Ladiſhip anſwered, I might do what I pleaſed, for ſhe would not meddle with that matter.</p>
               <p>That I told her I made <hi>Strode</hi> high in Drink, having taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that hindred me from being in that Condition; and that I gave her ſome Notes of what I had then learned from <hi>Strode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Cauſe of her turning away, She ſaid it was on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: An <hi>Iriſh-Man</hi> who is a Sollicitor, came once and told her, That her Miſtreſs had got a Rupture by keeping me in her Houſe; And that the truth was, We lived in ſuch a manner together at <hi>Powis-Houſe,</hi> that the Old Man her Husband was ſent up thither to keep us honeſt; That of this ſhe gave ſome Account to Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s Daughter, and upon this occaſion ſhe was turned away; her Miſtreſs alſo telling her, That ſeeing ſhe could not live quietly at her own Houſe, ſhe had no further need of her Service.</p>
               <p>She ſaid, She ſaw me twice at <hi>Powis-Houſe,</hi> that time ſhe was there waiting at the Table on her Miſtreſs and me, and that ſhe poached Eggs for us. Being asked, Whether ſhe did not lately hear from Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> by way of Advice and Inſtruction, how to behave her ſelf? She denyed that ſhe had any Letter or Meſſage from her, or had ſeen her of a long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nevil,</hi> aliàs <hi>Payn,</hi> was called in, he ſaid he knew me, and had ſeen me four times at <hi>Powis-Houſe.</hi> That he knew not of my going to Mr. <hi>Webb</hi>'s in <hi>Buckinghamſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he never had any Letters or Papers from the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> in his life; but that betwixt him and Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> many Letters and Papers had paſt: And denyed not, but that the <hi>Danby-Reflections</hi> paſt out of his Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52261:38"/>
By Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> the Papers of <hi>Knox, Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi> were brought to him for his advice, which having given, he ſent back; he remembred that I did attend in the Rules when Mrs. <hi>Ayry</hi> and <hi>Dowdel</hi> came over to him, but knows nothing of twenty ſeven pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that he ſhould ſend to me, and deſires if any ſuch thing were objected to him that he might ſee his hand.</p>
               <p>That for the many Liſts objected to have been writ over by him, he denied the ſame; he ſaid he knew <hi>Monſon</hi> and <hi>Keymiſh</hi> from many years acquaintance; he owned that Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> came to him in the Fleet, to tell him of <hi>Prance</hi> his being tortured, and how that the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was ſetting up <hi>Strode</hi> to be a new witneſs; he ſaid I told him, that he had turned <hi>Strode</hi> the wrong ſide out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>He denied the ſending of any Letters or Liſts to his remembrance, or any Letter to the Tower by any Woman: He knew nothing of the <hi>Affidavit</hi> made by <hi>Lane,</hi> but would not deny that ſuch a thing might have been. He ſaid that <hi>Knox</hi> was troubled he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare as he did, for that he was told, that he was taken out of priſon by Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> charity.</p>
               <p>He ſaid that the ſecond diſcourſe he had with me at <hi>Powis</hi>'s houſe was, concerning Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> having offered to procure me an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns place under the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in the late expedition to <hi>Scotland,</hi> or elſe that I ſhould ſtay and depend upon her.</p>
               <p>He ſaid farther, That Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> from being his friend, became his enemy. I replied, That Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> had ſent him 80 <hi>l.</hi> and that her husband had been his ſecurity to keep him from priſon, but that upon ſome difference ariſing upon complaint made, that <hi>Nevils</hi> daughter was like to turn Whore, old <hi>Celliers</hi> withdrew his ſecurity, and ſo <hi>Nevil</hi> was returned to priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nevil</hi> in anſwer to this reviled with many paſſionate expreſſions, and as to the writing the Pamphlet <hi>Timothy Touchſtone,</hi> he denies it, and ſays he knew nothing of Mr. <hi>Jeane</hi> the Prieſt in <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to one <hi>Cox</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> he ſaid he had been his Agent about his buſineſs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but denied to have heard any thing from him about Ten thouſand pound, which I objected; he acknowledged that he was ſtill for the advice of Indicting falſe witneſſes, and had twenty times adviſed the Indicting <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> but as for the framing a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot, and to draw men into it, it had been a great villany, and he utterly denies the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:52261:39"/>
That he only had from Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> Fifteen pound; but that ſhe had of his money Seventeen pound; That the commerce between her and me was very ſcandalous, and ſhe was ſuſpected to defraud the Charity which came through her hands, which by the Collection of all forts of Catholicks was about Twenty two pounds <hi>per</hi> week.</p>
               <p>He acknowledged, that he adviſed me to compound my debts, and not to depend upon ſhifts of Law.</p>
               <p>He owned that he received all the Trials that were printed, and had fingered them out, as would ſtill appear by the Books he had by him; for that ſeeing how ill things hung together, and that ſome things looked like perjury, he thought it would be eaſie to frame Indictments againſt the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>That as to his informing me of a Liſt of mutinous Coffee-houſes he denied the ſame, having never been in above four or five in his life, but it was notorious enough how all the Coffee-houſes were factious.</p>
               <p>He declared his great hatred and animoſity againſt Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> who formerly indeed came to him every day, but that ſhe cauſed her husband to withdraw his Bail, and he was again clapt up.</p>
               <p>To this I objected, That it was not altogether Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> but the advice of the Lords in the Tower, that he ſhould be again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; foraſmuch as when he was formerly in that Condition, he had been very induſtrious about writing of Papers in their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, but that being at Liberty, he chiefly followed the Play-Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nevil</hi> here reflects upon me as a Lewd and Infamous perſon, to which I replied, That if I were ſuch as he ſaid, it was the more plain, that I could not proceed in ſuch weighty undertakings as I had managed, without conſiderable Counſel and Direction; which is agreeable to what I have affirmed.</p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Powis</hi> ſaid, She hoped the Oath of an Infamous perſon ſhould not bring her in danger, for that no perſon of Common ſenſe would ever truſt ſuch a Creature as I was with any thing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> ſaid, She never cauſed me, or any body elſe to put forth Pamphlets, but that indeed I did make ſome, and put them forth,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52261:39"/>
which were very inconſiderable things, that I did once read to her two Pamphlets wherein was no matter of hurt but the things were fooliſh, and mere Chimaera's, and then ſhe railed upon me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> called in, ſaid, That he gave his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants charge to admit me whenever I came, and that he did call me Captain <hi>Willoughby,</hi> yet his Lordſhip told the Board, he could not but be troubled to have his name mentioned by ſo infamous a perſon as I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nevil</hi> alias <hi>Payne,</hi> called into the Council on <hi>Friday, Novem.</hi> 7. 1679. ſaith, That I had writ him a kind of a Challenge, which he knowing my life, rejected: beſides, that I was grown in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour proud, and high as a Prince.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Informant ſaith, that about half a year ago, he became acquainted with Mr. <hi>Willoughby,</hi> taking him to be a very Civil Gentleman, and not knowing that he had any other name; and about the ſecond day of <hi>October</hi> laſt, he met the ſaid <hi>Willoughby</hi> at the <hi>Hoop-Tavern</hi> on <hi>Fiſhſtreet-hill,</hi> and there drank a Bottle of <hi>Rheniſh-Wine</hi> with him; in the drinking whereof, he the ſaid <hi>Willoughby</hi> told this Informant, that he looked on him as an honeſt man and one that loved his King and Country, and expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Proteſtant, and much againſt Rebellion: and further added, that he would put this Informant into a Way to ſerve his King and Countrey: whereunto this Informant replyed, that he would ſerve his King and Countrey to the laſt drop of his bloud in anything that was juſt: to which the ſaid <hi>Willoughby</hi> replyed, that he would not put this Informant on any thing but what was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and juſt, and that he would make it eaſie, but at that time refuſed to tell the buſineſs, but appointed this Informant to dine with him at M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
                  <hi>Celliers</hi> the next day following, which this Informant did, and after Dinner, the ſaid <hi>Willoughby</hi> took this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant into a private room, and there told this Informant, that there were Commiſſions given out privately by the Fanaticks, and perſwaded this Informant to get one, and if this Informant did ſo, he would bring this Informant to the King, and that it ſhould be 5000 <hi>l</hi> in this Informants way, beſides being taken care of for the future: But this Informant replying, that he did not believe there was any ſuch thing, the ſaid <hi>Willoughby</hi> anſwer'd, that he knew it to be true, and that he had been at ſeveral meetings with them, and named one in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> another which he called Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Player's,</hi> or my Lord <hi>Shaftbury</hi>'s in <hi>London,</hi> a third that was Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi>'s, and particularly ſaid, that <hi>Bloud</hi>'s party iſſued out theſe Commiſſions.</p>
               <p>And this Informant had heard before that M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
                  <hi>Cellier</hi> had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured the Gentlemen that came over from St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s and that ſhe was a Papiſt, but the ſaid <hi>Willoughby</hi> did never intimate to this Informant that he was imployed by the Papiſts in this Affair, and charged this Informant not to ſay any thing of this Matter to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52261:40"/>
Mr. <hi>Nevil</hi> becauſe he had no Correſpondence with him nor deſired any: nor to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> becauſe ſhe was a woman: And then this Informant promiſed him to ſee what could be done, and ſo left him, reſolving not to inſinuate into any ſecret Truſt on purpoſe to betray it; about Four days after which, this Informant returned to Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby</hi> and told him he had been at the Club in <hi>Weſtminſter-market,</hi> but could not learn any ſuch thing, and when this Informant had ſeen the ſaid <hi>Willoughby,</hi> this Informant went to Mr. <hi>Nevil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nevil</hi> bid this Informant never to meddle with ſuch villanous treacheries: and this Informant further ſaith, that he likewiſe told Mrs. <hi>Jane Bradley</hi> the ſame ſtory, and that he heard that <hi>Mr. Blouds</hi> party, the Fanaticks, had the giving out theſe Commiſſions, and ſhe then ſaid, ſhe would uſe her intereſt with one Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> who had formerly been her Sweet-heart to get one: And the ſaid <hi>Jane Bradley</hi> had ſeveral times ſince wiſhed we could get the 5000 <hi>l.</hi> ſaying ſhe would ſhare therein: and this Informant did tell her that he heard thoſe Commiſſions were given out by <hi>Mr. Blouds</hi> party, by thoſe people where he was concerned, and that this Informant would beg his Bread before he would be guilty of ſuch Treacherous deſigns, and that it was to no purpoſe to meddle in it for there is a liſt found out as he heard: and this Informant remembers the ſaid <hi>Willoughby</hi> asked this Informant if he knew Collonel <hi>Manſel,</hi> which this Informant ſaid he did, and he alſo told this Informant that he had been in the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Company or Club, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith not.</p>
