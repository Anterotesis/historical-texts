         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

or they are particuler questions appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the same. Amongst other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
principles there are two, about
which there is greatest contention at this
day: the one is the Word of God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church: we will first speake of
the word of God, and afterwardes of the
Church, and lastly we will examine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
particuler Controuersy, if God shall

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16199:3"/>
there are which now adayes hold many
in error. The one is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> opinion that
many haue, who thinke it a matter of
little importance, whether they giue
credit or no to many things taught by the
Roman Church, which daungerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
may be taken out of the mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
of all faithfull people, by that which we
shall deliuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Word of God,
and the Church, for thereby it shall eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appeare, that al thinges are firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be belieued, which the Roman
Church belieueth, and that without
this faith no man can hope to be saued.
The other is, that such as de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire to find
out the true faith in euery particuler Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy,
are oftentimes so hindred by the
sleights and falshoods of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes,
as it willbe very hard for them to
discerne that which is true from that
which is false. Wherfore we will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
in euery particuler Controuersy, to
set downe the true state of the question.
Afterward we will lay open the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Catholike doctrine. And la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
we will plainly and briefly answere
the chiefe obiections of our Aduersaries
whether they be drawne out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or taken from the Fathers.</p>
            <p>2. And because our Aduersaries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16199:3"/>
boast and brag of the written
Word of God, pretending out of it only
to proue their doctrine &amp; impugne ours:
our chiefe care shalbe to shew, that the
Catholike and Roman faith is both eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and strongly to be confirmed out
of the written Word of God, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Aduersaries hath no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
at all in the holy Scriptures, but
is manifestly opposite &amp; repugnant ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
yet so, as we will set downe the
vniforme conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the auncient Church
to be agreeing with vs in euery Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy,
leauing the more ample search of
antiquity, vnto others, to whome we
will referre the Reader, setting downe
their particuler names; so loath we are
that this booke of ours should grow too
great: and for the same reason we haue
thought good to omit many arguments
which might be drawne out of the holy
Scriptures for confirmation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
faith, contenting our selues to
set downe only the more solide and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
proofes, because we are resolued to be
as briefe as we may.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Word of God in generall.</head>
            <p>THE word of God, if we speake
of it in generall, may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
two wayes, either for that
One, Eternall and Infinite Word
which contayneth perfectly in it selfe
whatsoeuer is in the mind of Almighty
God, which is the same with the Sonne
of God, and Word of the Father, of
whome <hi>S. Iohn</hi> speaketh in his Ghospell
saying: <hi>In the beginning was the VVord,</hi> but of
this Word we are to say nothing heere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but the Word of God may be other wise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
and taken for that Word which
was not alwayes, nor contayneth all
thinges which are in the mind of God
but a small part only of them, to wit, such
thinges as God would haue vs know and
belieue: and of the Word of God in this
sense we speake now. For this Word is
the proper and complete obiect of our
faith.</p>
            <p>2. Moreouer this Word hath two
conditions or properties, the one is, that
the same be reuealed vnto vs, for there are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16199:4"/>
innumerable verities in the mind of God
the which because they are not reuealed
to vs, do not appertayne to this Word.
The other is, that it be immediatly reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by God, for such thinges as God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth

            <p>3. Of this Word of God so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
there is no Controuersy betwene
vs and our Aduersaries, but only in
wordes: for wheras our Aduersaries say
that Catholikes affirme, that we must
with diuine fayth belieue the words of
men, or which is worse, rather belieue the
words of men then the Word of God, it
is a meere slaunder, for there is no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike

            <p>THE written Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
of two parts, of the Letter
which euery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man may read in
the books themselues, and in the
true se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se of the Letter, which is as it were
the very soule and life thereof, without
which the Letter alone rather killeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
quickneth or giueth life: as we see eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
by experience in the Iewes, <hi>Arians,</hi>
&amp;c all other heretikes, as well new as old:
for the Iewes hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues stiffely to the
Letter of the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; the <hi>Arians,</hi> as

they will not acknowledge the true
sense of the Letter, Iewes they are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
they are, Catholikes they are not.
And surely the Letter alone without the
true sense cannot truly and properly be

called the Word of God, no more then
a body without a soule can truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called a man: wherefore they
which spoile the Letter of the true sense
may be compared to them who bereaue a
man of his soule and life.</p>
            <p>2. But whosoeuer do substitute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
contrary sense and meaning in

they, who not only kill a man, but by

they confesse at last that there was neuer
any which hath not at sometyme erred
in seeking out the true interpretation of
holy Scripture. For they giue not their
assent either to the ancient Fathers, or
to their owne Maisters in all thinges
they teach or write: nay they cannot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
any one whom they acknowledge
not to haue erred sometyme,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. v. 4.</note> nor dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme

of our Aduersaries nothing either solide
or certayne is contayned in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
for wheras all dependeth of the
true sense of the Letter, and with them
there is no certayne or sure meanes by
which to finde out this sense, it followeth
that they call all into doubt, which is in
the Scripture, wherby who seeth not how
much they iniure them? But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
according to the Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
all thinges are euident and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
which are contayned in the holy
Scriptures, appertayning eyther to faith,
or good manners: the Catholikes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
euer a certayne and faithful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
to wit, the Catholike Church.
And surely whosoeuer reiecteth the sense
which the Church giueth, and in place
therof substituteth another altogeather
repugnant to it, doth all one with him,
who reiecting the holy Scripture should
in place therof bring in a new Scripture
of his owne forging, the sense of the
Scripture being no lesse a part of the word
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16199:8"/>
of God then the letter, which in these
few wordes <hi>Tertullian</hi> confirmeth out of
the tradition of the auncient Church:
<hi>The sense adultered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul. de praesc. c. 17</note>

            </p>
            <p>4. And to conclude, it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
that saluation is to be found in the

            <p>2. Now as for the <hi>Canons</hi> lately set

them, seeing they neyther agree one
with another, nor with the auncient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Church, nor are any where
found in the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Word of God, which
(as they teach) is only to be belieued:
neyther can they bring any thing, eyther

haue not taken from the writings of the

            <p>3. <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> indeed sayth,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Inst. c. 7. sect 2. in fine.</note> that it

these speake nothing to the purpose, for

himselfe, and the holy Ghost, whereof
there is no controuersy betweene vs and

we giue by fayth, that is to say, that
it is the holy Ghost who chiefly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

of fayth, or that which is to be belieued,
whereof we now dispute, for the holy
Ghost doth not induce vs to belieue the

pure and sincere Word of God only: we
aske therfore of our Aduersaries, by what

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16199:10"/>
we read not this any where in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

It is necessary therefore that if
they will haue vs belieue, that they are
perswaded by the holy Ghost to belieue
such books only to be authenticall as they
doe say are such; that they first shew this
to be a truth expressely contayned in holy

The first is, for that the Hebrew text

            <p>THE Catholike Church of Christ
not without good cause doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
and condemne our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
new Translations of the
Bible, and that for many reasons. The
first and most iust reason is, because such
their translations are replenished with
errors, which haue byn inuented eyther
by <hi>Iewes,</hi> or <hi>Heretikes,</hi> of which see many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in the precedent Chapters of the

will set downe three other causes or ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens
from whence these errors spring,
wherby it shall further appeare, that our

            <p>2. The first cause is, for that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

their labour in finding out all the versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which they highly extoll &amp;

them cite <hi>Thargus Rabins,</hi> and such other

               </gap>hence it is, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
do insert into the new transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16199:14"/>
almost all the places of Scripture
corrupted by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and that they deny
togeather with the <hi>Iewes</hi> many oracles of
the Prophets, to be vnderstood of Christ,
and many wayes wrest euen those oracles
which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny to be vnderstood
of Christ, from that true sense in which
they are cited in the new Testament, by
the Apostles, Euangelists, and Christ
himselfe, to prophane &amp; impious senses
lately inuented by the Iewes out of their
hatred to Christ.</p>
            <p>6. The second cause is, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
nothing more then in their transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to depart from the vulgar edition,
the which seeing it is most sincere and
correct, they which almost in all thinges
leaue it, must needes fall into many
errors.</p>
            <p>7. The third cause is, the malicious
intention of our Aduersaries, who set
forth new translations of the Scripture
for no other end, then by them to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
the Catholike doctrine, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
and confirme their owne errors
and heresies: and therefore when any
plain text occurreth, which maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
against their erroneous doctrine,
they seeke to make obscure the true and
proper sense by their peruerse translation;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16199:14"/>
but if they light vpon any place some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
obscure, which may seeme to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
their doctrine, they so depraue it by
their new translation, that the Scripture
it selfe may seeme to confirme what they
falsely teach, and so by this meanes they
must needes stuffe their translations with
infinite corruptions, for these three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:<note place="margin">Grets. tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat. de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nouis tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

many other places in the vulgar edition,
both of the old and new Testament, but
we will lay foure generall grounds, out
of which all their arguments may be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered.</p>
            <p>2. The first is: If our Aduersaries
will needes haue the present <hi>Roma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </hi>
Church condemned for following and
authorizing the vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they must needes also condemne
the whole auncient Church, and all the
Fathers who liued in the first foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares after <hi>Christ,</hi> for they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
no other interpretation of the old
Testament as authenticall, then that
of the <hi>Septuaginta</hi> Interpreters, which
much more departeth from the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
text, now extant, then our vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi>
as our Aduersaries themselues confesse.
Wherfore if the <hi>Roman Church</hi> be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for the vulgar Edition, much
more the <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> for the version
of the <hi>Septuaginta:</hi> and heereof it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
further, that the Church is not to be

of the Scripture which in some
thinges may be amended, so long as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be found in it which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
eyther to fayth or good manners:
For otherwise the auncient Church had
erred in retayning the version of the
<hi>Septuaginta,</hi> which was corrupted in some

for answere to our Aduersaries argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when they obiect certayne light
faults of the vulgar Edition which haue
crept into it, eyther by the negligence of
the printers, or by any other accident.
As also what our Aduersaries obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Psalter</hi> may heerby be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to be very weake, for seeing that no

cannot condemne vs, vnlesse they will

version, is as shewed in the 11. Chapter
of the Latin Edition of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy.</p>
            <p>3. The second ground. A good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
doth not ty himselfe to transtate
word for word, seeing that euery tongue
hath his proper phrases, and manner of
speach, but contenteth himselfe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the true sense and meaning of that
which he translateth. Wherefore all our
Aduersaries argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are nothing worth
by which they proue that certayne places
of the vulgar edition are somewhat other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the Hebrew and Greeke, so that
the sense of the whole period be one and
the same, as most of the places are which
they carpe at in the vulgar Edition.</p>
            <p>4. The third ground. The places of
holy Scripture are of two sortes, some are
cleare &amp; manifest, as almost all are, which
set downe the history of the old and new
Testament. Others are obscure, and full
of difficulty, as are many places in the
<hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> Now if the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in such places as are euident and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
do interprete rightly all of them,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd in such places of Scripture as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16199:17"/>
expresse a sense and meaning agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
to the Letter, though he come short
of the best sense, and that there might be
a better gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en, he is not therefore to be
thought to haue erred, or not to haue ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the office of a good interpreter. For
so plentifull and profound is the sense
of holy Scripture, especially in such places
as are ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cure, as it is not easy for any
man to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udge, which is the best sense.
Nay if we must interprete a new, vntill
wee haue found out the best sense, there
will neuer be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> end of interpreting, but

               </gap>tation,
or at least correct and amend
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormer, as our Aduersaries haue done,
and <hi>Bezw</hi> by name, who hauing set out
fiue diuers editions of the new Testament
euery one much differing from the other,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1598.</note>
as himselfe freely confesteth, yet he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledgeth that in his first edition
he hath neyther satisfyed eyther the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the worke, or his owne desire. Out
of which ground we answere to that
which our Aduersaries obiect: to wit,
that there are many places of the vulgar
Edition which might much better and
much more cleerly haue been translate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>:
for it is sufficient that they are well and
rightly translated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:16199:17"/>
5. The fourth ground. We are not
to reprehend the translations of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
only because they differ one from
another, so long as they are not contrary
the one to the other: and in this the holy
Scripture differeth from other prophane
writings. For euen as the holy Ghost in
diuers places of holy Scripture teacheth
thinges different, but not repugnant: so
the same holy Ghost can in one place
&amp; in the same words teach diuers things.
And heerehence it is,<note place="margin">1. p. q. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> art. vlt.</note> that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
well, as did <hi>S. Augustine</hi> before him,
that of one &amp; the same p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace of Scripture,
there may be many litterall senses. For
whereas the litterall sense is that which
the author intendeth, and the proper and
chiefe author of the holy Scripture is God
himselfe whose intention and meaning is
not tied to one verity only, as is mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
but he in one and the same
moment comprehendeth all things; there
is no doubt, but that he in the same words
and at the same tyme, can intimate vnto
vs diuers things.</p>
            <p>6. The which thing is excellently
declared by <hi>S. Augustin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. l. 12. confess. cap. vltimo.</note> for hauing said that
he thought Moyses intended diuers senses
in his words, he correcteth himselfe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that without all doubt God who is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16199:18"/>
the principall author of the Scriptures
did so. <hi>O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of them do say any thing not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the word of God, but both the
one sense and the other is godly, and
conformable to other places of Scripture:
and this maketh much for the dignity of
the Scriptures, and profit of the Church,
according to that which <hi>S. Augustin</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

text, and betweene the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text and
the <hi>vulgar Edition,</hi> or lastly betweene the

much soeuer the same wordes are diuersly
translated, to wit, otherwise of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>vulgar Edition</hi> of the new, where in
both places the same wordes are cited, for
the same places of Scripture are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
otherwise cited by the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the

               <hi>new Testament,</hi> then hath the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text of
of the <hi>old.</hi> But here is diuersity without
any repugnance, or contrariety. And this
hath place especially in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text,
because in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue there is so
different reading of one and the same
word. See examples hereof in the <hi>Latine</hi>
Edition of this Controuersy, in this
Chapter.</p>
            <p>9. It wilbe easy out of that which
hath byn said to answere that which our

otherwise it proceedeth from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Hebrew tongue, which hath
many wordes subiect to ambiguity, and
very many phrases much different from
the Latin and Greeke phrase, as in the
Chapters that follow may be seene in the

Christ alone is meant hereby, and not his

for the reasons following.</p>
            <p>2. First it is euident that the seed
of the Serpent which is opposed against
the seed of the woman, doth not signify
any one Serpent, but a multitude: it is
therefore very probable, that by the seed
of the woman a multitude also is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
vnlesse we will haue the Scripture
in so few wordes speak ambiguously.
Moreouer <hi>semen</hi> is a Nowne collectiue
properly signifying a multitude, neyther
is there any thing in this sentence that
forceth vs to departe from the proper si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification
of the Word. This reason is
of so great a force, that <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>but that I see they offer

            <p>3. Secondly it is said of the seed of
the woman, that it shall crush, and bruze
the head of the Serpent, but this crushing
and bruzing the Scripture doth not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to Christ alone, but to all that lead
a godly life in him, for to euery iust man
the holy Ghost speaketh, saying: <hi>thou
shalt walke ouer the Addar and Basiliske,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 90<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v 13.</note> 
               <hi>and thou
shalt tread vnder thy seete the Lyon and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi>
And <hi>Christ</hi> saith vnto his Disciples:
<hi>Behold I haue giuen you power to tread vpon the
Serpents and Scorpions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 10. v. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and vpon all the power of
the enemy.</hi> And the Apostle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
prayeth saying. <hi>The God of peace crush
Satan vnder your feete quickly.</hi> And lastly in
very many places of Scripture the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are said to ouer come the Diuell,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. v. 20.</note> and to
get victories against him, which is all
one as to crush him. Seing therefore the
proper worke of this seed agreeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the members of Christ,<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 2. v 13.</note> the Word
<hi>seed</hi> is not to be limited to Christ alone.<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. v. 11.</note>
Ad hereunto that God in these wordes
intended to comfort not only <hi>Eue</hi> decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the craft of the Diuell,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. v. 57.</note> but all her
posterity. Now the comfort is more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
if all the faithfull should be able
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16199:22"/>
by Christ to ouercome the Diuell, then if
that Christ alone should ouercome him,
euen as our comfort is greater that we to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
with Christ shall rise againe, then
if Christ only should rise, and he alone
attayne to eternall life.</p>
            <p>4. Thirdly. Albeit we should graunt
our Aduersaries, that Christ alone doth
crush the head of the Diuell, which is
the former part of the sentence: yet the
latter part can by no meanes be applyed
to <hi>Christ</hi> alone, where it is sayd, that the
Diuell shall crush this seed, for Christ in
his owne person cannot be crushed by
the Diuell: we must therefore needes by
this seed vnderstand also the members of
Christ, for in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text it is thus
word for word, <hi>ipsa, velipsum, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teret te in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,

the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is the same in both places
both in the first and in the later part of
the sentence, and signifyeth <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nterere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. As for <hi>Caluins</hi> exposition inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
by the seed of the woman all man
kind;<note place="margin">In Gen. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co citato &amp; l. 2.</note> it is not to be receaued, for God in
this place denounceth emnity betweene
the <hi>seed</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Instit. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3. sect. 2.</note> and the <hi>seed</hi> of the
<hi>woman,</hi> but infidells and vngoodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
haue no emnity with the Diuell, and
his seed, but are rather the seed and sonnes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16199:22"/>
of the Diuell, according to those words
of Christ:<note place="margin">Ioan. 8. v. 44.</note> 
               <hi>You are of your father the Diuell;</hi> they
therefore cannot appertayne to this seed
of the woman.</p>
            <p>6. But whereas <hi>Caluin</hi> in another
place sayth,<note place="margin">Caluin l. 1. Instit. c. 14. sect. 18.</note> that Christ and his members
are signifyed by the <hi>seed</hi> of the <hi>woman,</hi> wee
like well of that his saying, for it is the
exposition of the Catholike and auncient
Fathers, and indeed the true litterall
sense.</p>
            <p>7. For in that sentence God sayth,
first that he will put emnity, wherefore
he speaketh not of any <hi>naturall emnity,</hi> as
<hi>Caluin</hi> insinuateth, but of a <hi>supernaturall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from God. Moreouer God signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth
betweene whome this emnity shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,
to wit, betweene the <hi>Serpent</hi> and <hi>woman.</hi>
Now as by the <hi>Serpent</hi> the <hi>Diuell</hi> is meant,
whome that <hi>naturall Serpent</hi> represented,
and in whome God layed his curse vpon
the Diuell: so by the woman <hi>Eue,</hi> is meant
the spouse of Christ, or his <hi>true Church</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by <hi>Eue,</hi> whose force and victory
against the Diuell was therefore foretold
by God:<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. v. 32. 2. Cor. 11. v. 2. &amp; 3.</note> for that <hi>Eue</hi> represented the
Church, as <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi>

and haue the <hi>testimony of Iesus Christ,</hi>

            <p>8. Furthermore, this woman, to wit
the Church shall crush <hi>the head</hi> of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 90. v. 13. Luc. 10. v. 19. Rom. 16. v. 20.</note>
as we haue proued by many places of
Scripture. But on the other side the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
heele</hi> shalbe crushed by <hi>Satan,</hi> for the
Church ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the <hi>Diuell</hi> by her

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:16199:23"/>
In the first combat is that the Church o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
cometh by open warre, and therefore
it is expressed by crushing of the head. In
the later combat in which a part of the
Church is ouercome, the enemy procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
by guiles and deceites, and therefore
that combat is signifyed by crushing the
heele, for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word signifying <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oleoster in c. 3. Gen.</note>
doth signify also properly <hi>insiaiari,
&amp; ex insidijs aggredi,</hi> as appeareth by many
places of Scripture. And out of ignorance
heerof <hi>Caluin</hi> without cause reprehendeth
the vulgar interpreter, for otherwise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating
this combat in the later part of
the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence then he had in the former, for
the <hi>Emphasis,</hi> or force of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
required that he should interprete the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part as he did by these wordes, <hi>tu insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaberis
calcaneo eius,</hi> which is as much to
say, as thou shalt crush her heele, not by
open warre, but by taking her at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.
See further of this matter in this
Chapter in the <hi>Latin</hi> Edition the 8. §.
And you shall see that our Aduersaries
make a great adoe about a matter of small

For whether we reade <hi>ipsa,</hi> and so

               </gap>sed, is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16199:24"/>
sayd to be gotten against the <hi>Serpent</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

the same appertaineth rather to the <hi>woman

(betweene thy <hi>seed</hi> and <hi>her seed)</hi> do

was betweene the <hi>woman</hi> and the <hi>Serpent,</hi>
and are put in by way of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thesis, for the
combat of the Church and of her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is all one combat.</p>
            <p>10. But the chiefe cause that moued
the Church to retayne at this tyme rather
the word <hi>ipsa,</hi> then <hi>ipsum,</hi> or <hi>ipse,</hi> was to
controle the error of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> for if
the reading had byn <hi>ipsum,</hi> or <hi>ipse,</hi> one
might haue thought this promise to haue
appertayned only to Christ, as they
(though erroneously) would haue it,
but by reading <hi>ipsa,</hi> this promise must
needes be vnderstood to haue byn made
to the whole Church. For such is the
custome of the holy Church, whether she
interprete the Scripturs or administer the
Sacraments to do all as is most profitable
and most for the edification of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Neyther is Christ hereby excluded
but he is rather included in the name of
the Church, as is also the holy Ghost, for
the true Church of Christ cannot consist

is; There is not doubt but the Word of

            <p>2. The second assertion is; Neyther

tongue, as also of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the same into the <hi>Dalmatical</hi> to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue,
there can no certayne proofe be brought
thereof. And they who write this, do
not affirme, that all the Scripture was
translated by them, but certayne partes
only vsed of old to be read in the prayers
of the Church, as the <hi>Psalmes, Epistles,
Ghospels,</hi> and <hi>Lessons</hi> which were song pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickely

               </hi> at their first conuersion to the
faith of Christ, but this was 880. yeares
after Christ, and this custome was of no
long continuance amongst them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by that which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the
seauenth writeth to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baron. Tom. 10. ann. 880. n. 19. &amp; Tom. 11. ann. 1080. n. 1.</note> &amp;
is to be seene in <hi>Cesar Baronius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The third assertion; To translate
the Scripture into the vulgar tongue is
neyther in it selfe vnlawfull, nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by any Ecclesiasticall law, so it be
truly translated. Nay such a translation
serueth Preachers to great vse, who are
to cite and expound the Scriptures to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16199:29"/>
people in the vulgar tongue. <hi>Hereticall</hi>
translations are indeed forbidden, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the new Testament, because in
them many places of holy Scripture are
by false translating corrupted.</p>
            <p>7. The fourth assertion; It is not a
thing profitable to all to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the vulgar tongue, yea to many it
is rather pernicious, for we are taught by
the Apostle <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. vlt. v. 26.</note> that in the Scriptures
are many thinges hard to be vnderstood,
which vnlearned, and vnstayed perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
depraue to their owne destruction. Many
also there are vncapable of meate and
solid sustenance, who are therefore to be
fed with milke,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. v. 2. Heb. 5. v. 12.</note> as the Apostle speaketh,
and for such it is more wholesome to be
fed by the sermons and instructions of
their Pastors, then to feede themselues
with reading the Bible. It was therefore
great prudence of the Church to forbid
that the Bible, though translated and set
forth by Catholikes, should be read of
all indifferently,<note place="margin">Index. lib. prohibit. Reg. 4.</note> and without the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and leaue of the Bishop, Pastor, or
Ghostly Father.</p>
            <p>8. Our Aduersaries obiect certayn
places of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome,</hi>
in which they exhort to the reading of
the Scripture, but they should haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
that those Fathers speake of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16199:29"/>
the Scripture in the <hi>Greeke tongue</hi> then
extant, or in the Latin according to the
old edition, which was neuer forbidden
to any by the Church: whereas our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy
is about the translations of the
holy Scripture out of the Hebrew, Greek
and Latin into the vulgar tongue, which
are all for the most part corrupted.</p>
            <p>9. And it is worth the nothing,
that our Aduersaries spend their tyme in
vayne, in gathering togeather arguments
by which to perswade men that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for them to read the Scriptures in
the vulgar tongue, to the end they may
learne out of them what they must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
know if they wilbe saued, for how
truly or plainly soeuer they be translated
no man shall euer recevue any fruite by
them, vnlesse he first belieue aright, and
be guided by the holy Ghost, to whome
it appertayneth to guide vs into the right
land,<note place="margin">Psal. 142. v. 8. &amp; 10.</note> to make knowne vnto vs the way
in which we are to walke, to teach vs
the will of God which we are to fulfill.
VVhich is manifestly to be seene in the
<hi>Iewes</hi> who vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the <hi>Hebrew text</hi> much
better then Christians, in which there is
so ample and cleare mention of Christ,
and yet for all that they do not belieue in
Christ-Our Aduersaries therefore haue
little reason to keepe such a do about the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16199:30"/>
wordes of Scripture, or the translation of
them, let them first imbrace the true Faith
which is in the Church only, let them
seeke after the holy Ghost who is not to
be found out of the Church, let them
seeke out the true sense of the Letter,
which the Church only conserueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted,
and it will easily be graunted
vnto them to haue the Scriptures in what
tongue soeuer they will, so they be truly
and vncorruptedly translated, and that
they vse them to their owne saluation,
and not to their destruction, as many do,
wherof we haue for witnesses not only
the Scripture but dayly experience, and
this shall suffice concerning the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the Scripture into the vulgar to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue.</p>
            <p>10. For of the prayers in Latin ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
priuately made by the people, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikely
offered by the Priest at masse, and
in the administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, we

            <head type="sub">That our Aduersaries vse many sleightes

            <p>OVR Aduersaries often require vs
to proue all that which we say
out of the written Word of
God, but when we cite the same in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16199:30"/>
expresse tearmes they haue many wayes
by which they depraue it. Wherfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I make an end of this Controuersy
concerning the written Word, it shall
not be from the purpose briefly to detect
such their corruptions; partly to the end
that no man be deceaued by them, and
partly that euery man may vnderstand
nothing to be so plainely and clearely set
downe in the written VVord, which by
the Commentaries of crafty and subtile
wittes may not be weakned and made
of little force, if no regard be had to the
authority and iudgment of the Church.
And that no man may thinke that I herin
calumniate them or deale lesse sincerely
with them, I will set downe out of their
owne writings some one or two exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pls of
each manner of corrupting, wherof many
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples will occure in each Controuersy.</p>
            <p>2. The first manner of shifting of
places alleadged out of the written Word
is, to say, that the originall text is corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
and what is alleadged crept out of
the margent into the text, whereof see
many examples in the 12. and 18. Chapter
of the Latin Edition of this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy.</p>
            <p>3. Their second shift is to reiect the
vulgar translation and instead thereof to
cite some new and corrupt translation
of their owne. It is euident inough,

               <hi>and behold all thinges are cleane vnto

spake not those words in <hi>earnest,</hi> but in

did many other things, but <hi>Caluin</hi> and
<hi>Beza</hi> confesse,<note place="margin">Erasmus in a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not. Luc. Calu. &amp; Beza in illa verba S. Luc.</note> that this is a <hi>foolish Ironia.</hi>
Albeit they also peruert the same wordes
another way, for they restrayne the word
<hi>omnia,</hi> only to <hi>meate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The fift shift is, when Catholiks
alledge plaine places of Scripture which
admit no figure, to say that the Scripture,
yea euen Christ himselfe did speake <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,</hi>
but after <hi>a grosse</hi> and popular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the meaning is, that he speaketh
only <hi>probably,</hi> and <hi>not solidly.</hi> For example
sake when wee proue that the Sacrament
of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> excelleth the <hi>Manna</hi> of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16199:34"/>
               <hi>Iewes</hi> by these wordes of Christ,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6. v. 48. &amp; 49.</note> your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
indeed haue eaten Manna and are dead, this
is the bread descending from heauen, that if any man
eate of it he dye not, Caluins</hi> answere is, that
<hi>Christ</hi> accommodated his speach to the
grosse conceipt or opinion of the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">l. 4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit c. 14. sect. 25.</note>
When we proue the <hi>Exorzismes</hi> of the
Church, by which she casteth out diuells,
to be holy, because <hi>Christ</hi> sayth, <hi>one Diuell
will not cast out another, Caluin</hi> answereth, <hi>we
must remember</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that when Christ v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
such prouerbes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calu. in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum v. 25 Matth. 12.</note> 
               <hi>as are in vse among the people,
he vseth them only, as probable coniectures, and
not as solid proofes.</hi> So he. No meruaile ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if our Aduersaries say our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not solid, seeing they write so
much of Christs owne arguments.</p>
            <p>4. Their sixt shift is, to answere to
such plaine testimonies as are alledged
out of Scripture against their errors, that
the Scripture speaketh not <hi>simply,</hi> that is to
say, not truly, but according to the false
opinion of them, ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inst whom it hath
to do, which indeed is nothing els, but
to deny the Scripture. This is an vsuall
shift of <hi>Caluin</hi> who interpreteth <hi>to dispute by
