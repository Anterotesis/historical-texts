            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen firſt it pleaſed <hi>You</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our ſervice in Preaching <hi>at Your</hi> late Publike <hi>Faſt,</hi> we reſolved to cloſe our eyes againſt all Clouds of diſcouragement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from our owne unworthineſſe and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and to ſet our ſelves wholly to ſeek what the Lord would command us to deliver in his Name, at ſuch a time, to ſuch an Honourable and awfull Aſsembly, with a totall deniall of our <note place="margin">Pſalm. 82.</note> ſelves.</p>
            <p>And albeit we ſhould have beene glad to have beene ſpared this expoſing of our ſelves to the
<pb facs="tcp:112663:3"/>
publike view; yet, <hi>You</hi> appointing other wiſe, we hold it equall that the joynt <hi>entreaty</hi> of the <hi>Repreſentative Body</hi> of the whole <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty</hi> of the kingdome ſhould be regarded, and have choſen rather that others ſhould cenſure us of <hi>weakeneſſe,</hi> than <hi>You</hi> ſhould charge us with <hi>Diſobedience:</hi> Your <hi>Requeſt</hi> being no leſſe than a <hi>command;</hi> and <hi>Your</hi> acceptance ſufficient to give value to things of themſelves both meane and worthleſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, according to our Duty, ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly as the conſciouſneſſe of our ſlender perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances would permit, we obey Your <hi>Order,</hi> and doe now, although ſomewhat late, humbly offer theſe two plaine Sermons (for, who expects other in a <hi>Faſt?)</hi> at the footſtoole of <hi>Your Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> as a laſting Monument of Our Gratitude for <hi>Your</hi> encouraging <hi>Approbation</hi> of, and ſolemne <hi>Thankes</hi> for our weake endeavours in the preaching of them.</p>
            <p>If in ſome places we have taken that juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which all others have done before us, we truſt it ſhall not be imputed; ſo long as in the
<pb facs="tcp:112663:3"/>
most materiall paſſages we have kept to the very words which at firſt wee uſed, ſo farre as was neceſſary; and have not wittingly ſwerved an haires bredth from the ſenſe and ſubſtance in the reſidue.</p>
            <p>Wee have indeed pared off ſome Repetitions, which in ſpeaking had their uſe, the more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, and the better to ſet on the matter, but would not have been ſo gratefull in Writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Readers account every thing too long that hath any thing too much. We have likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſome expreſſions, which in diſcourſes of ſo much length, could hardly be ſo conciſe as wee deſired, Memory being not alwayes at hand to give birth to every Conception of our minds in ſuch formes as wee intended. And ſome few things we have added, where ſtraites of time, or defect of memory made ſome balkes in the firſt delivery.</p>
            <p>What ever our performances be, we humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave them in Your hands, and under Your Honourable Protection, which we are bold to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, becauſe they are by Your owne Act drawne

            <p>This honourable Aſſembly having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me to beare ſo great a ſhare in this weightie Worke, I hold it my dutie to conſider, that, how weake and unworthy ſo ever I my ſelfe be, yet I am now to <hi>ſpeake to Wiſe Men,</hi> who need not ſo much to be Catechiſed touching the <hi>Nature,</hi> as to be incited and quickned to the principall <hi>Uſe</hi> of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Faſt,</hi> which conſiſteth not ſolely in ſuch drawing neere to God by extraordinary Prayer and Humiliation as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a totall divorce from our deereſt Luſts, but alſo (and that more principally) in a particular, formall, ſolemne, entire engaging and binding of our ſelves, by an indiſſoluble <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> to that God whoſe face and favour we ſeeke, and implore.</p>
            <p>And this I apprehend to be a ſubject more neceſſary, by how

            <p>For, as it too often falls out, even among the beſt, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating that ſacred and dreadfull Ordinance of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> (whereof alſo we are ſhortly to communicate) that moe labour more to <hi>diſcerne,</hi> and <hi>feed</hi> upon his bleſſed Body and Bloud, ſpiritually by faith, to make Chriſt their owne, (which muſt be done too) than actually, totally, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely (then) to devote, reſigne, and yeeld up themſelves unto him, in the act of receiving, <hi>to be his ſervants:</hi> So it doth not ſeldome happen in the exerciſe of holy <hi>Faſting,</hi> that not a few of that ſmall handfull which deſire to approach the preſence of God in trueth, are more converſant in ſearching, confeſsing, bewailing of ſinne, and in craving of mercy, (all of which are neceſſary duties) than in working up their hearts to that indiſpenſable pitch of heavenly reſolution, ſincerely to ſtrike through a religious and inviolable <hi>Covenant</hi> with their God. Whereas, without this, all their labour will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt, their expectations fruſtrate, they take the glorious Name of God in vaine, provoke the eyes of his Glory more againſt them, cauſing him infinitely to loath and abominate both their perſons, and ſervice; nor ſhall they ever, by all their crying, and ſighing, no not by whole rivers of teares, be able to draw down an arme of Mercy from Heaven to come and ſave them.</p>
            <p>The more effectually therefore to provoke both my ſelfe and you at this time, to the due performance of this moſt neglected (but moſt neceſſary) dutie, I have thought fit, in a very plaine and familiar way ſutable to the nature of this exerciſe (which ought to be as ſerious, as ſolemne) to worke and chafe into all our hearts the ſtrength and ſpirit of that good Word of God, which you ſhall finde written for our inſtruction in</p>

            <p>The Prophet having laboured about thirtie yeers, to humble Judah by continually ringing in her eares the dolefull tydings of a ſore captivitie approaching, could not be beleeved. But, when once the quick and ſad ſenſe of their bondage under the Chaldean yoke had forced from them an acknowledgement of the truth of his prophecies, he found it as hard a taske to worke their hearts to any hope of deliverance. For, as it is a worke even inſuperable, to poſſeſſe a people ripe for deſtruction, that any evill is neere them, till the wrath of God breake in upon them and overwhelme them; ſo is it a buſineſſe of little leſſe difficultie to hold up the

ſpirits even of Gods owne people, once caſt under any great extreamitie, with any hope of reſcue. <note place="margin">Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This was <hi>Iudah's</hi> caſe. Before the Babylonian had laid this yoke on their necks, God had plainly revealed, and often inculcated that it ſhould lye upon them juſt 70. yeeres and no longer, after which they ſhould have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of returne to their owne Land againe. Howbeit, <note place="margin">Ier. 25. 11. 29. 10.</note> the weight of their miſery, the abſence of God, (who had <hi>caſt them out of his ſight)</hi> together with the inſolence and crueltie of their proud oppreſſors, had throwne them downe ſo low in a diſconſolate condition, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which God could either now ſay or doe, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to raiſe up their hearts to any aſſurance of returne. The ſame ſtrength which Luſt hath to draw men from obedience, it will ſurely have afterwards to drive men from beleeving, in their greateſt neceſſities of <hi>living by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The maine beame which ſtucke in their eyes to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ther ſight of deliverance promiſed, was, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and invincible potency of the Chaldean Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy (then in her pride) and more eſpecially the ſtrength of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Queene and Miſtreſſe of that puiſſant Empire. How could they hope to be delivered, when ſhe that commanded the world detained them? <hi>Shall the prey be taken from the Mightie, or the lawfull captive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered?</hi>

            <p>To cure them therefore of this deſperate deſponſion of minde, the Lord ſtirred up this Prophet to foretell the totall and finall ſubverſion and ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> and of that whole Monarchy; and further, to declare from God that the deſolation thereof, ſhould be the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the captivitie of <hi>Iudah</hi> in it. The better to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them of all this, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> wrote the whole Prophecy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112663:7"/>
againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> (contained in this Chapter and the next following) in a Book by it ſelf, which he ſent to <hi>Babylon</hi>

                  <hi>Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Jer. 51. 59.</note> by the hand of <hi>Scraiah</hi> (Lord Chamberlaine to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and now going in an Embaſſie from his Maſter to Great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar)</hi> with Command from the Prophet that, after the reading thereof to the captives, he ſhould <hi>binde a ſtone unto it, and caſt it into the midſt of Euphrates,</hi> with this ſaying pronounced over it, <hi>Thus ſhall Babylon ſinke, and ſhall not riſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But, to haſten to my Text, In the five firſt verſes of this Chapter, the Prophet ſummarily compriſeth the ſubſtance of his whole Prophecy againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, 1. her <hi>deſtruction,</hi> 2. the <hi>Meanes,</hi> 3. the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereof to the people of God.</p>
            <p>And firſt, he makes Proclamation, and an <hi>Olyes!</hi> as it were, to all the world, to come and behold the Great <note place="margin">1.</note> Worke he was to doe againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> the chiefe Citie of the Empire, againſt <hi>Bell</hi> the chiefe Idol of that Citie, and againſt <hi>Merodach</hi> the glory both of that Citie and Empire; yea, though the King then reigning when God meant to deſtroy it, ſhould prove as potent as that great King, the firſt of that name, who for reſtoring the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Empire to her ancient Splendor, and for tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Imperiall Seat from <hi>Nineve</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> was by poſteritie worſhipped as a God, and transferred his name to all his ſucceſſors, as the name of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the Egyptian Kings, of <hi>Benhadad</hi> to the Syrian Monarchs, and of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to the Romane Emperours. Although all theſe ſhould be joyned together to withſtand the downfall of that Monarchy, yet deſolation ſhould be brought over them all, they ſhould all be confounded and removed for ever, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1, 2. and all to make way for the deliverance of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:112663:8"/>
But what ſhould be the <hi>meanes</hi> of ſuch an unexpected deſtruction? This was to be done by an Army from the <note place="margin">Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
               <hi>North,</hi> that is, by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> both of which, but more eſpecially the <hi>Medes,</hi> were ſituated towards the <hi>North</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore ominous. That <note place="margin">Omne malum ab Aqutlane.</note> theſe were the men, appeares more fully by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in the reſidue of this, and of the 51. Chapter. This Northern Army ſhould be the confuſion of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the confuſion of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould prove the reſtoring of the Church <hi>(verſ.</hi> 3.) And the reſtoring of the Church ſhould produce a <hi>Covenant</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>For, behold, the iſſue and <hi>conſequent</hi> of the ruine of <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>Babylon</hi> was, the return of the captive Jews, from thence to Jeruſalem, and a renewing Covenant with him that had ſhewed ſuch mercy on them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>in thoſe dayes, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the children of Iſrael ſhall come, they and the children of Iudah together, going and weeping, they ſhall goe and ſeek the Lord their God. They ſhall aske the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, ſaying, Come and let us joyne our ſelves to the Lord in an everlaſting Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> This began to be fulfilled at the end of 70. yeeres deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, when the Empire was firſt over-run and ſubdued by <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian.</hi> For he made Proclamation of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 22.</note> to returne, in the firſt yeere of his reigne. And when they returned, this was their deportment; they went weeping; and, <hi>to ſeeke the Lord their God.</hi> They <hi>goe,</hi> not ſo much to repoſſeſſe their ancient patrimony and inheritance, and to grow rich in the world, as to ſeeke and finde the Lord their God, and that with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to enter into <hi>Covenant</hi> with Him, and ſuch a Covenant as ſhould never <hi>be forgotten,</hi> but daily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and carefully performed.</p>

Covenant, and that at the time of a publique Faſt? And this brings it home to the buſineſſe we are <note place="margin">1. <hi>That it is ſo,</hi> in ſpeciall.</note> now about. For, as they entred into Covenant upon receipt of ſuch a deliverance, ſo they did it at the time of a ſolemne Faſt. This will appeare throughout the whole ninth Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> where it is firſt ſaid, that <hi>the Children of Iſrael were aſſembled with faſting, and with ſack-cloath, and with earth upon them: they ſeparated themſelves from ſtrangers, they ſtood and confeſſed their ſinnes, and the iniquities of their fathers.</hi> They juſtified God in all his proceedings againſt them, and in all the evils he had brought upon them. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that neither they, their Princes, people, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had kept the Law; they had not ſerved God in that Kingdome he had beſtowed upon them. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſay they, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. <hi>We are ſervants this day, and for the Land that thou gaveſt unto our fathers, to eate the fruit thereof, and the good thereof, behold we are ſervants in it, And it yeeldeth much encreaſe unto the Kings whom thou beſt ſet over us, becauſe of our ſinnes: alſo they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattell at their pleaſure, and we are in great diſtreſſe. And becauſe of all this, we make a ſure Covenant,</hi> in the laſt verſe) <hi>and write it, and our Princes, Levites, and Prieſts ſeale unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here is the full accompliſhment of that you have in my Text. What in the Text is ſet down by way of Prophecy, you here ſee acted in the Hiſtory. In <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs</hi> time, they come home unto it. And if you look into the tenth Chapter, you ſhall ſee who ſealed this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: firſt, the Princes, the Officers, the Magiftrates of the Kingdome, the <hi>Parliament men,</hi> if you will ſo call them, and then the reſt of the people. And what is the ſubſtance of their Covenant? They <hi>entred into a curſe,

and into an Oath, to walke in Gods Law, which was given by</hi>

            <p>Here then is their Covenant: you ſee alſo with what ſolemnitie it was made and ratified; by <hi>ſubſcribing</hi> of <hi>hands,</hi> and ſetting to of their <hi>Seales,</hi> by an <hi>Oath,</hi> and by a <hi>curſe;</hi> binding themſelves by all the moſt ſolemne and ſtrongeſt bonds that poſſibly they could; and all this in Publique, and at a <hi>Publique Faſt.</hi> So that now the point is cleare, <hi>That it is ſo,</hi> and that the practiſe of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath ever been, upon any great deliverance, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to enter into ſolemne Covenant with the Lord.</p>

               </gap>) is very emphatical; ſo as that word, being explained, will ſufficiently ſet out before you the nature of the Covenant here intended. Some Tranſlators render it, <hi>Let us glue our ſelves unto the Lord;</hi> which imports a conjunction ſo neere, as nothing can come between, and ſo firme, as nothing can diſſolve.

               </note>, <hi>for the Kings tribute, and that upon our Lands and Vineyards.</hi> That is, they had engaged both Lands and Vineyards for ſecuritie of the money bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, that the Uſurer ſhould enter upon all, in caſe they failed of payment at the day. So that, as men, to make ſure, will have a <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> or <hi>recogniſance in the nature of a Statute Staple,</hi> acknowledged, whereby a mans perſon, goods, lands, and all, are bound for the ſecuritie of the Creditor, that he ſhall have both principall and intereſt at the day agreed upon (and here that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> proves too true, <hi>The borrower is ſervant to the lender:</hi> for, he hath nothing left to his own diſpoſe; if he would ſell any Land, ſettle any joyncture, there is a <hi>Statute</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, he can diſpoſe of nothing till that be taken off;) ſo it is in the caſe of any man joyning himſelf to the Lord by Covenant, he muſt even bind himſelf to God as firmely, as fully, as the poore borrower, who for his neceſſitie takes up money, binds himſelf to the Uſurer. If Godlend him any mercy, any bleſſing, he binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reſtore not only the principall (the bleſſing it ſelf) when God ſhall call for it; but even the intereſt too; I meane, all poſſible homage, ſervice, and honour which becomes thoſe who have received ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
            <p>This is more than implyed in that parable of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour touching the talents diſpenſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 27. for even to him who had received but one talent, was it ſaid, <hi>Thou oughteſt to have put my money to the Exchangers, that at my coming I might have received mine own with uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> God will have his returne, ſome intereſt, for every mercy; and expects a <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> that is, a Covenant, for his better ſecuritie. God will have him bound, ſoul,

body, eſtate, life and all; ſo as all he is, and hath, ſhall <note place="margin">2. <hi>How this is to be done.</hi>
               </note> be forfeited, if he do not keep touch, and make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to agreement and Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. This is the firſt uſe of the word, <hi>nilvn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is yet more in it. For, though it be true that the obligation of a borrower to the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer be as ſtrong as bonds and Statutes can make it; yet, there is not ſuch an entire, neere, firme, and laſting tye of the borrower to the Lender, nor ſuch a thorough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the whole eſtate of the Uſurer, as there is of him that is in Covenant with God. The Uſurer, though he bind the poor borrower faſt to him, yet he keeps him at diſtance, not giving him intereſt in, or uſe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his eſtate, but only of the ſumme borrowed. But now this <hi>joyning of our ſelves to the Lord,</hi> is ſuch, as is made by <hi>marriage;</hi> and gives intereſt in all that the Lord is, and hath, and admits us to the participation of all the moſt intimate, neereſt, choyſeſt expreſſions of the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Love of God, which is or can be found between the husband and the wife, who are <hi>joyned</hi> together by the bond of marriage, and made one fleſh.</p>
            <p>So the word is uſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 34 where <hi>Leah,</hi> being delivered of her third ſonne, <hi>Levi,</hi> thus ſaith to the women about her, <hi>Now this time will my husband be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>unto me, becauſe I have born him three ſonnes.</hi> That is, now ſhall my husband be more arctly united to me in all love, and in all demonſtrations of it, and that in the moſt free, full, and intimate way of expreſſion that poſſibly can paſſe between thoſe who are coupled together in ſo neere a relation.</p>
            <p>So then, lay both theſe together, and you have a cleare view of this <hi>joyning of our ſelves to the Lord</hi> by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. He that enters into Covenant with God, doth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112663:18"/>
not only bind himſelf, as the needy <hi>borrower</hi> to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous <note place="margin">2. <hi>How this is to be done.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Vſurer,</hi> for a <hi>time;</hi> but, as the <hi>wife</hi> to the <hi>hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> to be <hi>wholly his for ever,</hi> without any reſervation, limitation, or termination, till death diſſolve the bond. As the wife hath intereſt in the goods, eſtate, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the husband; and all that he hath is hers: ſo by this <hi>joyning of our ſelves to the Lord,</hi> He becomes ours, as well as we become his, and both are mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to each other by an indiſſoluble bond for ever. All the power, wiſdome, goodneſſe, mercy, grace, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Great God hath to communicate to the creature, is now aſſured and made over to every ſoule that thus engageth himſelf unto him. And on the other ſide, all the wit, ſtrength, induſtry, wealth, honour, friends, life, and all that this man hath, he makes over, and reſignes up actually, totally, abſolutely, and for ever unto the Lord, to ſerve and honour him withall; and that with all his heart, and with his whole deſire; to have nothing, to do nothing, to be nothing but for the Lord, though all the world be againſt him for it. This I take to be the full latitude of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> for the <hi>Matter</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Touching the <hi>forme</hi> of this Act of <hi>joyning our</hi>

Therefore it is, that among the varietie of ratifications of Covenants mentioned in Scripture, ſtill there is ſomewhat of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſolemnitie reported to have been uſed at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, to ſtrike the bargaine thorough.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is the nature of God, where he beſtowes one bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to adde moe, and ſtill to riſe in his bleſſings. Where he once opens his hand to take a people into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he opens his heart to take them into his <hi>boſome.</hi> Where he puts forth his <hi>power</hi> to <hi>reſcue</hi> a people, he puts out his heart to make them <hi>his owne,</hi> if then they have eyes to diſcerne the opportunity.

them by ſolemne <hi>Covenant</hi> to be their God for ever. <note place="margin">3. <hi>Why it is ſo,</hi> in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, ſhall God, at ſuch a time, be ſo willing and deſirous to enter Covenant with men, and ſhall they think it too much for them to be in Covenant with him? Shall he be faſt bound to them, and they left free to ſit looſe from him? Indeed, this is that which our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature would willingly have: People would faine be their owne men; which yet in truth, is, to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſlaves. Neceſſary therefore it is for men, upon receit of <hi>any deliverance,</hi> to renew Covenant with God who is pleaſed to honour them ſo farre, as to be in Covenant with them. For, theſe two are relatives, and ever goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> God is not the God of any people but of his owne Covenant-Servants. The reſt, he ſtiles, <hi>Lo-ammi.</hi> Hoſ. 1. 9. <hi>for yee are not my people,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I will not be your God.</hi> They will not enter into Covenant with me, and I will make no Covenant with them. That is the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God is pleaſed to enter into Covenant with his <note place="margin">2. God is content to be bound firſt.</note> people, ſo is he <hi>firſt</hi> in the Covenant. God requires no man to bind himſelf by Covenant to Him, till the Lord firſt ſtrike a Covenant with his Soule. As <hi>we love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us firſt;</hi> ſo we enter into Covenant with him, becauſe he firſt entreth into Covenant with us. I <hi>will be their God,</hi> he is firſt bound, and ſeales firſt; and then, and not till then, it followes; <hi>they ſhall be my people.</hi> This is the conſtant tenor of the Covenant. And ſhall he begin, and we think much to follow? Can there be a marriage conſummated where onely the man is firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the woman, and the woman will not after, for her part, be married to the man? Now, God no way ſo much declares his willingneſſe to be in Covenant, and to be <hi>firſt</hi> in it, as by deliverances (as we ſhall ſee more in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112663:21"/>
next reaſon:) great reaſon therefore, men ſhould then ſecond him by mutuall ſtipulation. It is an hard caſe, <note place="margin">3. <hi>Why it is ſo,</hi> in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> when men will not follow, where God leades.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In deliverances God more eſpecially manifeſteth his fidelity in <hi>keeping Covenant</hi> with his people, even <note place="margin">3. In delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances God more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his fidelity in the Grand Covenant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.</note> when they have <hi>broken Covenant</hi> with him, and forfeited all into his hands. When God delivers a people out of any ſtraite, doth not that uſually ſuppoſe ſome <hi>folly</hi> of theirs going before, &amp; provoking him to caſt them into that affliction; whence, upon their <hi>cry,</hi> he is pleaſed to deliver them?</p>
            <p>And when they have ſo farre and ſo long broken the Lawes, and contemned the Counſel of the moſt high, and <hi>dealt unfaithfully in his Covenant,</hi> as that he hath bin even compelled to throw them into <hi>darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death:</hi> yet if then, upon their humiliation, he be pleaſed to <hi>deliver them out of all their diſtreſſes;</hi> this is to give them freſh experience of his infinite love in <hi>Keeping Covenant and mercy</hi> with them, that kept no Covenant with him. This is called <hi>a remembring of his Covenant</hi> with his people, after that <hi>their uncircumciſed hearts be humbled, and that they accept of the puniſhment of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>their iniquity,</hi> when God ſhould have caſt them out of their land, among their enemies, as afterward he did. So that, in a deliverance, that which is moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in God, and ſhould be moſt ſweet and pretious to his people and moſt eyed by them, is his fidelity, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and unchangeable Love in bringing out that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he once made with them, and ſpreading it before himſelfe, and making of it good, even when they could not exſpect it, nor durſt to plead it. Hence that paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſpeech of God to rebellious <hi>Ephraim. Is Ephraim my deare ſonne? is he a pleaſant child?</hi> As if he ſhould have <note place="margin">

ſaid, ſurely he cannot conclude ſo; yet, my love, by vertue of the ancient Covenant betwen us, makes <note place="margin">3. <hi>Why it is ſo,</hi> in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> me ſtill ſo to account him: witneſſe that which followes; <hi>for ſince I ſpake againſt him,</hi> (that is, as reſolving to caſt him off for ever) <hi>I remember him ſtill,</hi> (I remember I am in Covenant with him,) <hi>therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I wil ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Thus, deliverance is a thread drawne out of the bowells of his Covenant. Great reaſon therefore that, in this caſe, his people ſhould think of renewing their league and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Lord on their parts, when they have ſo ſhamefully broken it, and yet he goes on in ſo much mercy to manifeſt his fidelity in <hi>remembring</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> the Couenant on his part, by giving them deliverance.</p>

If God have delivered us once, he will do it no more: or, if he do ſomewhat, to hold us up by the chin that we ſink not, yet will he hold us down from the throne, that we reigne not, till we come up actually and fully in this point of Covenanting with him. It is only to thoſe that <hi>take hold of his Covenant,</hi> that he <hi>gives an everlaſting name which ſhalt not be cut off,</hi> Iſay 56. 4, 5.</p>

            <p>And, as it was with old <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo it is, and ever will be with the new, (I meane, <hi>myſticall Babylon)</hi> to the end of the world; might ſhe ſo long continue.

            <p>Now then, when God pleaſeth to deliver a people from ſuch bondage, and to awaken them effectually to look up, and to reflect even with aſtomiſhment upon thoſe great and gaſtly ſins of theirs, which had cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cords of the Covenant between God and their Soules, and provoked God to ſubject them to ſo much bondage; and, that they muſt either renew Covenant, or be obnoxious to more wrath, and be laid open to more and greater temptations and ſins; this cannot but exceedingly work upon their ſouls, cauſing their hearts to melt, and their very bowels to yearne after the Lord, to enter into a new, <hi>an everlaſting Covenant that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that which God by his ſervant <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſpake touching the deportment of the remnant of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which ſhould eſcape the ſword among the nations and

For, of them, he ſaith there; <hi>they that eſcape of you ſhall remember me among the nations, becauſe I am broken with their whoriſh heart which hath departed from me, and with their eyes which goe a whoring after their idols, and they ſhall loth themſelves for the evils which they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all their abominations.</hi> And of the ſame people he ſaith, afterwards, <note n="*" place="margin">cap. 11. 18, 19, 20.</note> that, upon their returne home, <hi>They ſhall take away all the deteſtable things, and all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof from thence. And I will give them one heart, and put a new ſpirit within them, I will take away the ſtony heart out of their fleſh, and give them an heart of fleſh, that they they may walke in my Statutes, and keep mine ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and doe them: and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</hi> So that here is a full Covenant ſtriken, and that upon this ground: viz. the Conſideration of thoſe great ſinnes they formerly committed, whereby they had broken their firſt Covenant and departed from their God.</p>

            <p>I appeale to the conſciences of many who heare me this day, and I require them from the Lord, to witneſſe truly, whether it be not even thus with them.

For, as many exact Chronologers obſerve, the Temple was not perfected in the reigne of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> as ſome have thought; but in the ſixth yeere of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom and the former <hi>Darius,</hi> both <hi>Xerxes</hi> (the husband of <hi>Eſther,</hi> and called in Scripture <hi>Ahaſhuerus)</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> ſucceſſively ſwayed the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Scepter.

This Covenant is a marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and there is no marrying with God, ſo long as your former husband, your baſe corruptions, your ſwearing, riot, drunkenneſſe, uncleanneſſe, pride, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and what ever elſe your ſoules <hi>know to be the plague of your own hearts,</hi> remaine alive and undivorced. <hi>For the woman which hath an husband, is bound by the Law to her husband ſo long as he liveth:</hi> but, if he be once <hi>dead, ſhe is free from that Law,</hi> Rom. 7. Therefore ſend theſe packing, in the firſt place. A wiſe man will never marry a ſtrumpet, nor with any woman, that hath another hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: his wife that ſhall be only his own, none elſe ſhall have intereſt in her. Much leſſe then, will the Holy and Jealous God admit of any Spouſe that is wedded to any luſt, and ſo continueth. Say then, what wilt thou now do? wilt thou ſtill keep thy darling luſt?

            <p>Every Idol is that great <hi>Image of Iealouſy,</hi> which the Lord can by no meanes endure, and which will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the deſtruction of King and People, where ever it is entertained, eſpecially if againe received in, after it hath been once ejected.

            <p>Beloved, let me ſpeake freely, for I ſpeake for God, and for all your ſafeties. You cannot be ignorant of the groſſe Idolatry daily encreaſing among us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not (as adultery) in Corners onely, but in the open light; people going to, and coming from the Maſſe in great multitudes, and that as ordinarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, confidently as others go to and from our Churches.

            <p>Whoſe heart bleeds not over this prodigious growth of Popery and over flowing of Popiſh Maſſes?

Who remembers not with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and horror, how often that inſatiable Idol hath bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelfe in the bloud of many of our Anceſtors and Progenitors? And can any be ſo ſilly as to beleeve, that it will reſt ſatisfied till it ſwim againe in our bloud alſo; unleſſe we will joyne with Idolaters, and ſo periſh in Hell? For what ever ſome men talke of the poſſibility of the ſalvation of ſome perſons in that Church, (as they call it) yet it is agreed on all hands, among us, that, for thoſe of our owne Nation and once of our owne Church where the light hath ſo long ſhined in ſo much brightneſſe, ſo as they have both received &amp; profeſſed it; if they ſhall (whether to gratifie a Parent, a wife, husband, friend, Maſter &amp;c.) put out their owne eyes, and returne backe to <hi>Babylon</hi> from whence they were once ſet free, their caſe is very deſperate and diſmall, and <hi>it had been better for them never to have knowne the way of righteouſneſſe, then after they have knowne it to</hi>

               </note> you will be thorough for God, and follow him fully, downe with all <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> through the Kingdome, ſo farre as the making of the Lawes yet more ſtrict and <note place="margin">Meanes.</note> full for that purpoſe, may effect it.

And if you, having now ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and power, ſhall not throughly cleanſe the Land of theſe ſpirituall whoredomes ſo boldly facing and even out-facing the glorious Goſpell profeſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; be ſure, that, in ſtead of a bleſſing upon your Conſultations and proceedings, you will draw downe a Curſe that will cleave to you, and goe home with you, and ſcatter like poyſon over all parts and Corners of the Kingdome, till all be conſumed and become a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>You all I thinke, agree upon the neceſſity of a great Reformation. Where ſhould you begin then, but where God ever begins? Looke into the Stories of <hi>Aſa, Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, Hezekiah, Ioſiah,</hi> and even of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> himſelf, (the groſſeſt Idolater and moſt bloudy Tyrant that ever reigned in <hi>Iudah)</hi> when once God had throughly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him; and you ſhall ever finde that they began their grand Reformation at <hi>Idols,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed with them. I ſpeake not this to backe or countenance any tumultuous or ſeditious ſpirits that have lately been ſtirred up to doe things without Commiſſion; but to You, whom God hath duely called to the worke, and indiſpenſibly requires it at your hands. <note place="margin">3.

Only I am to pray you, that if you ſhall find any eſcapes to have been made in the Ordinary Courts of Juſtice, in the condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Murder,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> take notice of them, and there be ſure to ſtrike home, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did where <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe had been too indulgent.

teſtimony of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> that <hi>he walked in the firſt wayes of his father David,</hi> verſ. 9. that <hi>he had riches and honour</hi>

            <p>And yet, as many of our blind guides and Idol Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards care not to erect Preaching where there is none, ſo doe they all they can to cheat and defraud thoſe of it who doe or would enjoy it, ſometimes by pulling it downe where it is ſet up, and (to fill up the meaſure of their wickedneſſe) glorying in it, when they have done; ſometimes by ſtriking out the teeth of it, that if men will needes preach, yet it ſhall be to little purpoſe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a frigid, toothleſſe, ſapleſſe diſcourſe, never pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing deeper than the care. If the Preacher come home to convince the Conſcience of particulars that need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, (which yet was the old courſe, and ſhould be ſo ſtill) the Preacher is either derided as worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but contempt, or elſe cenſured as indiſcreet, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

it is now become a great hindrance to edification. <note place="margin">3. <hi>Vſe. Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> If a Miniſter would carefully and ſolidly open the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heads of Catechiſme, confirme them by Scripture, and bring them home by ſome ſhort and familiar appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Meanes.</note> moſt ſutable to vulgar eares and Capacities; I hold it ſimply the moſt profitable exerciſe (at leaſt for one part of the day) that can be ſet up for the increaſe of ſound knowledge and Piety: and pity it is that this is ſo much neglected. <hi>But this,</hi> ſay our new Maſters, <hi>is worſe than preaching.</hi> Therefore they enjoyne all to keep one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the bare Queſtions and Anſwers of the <hi>Chila's</hi> Catechiſme. And if any preſume to adde any expoſition or inſtruction, he is by ſome hurried from poſt to pillar, and cenſured as a pernitious Malefactor.</p>
            <p>And as they have thus thruſt all preaching (be it but Catecheticall) out of the Church in the afternoones of the Lords day, ſo have they ſhut divers able, godly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Paſtors out of their owne Pulpits on the weeke dayes, even in Populous Townes, where the Miniſters were willing to beſtow their paines, (and ſo for many yeares with great fruit and comfort to the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had done) <hi>gratis,</hi> for the refreſhing of many hungry Soules who had no preaching at home in their owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and dare not ſtirre thence on the Lords day to ſeeke it abroad.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſome of your Cathedrall Men are come to that paſſe, that when any Sermon (ſuch as it is) is preached in the Cathedrall or Collegiate Church, no Sermon muſt then be preached in the Pariſh Church or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es adjoyning, meerely to uphold the pompe and State of the Greater Church, and for feare of leſſening the Auditory, or diminiſhing the honour of the Preacher, (who many times deſerves little enough) whereas not

            <p>Wonder not at my length, and heate in this point. It is a matter of greateſt Conſequence, and of all other moſt proper for a Preacher to be zealous in.
