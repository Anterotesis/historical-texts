         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas at Our accesse vnto the Imperial Crowne of this Realme,</hi>
Wee found the Treasures thereof exhausted, the Reuenue of Our
Lands much diminished, and yet a great masse of Debts lying vpon
Us, &amp; a dayly charge, which in an ordinary course must be borne for the
support of Our Honour, and a more then extraordinary charge for the
necessary defence of Our Kingdomes, Wee being imbarked in a Warre
at Our first comming to the Crowne: And when Wee entred into a
serious consideration of the seuerall parts of Our Reuenue, Wee found
them much too short to maintaine Our ordinary Expences, much lesse the extraordinary, which
are neuerthelesse vnauoidable. To the end therfore, that Wee might be fully and truely informed
of the present state of Our Reuenue in euery part thereof, and of the burthen which lyeth vpon
it, and so bee better enabled, for the future, to dispose and settle the same in such an order, as that
Wee might with more comfort mannage Our Estate, Wee thought it fit to make choyce of some
Persons of qualitie and experience, to bee Our Commissioners for Our Reuenue, and they to
take into their especiall care and considerations, by what iust and honourable meanes, Wee might
retrench all vndue or vnnecessary Charges, issuing out of Our Reuenue, or Coffers, and how to
aduance and improoue such parts thereof, as might admitte of an improouement; which Our
Commissioners hauing returned to Us an Accompt of their paines from time to time in this
Our Seruice, Wee finde by them that the casuall profits of Our Lands, either by Fines for Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or Copy-hold Estates, Herriots, Reliefes, or therwise, haue, <hi>Communibus annis,</hi> yeelded to Us,
or Our Crowne, in diuers yeeres past, but a small Summe, nor is like to doe in many yeeres yet
to come; And yet out of the same there are issuing diuers Annuall Fees and Payments, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the whole to a great yeerely value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28584:2"/>
Wee therefore, by the aduice of Our sayd Commissioners, intending to reduce Our Reuenue
to a more certaintie, and to improoue our yeerely Rents in those places where it may conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
admitte of such improouement, to abate Our vnnecessary charge issuing thereout, and yet
to raise a present Summe of Money towards the defraying of those great expences, which for
the publique defence of Our people and Kingdomes Wee cannot auoid, and for the supply where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
Wee are resolued to spare nothing which lyeth in Our power, and for the satisfying of those
iust debts, which dayly crie in Our eares, haue resolued, and by these Presents doe declare and
publish Our Resolution to all Our louing Subiects whom it may concerne, That We wil grant
in Fee-Farme, all, or any of Our Honours, Manours, Lands, Tenements, Woods, &amp; other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments,
both in the Suruey of Our Exchequer, and of Our Duchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> aswell such
as are held by Copie, as by Lease, Custodie, or otherwise, &amp; aswell such as are yet in the hands of
Our Commissioners when We were Prince, as other our Lands in Mortgage, (which We pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
forthwith to redeeme) those Manors &amp; Lands onely excepted, which are parcell of Our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
of <hi>Cornewall.</hi> And to this end We purpose forthwith to nominate certaine persons vnder Our
Great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> to bee Our Commissioners, to whom Wee will giue full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
for Us, and in Our Name, to treate and conclude with any persons, for any parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
aswell Quillets and Parcels, as entire Manours, at, and for such increase of Rents, or Fine,
or both, as they in their good discretions shall thinke fit, and agree vpon: And We haue thought
good thus to publish Our Pleasure and Resolution herein, that the present Tenants of Our
Lands, and all other Our louing Subiects may take notice thereof, and may know whither,
and to whom to make their repaire for this purpose; To which ende Wee will appoint Our
sayd Commissioners to attend this Our Seruice on the twentieth day of September next, and
so from time to time thence forward, at the Chamber, commonly called the Painted Chamber, in
Our Palace at <hi>Westminster,</hi> whither Our pleasure is, that all such of Our Subiects, as shall bee
desirous to purchase any of Our said Lands in Fee-Farme, as aforesaid, shall resort to make their
agreements accordingly. And because this Our Resolution may take that effect which Wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and expect, Our Will and Command is, that from hencefoorth, vntill Our further Pleasure
bee knowen herein, no Estate or Lease by Copie or otherwise, bee renewed, granted, or altered by
any, but by Oursayd Commissioners onely.</p>
