            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pleas'd to cast, upon this Poem (the
first fruits of an Infant Muse) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the knowledge I have
of your excellent temper, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alter'd
clemency, have sufficiently warranted my
presumption of throwing it at your feet, and by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it an humble present to a Person so far above
the common Sphere, secure it from the peircing
<hi>Tallons</hi> of Eagle Eyed Criticks: I know it is a
triffle that by the meaness of the stile, the want of
good design, and the ill representation at the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,</hi>
being Play'd to the worst advantage, has got
little credit with the World and consequently is

far unworthy your patronage, but if you consider
the credit of a young Author lyes at stake, one
whose design was onely to please not offend, you
doubtless will be induc'd to a more favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of my presumption. The censures of others
will the less trouble me when you protect it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how common 'tis now to discant on Authors
truely famous and worthy all applause, as well as
others of a far meaner knowledge and reputation
'Tis my desire, I confess, to be free from malicious
censures, and that my partial Reader would be so
favourable as not to be my Interpreter, but content
himself with the Perusal, according to <hi>Martial
(Absit a jocorum nostrorum simplicitate malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
interpres,)</hi> But since the humour of this Age
tends another way, I must study self satisfaction,
and relie on the Patronage of a Person whose
worth I am so well acquainted with, that the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms
of pretenders will appear as ridiculous as
they can endeavour to make this Poem, if they
durst write themselves.</p>

            <l>To us, but always thought your selves i'th' right.</l>
            <l>Our Rhymer swears it never shall corode</l>

            </l>
            <l>Since great and pow'rful Sons of Poesie,</l>
            <l>Have felt your pointed censures, why not he?</l>
            <l>The Age is alter'd now, he that has Wit,</l>
            <l>Ne're uses it abroad, but in the Pit,</l>
            <l>There spreads it all, and e're one Scene does know,</l>

            <l>Not a Wench here that's worth the speaking to.</l>
            <l>Others that want Wit, hither come to glean,</l>
            <l>Seem to find fault and cavil at a Scene,</l>
            <l>Because they understand it not, yet will</l>
            <l>Dislike, because 'tis Modish, and Gentile.</l>
            <l>Thus both ways we our Enemy's inclose:</l>
            <l>The Wise and Fools are equally our foes,</l>
            <l>'Tis true some tender hearted Females come,</l>
            <l>That want divertisement and trade at home,</l>
            <l>But little's to be got by them, alas!</l>
            <l>They bring good faces, but their moneys brass,</l>
            <l>Madam, we cry, 'tis naught, she peeps through hood;</l>
            <l>Cryes, truth, my Lord did give it me for good.</l>
            <l>Still this makes ill for us, such as doe pay</l>

            <l>Your Criticism's greater then your sins are,</l>
            <l>And yet, you'd laugh to hear, Old Cole of Windsor,</l>

            <l>But do your worst for we resolve to try,</l>
            <l>A proof now of the Ladies Clemency,</l>
            <l>If they but favour us, you must obey,</l>
            <l>Their frowns hurt you more then you'l hurt our Play,</l>
