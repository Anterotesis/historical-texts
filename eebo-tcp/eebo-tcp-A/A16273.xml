         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

such good sort as time would permit, hauing past the pikes

Patrone first, and next (as his deere friends and kindsmen)
to offer you her kinde seruice. If shee speede well there, it
is all shee requires, if they frowne at her beere, she greatly
not cares: for the wise (shee knowes) will neuer be other
then them selues, as for such then as would seeme so, but
neither are, nor euer will be, she holds this as a maine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
that their malice neede as little be feared, as their
fauour or friendship is to be desired. So hoping you will
not forget vs there, as we continuallie shall be mindefull

            <p>MAny honoured names haue heretofore (in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer
interest,) patronized some part of these inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
many here be, that onely these Collections haue
brought to light, &amp; not inferiour (in the best opinions) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
before published. The trauaile that hath beene taken in
gathering them from so many handes, hath wearied some
howres, which seuered, might in part haue perished, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
into this meane volume, may in the opinion of some not
be altogether vnworthy the labour. If any man hath beene
defrauded of any thing by him composed, by another mans
title put to the same, hee hath this benefit by this collection,
freely to challenge his owne in publique, where els he might
be robd of his proper due. No one thing beeing here placed
by the Collector of the same vnder any mans name, eyther at
large, or in letters, but as it was deliuered by some especiall
coppy comming to his handes. No one man, that shall take
offence that his name is published to any inuention of his,
but he shall within the reading of a leafe or two, meete with
another in reputation euery way equal with himselfe, whose
name hath beene before printed to his Poeme, which nowe
taken away were more then theft: which may satisfie him
that would faine seeme curious or be intreated for his fame.</p>
            <p>Nowe, if any Stationer shall finde faulte, that his Coppies
are robd by any thing in this Collection, let me aske him this
question, VVhy more in this, then in any Diuine or humaine
Authour: From whence a man (writing of that argument)
shal gather any saying, sentence, similie, or example, his name
put to it who is the Authour of the same. This is the simplest
<pb facs="tcp:13045:4"/>
of many reasons that I could vrdge, though perhaps the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
his capacitie, but that I would be loth to trouble my selfe,
to satisfie him. Further, if any man whatsoeuer, in prizing of
his owne birth or fortune, shall take in scorne, that a far mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
man in the eye of the world, shal be placed by him: I tell
him plainly whatsoeuer so excepting, that, that mans wit is
set by his, not that man by him. In which degree, the names
of Poets (all feare and dutie ascribed to her great and sacred
Name) haue beene placed with the names of the greatest
Princes of the world, by the most autentique and worthiest
iudgements, without disparagement to their soueraigne ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles:
which if any man taking exception thereat, in ignorance
know not, I hold him vnworthy to be placed by the meanest
that is but graced with the title of a Poet. Thus gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
I wish thee all happines.</p>

               <l>Good Kings haue not disdained it,</l>
               <l>but Sheepheards haue beene named:</l>
               <l>A sheepe-hooke is a Scepter fit,</l>
               <l>for people well reclaimed.</l>
               <l>The Sheepheards life so honour'd is and praised:</l>
               <l>That Kings lesse happy seeme, though higher raised.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Sommer Sunne hath guilded faire,</l>
               <l>with morning rayes the mountaines:</l>
               <l>The birds doo caroll in the ayre,</l>
               <l>and naked Nimphs in Fountaines.</l>

               <l>All breathe delight, all solace in the season:</l>

               <l>Is (<hi>Sophi</hi> said) thence called so,</l>
               <l>but names her beauty showe not,</l>
               <l>Yet hath the world no better name then she:</l>

            <l>IN pride of youth, in midst of May,</l>
            <l>When birds with many a merry Lay,</l>
            <l>salute the Sunnes vp-rising:</l>
            <l>I sate me downe fast by a Spring,</l>
            <l>And while these merry Chaunters sing,</l>
            <l>I fell vpon surmizing.</l>
            <l>Amidst my doubt and minds debate,</l>
            <l>Of change of time, of vvorlds estate,</l>
            <l>I spyed a boy attired</l>
            <l>In siluer plumes, yet naked quite,</l>
            <l>Saue pretty feathers fit for flight,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:13045:17"/>
wherewith he still aspired.</l>
            <l>A bowe he bare to worke mens wrack,</l>
            <l>A little Quiuer at his back,</l>
            <l>with many arrowes filled:</l>
            <l>And in his soft and pretty hand,</l>
            <l>He held a liuely burning brand,</l>
            <l>where-with he Louers killed.</l>
            <l>Fast by his side, in rich aray,</l>
            <l>There sate a louely Lady gay,</l>
            <l>his mother as I guessed:</l>
            <l>That set the Lad vpon her knee,</l>
            <l>And trimd his bowe, and taught him flee,</l>
            <l>and mickle Loue professed.</l>
            <l>Oft from her lap at sundry stoures,</l>
            <l>He leapt, and gathered Sommer flowres,</l>
            <l>both Violets and Roses:</l>
            <l>But see the chaunce that followed fast,</l>
            <l>As he the pompe of prime dooth wast,</l>
            <l>before that he supposes:</l>
            <l>A Bee that harbour'd hard thereby,</l>
            <l>Did sting his hand, and made him crye</l>
            <l>Oh Mother, I am wounded:</l>
            <l>Faire <hi>Venus</hi> that beheld her Sonne,</l>
            <l>Cryed out alas, I am vndone,</l>
            <l>and there-vpon she swounded.</l>
            <l>My little Lad the Goddesse sayd,</l>
            <l>Who hath my <hi>Cupid</hi> so dismayd?</l>
            <l>he aunswered: Gentle Mother</l>
            <l>The hony-worker in the Hiue,</l>
            <l>My greefe and mischiefe dooth contriue,</l>
            <l>alas it is none other.</l>
            <l>Shee kist the Lad: Now marke the chaunce,</l>
            <l>And straite she fell into a traunce,</l>
            <l>and crying, thus concluded:</l>
            <l>Ah wanton boy, like to the Bee,</l>
            <l>Thou with a kisse hast wounded me,</l>
            <l>and haplesse Loue included.</l>

            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:13045:17"/>
But ah, my wounds are full of spright,</l>
            <l>and cannot be recured:</l>
            <l>The boy that kist his Mothers paine,</l>
            <l>Gan smile, and kist her whole againe,</l>
            <l>and made her hope assured.</l>
            <l>She suckt the wound, and swag'd the sting,</l>
            <l>And little Loue ycurde did sing,</l>
            <l>then let no Louer sorrow:</l>
            <l>To day though greefe attaint his hart,</l>
            <l>Let him with courage bide the smart,</l>
            <l>amends will come to morrow.</l>

               <hi>THestilis</hi> a silly Swaine, when Loue did him forsake,</l>
            <l>In mournfull wife amid the woods, thus gan his plaint to make.</l>
            <l>Ah wofull man (quoth he) falne is thy lot to mone,</l>
            <l>And pine away with carefull thoughts, vnto thy Loue vnknowne.</l>
            <l>Thy Nimph forsakes thee quite, whom thou didst honour so:</l>
            <l>That aye to her thou wert a friend, but to thy selfe a foe.</l>
            <l>Ye Louers that haue lost your harts-desired choyce:</l>
            <l>Lament with me my cruell hap, and helpe my trembling voyce.</l>
            <l>Was neuer man that stoode so great in Fortunes grace,</l>
            <l>Nor with his sweate (alas too deere) possest so high a place:</l>
            <l>As I whose simple hart, aye thought himselfe still sure,</l>

Shee knowes my guiltlesse hart, and yet she lets it pine:</l>
            <l>Of her vntrue professed loue, so feeble is the twine.</l>
            <l>What wonder is it then, if I berent my haires:</l>

            <l>And yeelded goods and life into his enemies hands:</l>
            <l>What tongue could tell his woe? yet was his griefe much lesse</l>
            <l>Then mine, for I haue lost my Loue, which might my woe redresse.</l>
            <l>Ye woods that shroud my limbs, giue now your hollow sound:</l>
            <l>That ye may helpe me to bewaile, the cares that me confound.</l>
            <l>Ye Riuers rest a while, and stay your streames that runne:</l>

            <l>A Silly Sheepheard lately sate</l>
            <l>among a flock of Sheepe:</l>
            <l>Where musing long on this and that,</l>
            <l>at last he fell a sleepe.</l>
            <l>And in the slumber as he lay,</l>
            <l>he gaue a pitteous groane:</l>
            <l>He thought his sheepe were runne away,</l>
            <l>and he was left alone.</l>
            <l>He whoopt, he whistled, and he call'd,</l>
            <l>but not a sheepe came neere him:</l>
            <l>Which made the Sheepheard sore appall'd,</l>
            <l>to see that none would heare him.</l>
            <l>But as the Swaine amazed stood,</l>
            <l>in this most solemne vaine:</l>

Came <hi>Phillida</hi> foorth of the vvood,</l>

            <l>Whom when the Sheepheard did behold,</l>
            <l>he straite began to weepe:</l>
            <l>And at the hart he grew a cold,</l>
            <l>to thinke vpon his sheepe.</l>
            <l>For well he knew, where came the Queene,</l>
            <l>the Sheepheard durst not stay:</l>
            <l>And where that he durst not be seene,</l>
            <l>the sheepe must needes away.</l>
            <l>To aske her if she saw his flock,</l>
            <l>might happen pacience mooue:</l>
            <l>And haue an aunswere with a mock,</l>
            <l>that such demaunders prooue.</l>
            <l>Yet for because he saw her come</l>
            <l>alone out of the vvood:</l>
            <l>He thought he would not stand as dombe,</l>
            <l>vvhen speach might doo him good.</l>
            <l>And therefore falling on his knees,</l>
            <l>to aske but for his sheepe:</l>
            <l>He did awake, and so did leese</l>

            <lg>
               <l>SHeepheard, saw you not</l>
               <l>my faire louely <hi>Phillis,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Walking on this mountaine,</l>
               <l>or on yonder plaine?</l>
               <l>She is gone this way to <hi>Dianaes</hi> Fountaine,</l>
               <l>and hath left me wounded,</l>
               <l>with her high disdaine.</l>
               <l>Aye me, she is faire,</l>
               <l>And without compare,</l>
               <l>Sorrow come and sit with me:</l>
               <l>Loue is full of feares,</l>
               <l>Loue is full of teares,</l>
               <l>Loue without these cannot be.</l>
               <l>Thus my passions paine me,</l>
               <l>For my loue hath slaine me,</l>
               <l>Gentle Sheepheard beare a part:</l>
               <l>Pray to <hi>Cupids</hi> mother,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Where her flocks are feeding,</l>
               <l>by the Riuers side:</l>
               <l>Oh, I must admire</l>
               <l>she so farre exceeding</l>
               <l>In surpassing beautie,</l>
               <l>should surpasse in pride.</l>
               <l>But alas I finde,</l>
               <l>They are all vnkinde</l>
               <l>Beauty knowes her power too well:</l>
               <l>When they list, they loue,</l>
               <l>When they please, they moue,</l>
               <l>thus they turne our heauen to hell.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13045:87"/>
For their faire eyes glauncing,</l>
               <l>Like to <hi>Cupids</hi> dauncing,</l>
               <l>roule about still to deceaue vs:</l>
               <l>With vaine hopes deluding,</l>
               <l>Still dispraise concluding,</l>
               <l>Now they loue, and now they leaue vs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus I doo despaire,</l>

               <l>heauie hart with woe will breake:</l>

               <l>Let them shew I loue her,</l>
               <l>gracious <hi>Venus</hi> be my guide:</l>

               <l>She will still disdaine me,</l>
               <l>beauty is so full of pride.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What though she be faire?</l>
               <l>speake, and feare not speeding,</l>
               <l>Be she nere so coy,</l>

            <head>¶The Wood-mans walke.</head>
            <l>THrough a faire Forrest as I went</l>
            <l>vpon a Sommers day,</l>
            <l>I met a Wood-man queint and gent,</l>
            <l>yet in strange aray.</l>
            <l>I meruail'd much at his disguise,</l>
            <l>whom I did know so well:</l>
            <l>But thus in tearmes both graue and wise,</l>
            <l>his minde he gan to tell.</l>
            <l>Friend, muse not at this fond aray,</l>
            <l>but list a while to me:</l>
            <l>For it hath holpe me to furuay</l>
            <l>what I shall shew to thee.</l>
            <l>Long liu'd I in this Forrest faire,</l>
            <l>till wearie of my weale:</l>
            <l>Abroade in walks I would repaire,</l>
            <l>as now I will reueale.</l>
            <l>My first dayes walke was to the Court,</l>
            <l>where Beautie fed mine eyes:</l>
            <l>Yet found I that the Courtly sport,</l>
            <l>did maske in slie disguise.</l>
            <l>For falshood sate in fairest lookes,</l>
            <l>and friend to friend was coy:</l>
            <l>Court-fauour fill'd but empty bookes,</l>
            <l>and there I found no ioy.</l>
            <l>Desert went naked in the cold,</l>
            <l>when crouching craft was sed:</l>
            <l>Sweet words were cheapely bought and sold,</l>
            <l>but none that stood in sted,</l>
            <l>Wit was imployed for each mans owne,</l>
            <l>plaine meaning came too short:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:13045:95"/>
All these deuises seene and knowne,</l>
            <l>made me forsake the Court.</l>
            <l>Vnto the Citty next I went,</l>
            <l>in hope of better hap:</l>
            <l>Where liberally I launch'd and spent,</l>
            <l>as set on Fortunes lap.</l>
            <l>The little stock I had in store,</l>
            <l>me thought would nere be done:</l>
            <l>Friends flockt about me more and more,</l>
            <l>as quickly lost as wone.</l>
            <l>For when I spent, they were kinde,</l>
            <l>but when my purse did faile:</l>
            <l>The formost man came last behinde,</l>
            <l>thus loue with wealth doth quaile.</l>
            <l>Once more for footing yet I stroue,</l>
            <l>although the world did frowne:</l>
            <l>But they before that held me vp,</l>
            <l>together troad me downe.</l>
            <l>And least once more I should arise,</l>
            <l>they sought my quite decay:</l>
            <l>Then got I into this disguise,</l>
            <l>and thence I stole away.</l>
            <l>And in my minde (me thought) I saide,</l>
            <l>Lord blesse me from the Cittie:</l>
            <l>Where simplenes is thus betraide,</l>
            <l>and no remorce or pittie.</l>
            <l>Yet would I not giue ouer so,</l>
            <l>but once more trie my fate:</l>
            <l>And to the Country then I goe,</l>
            <l>to liue in quiet state.</l>
            <l>There did appeare no subtile showes,</l>
            <l>but yea and nay went smoothly:</l>
            <l>But Lord how Country-folks can glose,</l>
            <l>when they speake most soothly.</l>
            <l>More craft was in a buttond cap,</l>
            <l>and in an old wiues rayle:</l>
            <l>Then in my life it was my hap,</l>
            <l>to see on Downe or Dale.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:13045:96"/>
There was no open forgerie,</l>
            <l>but vnder-handed gleaning:</l>
            <l>Which they call Country pollicie,</l>
            <l>but hath a worser meaning.</l>
            <l>Some good bold-face beares out the wrong,</l>
            <l>because he gaines thereby:</l>
            <l>The poore mans back is crackt ere long,</l>
            <l>yet there he lets him lye.</l>
            <l>And no degree among them all,</l>
            <l>but had such close intending:</l>
            <l>That I vpon my knees did fall,</l>
            <l>and prayed for their amending.</l>
            <l>Back to the vvoods I got againe,</l>
            <l>in minde perplexed sore:</l>
            <l>Where I found ease of all this paine,</l>
            <l>and meane to stray no more.</l>
            <l>There, Citty, Court, nor Country too,</l>
            <l>can any way annoy me:</l>
            <l>But as a vvood-man ought to doo,</l>
            <l>I freely may imploy me.</l>
            <l>There liue I quietly alone,</l>
            <l>and none to trip my talke:</l>
            <l>Wherefore when I am dead and gone,</l>
            <l>think on the Wood-mans walke.</l>
