         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Before the Right Honourable

Then Lord Chief BARON of the EXCHEQUER

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THere are two Queſtions which every one that
looks on this Tryal will be apt to put, and
expect a Reſolution: <hi>viz.</hi> Why was not
this Publiſhed ſooner? and why now? The anſwer
to the former depends on matter of Fact, (ſo that
as it can have no more credibility, ſo it demands as
much as the ſerious Proteſtation of a Chriſtian and
a Miniſter can give it:) and will be a fit introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Reply to the ſecond Query, and I hope
both together will give ſufficient ſatisfaction. A
very good friend of mine, and near Relation of Sir
<hi>John Croke</hi> engaged me not to do it whilſt he lived;
'twas hard to forbear ſo long, and ſuffer my Innocence
to be ſo publickly aſperſed, and not receive as publick
a Vindication. The Conſpirators had their Agents
abroad, who publiſhed and very zealouſly heightned
the Crimes they themſelves had forged: many years
the Plot had been tontriving and endeavoured to be
brought forth in moſt of the Courts in <hi>England:</hi>
My Credit defamed, falſe Arreſts, and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
procured, violent Entrys made upon my Church
and threats us'd (barbarous Malice) to thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who came to aſſiſt my Wife in Travail: But
Juſtice prevailed againſt their Malice, I had right
upon my ſide, and bafled their Contrivances: Then
the grand Roguery was brought upon the Stage, and
they took Counſel together <hi>to take off the Juſt
<pb facs="tcp:65659:3"/>
Man, becauſe he was unprofitable to them;</hi>
They had heard that a dead Lion could not bite, and
reſolved to make the Experiment on Me. Yet
tho the Provocations were ſo great, the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
my Friend had put upon me prevailed, and I
ſpared the Family, that He might not ſee the Evil
which they had brought upon themſelves in his dayes:
Beſides, as to the neighbouring places, Juſtice had
done me Right, and ſecured my Reputation, both by
the Acquittal, and the encouragement it gave me (the
Lord Chief Baron himſelf directing the Proceſs for
ſpecial Baile) to Proſecute ſeveral of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators:
A hearty ſubmiſſion and reaſonable compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
were the eaſieſt terms that could be allowed:
<hi>Larimore</hi> paid <hi>30 l. Thomas Croxton, 44 1.
Tho. Beamſly, 20 1. Mayn, 15 l. Nicholas
Sanders, 12 l.</hi> The reſt their Poverty ſecured,
and Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> loſt his Commiſſion. So much
in anſwer to the firſt queſtion: which might be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied to the Second, and with what I ſhall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
add I hope make a juſt reply: I have lately
heard this Tryal more talked of than formerly, ſome
notable Evidences of the preſent times prompted
ſeveral Mens Curioſity to look back into what had
been formerly done; and this Account convinc'd
them that 'twas no new thing for Fanatical Villains
to Plot, Contrive, and be Perjur'd for leſs matters
than Rule and Empire,</p>

                  <hi>Larimore</hi> ſaid, (May it pleaſe your Honour my Lord,) upon
<hi>Friday</hi> the 18th. of <hi>Sept.</hi> in the year of our Lord 1668. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
twelve and one of the Clock at Noon. I lock'd my doors
faſt, and left no body in my houſe; putting the Keys in my Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
I went to a Hemp-plot (about two Furlongs from my Houſe)
to pluck Hemp, where I, (and the reſt of my Family) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till an hour and half of Sun-ſet, and then coming home,
found my doors wide open, ſo I went in, and run up the Stairs,
into my Chamber, (or upper Loft, over my inward Chamber
where I lye,) I then hearing a noiſe (in the Chamber where I
lye, juſt under me,) I peeped down through ſome of the chinks
of the Loft-boards, there I ſay this Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> (pointing with
his left hand towards me, but having his face all that time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Judge) ranſacking and rifling of a Box, in which Box
was (then amongſt other Goods) one white Holland Apron, a
Purſe, and in that Purſe was, (at that time) two gold rings,
(each of them of the value of 10s.) two ten ſhillings pieces of
Gold, and 19s. in Silver, all the which ſaid Gold Rings, Gold,
and Silver, (except one ſmall piece of Silver or two) I then ſaw
this Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> (that is now the Priſoner at the Bar,) take,
and turn out of this very Purſe, (which I do now ſhew unto
your Honour) and he did then ſteal and carry away all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Rings and Money, (with the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> Apron;) All
theſe things (My Lord) I ſaw him take <hi>out of my Box, and Purſe,</hi>
(for I was all that time looking through the chinks of the Board:)
And when Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> heard ſome noiſe (above) I further
ſaw the Priſoner now at the Bar, go out of my ſaid. Lower
Room where my Box was, and glanc'd by the Stair-foot-door,
and ſo run out of my houſe, with a great bunch of Keys in his
hand, down my Yard, and hid himſelf in a Cloſe (where there
were ſome Beans and Weeds.) All this, my Lord, I ſaw with my own
eyes. Moreover (my Lord) I having a Warrant from Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Pigott</hi> to ſearch for the ſaid Rings and Money, &amp;c. I did upon
the next day (it being <hi>Saturday,</hi> and the 19th. of <hi>September,</hi>
after Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> had robb'd me,) I called <hi>Richard Mayne</hi> Jun.
the Conſtable, and Mr. <hi>Tho. Beamſly</hi> Tithingman, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of our Town to ſearch Mr. <hi>Hawkin</hi>'s houſe for my ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and Goods, (which the day before, I ſaw him ſteal from me,)
but he refuſing to open his doors (or to let us ſearch) when
we ſaw that, the Conſtable broke open his doors, and then we
went in, and ſearching his houſe I did then find in an inward
Room below Stairs, in a Basket hanging on a pin, (put amongſt
papers and rags, and other trumpery,) this Gold Ring, and this
five ſhilling piece of Silver, And I do Swear, that this Ring and
piece of Silver is one of the ſame Rings, and pieces of Silver
which the day before I ſaw the Priſoner (now at the Bar) take
out of this very Purſe, it being <hi>Friday,</hi> the 18th. of <hi>September,</hi>
and an hour and half before Sun-ſet. This was the Sum and

               <p>(My Lord) I deſire to know of <hi>Larimore</hi> if he be ſure
that it was upon a <hi>Friday,</hi> and the 18th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1668.
and an hour and half before Sun-ſet, when he ſaw me in his houſe,
robbing him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>Why (when <hi>Larimore</hi> found his doors open, which
he expected to have found locked,) did not he call ſome of his
Neighbors, to aſſiſt him in ſearching his houſe, and to ſecure me,
(or any other perſon which he might find robbing him,) rather
than to run up Stairs (by himſelf) to alarm any perſon that was
in his houſe, and thereby giving them opportunity to eſcape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Larimore</hi> ſaid, he did not then ſo well conſider of it as now;
but (beeing willing, ſeeing his doors open) ran up the Stairs to
know what the matter was, and looking through the chinks of
the Loft, ſaw me in his houſe, as aforeſaid.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lar.</speaker>
               <p>Replied, that he was (for that time) ſo amazed, that he
could not ſpeak to me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>

               <p>If you ſaw me commit the Robbery in your Houſe,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>Why did not you then rather ſend out Hue and Cryes
to apprehend my perſon, than to ſearch my houſe; and why did
not you charge me with flat Felony before Sir <hi>Richird Pigott,</hi> of
whom you had your Warrant? if you ſaw me rob you.</p>

               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>Did you not ſay to Mr. <hi>Wilcox,</hi> that your Brother <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimore</hi>
told you that he had loſt the Stone Rring, and five-ſhilling-piece

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65659:8"/>
before the difference began betwixt me and your Brother; and

the ſame a month before?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beamſly</hi> replied, that he did not remember any ſuch diſcourſe.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>(my Lord) I ſuppoſe that I can prove theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Larimore</hi> told <hi>Beamſly</hi> that he had loſt this Gold Ring
and five-ſhilling piece of Silver (now in Queſtion) before there was
any difference between <hi>Larimore</hi> and my ſelf, which began in
<hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1667. this was proved by Mr. <hi>Wilcox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And that <hi>Larimore</hi> confeſs'd (upon his Oath) before Sir
<hi>John Croke,</hi> (upon the 19th. of <hi>Sept.)</hi> when I was committed,
that he loſt the ſaid Ring and piece of Silver about a month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which muſt be about <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. This was proved by Mr.
<hi>Browne, Faulkner,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>3. I can prove that <hi>Larimore</hi> told Sir <hi>Richard Pigett,</hi> (when
he went for his Warrant to ſearch) that he did ſuſpect ſeveral
perſons for robbing him of this Gold-ring and five-ſhilling piece,
and that I was only one of them ſuſpected perſons, this Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Pigott</hi> did acknowledge to be true.</p>
               <p>But now he ſwears that he ſaw me ſteal the Gold Ring and
five-ſhilling piece out of his houſe on <hi>Friday</hi> the 18th. of <hi>Sept.</hi>
an hour and half before Sunſet, 1668.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>I pray my Lord, and you that are of this Jury, take
notice of this, and compare the times out of his own mouth; but
more of this when I come to make my Defence.</p>

Cryer, Margaret</hi> the wife of <hi>Henry Larimore.</hi> She being ſworn
ſaid, that when ſhe was a Servant to <hi>Larimore,</hi> which now is
her Husband, ſhe had ſeen Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> at ſeveral unſeaſonable

Sworn, Mr. <hi>Dodſworth Croke</hi> ſaid as followeth; (taking the

upon it within and without, and put it upon his finger,

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Good</hi> took the fiveſhilling piece into his hand, and ſwore,
that he being at <hi>Buckingham</hi> Seſſions laſt, about ſome trouble,

a fiveſhilling piece to this <hi>Larimore</hi> for other money, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring

               <p>I humbly thank your Honour for that freedom, but I
do humbly conceive that the proving of the laſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the ring, and fiveſhilling piece was either <hi>Larimore</hi>'s own Goods,

to confeſs, (as much as I can have ground to believe) which
is, that <hi>Larimore</hi> might have the Ring and five ſhilling
piece of ſilver in his poſſeſſion, but the Charge againſt me is, that
I ſtole them from him, which I do flatly deny, and do not doubt
of clearing my ſelf when I come to my Defence, if I may be

his Brother <hi>Beamſly,</hi> upon the 19th. of <hi>September,</hi> that he had
loſt this very Ring and five ſhilling piece of ſilver before the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
began, which is impoſſible (My Lord) as appears by
the Oaths of <hi>Larimore,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Good,</hi> for how could he be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of that five ſhilling piece nine months before he had it? And
that he did ſay the very words to his Brother <hi>Beamſly</hi> we have
already proved, by the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Wilcox.</hi>

               <p>ſaid, Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> was this Suit for Tyths begun
by you againſt this <hi>Larimore</hi> before the time that <hi>Larimore</hi> ſwears
this Felony was committed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, for I began that Suit for Tythes in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi>
Term, 1667. and <hi>Larimore</hi> Swears that I robb'd him
upon the 18th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1668. which is (my Lord) about
a year after. My Lord, it is an eaſie way thus for the Fanaticks
to pay Tyths, if they can but hang up the Clergy, they may ceaſe
all their future pleading for Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Larimore</hi> began to ſtumble, and ſhew his malice in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
me unjuſtly, by his multiplying of feigned Felonies?
wherewith he did (then endeavour to) load me, of which I
appeared innocent.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> brought me a pair of tops, to
put new legs to them, which I did, and he coming by my Shop,
told me he wanted his Boots, I replied, they were done, but I
being then about to go out, did promiſe Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> to lay them
in my Window, ſo that he might take them as he went home,
which accordingly he did, and when I came home, I went to Mr.
<hi>Hawkins,</hi> who (at that time) was at Sir <hi>John Croke</hi>'s houſe,
where he contented me for my work before we parted, and this
is all that I can ſay, my Lord.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> paid me honeſtly for the

and did ſue for them, then they lay at me night and day, to have
me charge Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> with flat Felony, for ſtealing the ſaid
Boots out of my Shop, but I told them, that I laid them in my

the Conſtable, <hi>Miles,</hi> and <hi>John Sanders,</hi> (who is ſince dead, my

               <p>That they had heard <hi>John Chilton</hi> ſay that I had ſtoln a pair

               <p>My Lord, <hi>Larimore,</hi> and the reſt (that I have named)
deſired me to charge Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> with flat Felony, for ſtealing
the ſaid Boots, as ſoon as he demanded the Tyths of <hi>Chilton;</hi> and
they would have forced me to fetch a Warrant from a Juſtice of
Peace to ſearch for them, and did further threaten me, (in caſe
I would not do it) that Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> would indict me (at the
Aſſizes) as one acceſſary to the ſtealing of my own Goods.</p>

               <p>Yes (my Lord) and he ſaid, that he would make me
ſwear that Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> had ſtole my Boots, and for that end did
ſerve me with a <hi>Subpoena</hi> to be here—Here <hi>Larimore</hi> the ſecond

(pointing at <hi>John Chilton)</hi> is hired by Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> to ſwear
this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chil.</speaker>
               <p>Replied, No (My Lord,) I am not hired by Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi>
to ſwear, but I might have been hired, or born out, if I would
but ſwear that Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> ſtole my Boots, by one <hi>Croxſtone.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chil.</speaker>
               <p>(My Lord,) I am not hired to ſwear by Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi>
but if I would ſwear that he ſtole my Boots out of my Shop, I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65659:10"/>
might have been born out in ſo doing. For <hi>Tho. Croxſtone</hi> (of
<hi>Weſton</hi> on the Green, in the County of <hi>Oxon)</hi> told me (upon
<hi>Monday</hi> laſt, it being the 8th. of <hi>March, 1668.)</hi> that if I would
but ſwear what he would have me againſt Mr. <hi>Hawkins, (viz.</hi> that
he ſtole my Boots) he would bear me harmleſs; but I replied,
that it went againſt my Conſcience to do it; I added farther, that,
if I ſhould be ſo wicked as to ſwear it, Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> can prove
the contrary by Mr. <hi>William Croke</hi> and others; to which <hi>Lari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
replied, that I need not fear what Mr. <hi>Croke</hi> knew in that
caſe, for he is one of us, and will not juſtifie any thing that may
tend to our prejudice; I farther told him that I durſt not do it, for
if I ſhould, Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> might make me fly the Country,
as <hi>Smart</hi> did <hi>Wheeler,</hi> to which <hi>Croxſtone</hi> replied, that if I would
ſwear it, he would bear me out againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> as
far as an hundred pound would go, and if that would not do, as
far as five hundred pound would go.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Tho. Croxſtone</hi> ſaid (My Lord,) I ſaid no ſuch thing.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Chilton</hi> run in, and ſaid, As I live and breath, my Lord, <hi>Crox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi>

Boots, he would bear me out, as I ſaid before, and if I made any

            <sp>

Robb'd, or do you know that I am the Perſon that robbed

               <p>This <hi>Boyce</hi> Swears, (My Lord,) that about two years
laſt paſt he ſaw my hand in <hi>Noble's</hi> pocket, and that <hi>Noble</hi> told
him, he then loſt a Gold Ring, and piece of Gold. (My Lord, I
think (with Submiſſion to your Honour and the Court,) I am
not bound to anſwer to this Charge, becauſe there is no Indictment
exhibited againſt me for it, nor is <hi>Noble</hi> himſelf here to Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
or can <hi>Boyce</hi> ſwear that I pickt <hi>Noble</hi>'s pocket, or that <hi>Noble</hi>
ever told <hi>Boyce</hi> I did, (as he himſelf Swears.) But (my Lord)
I obſerve (in this) the Malice of <hi>Larimore</hi>'s heart, (as well as
in that of the Books,) for <hi>Boyce</hi> Swears that he can ſay nothing
to <hi>Larimore</hi>'s Bill of Robbery, and yet he forces him to come
from <hi>London</hi> hither, to ſtart a ſenſleſs ſtory about <hi>Noble</hi>'s Ring,
and Gold, which is of near two years ſtanding. (My Lord)
if there had been any truth in it, why was not <hi>Noble</hi> (himſelf)
here to proſecute; and why did he let it reſt ſo long? I ſay again
(my Lord) if it had been true that I had pick'd <hi>Noble</hi>'s pocket,
and if <hi>Larimore</hi> had known it, I pray (my Lord) and you of
the Jury, what had that concern'd <hi>Larimore;</hi> but my Lord, I
am as clear of picking <hi>Nobles</hi> pocket as I am as of ſtealing
<hi>Chilton</hi>'s Boots, and as clear of both theſe, as I am of robbing
this fellow <hi>Larimore,</hi> (that now calls my Life in Queſtion) nay,
if he can fairly prove me guilty of one, I am willing to ſuffer,
as guilty of all.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am bold to appeal to your Honour, whether
it be a fair Proſecution in <hi>Larimore,</hi> to ſtir up <hi>Chilton</hi> (falſly)
to charge me with Felony in ſtealing his Boots, when I had not
only a right in them, but alſo leave (from him) to take them,
and paid him for his work, (which <hi>Larimore</hi> himſelf knows.
Nay (my Lord) if I had never paid <hi>Chilton</hi> for his Legs, the
Tops being mine (by Law) it had not been Felony, but a
Treſpaſs, becauſe I had leave from him to take them, and a right
in them the Tops being mine, and again, (my Lord) I appeal
to your Honour, whether it be fair in <hi>Larimore</hi> for him to ride
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65659:12"/>
up and down City, and Country, to bring a multitude of Witneſſes
together, that can ſay nothing to his Bill, (as <hi>Boyce</hi> ſwears he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not)
if this doth not diſcover malice in a Proſecutors heart, I know
not what doth, and if that appears to your Honour, and the Jury
to be in him, how far that ought, (as well by Law, as Equity,
to fruſtrate his Evidence, I am willing to leave to your Honour,
and the Jury, and ſo I have done as to <hi>Boyce</hi>'s Evidence.</p>

being both Sworn.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>John Cox</hi> ſaid, (My Lord) I being in Mr. <hi>Hawkin</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(not long ſince,) one asked him, how he thought to come
off at the Aſſizes: Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> reply'd, he cared not much for
this Plot, (tho he ſhould be Convicted,) for they could but
burn him in the hand for it, and that he could bite out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucy</hi> being ſworn, ſaid, that he heard Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> confeſs,
that he owed <hi>Larimore</hi> 15s. but becauſe he had dealt ſo (unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
with him, he would make it coſt <hi>Larimore</hi> fifteen times
15s. before he would pay him.</p>

               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>I humbly thank your Honour; and I hope (my Lord)
becauſe the Evidence is large, I ſhall have the more time allowed
me, to make my Defence, (and if ſo) I doubt not but fully to

               <p>I humbly thank your Honour, and do promiſe to be
as brief as conveniently I can; and as I intend to offer nothing
but the naked truth. So I will ſay no more, (if I am not misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
than I can prove to be true. And (my Lord) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may ſeem neceſſary for me to offer many things (by way
of Defence) in anſwer to ſo great a Charge, (to ſave time) I
pray, that it may not be expected by your Honour, or the Jury,
that I ſhould call Witneſſes to prove every particular; but when
I offer ſuch things, as are moſt material, if either your Honour,
or the Jury be not fully ſatisfied touching the truth of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
points, I do humbly pray, that I may be called upon to
prove them, for when I am not called upon for proof, I ſhall under
favour (my Lord) take it for granted, that I am believed. And
for Method herein, (if I may have leave) I do intend this.</p>

1. In General, to ſhew how improbable it is, that I ſhould be
guilty of this Robbery, and alſo deliver ſome hints to move
the Court, and Jury to Queſtion whether this Proſecutor <hi>(La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimore)</hi>
was Robbed at all, or no?</p>
               <p>And 2ly. More particularly to examine the Evidence, as to
matter of Fact.</p>

               <p>Go on Sir, to your Defence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Honour, and you of this Jury, I
begin with the firſt part of my Defence, which is, to hint how
unlikely it is, that I ſhould be guilty of robbing this <hi>Larimore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Larimore</hi> is Generally known to be a notorious Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
and an Enemy to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and a hater of
the Miniſtry in General; but more particularly, he is moſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
and Malicious againſt my ſelf, becauſe I ſued him for Tyths,
and cauſed him to be Indicted, for not coming to Church, or
Baptizing his Children; for which reaſon, his Malice againſt me
hath appeared notorious ſeveral ways, as (amongſt others.)</p>
               <p>1. By diſſwading all that owed me any money, not to pay me.</p>
               <p>2. By his inducing thoſe to whom I owed mony, to arreſt, and
trouble me.</p>
               <p>3. By diſſwading thoſe that I ſued for Tyths, not to agree
with me; he promiſing them, that Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
would force me to run the Country, ere long.</p>
               <p>4. By his continual tormenting, and vexing me with his falſe
Arreſts, and illegal Indictments.</p>
               <p>5. By his conſtant endeavour to diſſwade my friends from
(any ways) relieving me, or mine, in my greateſt wants, and
neceſſities, adviſing them to ſtarve us.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and this Jury, if you are nor fully ſatisfied in any of
theſe particulars that I have alledged, I am ready to prove them;
but if this be granted, they are (no doubt) ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to prove the malice of his heart. Again I ſay, that it is
no ways poſſible, that <hi>Larimore</hi> was Robbed (at all) and of
this opinion are moſt of his Neighbors round about him, as may
appear by this Certificate) which followeth.</p>

altho I made no uſe of it upon my Tryal; yet the World
may ſee what an opinion <hi>Larimore</hi>'s Neighbors had concerning
him, and his (pretended) Robbery; which Certificate I have
for that purpoſe here inſerted.</p>
            <p>2. It is not likely that <hi>Larimore</hi> was robb'd, becauſe he did
not declare it to his Neighbours immediately, which doubtleſs
he would have done, had any ſuch thing befallen him.</p>
            <p>3. Nor is he certain (as to the time,) when he was Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
            <p>For 1. He told his Brother <hi>Beamſly,</hi> that he had loſt the Ring
and Five-ſhilling piece (in Queſtion) before there was any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between him and I: As may appear by this Certificate,
under Mr. <hi>Willcox</hi>'s own hand, which is as followeth.</p>

            <p>By this Certificate, it appears (by <hi>Larimore</hi>'s own Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his Brother <hi>Beamſly)</hi> that he had loſt this Ring, and Five-ſhilling
piece, before there was any difference between him, and
I, and ſeeing I began my Suit for Tyths in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, 1667.
againſt him, and others, as it is well known to the Inhabitants
of <hi>Chilton,</hi> (and alſo may appear by the Records of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65659:14"/>
This is the firſt time, that <hi>Larimore</hi> ſaid he had loſt the Ring,
aud Five-ſhilling piece.</p>
            <p>And that this is falſe, muſt needs appear, by what Mr. <hi>Good,</hi> and
<hi>Larimore</hi> have already ſworn in open Court, <hi>viz.</hi> that Mr. <hi>Good</hi>
pawned the Five-ſhilling piece to <hi>Larimore</hi> at <hi>Buckingham</hi> Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
laſt, (which Seſſions were held upon the 9th. and 10th. of
<hi>July, 1668.)</hi> which is near nine Months after the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
            <p>And moreover, <hi>Larimore</hi> confeſſed upon his Examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> when I was Committed, (which was upon the
19th. of <hi>Sept. 1668.)</hi> that he had loſt the Ring, and Five-ſhilling
piece a month before, which muſt (conſequently) be about the
19th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1668. And if ſo, how is it poſſible that he could
have loſt them before the difference began betwixt us, which
was above ten Months before?</p>
            <p>3. He now ſwears in open Court, that he ſaw me ſteal the
ſaid Gold Ring, and Five-ſhilling piece of Silver, out of his houſe
upon <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1668. (preciſely) an hour and
half before Sun-ſet; all which times being compared together,
can no ways be poſſible; for which, I dare appeal to all that hear
it. Nor is it likely, in caſe he could prove that he was robb'd,
(which I am confident, he never can) that I am the Perſon that
robbed him; as may appear upon theſe confiderations, amongſt
others.</p>
            <p>1. Is it likely that I ſhould commit a Robbery in my own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
(in the day time) where all that ſaw me, muſt needs know
me, and at the houſe of ſuch a perſon as this <hi>Larimore</hi> is, that
had ſolemnly Swore (but a little before) that he would take
away my life, as may appear, by what his Son ſaid to <hi>Anne Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Is it probable, that if I were Guilty, I would not have
made my eſcape, having twenty four hours time, and four or
five hours notice after they firſt attempted to ſearch my houſe;
or that in all that time, I could find no better place to conceal a
Ring, and Five-ſhilling piece, than in a little basket with two or
three eggs, (which all that time was hanging upon a pin.)</p>
            <p>Again, if <hi>Larimore</hi> ſaw me rob him upon the 18th. day of
<hi>Sept.</hi> 1668. (as he ſwears he did) why did not he then ſecure
me? He ſwears, I ran away, why did not he ſend out Hue and
Crys, to diſcover, and apprehend me? But the ſaid <hi>Larimore</hi> was
ſo far from doing it, that he never declared it to any of his
Neighbors, nor to the Conſtable, when he commanded him to
ſearch, as may appear as well by the ſearch it ſelf, (in that they
ſearched other Houſes before they ſearched mine,) as by the
Conſtable's Oath, who ſwears, that <hi>Larimore</hi> ſaid not any thing
to him, that he had ſeen me rob him, nor did the ſaid <hi>Larimore</hi>
declare it to Sir <hi>John Croke;</hi> for if he had, Sir <hi>John</hi> (no doubt)
would have inſerted it in the Mittimus, which he hath not done,
Nor did he declare it to Sir <hi>Richard Pigott,</hi> from whom he fetch'd
his Warrant to ſearch, as may appear by the contents of it.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65659:14"/>
Whereupon, my Lord Chief Baron <hi>Hale</hi> calling to the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Warrant, (which being delivered) the Judge (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
immediately eſpied, that the ſaid Warrant, bore date a
day before the Robbery was committed, which, when my Lord
obſerved, he asked <hi>Larimore</hi> if he fetched this Warrant to Search
for this Ring, and Five-ſhilling-piece; to which <hi>Larimore</hi> replied,
he did, and then my Lord asked <hi>Larimore</hi> upon what day he
was Robbed, he replied, upon <hi>Friday,</hi> the 18th of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1668.</hi>

               <p>How comes it then to paſs, <hi>Larimore,</hi> that the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
bears date the 17th. day, and you Swear, that the Priſoner
at the Bar did not Rob you till the 18th. day? This is likely to
be true.</p>

               <p>To this replied, that he was robbed at ſeveral other

               <p>I humbly thank your Honour. And I hope the Jury
will take notice how <hi>Larimore</hi> hath enſnared himſelf, by the date
of the Warrant, which my Lord firſt diſcovered. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Larimore</hi> replies, that he was Robbed at ſeveral other times,
he may have credit, (but by thoſe only that can believe all that he
hath ſaid and ſworn;) For he ſaith that he was robbed before
he and I differed, which muſt be before <hi>October,</hi> 1667. and he
told Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> likewiſe (when I was committed,) that he
was robbed of the foreſaid Goods but a month before, which
muſt needs be about the 19th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1668. but now he
ſwears in Court, that he ſaw me ſteal theſe Goods on <hi>Friday,</hi>
the 18th. of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1668. which muſt needs be impoſſible, that
I ſhould rob him at three ſeveral times of the ſame Ring and Five-ſhilling
piece; and beſides this, it is improbable, that he ſhould
be robbed before, <hi>October,</hi> 1667. and again in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1668. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he never declared any of theſe Robberies to any perſon,
before the 16th. of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1668. (upon which day, he, and Sir
<hi>John Croke</hi> concluded upon this Conſpiracy, as hereafter we ſhall
make appear; And moreover, <hi>Larimore</hi> (himſelf) confeſſed even
now, that he fetch'd this Warrant to ſearch for this very Ring
and Five-ſhilling piece (which now he denys.) By this, all may
ſee, how notoriouſly he contradicts himſelf.</p>

               <p>ſaid to <hi>Larimore,</hi> thou art very cunning, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with a Warrant, a day before you was robbed. It ſeems
you knew upon the 17th. day, that you ſhould be robbed on the
18th. day, and alſo, that this perſon (now at the Bar) ſhould
Rob you. Surely, you can Divine. Here the people began to cry
out ſhame on <hi>Larimore.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>My Lord, I had ſeveral reaſons, that moved me ſo
to do.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65659:15"/>
1. in General, moſt of thoſe perſons that were preſent, were my
inveterate enemies, and ſeveral of them had threatned to ruine
me, and my Family; and therefore, I bad reaſon to ſuſpect, that
they came to injure me, either in my poſſeſſion, or Goods: For
the firſt, Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> and <hi>Larimore,</hi> had often threatned to
pull down my Houſe, and for that end, had hired ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to make a forcible entry upon it, and particularly, they
had lately hired <hi>Jaires</hi> the ſon of <hi>Leonard Styres</hi> of <hi>Thame,</hi> (in
the County of <hi>Oxon)</hi> by a Ladder to climb up, and run down
my Chimney, and open my doors, when we were all abroad:
And about the ſame time they alſo contracted with one
<hi>Chriſtopher Tyler</hi> of <hi>Chilton</hi> for the ſame purpoſe. And 2. I feared
the ſeizing of my Goods by the ſaid perſons, becauſe they had
then a Writ of <hi>Levary</hi> (or Execution) to ſeize them, which <hi>Lari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>'s
Son had a few days before in part executed, and he was then
preſent; And if theſe reaſons are not ſufficient, I have more to
juſtifie my act, in refuſing to have them ſearch my houſe, which
was all (my Lord) I ever denied, for I then declared my ſelf
willing that Mr. <hi>Sanders</hi> the other Conſtable, (he being then at
the next door) might charge whom he pleaſed, and ſearch as
narrowly as he could.</p>

Entry, and added farther, that he did help to ſet up the Ladder
for that purpoſe, being called by Sir <hi>John Croke</hi>'s own Sons, they
and <hi>Larimore</hi> ſtanding by all that time to watch. And touching
the ſecond particular, concerning the ſeizing of my Goods, Mr.
Sheriff himſelf can juſtifie, that they had then in their hands ſuch
a Writ: (my Lord) he is in Court, if your honour pleaſe to
call him.</p>
               <p>And for the 3. Particular, that I ſhewed my ſelf willing that

Mr. <hi>Henry Golder, Robert Caſemore,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charles Willcox,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

theſe Reaſons fully proved, commended my diſcretion, in not
opening my doors, and he added further, that he ſhould have
done as much himſelf, ſaying it was a ſoul buſineſs, and the Judg

hearing a great noiſe, (I being then entruſted by Sir <hi>John Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi>
as keeper to Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> which is a Priſoner at the Kings
Bench,) I fearing that they were contriving ſome way for him
to eſcape, I ſtarted ſuddenly out of bed, (having nothing on but
my ſhirt,) and ſtood at the Dining-room door behind the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and then, my Lord, I heard this <hi>Larimore.</hi> tell Sir <hi>John
Croke</hi> that he had undone him, by cauſing him to contend with
the Parſon. Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> asked him why? <hi>Larimore</hi> replied,
becauſe this <hi>Hawkins</hi> will undoe me, for he hath entred me into
moſt Courts of <hi>England,</hi> and ſummoned me into the Crown Office
and Chancery, and I cannot maintain ſo many Suits: Sir <hi>John
Croke</hi> replied, is that all? Come brother <hi>Larimore,</hi> be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we will have one trick more for <hi>Hawkins</hi> yet which ſhall do
his work. <hi>Larimore</hi> replied, Sir <hi>John</hi> you have put me upon too
many tricks already, more than I can manage, and the Parſon is
too hard for us ſtill. Sir <hi>John</hi> replied, [If thou wilt but Act, I
will Hatch enough to Hang <hi>Hawkins.] Larimore</hi> replyed, but
how ſhall we bring this to paſs? Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> made anſwer,
[Canſt not thou conveigh ſome Gold, or Silver into Mr.
<hi>Hawkins</hi> his Houſe, and have a Warrant ready to ſearch his
houſe, and then our Work is done.] <hi>Larimore</hi> replyed, Sir,
if we could but bring this to paſs, it might do well, but I
know not how. Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> ſaid to <hi>Larimore,</hi> Do you
but go to Sir <hi>Richard Pigott,</hi> and inform him, that you have
loſt ſome Money, and Goods, and deſire his Warrant to ſearch
for them, (which Sir <hi>Richard</hi> neither can, nor will deny you)
and then take <hi>Dick Mayne</hi> the Conſtable, (who is one of us, and
will do whatever we deſire of him,) and go and ſearch Mr. <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>'s
houſe, and there you will find theſe things; and then
Charge him with flat Felony, and force him before me, and no
other Juſtice, and i'll ſend him to the Gaol without Bayle,
[And we will hang him at the next Aſſizes.] Come, ſaid Sir
<hi>John Croke,</hi> Brother <hi>Larimore,</hi> let us go and drink our mornings
draught, and we will conſult more about this buſineſs. And ſo,

the Town, I was informed that Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> (as <hi>Larimore</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,)
had robbed him: I then began to think more ſeriouſly
upon what I had heard paſs the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before, between Sir

ſaw a paper lying upon the Hall-Table full of writing, and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimore,</hi>
with the Conſtable, and ſeveral others, had brought
Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> before Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> who Committing Mr. <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>

Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> came to Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> (as all that were there can
juſtifie.) And on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning I went to an Alehouſe, where
they had kept Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> all night, and there I ſaw Mr. <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
go to the Gaol, and then my heart began to tremble, and
yet I durſt not diſcover any thing of what I had heard; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home, I ſaid to Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> Sir, What, they have carried
the poor Parſon to the Gaol. Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> replied, [Yes, let
him go, and the Devil go with him, and more ſhall follow after;]
have I not often told you, that if my Brother <hi>Larimore</hi> and I, did
but lay our heads together, none are able to ſtand againſt us?
I replied, Yes, Sir <hi>John,</hi> I have often heard you ſay ſo, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>About this time Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> ſtole away from the Bench,
without taking his leave of my Lord Chief Baron; or any of the

               <p>My L. C. B. ſaid, Is this Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> a Gentleman, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives
ſuch Plots as this? I never in all my days heard of the
like: but I think once in this place, I met with one ſomething
like it, but this far exceeds that, if this be true that Mr. <hi>Browne</hi>
hath ſaid.</p>
               <p>But you of this Jury, there is an honeſt man, ſaid my Lord,
pointing to Mr. <hi>Willcox,</hi> he overthrows all; if that be true which
he ſaid, then all that is falſe which <hi>Larimore,</hi> his Son, and Siſter

               <p>
                  <hi>Larimore</hi> ſaid, My Lord, what I have ſworn as to Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi>
is true.</p>
               <p>My L. C. B. replied, Come, <hi>Larimore,</hi> thou art a very Villain:
<hi>Larimore</hi> ſaid, I wiſh that the Ground may open, and ſwallow
me, if any thing that I have ſworn againſt Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> is falſe.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>I hope you Honour, and this Jury, are by this time
fully convinc'd, that Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> is concerned in this Plot, for
(my Lord) he hath appeared all along to be the Grand contriver
of it, as appears by Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Teſtimony, and by what he ſaid
to <hi>Larimore</hi> before me and others.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>
               <p>Is Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> gone? he ſaid, Gentlemen, I muſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65659:17"/>
not forget to acquaint you, (for I thought that Sir <hi>John Croke</hi>
had been here ſtill) that this Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> ſent me this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two Sugar-loaves, for a Preſent, praying me to excuſe his
abſence yeſterday, I did not then know, (ſo well as now) what
he meant by them, but to ſave his Credit, I ſent his Sugar-loaves
back again. Mr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> did you not ſend Sir <hi>John</hi> his Sugar-loaves
back again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot think that Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> believes that the
Kings Juſtices come into the Country to take bribes, I rather
think, that ſome other perſon (having a deſign to put a trick
upon him) ſent them in his name. And ſo taking the Letter out
of his boſom, ſhewing it to the Juſtices, ſaid, Gentlemen, do
you know this hand? To which ſome of them replied, they
believed it might be Sir <hi>John Croke</hi>'s own hand, which Letter
being compared with his Mittimus, (for he had no Clerk) and
ſome other of his Writings there, it plainly appeared to be his
own hand. So my L. C. Bar. ſeeing that, (putting up the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
again into his Boſome) ſaid, he intended to carry that to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and he added farther, that he would relate the foulneſs of
the buſineſs as he found occaſions fit for it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I humbly thank your Honour, and the Court,
for that great patience, and liberty I have had, and intend to

eſt quàm Eloquentia,</hi> Innocence is better than Eloquence.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>My Lord Chief Baron. <hi>Hale</hi>'s Directions to the Jury were

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>
               <p>ſaid, You that are of the Jury, the Priſoner at the
Bar ſtands Indicted for Robbing this <hi>Larimore,</hi> and you have
heard (at large) both the Proſecutors Evidence to prove him
Guilty (which if you do believe) I never heard a fuller.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65659:18"/>
And 2. You have alſo heard the Priſoners Defence, wherein
(as I think) he hath as fully anſwered the ſame Charge. I ſhall
Firſt, repeat the Evidence againſt him, which conſiſts of two
branches; the firſt is the Proſecutors proof of this Indictment,
and Secondly, his charging him with other Crimes of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as the ſtealing of <hi>Chilton</hi>'s Boots, and the picking of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>'s
pocket.</p>
               <p>1. For to prove him guilty of Robbing him, he obſerves this
Method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He himſelf ſwears that he ſaw the Priſoner at the Bar,
commit the Robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Son, and Siſter ſwears that they ſaw him run out
of the houſe at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He brings in four or five perſons that ſwear the Gold,
Ring, and the Five ſhilling piece, was found in the houſe of
him, that is now the Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> and Laſtly, He proves by two witneſſes, that the
Gold Ring, and Five-ſhilling piece was pawned to him.</p>
               <p>And for the Firſt of theſe, <hi>Larimore</hi> ſwears that upon <hi>Friday</hi>
the 18th. of <hi>September</hi> laſt paſt, he lockt his doors, between
twelve, and one of the clock at noon, and went out (leaving
no body at home,) to pluck Hemp, about two Furlongs from
his Houſe, where he ſtay'd with the reſt of his Family till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an hour and half of Sunſet, at which time, he coming home,
found his doors open, and ran up into his Chamber, and there
through the chinks of of the Loft-boards, he ſwears that he ſaw
the Priſoner, now at the Bar, ranſacking, and rifling of a Box, in
the which was at that time a Holland Apron, and a Purſe, in
which Purſe was two Gold Rings, two pieces of Gold, and 19s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in Silver, all which ſaid Rings, Gold and Silver, with the ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pron,
he ſwears that he did ſee the Priſoner now at the Bar, turn
out of the ſaid Purſe, take, and Feloniouſly carry away, (except
one piece or two of the Silver,) and ſhews the very Purſe out of
which he ſaw him take them. If you compare the Evidence with
the Indictment, you may ſee the policy of the Proſecutor. For,
he would gladly ſeem a moderate Proſecutor, by Indicting
him for Felony only, as the ſtealing of Rings and Money, &amp;c.
But by his Evidence, he would as gladly charge him with Burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
alſo, for he ſwears, he broke open, or pick'd the Locks of
his Doors, and Box, which by Law is the ſame.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, To corroborate this his evidence, he brings in
two Witneſſes more, <hi>viz.</hi> his Son, and Siſter <hi>Beamſly,</hi> and they
ſwear that they did (at the ſame time) ſee the Priſoner that is
now at the Bar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) run out of <hi>Larimore</hi>'s houſe, with a great bunch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65659:18"/>
of keys in his hand, and he hid himſelf amongſt Beans, and weeds
And note the keys, to intimate that by the help of thoſe, he
pick'd <hi>Larimore</hi>'s Locks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. He brings in his Son. <hi>Dodſworth Cooke,</hi> the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and Tything man, which all ſwear that they found this
Gold Ring, and Five-ſhilling piece of Silver in a basket hanging
upon a pin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the houſe of the Priſoner at the Bar with a few
Eggs, which the Priſoner at the Bar, the day before had ſtoln
from him.</p>
               <p>And Fourthly and Laſtly, He brings in one of Sir <hi>John Croke</hi>'s
Sons, and Mr. <hi>Good,</hi> who ſwear, that the one pawn'd the Ring,
the other the Five-ſhilling-piece to <hi>Larimore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Larimore</hi> Swears he ſaw the Priſoner Rob him, his Son,
and Siſter ſwear that they ſaw him run out of the houſe, the
ſame time, four more ſwear, that they found the Ring, and Five-ſhilling-piece
in his houſe upon ſearch; And Laſtly, two ſwear
that the Ring and Five-ſhilling piece was pawned to him. If all
this be true, he muſt needs be guilty, and if ſo, (altho I have
a great reſpect for his Calling, yet that ſhall no ways excuſe him
but rather aggravate his Crime.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the Indictment.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, He ſeems to charge him with other Acts of the
like nature, as</p>
               <p>1. He brings in one <hi>Chilton</hi> to ſwear that the Priſoner at the
Bar did ſteal a pair of Boots from him, and four or five Perſons
ſwear, that they did hear <hi>Chilton</hi> ſay he did.</p>
               <p>2. He brings one <hi>Boyce</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> a perſon, I think, of no
great Credit, he ſwears that he ſaw the Priſoner at the Bar, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two years ago) have his hand in the pocket of one, <hi>James
Noble,</hi> and that <hi>Noble</hi> ſaid, that he loſt a Gold Ring, and piece
of Gold at the ſame time. This, (if true) would render the
Priſoner now at the Bar obnoxious to any Jury. Thus far the
evidence againſt the Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the Priſoners Defence, which becauſe it is
ſo full, I ſhall be the briefer in it. The parts of his Defence were
two, as himſelf obſerved.</p>
               <p>1. He ſhews how too improbable it is.</p>
               <p>And 2. How, impoſſible that he ſhould be guilty of this
Charge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is not likely that <hi>Larimore</hi> was robbed at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he did not declare it to any of his Neighbors, as ſoon as he
ſaw the Robbery Committed; again, he varies as to the time
when it was done, for that he told his Brother <hi>Beamſly.</hi> that
he had loſt the Ring and Five-ſhilling-piece, before there was
any difference between him, and the Priſoner at the Bar, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by Mr. <hi>Willcox,</hi> and that difference began in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
Term, 1667. And before Sir <hi>John Croke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he confeſſed that he
had loſt this a month before the Priſoner <hi>(viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hiwkins)</hi>
was committed, which muſt be about the 19th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1668.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65659:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And in Court he ſwears that he ſaw the Priſoner at the Bar Rob
him of the ſame Gold Ring, and Five-ſhilling-piece of Silver,
upon <hi>Friday</hi> the 18th. of <hi>September</hi> 1668. an hour and half be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sunſet, all this cannot be true, and for the Warrant, that
bears date a day before the Robbery was committed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Judge ſaid to <hi>Larimore,</hi> Come, thou art a cunning fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
for thou went'ſt to Sir <hi>Richard Pigott</hi> for a Warrant upon
the 17th. day, and waſt not robb'd until the 18th. day, <hi>Larimore</hi>
thou kneweſt it ſeems, upon the 17th. day that thou ſhould'ſt
be robbed on the 18th. day, that the Priſoner now at the Bar,
ſhould rob thee: Surely Thou canſt Divine, if all this be true.
Again, is it likely, that when the Priſoner at the Bar was charged
with flat Felony at his own doors, the Conſtable likewiſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to break open his Houſe to ſearch, if he had been guilty,
his Wife and himſelf, having the opportunity of going abroad
after they had ſo Charged him, while they were gone to conſult
with Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> as the Priſoner at the Bar ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they did by the Teſtimony of ſeveral Witneſſes, (as Mr.
<hi>Reed,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> and others) that in all that time he would not
have made his eſcape, or at leaſt found a more convenient place
to convey a Ring, and Five-ſhilling-piece, than to let it remain
all that time in a little Basket with a few Eggs, (hanging on a
Pin?) Again, who came firſt into the Room where this Egg-Basket
hung? why <hi>Larimore;</hi> and who took down the Basket?
<hi>Larimore;</hi> who turned out the Eggs? <hi>Larimore.</hi> And who had
the dreſſing of the Eggs? <hi>Larimore.</hi> He is a ſpecial Cook; you
Gentlemen of the Jury, it is an eaſie thing, for <hi>Larimore</hi> to
juggle a Ring, and Five-ſhilling-piece into a Basket he being
the firſt that came into the Room, as he put up his hand to take
down the Basket, he might with eaſe enough, conveigh ſuch
things as thoſe were, into it. All this, and many more, are proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Circumſtances to move you, and me to believe, that it is not
poſſible, that the Priſoner at the Bar is guilty of this Robbery;
But that I muſt leave to you to conſider of.</p>
               <p>Again, The Priſoner at the Bar proves the whole buſineſs to
be but a meer Contrivance of Sir <hi>John Croke</hi>'s, and this <hi>Lari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>'s,
(on purpoſe to ruin him) as is fully made manifeſt
by the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> who juſtifies, that upon
<hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 16th. of <hi>September</hi> laſt paſt (and but two days
before this pretended Robbery) he heard Sir <hi>John Croke</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
this <hi>Larimore,</hi> to fetch a Warrant to ſearch the Houſe of the
Priſoner at the Bar, and then to conveigh Gold and Silver into
it; which having done, Charge him with flat Felony, and bring
him before the ſaid Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> and no other Juſtice, he then
promiſing to the ſaid <hi>Larimore</hi> to Commit him to the Gaol with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bayle, and hang him at the next Aſſizes, which is now. And
as I take it, they do aim at it. You of this Jury, if you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> ſaith, it is as foul a Conſpiracy, as ever
was heard of: And I am apt to think it may be probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65659:19"/>
that Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> and <hi>Larimore</hi> did threaten to caſt
this Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> into Priſon (and ſo ruine him) if he came
down, and teſtified his knowledge about this buſineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
thing is of a very ill conſequence. Again, it ſeems likely that
Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> may be credited, if you compare their Actions
with the Times, for upon <hi>Teuſday</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> Arreſted the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
upon a (feign'd) Action of an 100 l. upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi>
the Plot was concluded upon, by Sir <hi>John Croke,</hi> and <hi>Larimore,</hi>
as may appear by Mr. <hi>Browne</hi>'s Teſtimony. On <hi>Thurſday,</hi> they
procured of Sir <hi>Richard Pigott</hi> the Warrant to Search: On <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
Larimore</hi> pretends that he was Robbed, (tho in truth there
appears no ſuch thing.) Upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Priſoner's Houſe
was broke open, and he apprehended; and upon <hi>Sunday</hi> he
was carried to the Gaol, it was a good weeks work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But there
is an honeſt man, ſaid my Lord Chief Baron (pointing at Mr.
<hi>Willcox)</hi> he knocks down all, for he juſtifies, that he came to
<hi>Larimore</hi>'s houſe upon <hi>Friday,</hi> the 18th. of <hi>September</hi> laſt paſt,
(it being the ſame day, that he ſwears he ſaw the Priſoner at
the Bar Robbing him, and an hour an half before Sunſet;)
and there continued till it was near night, and he further ſaith,
that <hi>Larimore</hi> was with him all that afternoon: And he ſaid,
that <hi>Larimore</hi> was not Robbed that afternoon, nor was Mr.
<hi>Hawkins</hi> there at that time. If this that Mr. <hi>Willcox</hi> ſaith be
true, then all that <hi>Larimore,</hi> his Son, and Siſter hath Sworn,
muſt needs be faſe.</p>
               <p>And as touching the Boots, <hi>Chilton</hi> Swears that he had legg'd
a pair of Boots for the Priſoner at the Bar, and laid them in his
Shop-window, for him to take along with him as he went by,
which he did, and paid him for his Work, and yet this <hi>Lari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Croke, Croxſtone,</hi> and others, did uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
endeavours, to ſtir up this <hi>Chilton</hi> to Indict the Priſoner
at the Bar, for Stealing of them; <hi>(Croxſtone</hi> promiſing him to
bear him out in it.) This can argue nothing elſe but Malice
in thoſe perſons; And for that which <hi>Boyce</hi> ſwears, is a Story
that can argue nothing elſe; for neither is <hi>Noble</hi> hereto Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
nor can <hi>Boyce</hi> Swear that the Priſoner at the Bar did pick
his Pocket, or that <hi>Noble</hi> ever ſaid he did.</p>
               <p>Thus I have repeated the Evidence to prove him Guilty, and
have not (I think) omitted any thing in it that is material.
Which if you do believe, he muſt needs be guilty. And alſo
the Priſoners Defence, which (I think) is ſufficient, it is a
plain caſe, and (I ſuppoſe) you need not go from the Bar,
but that I leave to you.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Jury, not ſtirring from the Bar, which the Clerk
obſerving, he called the Jury, who ſeverally anſwered to their
names, which being done, The Clerk of the Arraigns asked
whether they were all agreed upon their Verdict.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk. Robert Hawkins,</speaker>
               <p>Hold up thy Hand, which I did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jury.</speaker>
               <p>Look upon the Priſoner at the Bar, How ſay you? Is
he guilty of the Felony, whereof he ſtands Indicted, or not
guilty?</p>
               <p>Fore-man of the Jury ſaid, Not Guilty my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid to the Jury, you have found like Honeſt
Men: I do believe, that he is not Guilty: and he ſaid to <hi>Lari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
thou art a very Villain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jaylor</hi> ſaid, Is Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> (my Lord) diſcharged of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>
               <p>Replied, Yes, yes, he is diſcharged, paying his Fees.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Honour, my Lord, I am poor, (and
this, with other troubles, which they have (unjuſtly occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)
hath coſt me a great deal of money already.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. B.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot help that, nor can I give away other mens
rights, if they will not remit their Fees, you muſt pay them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hawk.</speaker>
               <p>I humbly thank your Honour, and ſhall obſerve your
Lordſhips Commands.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Court aroſe, there being no other buſineſs, (but
my Trial) the whole morning, which laſted from eight untill
one. So as ſoon as my Trial was over, Sir <hi>John Croke, Larimore,</hi>
and the reſt of that Crew, fled privately out of <hi>Alisbury,</hi> and
durſt not ſtay.</p>
               <p>Thus, I have (as briefly as poſſible I could,) run over my
Trial, and for the truth of it, I dare appeal to all that heard it,
(which were hundreds) who can juſtifie, that I have given a
juſt and faithful account of it.</p>
               <p>This Conſpiracy may put us in mind to pray (with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her Letany.</p>
               <p>From all Privy Conſpiracy and Rebellion, Good Lord deliver us.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with her, I am bound to give Thanks, and ſay always.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> Almighty God, who art a ſtrong Tower of Defence, unto thy
Servant againſt the face of his Enemies. I yield thee praiſe
and Thanſgiving, for my Deliverance from thoſe Great, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Dangers, wherewith I was Compaſſed, I acknowledge it to be
thy Goodneſs, that I was not Delivered over as a Prey unto them;
Beſeeching thee ſtill to continue ſuch thy Mercys towards me, that all
the World may know, that thou art my Saviour, and Mighty Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>
