            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE lyfe of man (right Honorable) is sayd of the holy man Iob to be a continuall warfare on earth: wherby it is euident, that so long as we remayne in the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of this fleshe, we are euen in the middest of this difficulte and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouse fighte, compassed in on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye syde withe huge Armies of feyrce and cruell enemies, and also subiecte at euery mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the furiouse assaults and inuasions of stronge and subtill aduersaries. As the holy Aposte S. Paule witnesseth Ephes. 6. That we wrastle not againste fleshe and bloud, but againste principalities, against powers, and against the worldly gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the Princes of the darckenesse of this world, againste spirituall wickednesses which are in the highe places. Being therefore so weake and feble of our selues, that we are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnable to resist or to stand in battaill, and encounter with so mightie stoute Champions as these, namely that old serpent with all the whole rablement of the hellishe Armye, which by long practise are so experte, that there subtiltie is more to be feared then there power: the holy ghost warneth all those that wilbe the true souldiours of Christ, to put on all the armour of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to haue there loynes gyrded about with veritie, hauing on the brest plate of righteousnesse, and to haue there feete shood with the preparation to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell of peace, to take the shield of faith, and the sword of the

Spirite, the helmet of Saluation. All which spirituall weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Lord doth minister vnto vs by his holy woorde. And our sauiour Christ as a moste mightie Captaine, by his example hath taught all his souldiours howe they shall vse the same to the vanquishinge of Sathan. But the malice of the deuill wrought so effectuously in the corrupt nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that by the meanes of his generall Vicar Antichrist, for a longe space of time, he had almost quite banished these spirituall weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and Christian armour, and brought in a great number of his owne framing, which are so farre vnfite or vnable to repell the violence of his fyerie dartes, that of themselues they giue deadly woundes vnto all those that put or repose any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them. For of them selues (whatsoeuer they seeme to be) they are nothing els to the soules of men, but deadly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And yet notwithstandinge, the blindnesse of the worlde through the iust iudgement of God: For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of his holy word, was such, that being made druncke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Antichrist, it ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne a whoring after strange Gods, and in such filthie maner, that fully it hathe bene verified in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the Lord doth greuously complayne of by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete saying, my people haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted two euils: they haue forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayn of liuing waters to digge to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues pits eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pits, that can hold no waters, yea this madnes proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aded so farre and the corruptions of Antichrist were so depely roted in the hartes of men, that euen vnto this daye, althoughe the LORD in great mercye by placinge a noble and vertuouse Prince to raigne ouer vs, whiche hathe set vp and maintayned his holy woorde, hathe outwardlye bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed them, they remayne still in the mindes of the people: but whereto maye this be imputed, that in all places almost of this Realme, the greater parte beare more fauour to the monstruouse proceadinges of the man of sinne, then to the pure Gospell of Iesus Christ but that they are kepte in such ignoraunce and blindnesse, that they haue not tasted of the power of Gods word. For this hath alwaies bene and is the craftie pollecie of the Deuill, when as hee can not whollye stoppe the course of the Gospell, yet that he may make it the
<pb facs="tcp:2902:3"/>
lesse fruitefull, to indeuour by all meanes possible euen to entangle the ministers thereof in the vaine pleasures of this world, with couetousnes &amp; ambition, that therby they may become more studiouse, to set forth there owne glorye, then to aduance the glory of Christ, more carefull to erect and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe there owne bowers, then to builde vp the house of the Lorde. The miserable experience of oure time is an euident profe hereof. For out of what other founteyne haue all the mischeifes of latter time flowed, in this our Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande? But that the carelesnes in feedinge the Lords flocke hathe bene so greate, that in moste places eather raueninge wolues, or els suche lewde vnskilfull blinde guides as are not able to gouerne them selues, instead of true pastors are made gouernours in the church, and haue the rule ouer the flocke of Christ, so that it is no greate meruaile, that the people in some places of this realme, for want of good instruction not knowinge there duty to God set themselues in armour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againste the minister of God, there Soueraigne Prince. Thus Antichrist by meanes of ignoraunce the mother of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilishe deuotion, seducinge the people into sundrye errours dothe mayntaine his bloudye kingedome. For if his subtill practices were disclosed, and his abominations made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, there is no doubt but that the greatest part of those that haue there mindes still bewiched with the enchauntementes of that whore, would euen looth and detest her filthines and hate here with a deadly hatred.

the godly and diligent reader shall finde) that I am farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to speake any thing, which may set forth the excellencie and worthinesse of the same. Which all men must needes con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse, seeing the holy ghost pronounceth them to be blessed, whiche here and kepe the sayinges of the prophecie of this booke: especially liuing in these daungerouse and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some times, wherin the Romish monster, inspired with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilishe spirite, fearinge the vtter subuersion and ouerthrowe of his kingdome rageth so veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that he vseth all kinde of falshood and subtill dealinge, yea Barbarouse, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strouse tyrannie, and all to establishe &amp; maintayne his owne pride and vsurped aucthoritie, he hath oftentimes suche suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in warring against the true professours of the Gospell, that he hathe victorie and sleaeth there bodies, and that in suche terrible manner, that it might seeme to be a Iust qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill which he mainteyneth, excepte the Lorde had here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to his seruaunte Iohn, that he should thus for a time preuayle: and that in the ende he will reuenge the bloud of his Sainctes. Againe here is fully aunswered that deuilish and blinde obiection of the Papistes, which so sore troubleth the consciences of the ignorante: namelye that the Churche of Rome hauing continued so many hundred yeares, and bene so generall, and hathe had from time to time a succession of Bysshoppes, and alwaies remayned visible in the eyes of the worlde, can not be but the true Churche. On the other syde, they say that this Churche of oures was not any where to be founde within an hundred or two hundred yeares paste, and therefore can not be the true Catholike Churche of Christ. But let the diligent reader Iudge, of these thinges when he hath perused this booke: for herein he shall finde euen payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out before his eyes, the forme and shape both of the true Churche, and also of the false, which is the Synagoge of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. I mighte stand to reckon vp a great number of the like commodities, wherewith this prophecie is full, but then I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>houlde bee ouer tediouse: and I wishe rather that the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente Reader should gather them him selfe, which shall not
<pb facs="tcp:2902:4"/>
be heard for him to doe: seeinge the aucthour thereof, as it doth euidently appeare applied him selfe to write briefelye and playnly, not troubling the Reader with any long circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, nor yet wading curiously in searching out darcke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, but with modestie, comparing and alludinge to other places of the scriptures. Whereby those thinges that seemed most darcke and difficulte to be vnderstood, are made playn and easye. Thus when I had finissed my labour in translating this booke, I was bolde to dedicate the same vnto your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with diuers and sundrie causes &amp; respectes being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereto. As considering the great beneuolence and good will, which ye haue towardes the Aucthour hereof, and to all other that are godly learned: adioyning therto especially the feruent zeal &amp; loue towardes the Gospell, which God hathe wrought and planted in your harte: with the hatred of Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie and all other deuilissh doctrine &amp; errours, which by any wayes or meanes anoy the Churche of Christ. These are not the giftes of nature, or of flesshe and bloud, but of the spirite of God, giuen for the mainteyning of his glory here in earth, &amp; for the succouring of his pore afflicted Church, especially in those which for the same end and purpose, he hath placed in high calling and aucthoritie: whose greateste honour and chiefest dignitie doth consiste in this, that they are made the nourcing fathers and nourcing mothers of Gods people. The Lord which hath begunne and wroughte these his graciouse giftes in you, continue and increase the same dayly more and more, blesse ye with all spirituall blessinges, geue vnto ye long life with increase of Godly honour, to the aduancement of his glorie, the commoditie of his Churche, and your euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting comforte and saluation in Christ oure sauiour and redeamer.

            </q>
            <p>THis firste verse conteyneth the title of the booke, that it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuelation of Iesus Christ, which God gaue vnto him, to this end that he might shew his seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes those thinges which shoulde shortly after come to passe. It is vsuall amonge all the Prophets, least they shold be thought to spread abroad among the commun people the deuises of there owne brayne, to ascite God as the aucthor of there doctrine, of which sorte are these, The word of the Lord, The burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word of the lord. &amp;c. The selfe same doth sainct Iohn, in saying the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: sauing this that they do simplie alleage god as their onely aucthor, but this Apostle sheweth Iesus Christ to haue deliuered those things vnto him, which he himselfe receiued of the father. And truely Sainct Iohn nourished vp in the cleare light of the Gospell, doth speake muche more playnly &amp; sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vnto vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophets which were brought vp vnder the shadowes of Moses law. For although Christ, which is the eternall wisdome of his father, had alwaies this prerogatiue, to deliuer forth the heauenly oracles, by whose benefite wee ought to knowledge our selues to haue receiued, whatsoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:2902:6"/>
good gifts God hath at any time bestowed vpon his Church: yet notwithstandinge it was not so manifest to the fathers in time past vnder the law, as after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sone of God tooke our flesh, &amp; manifested him selfe to be beholden of vs vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clere light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vail being taken away. Rightly therefore sayeth Iohn, the reuelation of Iesus Christ, whereby he doth not onely seuer, and distinguish this heauenly doctrine from all deuises of men, but also extolleth the great and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dignitie of our sauioure Iesus Christ, to whome he doth attribute this diuine reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which is all one, as if he should say oure fleshe to be lifted vp and exalted to so great honour that it should eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made partaker of gods misteries, which ought not to seme straung, when as Christ placed at the right hand of god, in his fathers steed doth gouerne the Church and moreouer the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHich God gaue vnto him that he might shew to his seruauntes. &amp;c.</hi> The wonderfull goodnesse of God doth here shine forth vnto vs, that he doth vouchsafe to reuels to his Church such great misteries and secretes of thinges to come, neither doth he suffer his seruauntes to be ignorant of any thing, which is any way profitable for them to knowe.</p>
            <p>Here therefore God is appointed and declared to be the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this doctrine, Iesus Christ by whose meanes so great a treasure is come vnto vs, to be the mediator, for truely in him which is our head, God doth also imbrace vs which are his bodie, so that we refuse not to be his seruaunts, most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to receyue and obey all his commaundements. Moreouer S. Iohn meaneth not by these woordes, those secretes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be knowne of our sauiour Christ, which are declared in this booke (for seing that he is the wisedome of God no part of the diuine counsaile can be hid from him) but he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that Christ in the persone of the mediator, hath receyued this reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the father, that he might communicate the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to his Church. For it is not to be doubted, but that God reuealed also manie thinges by visions to other Apostles and holy men, which should make eyther to their confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
<pb facs="tcp:2902:6"/>
strengthninge, or els to the admonicion of the Churche then present. But he would haue this reuelation onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to writing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of the whole Church. For like as before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ, when doctrine &amp; teaching was more darke &amp; obscure, the Church stode in nede of many reuelations, so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of the gospell is sprong vp, and hath dispersed and driuen awaie all cloudes &amp; darkenesse, we ought to holde our selues contente with verie few extraordinarie visions. This one therefore, but yet a most excellent reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy ghost thought sufficient for the Church, that he might admonish it of the perils <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd daungers which it shold passe through. And this is it that Iohn sayeth, that God gaue this reuelation to Christ that he might declare it to his seruaunts (<hi>Those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that shold shortly come to passe.</hi>) Although the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and fulfilling of many thinges which are fore told of in this booke, should be differred vnto a long time after, yet he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that euen then the vtilitie and profite of this prophecy was to take place, when as by and by after, horrible persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s should be stirred vp against the Church by the Romane Emperours, and euen a little before were begunne to be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by Nero and Domitian (<hi>And sending his angell</hi>) He teacheth by whose ministrie this reuelation was brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that is by an Aungell being sent of Christ who partly by word and partely by signes shewed all these thinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And this is no small commendation of this doctrine that Christ sent it from heauen by an aungell. That he calleth him selfe the seruaunt of Christ, it is the same that the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles doe, as Paule, Peter, Iames and Iude, hee meaneth that he is a seruaunt of Christ, peculierly ordeyned to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie of the Gospell.</p>

But these three thinges are to be noted, in whiche Saincte Iohn saith he is a companion, that is in the kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, in affliction, and in the pacience of Iesus Christ. He cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingeth therefore vnto himselfe a portion in afflictions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is almost vnpossible, that anye should professe Christ syncerely, but that Sathan will seke to lay manifold troubles vpon them: how muche more then if he preache the Gospell: but it is a gloriouse thing to suffer for Christ. S. Iohn doth therefore comfort the godly, that they are not chastised with anye other of Gods scorges, then he him selfe, whome they knew to be most tenderly beloued of God. But this is more, that he addeth, in the kingdome, for if wee be made like vnto Christ in sufferinges, we shall also be made partakers of his glorie: according to that which Paule sayeth, if we suffer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him wee shall also raygne together with him.</p>

The Deuill can lay nothing vpon the godlye, rashly or without the determinat counsell of God the lord knoweth both.

The riches of this worlde are thornes, by whiche the immortall seede is choked, therefore wee oughte not to bee grieued for the want of them. And it is verie like that by these twoo thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that is by affliction and pouertie, he was holden in his office, least he should waxe wanton, or be taken in the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the worlde.</p>

For he had to doe with a pastor and Church, which he complaineth to be dead, and life is giuen onely by the spirite of God.

admonish the pastour that he could not hetherto haue remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any parte of life, but that he should vtterly haue died, excepte the Lorde had susteined and kepte him by his vertue and power, from extreme destruction.</p>

For if a widow which liueth in pleasures, be dead eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing as Paule saieth, how much more the pastour of the church, (which by preaching of the worde of God, ought after a sort, to breath into others the spirituall life) may be counted as dead, except he renounce the deuill, the fleshe, and all the vaine inticementes of the world, and frame his whole life to the obedience of Christ. And we neuerthelesse in the meane while so long as we haue a name y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we liue, do giue our selues ouer to pleasures, we liue to the world, we are dead to Christ.

The spirite truely can not but worke effectuousely in those, which Christ by the grace of regeneration shall call to newnesse of life. This place doth teach, what great daunger hangeth ouer the Churches, through pastours that are halfe dead, when as the infection proceding out of one, doth spread ouer almost the whole flock.</p>

            <p>THis admonition dothe shewe, that this pastour was not vtterly dead &amp; without all recouery, but oppressed euen as with a deadly slepe, and except he shold spedely be helped, he would straitway, yeld vp the ghost. He cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selleth him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he without delay awake out of this slepely sickenes, &amp; that he be carefull to call backe againe into life those, thinges that were euen then readie to die, as if hee should say, that he was so nygh destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that death hath eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now atached some

            </p>
            <p>He which before sayed that he knew his workes, now she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth of what sort they were, that is, not sound, but imperfect, and which bewrayed his inward hypocrisy. For how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull soeuer they apeared in the eyes of men, yet before God they are found vnperfect. But are not the workes of the best and godliest, (so long as they are compassed aboute with the infirmitie of the fleshe) also imperfect? I confesse they be. But here I say, that soundnes is opposed to hypocrisy, and not to perfection, which perfectly fulfilleth the whole law of God.</p>

We are taught here that forgetfulnes of the heauenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine brought forth this death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule, into which he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, so that it is no meruaill, if where it bee altogether silent, (as it is in the papacie) although there all godlines do vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye die.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2902:27"/>
his comming shalbe vncertaine to him, which except he shall preuent with wailing and repentaunce, his eternal saluation is vtterly lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notwithstanding thou hast a few names in Sardy. &amp;c.</hi> By these woordes he sheweth, that this rebuke did not pertayne to all the partes and members of the church, but to the moste parte. For he confesseth that there are a few, whome he also knoweth by name, whiche haue kepte them selues cleane and vnspotted from those heynouse vices. Christ doeth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the small number of these, ye he doth more esteme two or three which worship him syncerely, then the infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of worldlinges, which despise his commaundements. It is better therefore to be one of these few, whose innocencye Christ testifieth that he doth approue and alow, them to be of the huge multitude of those, which delighting them selues in there filthy pleasures, the Lord counteth as deade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which haue not defiled there garments. &amp;c.</hi> The reason of this Metaphor semeth to bee, that those whiche haue geuen there names to Christ in baptisme, haue put on Christ as a garment, that is, haue professed righteousnes, which garment they doe filthely defile, with wicked concupiscences and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of darkenes as manye, as like the dogge to his vomite, and the sowe to the myre, doe returne to there olde fleshelye conuersation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore they shall walke with me in white. &amp;c.</hi> He promiseth to the godlye, that they shall not want the rewarde of there sounde and vpright liuinge, for as they haue not bene partakers with the wicked in there sinnes, so lykewise they shalbe free from there punishmentes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For they are worthye.</hi> Because it is equity and right that they which haue lyued godly and vncorruptly, shoulde receiue the reward of righteousnes promised them in Christ. For he doth not here reason concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> desertes of workes, which eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very papistes them selues do not maintaine, that they doe iustifie for there worthinesse, neither concerning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2902:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of congruite, because all this dignity doeth depend vppon the promises of God, and they are grounded in his free fauoure he beinge pacified in Christ. For good workes are neither ours, for they are the giftes of God, neither perfectly good, in so much as they be ours, theirfore we cannot deserue any thing by them. Moreouer this is a notable conselation to the faithfull, whiche liue in that company where they see the wrath of God by many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sinns daily prouoked, that they may be of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte, that God will not punnishe them together withe the wicked, with whome they haue not consented in sinne and iniquity.</p>

            <p>IN the sixt epistle the pastour of the church of Philadelphia is praised, and receiueth comfort against the daungers that were at hand, and hanging ouer him. First therfore Christ beginneth his preface with those thinges whiche are most fytte to confime and strenthen this pastour, that he him selfe is holy &amp; true. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye because that being fully consecrated to God his Father, he doth sanctifie the whole church, which is his body: wherevppon hee is saied to be made to vs of God, holines, righteousnes, and redemption, (True) not only because that he is most free from all liynge and dissimulation, to which all mankinde is subiecte, wherby also he deserueth to be called the trueth it selfe, but also because he alone hath set forth true doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this pastour may acknowledg by whose benefite he hath imbraced true doctrine, and is numbred amonge the sainctes of God, that is by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of Christ, which is holy and true. What ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romaine prelates here aunswere, that they chaleng to them selues the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of sanctifiynge, that they boast and bragge that they cannot erre, that the pope doth suffer himself to be called not only holy, but most holye, and holines it selfe? are they not blasphemouse againste Christ which alone is holy and true?</p>

power ouer the house of Dauid, that is his Church, whiche so hath graunted the keies of the kingdome of heauen to his ministers, that yet he kepeth them to him selfe. Which hath so committed the gouernement of his Church to Pastours, that he may not in the meane time abrogate his owne aucthorite.

For although he promise that he will subscribe and agree in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the sentence giuen by the Pastours, if they shall lose or bynde anye thing in earthe, yet this is so to be vnderstoode, when men bring forth for decree, the Iudgement of God, and not there owne fantasies. As concerninge the Pastour of the Churche of Philadelphia, hee oughte to be admonished euen by this preface onelye, that hee by the aucthoritie of Christ whom nothing can resist either in heauen or earth, is called to that functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and office in the Church, and by his vertue shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be helped in discharging his dutie, and shalbe kepte free from violence of all enemies.</p>

He nameth it the hower of temptation, to teach, that the times of afflictions be appointed of God, how longe men shoulde be chasticed, that they shoulde laboure in vaine to deliuer them selues oute of the same, whiche doe not paciently waite, for the ende determined &amp; apointed of god.

For all heyght must fall down when we shall come into his presence, and it behoueth all thinges to appeare humble before his face.

Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer, that this inuincible force and strengthe painted forthe vnder the figure &amp; shape of a lyon, neuer shewed it selfe forthe more happely, then in the sacrifice of his deathe, by whiche hee most strongly subdued the deadly enemies of mankinde, the deuill, death, sinne, and hell: Furthmore the lambe apeareth in the middest of the throne, that the equalle of the diuine glorie he hath with the father might be shewed.

            <p>LEast he should thinke this famine to be the most bitterest of all the plagues, he heareth an oracle out of the middest of the 4. beastes, that this punishment shallbe tollerable, as that which should not bring vtter destruction. For he proclaymeth one measure called Chenix of wheate for a penye, and three of the same measures of barly for a peny, and that there shall be no scarcitie of wine and oyel. Chenix was a measure of wheat and barly, so much as should suffice a seruaunt, for one daies sustenaunce. The old interpretor dothe translate it two pownde, <hi>Budeus</hi> foure pounde, <hi>Pollux</hi> writeth that it weieth but thre pounde. Ezechiel in Chap. 4. doth alow for the suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of one man for a day twentie sycles, that is one pound of bread, and the sixt parte of a hin of water. And the Romane peny comed vnder Domitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was almost as much as 7. of our pence. And at that time they did work for a penie a day. When as therefore euerie daies labour shold be spent for there bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne of wheat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he signifieth that the scarcitie should bee great, but yet such as might be borne, seing there should be greater plentie of barly, and no scarcetie of wine and oyle. And this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure semeth to represent the state of the Churche, after it had taken roote in the world, but chiefely after the peace graunted thereto by constantine when as besydes the horrible herisyes which did openlye defyle and corrupte the doctrine of Christ, many other traditions of men and vnproffitable cerimonies crepte in, by which a great famine of sincere and pure doctrine

this terrible thretening shalbe fulfylled.

What meruail, if then the pure doctrine of Christ almost driuen out, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned in many places were sylent, wheras before it florished wonderfully, if heresies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, and wicked opinions, and traditions of men did then receaue so great strength? when by the iust iudgement of God the mindes of men must be bewitched with lies and falsehood, for neclecting the truth: if the Churche smitten &amp; shauen with the persecutions of pagans &amp; heretiques was greatlye demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and brought into a straight and narow Rome? But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all these calamities &amp; miseries the mindes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ought to haue bene armed, that they shoulde not faint in such sturdie stormes of temptations, but holde and keepe an vndefiled and constante profession of there faithe euen to the ende.</p>

            <p>THe openinge of the sixte zeale setteth forth a terrible earth quake and also diuers wonderouse thinges of heauen. Christ prophesied in the 24. chap. of Mathew, that there shalbe famine, and pestilence and great earthquakes in many places al which things, as also they are foretolde to come by this vision, so if they be vnderstood without figure, as Christ himself testifieth, they are onely the beginniges and as it were the foretellinges of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and truly there cronicles are full of many great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes in diuers and sundry nations and cuntries, which as Il graunte that they were sygnes of euilles shoulde followe, so I doubte not but that by the earthquake here are forshewed great alterations and chaunges of empire and religion, which should follow almost through the whole world. suche as were when the wicked pestilence of mahomet preuailed in the world through the sarasines, and sodenly spread ouer the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the cast and at length the turkes succedinge oppressed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest part of the west also. Then truely Christ the sonne of righteousnesse suffered a great eclipse, when the pure doctrine of the gospell was darkened almost to all whiche semed to bee lyke sackeclothe of heare to them, whose eyes the brightnes of this worlde had so tied and bounde that they were blinde euen in the cleare and broad dayly light.

I doe incline to the Iudgement of those which contend that euill Aungels are vnderstoode in this place. Howesoeuer it be, it is thought good to the iust iudgment of God, to take awaye almost altogether oute of the world, the free preachinge of the gospell, which before sownded in the whole earth. And the metaphore of the winde, doth very fitly agree: for the word being taken awaye the force of the holy ghost, whiche sheweth him selfe forth in the preachinge of the gospell, is restrained and holden backe, that he shoulde not blow vpon the earth nor vpon the sea, neither vpon any tree. For that whiche holsome and seasonable windes are to the worlde, the same is the holy ghoste, to the Churche. The mistery of the word therefore beinge taken out of the worlde, the Church must nedes suffer a sore decaye and deminishinge. And here no doubt is signified the greateste defection and departing almost of the whole world, from the pure doctrine of the gospell, such as happened in those miserable times, when the pestilente doctrine of Mahomete inuaded all Asia and Affrica, the popishe drosse dayly receiued great increase in Europe. And it is verye lyke, that here is noted that generall Apostasie, whiche Saincte Paule foresaw shoulde goe before the reuealinge of Antichrist 2.

But it causeth some to meruaile, why the tribe of Dan shold be altogether omitted &amp; left out of this rehersall. The auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writers supposed by the Prophecie of Iacobe that Antichrist shoulde hee borne of that tribe, and therefore it was not to be reckoned among the elect tribes, which is to weake and vaine, and it brought forth mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But onely, that like as serpentes do set vpon men vnwares, so the nature of this tribe should be suche that by subtilties and deceytes it shoulde ouercome the enemies. The simplest and plainest cause, whye one tribe was omitted, is this, that there might be place for the tribe of Leuy, which was not to be left oute of that rehersall, for the notable Misterie therein conteyned, For when as it had no inheritaunce in Canaan the lande of promise (because the lord was there portion) now the priesthood being translated to Christ, the holy ghost would plainly expresse, that the tribe of Leui also is admitted to the partaking of the heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce, although that amonge the rest it had no part in the earthly omision, but of so great a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Iewes whiche are here rehersed we may gather that misterie which Paule tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the 11.

For in Christ Iesus there is neither Iew, nor gentile, Scithian or Barbarian, but those whome God hath chosen he hath called, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e he hath called he hath sanctified, whome he hath sanctified, hee hathe glorified.

Christ commeth forthe into the presence of God, beinge the head and preseruer of his Church, as one that woulde defende the same, against the daungers which were at hand. Whereby both the greatnesse of the perilles is expressed, as though now necessitie required that the presente helpe of Christ shoulde be with them, and as it were to prouide them in doubtefull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and also the singuler loue of Christ towards his, and the especiall care he hath ouer them, which when troubles aproche neare, is readie prepared and present to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before god, and by continuall intercessions to commende the cause of the Church to his fatherly mercy. And Christ is here broughte in exercising the office of an highe priest, (which he hath without succession) when as he is placed at the altar. Whereby hee can saue for euer those that come vnto God through him, liuinge alwaies for this ende, that he may make intercession for them. Hebrewes chap. 7. Which is notablye described vnder this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. For he standeth at the altar, not that he may againe offer vp sacrifice propitiatory, bycause there is no oblation for the forgeuenesse of sinne without the shedding of bloud. For this sacrifice being once finished, by which eternall redemption is obteyned, we nede not to haue it repeated. But when as he is entred into the holy of holiest that is into heauen, he offerethe vp incense in the presence of God, which are the praiers of the sainctes vpon the golden altare of the incense. For this figure doth allude to the custome of the priestes of the old law, which dayly entring into the sanctuarie, did offer vp incense vppon the golden altar of incense. Exod. 30. Which now the vailes &amp; separations being taken away &amp; the priesthoode translated to Christ onely, is remoued into the holy of holiest into which Christ him selfe hath once ascended.</p>

That they which receyued not the loue of the trueth, that they might be saued, should be deceyued with lies that they might be damned. The like Allegories he vseth in the opening of the seales and will vse in the powringe out of the vials Chap. 16. When he vnderstandeth that the sentence of God doth perteyn to the whole bodie of Antichrist and euerie parte thereof: hee reckeneth vp therefore the earth, the plantes, the sea, the fluds, the heauen, the ayer, and all thinges that are therein, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may seeme to remaine whole or vntouched. These thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therefore I haue forewarned, that we should not to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously seeke subtile and curiouse expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in euerie worde, when we vnderstand that it is the maner of the prophete, and also often vsed in this vision, when as hee will describe anye generall calamitie, to reherse all the partes of the world after this manner.

               </gap>ast downe, the fire consumeth it, or els the bloud corrupteth &amp; rotteth it, wherevpon he sayeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thirde parte of the trees &amp; euerie greene herbe was burned. It is declared in the sixte Chap. In the opening of the sixte seale, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was giuen po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to death to sley the fourth part of men, with sword, with, famine, with pestilence, and with wilde Beastes: But here at the sowndinge of the Trumpettes, it is foreshewed that the thirde part shalbe afflicted. And there is signified onelye the dearthe of victuals, as that Chenix of wheate shoulde be sould for a peny, but here is described a meruailouse gret scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, when as euerie greene herbe is burnt vp. Whereby it is
<pb facs="tcp:2902:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gathered that these calamities should be greater then those, for the third part is greater then the fourth parte, and the scarcitie of victuals is more grieuouse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dearnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps he alludeth to the third parte of the world, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Europe which is estemed to be the third parte of the worlde, the tyrannie of Antichrist chiefely rageth, the wante of true and sincere doctrine, which through the traditions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and vnprofitable ceremonies, although not altogether wicked in the first institution, by long continaunce of time was brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte into the Church, whiles that the greater part of men was bent to defend the ordinances of the elders, rather then to ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Christ him selfe. Here vpon it was necessarie that a most greuouse famine should be brought into the Church. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soules of men excepte they be dayly fedd &amp; nourished with the iewce of Gods worde, waxe dry &amp; wither euen like vnto those herbes vpon which blasting winde hathe blowen, or whith to much parching heate hath burned vp. We may also in this place not vnfitlye vnderstande, diuers other plagues comming all together, as by the hail famine, by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pestilence, by the bloud warre, as histories do testifye, that all these euills did vehemently rage in the world, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Romane tyrannie. But when as the two latter do immediatly folow again, the former interpretation liketh me best: in the meane time I deny not but that the godly ought to be admonished by those bodely calamities, of what sorte that kingdome of Antichrist shold be, which with such vnluckie sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and tokens begonne to be spread abroade.</p>

great mounteyne doth signifye the kingdome of Antichrist, as it is vsuall in the prophetes that kingdomes, and commune wealthes are signified by mountaynes, as in Isay &amp; Daniele. By the sea which is a gathering together of many waters, the holy ghost vnderstandeth in this booke, the infinite multitude of people deuided into diuers nations, kindreds and tongues. This whole mountayne burneth with deuouring fire, what soeuer shall come nexte to hand, for like as fire corrupteth and consumeth into ashes the matter which is put vnto it, euen so the pestilent moren of Antichrist doth eate vp, rauen, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure all thinges.

The qualitie is described that like deuouringe fire it burneth, destroyeth, and wasteth all thinges, although those brawling hyerelings cry out neuer so loud, that without this mountayne there is no saluation. The effecte is declared, in that it turneth the third parte of the sea into bloud. And how much bloud he hath shedde by diuers kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of torments, &amp; especially by fire (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may omit the times that are past) our age that we now liue in doth see, &amp; our owne

eyes doe dayly testify the same vnto vs. Moreouer wee will not declare what warres, and how cruell he hath stirred vp in the ages past. But in our age, what tumults he hath raised vp in France, in Germanie, in Spaine, and in Flanders, who is there thorow out all Europe which knoweth not? and in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, what he hath practised and wroughte euen this present yeare that we write these thinges, I would to God it were as ready to be auoyded, as it is easye to remember it. That ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtly hee maye bee sayed to haue destroyed the thirde parte of them that dwel in the sea, &amp; the third part of shippes by which we may vnderstand townes or cities. But at length this fiery mountayne shalbe cast into the fiery lake. Which all godly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes do wish to be done most spedely.</p>

For how could the feble and weake multitude of the elect be able to suffer and indure so sturdy force as hard as the Adamant, of these horsemen, except they were furnished fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen with such rare and singuler vertue, of the holy ghost? Christ ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commeth forth euen in due time, in the shape and forme of an Aungell as he doth often in this prophecie, bycause hee doth faithfully execute the will of his heauenly father in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and defending the Church, and he is described to be a farre other person from those former seuen Aungells, which sounded the trumpetes, as to be such an one as is armed not so much for the taking vengeance vpon the wicked as appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the health and safegarde of the Church. For his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and mightie power is set forth, that the faithfull might not doubt to rest quietly and safely vnder the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him which is endued with inuincible strength to breake and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the violent force of the aduersaries.

            <p>THe law of repaying is decreed of the mighty God, for all ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, and to those which oppresse the Church of God with cruelty. Eternall captiuitie abideth for those which haue led the the saincts captiues. They which haue slaien the martyrs with the sword, shalbe killed with eternall death, which is the sworde of Goddes furye and wrath. And also god will haue certeyne si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes of his iustice to remaine apparant in the worlde, that all men maye know that they shall not escape vengeaunce, whiche accordinge to the manner of beastes doe cruelly rage in madnes againste innocentes. Accordinge to that of the poet: few mighty cruell men descend to there graue without slaughter and bloud few tyrants by drie death. For if we shoulde recken vp of the Emperours, those whiche were the chiefe aucthors of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we shall finde that they were destroyed of God by diuers and sundrye slaughters. Nero, Domitian, Decus, Valerianus Licinius, Iulianus with many others, were slaien with bloudy and cruell deathe. Therefore the murtheringe of the sainctes is not so permitted to Antichrist, that the Lorde would leaue the same alwaies vnreuenged.

This is a great confuse and troublesome sound, such at the first hearing, the voice of them that sing forth the praises of God in the Church semeth to be. Secondly that voice was like to the crackes of the terrible thunder. For it striketh the mindes of sinners and specially of those, whiche are priuie of there owne vnthankfulnesse, when they heare the glory of god sounded forthe, of his faithfull worshippers. Lastly when as the mindes of men are subdued and brought vnder to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of god, and filled with the pleasaunt sweetenes of his amiable grace, they heare with great delight a most pleasaunte harmonie, as it were of harpers singinge with there harpes.

For if he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice the offences of any with plagues he doth it by Iustice and righte beinge the Iudge of the whole worlde neither dothe he at any time punish the innocent for those which are guiltie. If verely he shew him selfe fauourable and gentle to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, he doth it for his infinite mercies sake, which he hath promised he will powre forthe vpon those, which worship him with sincere and ernest affection and loue of godlynesse. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he kepe backe any parte of those thinges, whiche he hath promised to his Church vntill at length he shall adorne the same with eternall felicitie.

And it is verie euidente that by the citie of Rome hee signifiethe, the Church or popishe religion, for all the excellencie thereof, as they them selues witnesse dependeth on the aucthoritie of the citie of Rome, which is the sea of the pope.</p>

And verely the citie of Rome, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had kinges in number seuen, but the verse folowing she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that, that which he sayeth here is not to be vnderstood of them, and others some doe expound it to be the seuen electors of the Empire, which seemeth to me not to agree to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter. Others also number the Emperours from Nero, which were these, Balba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerua, which was the last of the Romane Emperours, seing Traianus was a spaniard borne. But whiles I weigh and consider all things, nothing semeth more probable to me, then that the seuen heades should signifie so many degrees, or orders of the monarchie of Rome succeding one an other, for there haue bene so manye heades of that Empire, the firste of kinges, the seconde of consuls, the thirde of dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uiri, the fourth of dictators, the fifte of triumuiri, the sixt of Emperours, and the seuenth of popes.

The sixte, that is that Emperours, doe now beare the rule, the seuenth that is the Pope, which hath not as yet inuaded the tyrannie. And when he commethe hee must tary a litle while, this is added to the consolation of the godly that they might know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Romane Antichrist, should not alwaies exercise his cruell tyrannie in the Churche, but for a shorte time onelye, as it is shewed before, in the 11.12. and 13.

            <p>THere is verie great vehemencie of euerie worde, that hee preached not but cried out, &amp; that strongely, with as great streyninge of voice as he could.

with a lowde voice, that she is fallen, she is fallen, euen Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. althoughe she were neuer so great and trustinge to her owne fortresses. The Churche of Rome therefore may neuer looke for anye repayringe of her ruines, for shee is fallen, she is fallen euen the West Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and shall neuer be restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for those thinges shalbe performed vpon the Sinagoge of Rome, whiche were Prophecied of olde Babylon, by Esay the thirtenth Chapter, and Ieremie 51. Bycause if there shall remayne any broken peces of the buyldinges amonge the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of sherdes and rubbishe, they shall not be left for any hope of restoring, but to the greater horrour: for in those desert and solitarie houses, shall Zijm, and Ohijm dwell, that is spirits and Goblins: Ostriches shall there make there nestes, &amp; the Satyres shall daunce there, Owles shall crie, the Serpentes shall hisse, Dragons shall wallow and tumble there, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible indeede shalbe the face of all thinges in that place. Which the Aungell hath expressed in the verie same sense, and almost in the same wordes, when as he sayethe that Babylon shalbe an habitation of Deuils, a holde of all fowle Spirites, and a cage of euerie vncleane and hatefull byrde. When the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell therefore is preached co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ouerthrow of Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whatsoeuer remayneth in it, after the seruantes of god are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, we ought not to count the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for any other, which reioyce to dwell in such desolate places then for deuils, fowle spirites &amp; all vncleane birdes.

If any man heare the Monkes, the Priestes, or other Papistes of the same rabblement, bewayling the ruines of there monastries, or temples: they do almost with the same voices testifie there sorow. They recken vp with great bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sorowe the riches, the ornamentes and there beautie, and chiefely they do not forget there owne commoditie, which they miserablye complayne to be taken from them, nowe that these things are destroyed. But they are wretched men, which no man doth pitie bycause when Babylon stoode in her iolity, they filled the whole world with pride, couetousnesse, lecherie, crueltie, and Idolatrie. Worthely therefore they suffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmentes of so great enormities, if they walke destitute and and needie of all thinges, and also if they them selues feele the tormentes which they prepared for others.</p>

But at length an Aungell came downe from heauen, which representeth Christ, or at the least his minister, which had the key to shut the bottomles pit, whiche was the prison in which Sathan should be shut vp, and in his hande a great chaine, with which the deuill should be bounde, so long as he shoulde be kept in prison so we see that Sathan is not onely shut vp in prison, but also bounde with a chaine that hee might not hurte. For so great a iust and desire to hurte is euen bred in him, that vnlesse he be caste into boundes, and prison he will alwaies raise vp some tormoyles and troubles. But there is no cause why the elect shoulde be afeard of his tyràn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, bycause Christ as ofte as he will thrusteth him downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottomles pit, and holdeth him bounde both hande and foote with a great chaine, vntill he shall thinke good to sende him forthe to seduce the reprobate.

For he wrought in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate, all the time of those thousande yeares in which he was bound, but bycause he could not wast the whole world together or the greatest multitude thereof he is sayd to be shut vp in the bottomlesse pit and bound with a great chaine.</p>

This shall be his rewarde for so greate laboures, whiche althoughe Sathan knowe well enoughe, yet he releaseth no parte of his madnes, wherewith he rageth against the godly, but how much nerer hee is to extreme tormente, so muche more he waxeth mad againste the Churche. But Christ when the faithfull are taken vnto him, shall condemne him, as the head and aucthore of all wickednes whiche floweth in the worlde, together with his Aungels, to be tormented withe the euerlastinge torments of hell. Then at the laste, the Churche, when all enemies are ouercome, euen the deuill, deathe and sinne, shall quietlye tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe for euer vnder Christe her Kinge.

vnlawfull fauour may deceyue the Iudgemente of the pretor. But in the meane time what saluation shall there be for the electe?

But Iohn aunswereth this doubte; shewinge that an other booke was brought forthe and opened, whiche is called the booke of life, whereby it was manifest whome God had before ordeyned to lyfe, by his vnchangeable decree. Here vppon dependethe the saluation of the electe, whiche they obteyned by faithe in the worthinesse and merites of Christ in whome there election is founded, and being formed into new creatures by the grace of the holy ghost, they make the same manifest in the worlde by good workes, to the glorie of his name.

               <hi>And his seruauntes shall serue him. &amp;c.</hi> Here is an other reason ioyned, why there shalbe no more curse.

There shalbe no punishment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where there shalbe no transgression of the law. But that seruitude shall not hinder, but that we maye also raigne with Christ our heade, for it shalbe no constrayned subiection, suche as is seene in tyrannie, but a voluntarie submission, suche as is of sonnes to there Father, vnder whome they shall liue, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse well and blessedly. And also to offer to God his due obedience, is a more gloriouse Empire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the Kingdomes of the world: according to that saying to serue god is to raigne. In vaine therfore proude men and those that are puffed vp in arrogancie, indeuour to make all thinges subiecte to them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, when in the meane time they are founde rebels to God, which setteth himselfe against the proude, and vouchsafeth his grace onely to the humble.</p>

maketh his preface, that these sayinges are true &amp; worthy to be beleued, which thing when he hath done once or twise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nowe he doth it chiefely to increase the hope of heauenly rewardes in vs. For we knowe howe hardly the minde of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth suffer it selfe to be pluct from the beholdinge of thinges presente, whether they bee prosperouse, or aduerse, that they mighte conceyue and nourish new hope of eternall life.

            <p>NOw of his owne persone, he procureth aucthoritye, and credit to this prophecie. For leaste it mighte seme to haue proceaded from some franticke false prophet, or diuilishe inspired person: S. Iohn testifieth, that it was him selfe whiche hath sene these thinges which which were deliuered vnto him after the manner of a vision and hath heard these things which the holy ghost comaunded to be written. And we know suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by the historie, howe famouse, the name of Sainct Iohn, and how holye his aucthoritye was amonge these Churches, to whose custodie this booke was committed. But that some doe coniecture, that this Iohn was surnamed marke whiche mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to the Apostels Paule and Barnabas: It seemeth not to me agreable, both for other reasons, and also euen of that, that so often he nameth him selfe Iohn without the addition of the surname Marke, which thinge it is very like that he would not haue omitted, seeinge this onelye mighte make for difference: And it was the purpose of Iohn to bringe forth the aucthoritye of his name. But that other Iohn semed to haue bene more knowen by the name of Marke then of Iohn, whom Paule cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the kinsman of Barnabas, Coll. 4. of whom also he maketh mention 2. Tim. And also in the Epistle to Philemon, whom they thinke to be the very same which wrote the Gospell which is intituled the gospell after S. Marke.</p>

awaye to geue the honour that is due to God alone to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whervpon may be gathered the weaknes and frailtie of man, so readie to Idolatrie, when so great an Apostle dasshed his foote twise against the same stone.

               </gap>. For he would not worshippe the Aungell for God, whome hee knewe suerlye enoughe to be an Aungell and not GOD, but hee thought religeous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exhibite some reuerence and honoure, as to a heauenlye creature.

            </q>
            <p>THis forbiddinge is grounded vppon two reasons, firste that it is not equall for a seruaunte to be extolled with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biciouse honour of his fellowe seruauntes. For hee confesseth him selfe to bee the fellowe seruaunte, not of Iohn onely, but also of all his brethren the prophetes, that is of all the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Gospell, and not of these onely, but of those also, which kepe the sayinges of this booke, that is, of all the faithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The seconde reason, that is an vnworthtie acte, that the creature shoulde attempte to drawe to him selfe the honour of adoration, whiche is proper to God alone. And there is no doubte, but that all the Sainctes departed this lyfe, are of the same minde, that they refuse the importunate honours, whiche folishe men offer vnto them, and desire to haue God worshipped alone withe all kinde of worshippe. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes therefore doe verie great iniurie to the Sainctes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they obtrude suche thinges vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not onely, such which can be coloured by the fond deuise of <gap reason="foreign">

            </q>
            <p>BEcause so many secreat &amp; holy misteries of god are reuealed in this booke. Sainct Iohn mighte haue doubted, whether he shoulde publishe them or not but that he had bene flatlye for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bidden, by the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly oracle, to seale vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayings of the booke of this prophecye, as it it were certaine vnspekeable wordes, Although an other reason also is added that is to say that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time was at hande, in whiche this prophecy shoulde take effect. For euen then did the misterye of iniquity worke, and prepared the waye for Antichrist 2. thess. 2. Chapter. Therefore euen then was the vse of this Reuelation in the Churche. Daniell and other prophets were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to seale vp many thinges, the execu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion whereof shoulde be deferred alonge time after. But S. Iohn is forbidden to seale vp the sayinges of this prophecy, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the time of there fulfillinge was at hande. And this place dothe abundantlye confute the follye of those, which thinke that nothinge is conteyned in this booke, but doubtfull and darke speakinges, oute of whiche we can drawe nothinge that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne or determinate. For the sayinges of this prophecie are not sealed, but that the godly and diligent reader maye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande very many thinges very profitable to be knowen. For the holy ghost committeth nothinge to writing in vaine, so that we come soberly and reuerentlye, as it is meete to so great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes, to expounde the same.</p>

            <p>LEast the mindes of the godly shoulde be broken with yrcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenes, by continuance of so greate euils, Christ againe stirreth vp the hope of his comminge not longe to be differred, that by the vprightenesse of his Iudgemente, hee maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
