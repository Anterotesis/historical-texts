            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And heere deare brethren, I haue to present vnto your eyes, a rare example of the Iustice of God, vpon a great blasphemer of the precious blood of Christe, which came to passe in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>Iune,</hi> last past, in a Towne called <hi>Boothebie,</hi> three myles from <hi>Granthame,</hi> in the house of a good Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, bothe of woorshippe and credite, named Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Pennell,</hi> who hauing entertained this Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (for so he was,) who had styll in his mouth, the vse to sweate, Gods precious blood, and that for verie trifles: Thus notwithstanding, beeing often warned by his freendes, to leaue the taking of the Lords blood in vaine, did notwithstanding, styll persist in his wickednesse: vntyll at the last, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, to acite him, first with sicknesse, and last, with Death. During which time, of the Lordes
<pb facs="tcp:26529:3"/>
visitation, no perswasions could mooue him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, his forevsed blasphemies, but hearing the Bell to towle, dyd most hardlie, in the verie anguishe of death, starte vp in his bedde, and sware by Gods blood, this Bell dooth towle for me, wherevppon immediatlie, the blood aboundauntly, from all the ioyntes of his body, as it were in streames, did issue out, most fearefullie, as well, from mouth, nose, wrestes, knees, heeles, and toes, with all other ioynts, not one left free: whereupon he most my serablie yeelded vp the ghost, whose iudgement I leaue vnto the Lord.</p>
            <p>And nowe I will proceede, to shewe one other, as straunge a Iudgement, happening in <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> in a Towne called <hi>Donnington,</hi> where dwelled a poore man, named <hi>Iohn Twell,</hi> who deceased, owing vnto one <hi>Oswald Bowcer,</hi> the summe of fiue shilling, which the sayde <hi>Oswalde</hi> did forgiue the sayde man, before named, as he lay vpon his death bedde: but the sayde <hi>Oswaldes</hi> wife, called <hi>Ioane,</hi> would in no wise forgiue the sayde <hi>Twell,</hi> as long (she sayde) as she had day to liue. Wherevpon, not long after, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill appeared vnto her, in the forme of the sayd <hi>Twell</hi> deceased, expressing all the lyneamentes, of the body of the dead man, which might well be, for we reade in the Bible, in the like order, did Sathan counterfeit the body of <hi>Samuell.</hi> But to proceede to the matter, this euill spirit, vttered vnto her these speeches, &amp; sayd, he had brought her mony from <hi>Iohn Twell</hi> deceased, and
<pb facs="tcp:26529:4"/>
willed her incontinent, to disburse the sayd money, vnto her husband, for his paines: Which she, with as couetous a desire, receyued, saying, God thanke you. She had no sooner named God, but the money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed away, from betweene her handes, as it were a vapour, or smoake, tyll it was all consumed: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the Deuill giuing her a most fearefull, and sore stroke, vanished out of her sight.</p>
            <p>VVherewith her whole body, became as blacke as pitche, replenished all ouer with a moste filthy scurffe, and other thinges which was so odious, as heere my pen for modesties sake, leaueth to wright, referring you to the verses heereafter ensuing. But to proceede, her body was most straungely benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and her eyes closed vp from the benefite of the light. Thus remayning a certaine space, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the hardnesse of her heart, and with great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, thanked God for his iudgementes, bestowed on her. Wherevpon to be breefe, it pleased God, seeing her repentaunce, to reuoke his Iustice, and to restore her vnto her former health, where she remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, praysing the name of God, for his great mercies bestowed vpon her. And I beseech the Lord Iesus, that these examples, may not onely be read, but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily marked, to the amendment of our most sinfull and wicked liues, and that blasphemers may beware and take heede, how they more reuerentlie, in their communication vse the name of God: and that these harde hearted people, who will not forgiue
<pb facs="tcp:26529:4"/>
their brethren, be the debt neuer so small: But as it is well mentioned in the Gospell, will for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth pence, catch their poore brethren by the throate, forgetting howe many debtes, our heauenlie Father hath forgiuen vs, and washed vs in his blood. To whome be all honour and glorie: Amen.</p>

               <l>Now Christe our Lord and Father déere, in iudgement dooth procéede:</l>
               <l>Hurling at this miscreant vile, his thunderbolts of dread.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Meaning, in Iustice for to make, this viper, Uarlet he:</l>
               <l>A terrour vnto all the world, of swearing for to be.</l>
               <l>Wherefore, our Lord commaunded death; at him to shoote his darte:</l>
               <l>Who straight without protract of time, gored him vnto the harte.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, when that he the panges of Death, did féele, and eke sustaine:</l>
               <l>Than he began as you haue heard, Gods name for to blaspheme.</l>
               <l>And neuer ceased for to sweare, by Iesus Christe his blood:</l>
               <l>Untyll his soule, at the last gaspe, foorth of his body <unclear>yood</unclear>.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And in this cruell extasie, he passionate did lie:</l>
               <l>The space of thrée or fowre whole weekes, styll swearing bytterlie</l>
               <l>Now when that he had languished, the spare that I haue sayde:</l>
               <l>The people they perceyuing it, of force he would be dead.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Caused the Bell for to be tolde, that all for him might pray:</l>
               <l>Beséeching God, his soule to kéepe, against the dreadfull day.</l>
               <l>But when that he had heard this Bell, knolling most drerilie:</l>
               <l>He rushing vp, sayd, by Gods blood, this Bell it tolles for me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He had no sooner spoke these wordes, which I haue shewed to you:</l>
               <l>But that a pace, his heart blood did, foorth of his body flowe.</l>
               <l>For why, out of his singers endes, his blood did streame full faste:</l>
               <l>So did it foorth, at his toes endes, which made them all agaste.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>And yet the Lord procéeded foorth, this trayterous wight to scorge:</l>
               <l>The blood gusht out, yea, at his wrests, much like the foming surge.</l>
               <l>So did it also at his nose, runne foorth aboundantlie:</l>
               <l>With other filthie excrements, which man dooth lothe to sée.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus died he, commmitting his soule, to the furies fell:</l>
               <l>Which doo possesse th'infernall gulfe, and Laberinth of hell.</l>
               <l>Than was his body straight interde, although (in trueth) forlorne:</l>

               <l>And that for feare he should his God, through swearing thus offend:</l>

            <head>¶An admonition to the Christian Readers, inferred vpon the two straunge Stratagems before passed.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E may beholde (Christian Reader) with</hi> no lyttle gréefe of minde, the great looue of our God, and the lyttle regarde of our selues, his fatherlie motions, and in vs no signe of amendment. Referring the innumerable examples, happening not onely to our Fathers, but in our tyme also: let vs onely consider these twaine, the one of an abhominable swearer, the other of a wicked Woman, that would not forgiue. If we consider the wickednesse of the time, growen into a contumely, bothe of God &amp; good things. we may enter into a secrete conferring with our selues, how, or by what meanes, we shall lay claime to the mercie of God, béeing altogether voide, and shewing no signe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, wherby he may perceiue any sorrow for our sinnes, or in vs any desire to be pardoned. We abuse his name daylie, in euerie lyght and trifling matter: we goe to heare his woord, rather for a fashion, then any affection we beare to it. Looue is exiled amongst vs, neighbourhood nothing regarded, pitty vtterly subuerted, and remorse of conscience nothing estéemed, what shall become of vs? Remember we not, there is a life to come, a ioy, a blisse, a crowne of glorie? Would we be partakers thereof? no, if we would enioye that heauenlie happinesse, our life and conuersation, would shewe some meanes, how we séeke to deserue it. And shall we then wilfully lose it? oh no, take holde of Faith, embarce Repentaunce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humble your soules to the throne of mercie: that albeit the Lord perceyue we are vnprofitable labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="tcp:26529:10"/>
in his Uineyard: Yet that he may beholde in vs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, a good will, and a faithfull intention, to put our selues foorth: and though sinne so gréeuouslie presse vs downe (that our weaknesse cannot resist him,) yet that we are armed with Faith, and entire Hope, in that swéete Sacrifice once offered vp for vs all, euen the precious body and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus, in his merites, to foyle our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, comfort our féeble soules: and with a repentaunt heart, enter into the bosome of rest, prepared for vs, since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world. To the which that we may come, and leaue this wickednesse of lyfe: Assist vs most mercifull Father, with thy continuall grace, and arme our soules with faithfull patience, so shall we triumphe ouer our foe, and reioyce in glory world without end: which God graunt vs, for Christes sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
