         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Muſt on the behalf of the Perſons
concerned in theſe Papers now in
thy hands, bespeak thy Candour in
two or three Particulars following.
Firſt, That thou wilt not ſuffer thy
Curioſity to carry thee ſo far as to be very
inquiſitive who they were or where they
dwelt who held theſe Conferences; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that the knowledge thereof would be
of no uſe, there are ſeveral other reaſons
why I cannot gratifie thee therein, further
than by giving their true Characters,
<pb facs="tcp:100726:3"/>
which thou wilt find ſubjoyned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That whereas at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of theſe Conferences, and perhaps
alſo here and there in other parts of them,
thou mayſt obſerve ſome ſhort touches of
mirth, thou wilt not be offended at them
as ill comporting either with the gravity of
the Speakers, or the ſeriouſneſs of the
Deſign. For if thou conſider the humor
of the Age, thou wilt not find thy ſelf
obliged to impute it to the levity of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtians</hi>
temper, but to his diſcretion and
wiſdom, that he doth accommodate himſelf
to thoſe he would gain upon; as he that
will catch Fiſh, muſt ſuit his Baits to
their Guſt and Phancy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe it is not unlikely but
thou wilt take notice, that the Interlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
do now and then upon occaſion uſe
complemental Attributions towards each
other, and applaud one anothers Wit or Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
which being now put in print, may
to a ſevere Cenſor, ſeem to ſavour of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and look like clawing and flattering
<pb facs="tcp:100726:3"/>
one another. Therefore thou art deſired to
remember, that this was done only amongſt
themſelves and in private Converſation,
where ſuch kinds of Civility are uſually
practiſed without offence or imputation.</p>
            <p>As for the general Deſign of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
I make bold to tell thee, that it
is apparently noble and generous, namely,
to lead the way to more manly Converſation,
especially amongſt the better ranks of men,
to demonſtrate that the ſtricteſt Virtue is
conſiſtent with the greateſt Prudence and
Civility; and in ſhort, to raiſe the deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and depreſſed Spirit of Piety in the
World. The conſideration hereof incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Publication, and I hope will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
recommend it to thy Acceptance.</p>

               <hi>Biophilus</hi> a Sceptical Perſon, who had

was averſe to the great Doctrines of
Chriſtianity, concerning the Immortality
of the Soul and the life to come: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſequently was much concerned for
the preſent life. Till at length awakened
by the diſcreet Reaſonings of <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and
the affectionate Diſcourſes of <hi>Philander,</hi>
he begins to deliberate of what before he
deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eulabes</hi> a truly prudent and holy Man,
who made his life a ſtudy of and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> viſiting his Neighbour <hi>Philander,</hi>
after a little time ſpent in Civil Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is quickly preſt by him to the too uſual
Entertainment of liberal Drinking: which
<hi>Sebaſtian</hi> at firſt modeſtly and facetiouſly
declines; but afterwards more directly ſhews
the folly and unmanlineſs of it. He is
then invited to Gaming, which he alſo
excuſing himſelf from, and giving his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
againſt: <hi>Philander</hi> complains of the
difficulty of ſpending time without ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions.
Whereupon <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> repreſents
to him ſundry Entertainments of Time both
more delightful and more profitable than the
forementioned, amongst which, that of
friendly and ingenuous Diſcourſe: and from
thence they are led on to debate about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Conference; the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs, Eaſineſs,
Prudence and Gentility of which are largely
demonſtrated: of which <hi>Philander</hi> being

Conference.</head>
            <p>In the former Conference, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<hi>Philander</hi> of the great importance of
Religion, and the wiſdom of making it as well
the Subject of Social Communication as of retired
Meditation: Accordingly they two meet on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this ſecond time to confer about it. But
<hi>Biophilus,</hi> a Sceptical Perſon, being in their
Company, he at firſt diverts them from their
deſign by other Diſcourſe; till after a while,
under the diſguiſe of News, he is wheedled into
this Subject before he was aware: And then he
puts them upon the proof of thoſe Principles
which they would have ſuppoſed. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this
occaſion the foundations of Religion are ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into, and particularly that great Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>A Judgment to come,</hi> is ſubſtantially
proved. Which being done, and <hi>Biophilus</hi>
thereby rendred ſomewhat more inclinable to be
ſerious, they then purſue their firſt intentions,

               <p>A Good Evening to you, Good
<hi>Philander,</hi> I am glad to find
you in Health, and I hope
all your Family is ſo too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philander.</speaker>
               <p>I humbly thank you, Sir, we are all
well (God be praiſed) and the better to ſee you
here; for I hope you come with intentions to
give us the diverſion of your good Company
this long Evening.</p>

               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>If that will do you any pleaſure, I am
at your Service. For to deal plainly, I came
with the reſolution to ſpend an hour or two with
you; provided, it be not unſeaſonable for your
occaſions, nor intrench upon any buſineſs of
your Family.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Buſineſs, Sir! at this time of the Year
we are even weary with reſt, and tired with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is a time of leiſure I confeſs, the
Earth reſts, and ſo do we; yet I thank God my
time never lies upon my hands, for I can alway
find ſomething or other to imploy my ſelf in.
When the Fields lye dead and admit of no huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
I then can cultivate the little Garden
of my own Soul; and when there is no recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
abroad, I have a Company of honeſt old
Fellows in Leathern Coats which find me diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
at home.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I know the Company you mean, though
I confeſs I have not much acquaintance with
them; but do you find it a melancholy thing
to converſe with the dead?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſhould you ſay they are dead?
no, they are immortal, they cannot dye, they
are all ſoul, reaſon without paſſion, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
without noiſe or clamour. Indeed they
do not eat and drink, by which only Argument
ſome men now adays prove themſelves to be
alive, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> proved the Divinity of his God
<hi>Bel.</hi> But theſe are kept without coſt, and yet
retain the ſame countenance and humour, and
are always chearful and diverting. Beſides, they
have this peculiar quality, that a man may have
their Company, or lay them aſide at pleaſure
without Offence. Notwithſtanding, I muſt
needs acknowledge I prefer the Company of a
good Neighbour before them; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I am well ſatisfied that I cannot ſpend this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
better than in your converſation, and I
am confident I ſhall ſleep well at night, if firſt
ſome friendly Offices paſs between us.</p>

               <p>Your great Courteſie, <hi>Philander,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
that to be an obligation upon your ſelf,
which is but ſelf-love in me: for truly I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that ſo great a part of the comfort of life
depends upon a mans good correſpondence with
thoſe that are near about him, that I think I
cannot love my ſelf unleſs I love my Neighbour
alſo. And now, Sir, if you pleaſe, let us upon
this occaſion improve our Neighbourhood to a
more intimate friendſhip, ſo that you and I who
have hitherto lived peaceably and inoffenſively
by each other, may henceforth become mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſeful and ſerviceable to one another.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>O good <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> you talk of ſelf-love,
but I ſhall be ſo far from it, that I muſt hate my

               <p>If I were uſed to Complement, yet I

but I am plain and hearty, and heartily I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
both your ſelf and your motion.</p>
               <p>Maid, make us a good Fire.</p>
               <p>Come Sir, what will you drink?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>All in good time, Sir.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Nay never in better time; now is the
ſeaſon of drinking; we muſt imitate the Plants,
and now ſuck in ſapp to ſerve us all the Year
after: if you will flouriſh in the Spring, you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100726:7"/>

the Winter is cold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, here is that will abate the

This drink will make the Evenings warm, and
the Nights ſhort in ſpight of the ſeaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>That would be a pleaſant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes very often, <hi>probatum eſt;</hi> but then
you muſt take the full doſe. Come fear it not,
this will breed good Blood, cure Melancholy,
and is the only Cement of good Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Why then I hope our

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>You are pleaſant <hi>Sebaſtian:</hi> but now
that you and I are together, and under the roſe
too (as they ſay) why ſhould not we drink
ſomewhat briskly? we ſhall know one another
and love one another the better ever after. For,
let me tell you, this will open our hearts and
turn our very inſides outward</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>That trick, <hi>Philander,</hi> I confeſs I have
ſeen plaid, but I thought it a very unſeemly
one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt you miſtake me, I mean only
that a liberal Glaſs will take off all reſervedneſs
in our converſation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I underſtand you, good Neighbour, but
with your Pardon I muſt needs tell you, that I
have never been able to obſerve the Glaſs you
ſpeak of, to be ſo exact a mirrour of minds,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100726:7"/>
but as often to disfigure and diſguiſe men, as
truly to repreſent them. Have you not found
ſome men, who upon an infuſion in ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
have ſeemed for the preſent to be totally
diſſolved into kindneſs and good nature; and
yet as ſoon as ever the drink is ſqueezed out of
theſe ſponges, they become again as dry, as hard,
and as rough as a Pumice, and as intractable
as ever. Others you ſhall obſerve to Hector
and Swagger in their drink, as if they were of
the higheſt Mettle and moſt redoubted Courage,
whoſe ſpirits nevertheleſs evaporating with
their Wine; they prove as tame errand Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
as any are in Nature. Perhaps alſo you
may have taken notice of a maudlin kind of
Soakers, who commonly relent when they are
well moiſtned, as if they ſhrunk in the wetting;
and will at ſuch times ſeem to be very devout
and religious, and yet for all this they continue
as ſottiſh as ever, as impenitent as a weeping
Wall, and as inſenſible as the groaning Plank.
Contrariwiſe there are ſome men, who in the
general habit of their lives, appear to be very
diſcreet and ingenious perſons; yet if contrary
to their cuſtome, they have the misfortune to
be ſurprized with drink, they become as dull
as Dormice, as flat and inſipid as Pompions.</p>
               <p>I cannot think therefore that this Drink Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deal
is ſo infallible a teſt of mens tempers as
you imagine; or if it were, yet there is no need
of it between you and me: We can candidly
and ſincerely lay open our boſomes to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without having a confeſſion of our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
forced from us, by this new-faſhioned
Dutch Torture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt needs confeſs, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> that you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100726:8"/>
raille at Tipling with ſo good a grace, that I
cannot be ſorry I gave you the occaſion: but
ſtill I doubt you miſtake me, I am not for ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and debauched drinking, but in a civil
way between friends, to make our ſpirits light
and our hearts chearful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>And, good <hi>Philander,</hi> do not miſtake
me, I am not of that moroſe humour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
all chearfulneſs; neither do I take upon
me to preſcribe to every man his juſt doſe, or
think a man muſt divide by an hair, or be intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.
I account good Wine as neceſſary as
good Meat, and in ſome caſes more neceſſary:
neither do I doubt but a man may make uſe of
it with a good deal of prudent liberty; for I
do not look upon the Fruit of the Vine, as the
forbidden Fruit, or think ſo hardly of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
as if he gave us ſo good a Creature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to tempt and inſnare us. Yet on the other
ſide, I am perſwaded, that a man may love his
Houſe, though he doth not ride upon the ridge
of it; and can by no means be of their opinion,
who fanſie there is no freedom but in a debauch,
no ſincerity without a ſurfiet, or no chearfulneſs
whilſt men are in their right wits. And I look
upon the very conceit of this as reproachful both
to God and Man, but the practice of it I am
ſure is the bane of all manly converſation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I have known ſome men oppoſe one
vice with another as bad or worſe; and who
whilſt they railed at drinking, have in effect
only made Apologies for ill nature: but you,
<hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> though you ſpeak ſome very ſevere
things, yet attemper them with ſo much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
that I feel a kind of Pleaſure, even then
when you touch me to the quick; therefore you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100726:8"/>
that have ſo much good nature your ſelf, will,
I preſume, make ſome allowances to complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
in others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Far be it from me to undervalue good
nature which I have in ſo great eſteem, that I
ſcarcely think any thing is good without it:
it is the very air of a good mind, the ſign of
large and generous Soul, and the peculiar Soil
on which Virtue proſpers.<note place="margin">Of good nature and complaiſance.</note> And as
for  that genuine fruit of it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance,
I take it (if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood) to be that which above all things
renders a man both amiable and uſeful in the
World, and which as well ſweetens as facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
converſation: but the miſchief is (as it
generally happens to all excellent things) there
is a counterfeit which (aſſuming the name) paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
current for it in the World, by which men
become impotent and incapable of withſtanding
any importunities be they never ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or reſiſting any temptations be they never
ſo dangerous; but as if they were cripled in
their powers, or crazed in their minds, are
wholly governed by example, and ſneakingly
conform themſelves to other mens humours and
vices; and in a word, become every mans fool
that hath the confidence to impoſe upon them.
Now this is ſo far from that lovely maſculine
temper of true complaiſance, that it is indeed
no better than a childiſh baſhfulneſs, a feeble
puſillanimity and ſilly ſoftneſs of mind, which
nakes a man firſt the ſlave and property, and
tien at laſt the ſcorn of his Company. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is the part of a good-natured man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo rigidly to inſiſt upon the punctilio's of
his liberty or property, as to refuſe a Glaſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100726:9"/>
to him by civility; nor yet on the
other ſide, to be either Hectored or wheedled
out of his Chriſtian name (as we ſay) and ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly
ſubmit himſelf to be taxed in his drink
or other indifferent things at other mens plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
And if he ſhall fall into the company of
thoſe, who ſhall aſſume to themſelves ſuch at
Arbitrary Power, as to aſſeſs him at their own
rate, and preſcribe their meaſures to him; I do
not doubt but that with a <hi>ſalvo</hi> both to good
nature and civility, he may and ought ſo far
to aſſert his own Dominion over himſelf, a
with a generous diſdain to reject the impoſition
and look upon the impoſers as equally tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
and impertinent with thoſe who would
preſcribe to me to eat their proportions of
Meat, or to wear my Clothes juſt of their ſize.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir, your diſcourſe is brave and wiſe
and virtuous, but one thing is wanting to make
me your Proſelyte, which is, that I doubt it is
not practicable; you cannot certainly but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
ſenſible how difficult a thing it is for modeſy
and good nature to oppoſe the prevailing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the age, which in plain truth is ſuch,
that now adays a man looks very odly that keeps
any ſtrict meaſures of drinking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I am afraid it is too true which you
ſay, and though I have no mind to reproach
or much leſs to quarrel with the Age we live in,
yet I confeſs to you, it is matter of regret and
diſdain to me to obſerve skill in good liquor
ambitiouſly pretended to, as if it were a very
conſiderable point of knowledge, and good
drinking looked upon as ſo important an affair
of humane life, that that time ſeems to be loſt, in
which the Glaſs goes not round, and the Cap
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100726:9"/>
and the Bottle ſeem to be the Hour-glaſs or the
only meaſure of time. And this I the more
wonder at, becauſe the Air, the Climate, the
conſtitutions of mens Bodies are not changed,
and the Laws of Temperance are the ſame they
were wont to be: and beſides all this, I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
acknowledge the Age to be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
polite and ingenious; I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
very fain know, but have not hitherto
been able to ſatisfie my ſelf, from what cauſes
this change of mens manners in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
hath ariſen,<note place="margin">Apologies for tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling baffled.</note> and what hath
brought this Tipling humour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
faſhion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>You need not ask my opinion, for you
have anſwered your ſelf; it is a faſhion, and
that you know is changeable without obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cauſes; but becauſe, perhaps, you think my
unhappy experience may inable me to ſay
ſomething in the caſe, I will tell you: Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you know, are commonly taken up for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
ſake; for men do not love to appear
in the Garb of thoſe whom they hate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe.
Now there are a melancholy ſort of
People amongſt us, that are wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
in their way; men of a kind of Leſſian
Conſcience, that pretend to do all things by
meaſure, and indeed weigh every thing by ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and conſequently (whatever they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
themſelves) are very ſevere in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of other men; inſomuch, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is not juſt after their mode and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
eſpecially, if it look never ſo little aiery
and light, they preſently damn it as flat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
and debauchery. Theſe men (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſome of them may be well meaning and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100726:10"/>
pitiable) you will eaſily grant muſt needs be
very troubleſome in the World. But then there
is another ſort of men, who being of a more
ſanguine and cheerful temper, are not ſo ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
in their Principles, and conſequently are
apt to indulge themſelves a far greater liberty
of converſation; and in deteſtation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
whom they obſerve to be often abſurd and
unreaſonable, but always hide-bound and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical,
do (as it is too uſual in ſuch caſes) run
out upon ſome extremity on the other ſide;
and ſo in ſhort, it ſeems to me that unneceſſary
ſcrupuloſity hath given occaſion and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to its direct contrary; and thus that Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
humour, as you call it, hath become the
prevailing faſhion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>In truth, <hi>Philander,</hi> the account you
have given is ingenious, and not improbable: But
Lord, what a miſery is it that men muſt always
be upon extreams! is there no middle? cannot
men be merry and wiſe too? is there any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
that every man muſt be intoxicated one
way or other? if one ſort be ſilly, muſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be mad? or if they be mad, muſt theſe be
drunk? For my part, I cannot tell whether to
call this, diſtinction (as you do) or imitation,
or infection, or faſcination, or what you will,
but ſure I am, they are both very vitious and
abſurd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> I will not take upon
me altogether to juſtify the practice of the one
more than the other; but now I am in, I will
(with your leave) give you notice of another
thing, that is thought to have a conſiderable
ſtroke in this buſineſs, and may in ſome meaſure
mitigate your cenſure of the Good Fellows.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100726:10"/>
It is the obſervation of wiſe men, that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the cuſtomes of people were taken up at firſt
upon the account of ſome natural neceſſity or
defect (as we ſee generally Art ſupplies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
Nature.) Now you know we live in a cold
climate, and conſequently muſt needs have dull
flegmatick Bodies, the influence of which upon
our minds is eaſily diſcernable (amongſt other
inſtances) by that extreme modeſty and baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which is almoſt equally common to us all,
and peculiar to all that are of this Country,
and which ordinarily tongue-ties us in all good
Company, until Wine have warmed us, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that ligament; ſo that it ſhould ſeem that
drinking is not altogether blame-worthy, as
being more neceſſary to us than to moſt other
People, if it were but to make us ſprightly and
converſable: for as on the one ſide, you cannot
expect that all men ſhould be able to converſe
together like a company of dry Philoſophers;
ſo on the other, I know you would not have
Engliſhmen, when they are in Company, hold a
ſilent Quakerly Meeting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Now, <hi>Philander,</hi> you have mended the
matter finely; to avoid my cenſure of the good
Fellows (as you call them) you have cenſured
the whole Nation as a generation of dull Sotts,
and repreſented your Countrymen as a ſort of
People newly faſhioned out of clay, and juſt
able to ſtand upright, but into whom God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath put no Soul at all, but left that to
be extracted out of the Spirit of Wine, by
which means when we have attained it (and not
till then, it ſeems) we may become like other
folks. But in the mean time, I wonder what
became of all our ſober Anceſtors, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100726:11"/>
of the dry race of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> men
(as they are called) I cannot find but they had
as much Soul and Spirit as the preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(however they came by it) though they
never made Alembicks of themſelves. But in
earneſt, <hi>Philander,</hi> I will confeſs ingenuouſly to
you, that as for ſuch a dull ſort of earthly men
as you ſpeak of, I ſhould not be much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, if they now and then got a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
froth into their heads, to ſupply their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Brains; and if upon that occaſion, they
grew ſomewhat conceited and impertinent, the
matter was not much, though the Metamorphoſis
might ſeem ſtrange, for a dull Aſs to become an
Ape or a Monkey: But then for the ſame reaſon,
the finer Wits (and ſurely ſome ſuch there be)
ſhould let it alone; for that rational and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
men ſhould by this Cup of <hi>Circe,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
power of Wine, be transformed into ſuch
kind of Animals, methinks it is a thouſand pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But why do you ſmile, <hi>Philander?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Even at my ſelf, good <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> or at
leaſt at that picture you have drawn for me;
it would look a little ambitiouſly, if I ſhould
compare my ſelf to the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which,
they ſay, was fruitful in proportion to its being
overflown; but in plain truth, I am ſuch a ſpot
of Earth, as will bear nothing unleſs it be well
watered; and to countenance my ſelf in this
condition, though I cannot pretend to learning,
yet I remember I have heard that the graveſt
Philoſophers did uſe to water their Plants (as
we ſay) and ſometimes Philoſophized over a
Glaſs of Wine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>And why not over a Glaſs of Wine,
as well as by a Fire ſide? provided a man take
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100726:11"/>
care, that as by the one he does not burn his
Shins, ſo by the other he do not over-heat his
Head; or to follow your Metaphor, provided
a man only water the ſoil, and do not drown
it. You know it is only extreams that I find
fault with, when men will be always ſipping
and dabling, as if their Bodies were nothing
but Pipes made on purpoſe to tranſmit Liquors
through; or as if they had their Life and Soul
transfuſed into them from the Hogſhead.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, I perceive I am likely to get
nothing by my fine figure; I will therefore ſay
no more of my ſelf; but I have heard ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſay, they have always found their reaſon
to be ſtrongeſt, when their ſpirits were moſt
exalted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>But ſure they did not mean that their
reaſon was ſtrongeſt, when the Wine was too
ſtrong for them; if they did, then either their
reaſon was very ſmall at the beſt, and nothing
ſo ſtrong as their drink, or elſe we are quite
miſtaken in the names of things; and ſo in plain
Engliſh, drunkenneſs is ſobriety, and ſobriety
drunkenneſs: for who can imagine, that that
which clouds the head, ſhould inlighten the
mind; and that which wildly agitates the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
ſhould ſtrenthen the underſtanding; or
that a coherent thred of diſcourſe, ſhould be
ſpun by a ſhattered vertiginous brain? It is
poſſible ſome odd crotchets and whimſeys may
at ſuch times be raiſed together with the fumes;
or it is not unlikely, but that a man may then
ſeem wondrous wiſe in his own eyes, when he
ſhall appear very ſilly and ridiculous to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are not in the ſame condition with
himſelf; but to go about to make any thing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100726:12"/>
better of it, is a kind of liquid Enthuſiaſm.
And that this is no wild conjecture or unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
opinion of mine, I appeal to this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
tell me, good <hi>Philander,</hi> what is the
reaſon that men in thoſe jollities (we ſpeak of)
cannot indure the company of thoſe that will
not take their ſhare with them, but are moſt
pleaſed with ſuch as will rather exceed their
meaſure, and take off their Cups roundly; is
it think you out of deſire that ſuch men ſhould
be wiſer than themſelves, or the quite contrary?
or what is the reaſon that men of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
are very ſhy of thoſe perſons that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
and repeat afterwards the paſſages in
thoſe merry aſſignations? I make no doubt, but
when you have conſidered the caſe, you will
find this to lye at the bottom, namely, that even
ſuch perſons are ſenſible that ſeveral things paſs
amongſt them at ſuch times for wit and good
humour, which when they hear of again, and
reflect upon in their ſober intervals, they are
heartily aſhamed of, as apiſh and ridiculous
fooleries.</p>
               <p>But now if (after all) I ſhould grant you
(which I do not unwillingly) that men well
whetted with Wine (as they love to ſpeak) are
very ſharp and piquant, very jocoſe and ready
at a repartée, or ſuch like; yet beſides that this
edge is ſo thin and Razor-like, that it will ſerve
to no manly purpoſes; it is alſo very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
ſince at that time a wiſe man hath it not
in keeping.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I perceive hitherto the edge of my
Arguments turns at the force of your Replies;
therefore I had beſt contend no longer with you
on that point, whether Wine raiſes mens parts or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100726:12"/>
no: But one thing I have yet to ſay, which I am
ſure you muſt and will grant me, <hi>viz.</hi> that it
ſuppreſſes cares and melancholy, and makes a
man forget his ſorrows (that great diſeaſe of
humane life) and this I ſuppoſe ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
the liberal uſe of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>That which you now ſay is undeniably
true; and no queſtion, for this very end was
the juice of the Grape principally ordained by
the great Creator of the World; but yet I know
not how it comes to paſs, that this remedy is
ſeldomeſt made uſe of, by thoſe to whom it was
peculiarly preſcribed; I mean, the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and dejected have ordinarily the leaſt
ſhare of it; but it is very commonly taken by
the proſperous, the ſanguine and debonair, and
ſuch as have leaſt need of it; and theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
take it in ſuch large proportions, that
it makes them not only forget their ſorrows
(if they had any) but themſelves and their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
too.<note place="margin">The real cauſes of tipling intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of it exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated.</note> So that upon the
whole matter, I ſee no tolerable
account can be given of the way
of drinking now in faſhion; for
it appears to have been taken up
upon no neceſſity; it is recommended by no real
advantage, either to the body or mind, and
therefore muſt owe its riſe to no better cauſes
than dulneſs or idleneſs, a ſilly obſequiouſneſs to
other mens humours, or epicuriſm and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our own inclination. And for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of it, it is no better than a lewd artifice to
avoid thinking, a way for a man to get ſhut of
himſelf and of all ſober conſiderations.</p>
               <p>It fills men with more ſpirits than it leaves
them able to govern; from whence they become
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100726:13"/>
great talkers, proud boaſters, capricious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
and quarrelſome. For it ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and rarifies the Spirits, that they cannot
bear up a weighty thought; and while ſuch as
thoſe are ſunk and drowned, nothing but the
mere froth and folly of mens hearts bubbles up
in their converſation. And this inſenſibly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon men, by degrees introduces an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
vanity and impertinence, below the gravity
and dignity of humane nature; and by means
of which, ſuch men become fit only for toys
and trifles, for apiſh tricks and buffoonly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
which in concluſion, do ſo far degrade
a man below his quality, that he becomes not
only a ſhame to himſelf and his family, but the
contempt of his very ſervants and dependants.</p>
               <p>And touching this laſt, have you not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
obſerved, what dry bobs, and ſarcaſtical
jeers the moſt underling fellows will now and
then beſtow upon their betters, when they have
found them faultering in this kind: <hi>Was not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſuch a one cruelly cut laſt night,</hi> ſays one?
<hi>how like a drowned Rat was Maſter ſuch a one,</hi>
ſays another? <hi>how wiſely our Maſter looks when
he hath got his doſe,</hi> ſaith a third?</p>
               <p>Shall I need after all this, to repreſent the ſin
committed againſt God Almighty, by this
vain cuſtome in the breach of his Laws, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his Image, and quenching his Spirit;
or the injury it doth to humane Society, in the
riotous and profuſe expence of ſo comfortable
a Cordial and ſupport of humane life; or, ſhall
I but reckon up the miſchiefs a man here by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
to his own perſon, the danger of his
health, the damage to his fortunes, the—</p>

               <p>O, no more, no more, good <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100726:13"/>
I am yours, you have ſilenced, you have van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
me; I am not able to reſiſt the evidence
of truth in your Diſcourſe, you have quite
marr'd a Good-fellow, and ſpoil'd my Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But how then ſhall I treat you? Come, you
are for ſerious things, what ſay you to a Game
at Tables? Methinks that is both a grave and a
pleaſant entertainment of the time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Sir, I am ſo unskilful at that,
and moſt other Games, that I ſhould rather
give you trouble than diverſion
at it.<note place="margin">Of Gaming, and particularly, of Chance-Games.</note> But what need you be
ſollicitous for my Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
It is your Company only
which I deſire: And methinks it looks as if
Friends were weary one of the other, when
they fall to Gaming.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>But I ſhould think a man of your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
might have a phancy for this Game, as upon
other reſpects, ſo eſpecially becauſe it ſeems to
be a pretty Emblem of the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>As how, I pray you, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Why, in the firſt place, the caſual agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Dice in the Box, which unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
produceth ſuch or ſuch a Lott, ſeems to me
to repreſent the Diſpoſal of that Inviſible
Hand which orders the Fortunes of Men.
And then the dexterous management of that
Lott or caſt by the Gameſter plainly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the uſe and efficacy of humane prudence
and induſtry in the conduct of a Man's own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive, <hi>Philander,</hi> that you play
like a Philoſopher as well as a Gameſter; but
in my opinion you have forgotten the main re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100726:14"/>
of all, which is, That the Clatter
and Noiſe in toſſing and tumbling the Dice and
Table-men up and down, backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
lively deſcribes the hurry and tumult of
this World, where one Man goes up, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tumbles down; one is dignified and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
another is degraded; that man reigns and
triumphs, this man frets and vexes; the one
laughs, the other repines: and all the reſt tug
and ſcuffle to make their advantage of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Let this, if you pleaſe, be added to the
Moral of your Game. But when all is done,
I muſt tell you, for my part I am not ſo much
taken with the Original as to be fond of the
Type or Effigies; I mean, I am not ſo in love
with the World, as to take any great delight in
ſeeing it brought upon the Stage, and acted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again: But had much rather retreat from it,
when I can, and give my ſelf the contentment
of repoſe, and quiet thoughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>However, I hope you are not offended
at my mention of that Game. You do not
think it unlawful to uſe ſuch diverſion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, Dear <hi>Phil.</hi> I am not of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere
humour to forbid delightful Exerciſes;
for I am ſenſible, that whilſt Men dwell in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
it is fit they not only keep them up in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
reparation by Meat and Drink, but alſo
make them as lightſom and cheerful as they can,
otherwiſe the Mind will have but an uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
Tenancy. The Animal Life, I ſay, muſt
be conſidered as well as the Intellectual, and our
Spirits have need to be relaxed ſometimes, leſt
the keeping them continually intent weaken
and infeeble them ſo, that they cannot ſerve
us in greater purpoſes; I would therefore as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100726:14"/>
ſoon univerſally forbid all Phyſick, as all kind of
Exerciſe and Diverſion; and indeed rather of
the two, for I think the latter may in a great
meaſure ſave the trouble of the former, but
that will do little or no good without this.</p>
               <p>Neither do I think even thoſe Games of
Chance abſolutely unlawful; I have ſometimes
made uſe of this in particular which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the like to it, upon ſome occaſions: As
for inſtance, when I took Phyſick, and could
neither be allowed to walk abroad, nor to be
ſerious and thoughtful within Doors; I have
ſupplyed both for that time, with a Game at
Tables. Or, it may be, when I have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be engaged in ſome kind of Company, I
have play'd, not ſo much to divert my ſelf with
the Game, as to divert the Company from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was worſe. But to deal freely with
you: Though I do not altogether condemn,
yet I cannot very much commend theſe kind of
Sports; for indeed I ſcarce think them Sports,
they are rather a counterfeit kind of buſineſs,
and weary ones head as much as real ſtudy and
buſineſs of importance. So that in the uſe of
them a man only puts a cheat upon himſelf and
tickles himſelf to death; for by applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for delight to theſe buſie and thoughtful
Games, he becomes like a Candle lighted at
both ends, and muſt needs be quickly waſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
between Jeſt and Earneſt, whenas both his
Cares and his Delights prey upon him.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I obſerve, that Diverſions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
having ſo much of Chance and ſurprize in
them, do generally too much raiſe the paſſions
of men, which it were fitter by all Arts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to charm down and ſuppreſs. For to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100726:15"/>
ſay nothing of the uſual accidents of common
Gaming-Houſes, which (as I have heard from
thoſe that knew too well) are the moſt lively
Pictures of Hell upon Earth, and where it is
ordinary for men to rave, ſwear, curſe and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,
as if the Devil was indeed amongſt
them, or the men were transformed into Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirits; I have ſeen ſad Examples of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
in the more modeſt and private, but
over eager purſuits of theſe recreations. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that ſometimes a well-tempered perſon
hath quite loſt all command of himſelf at them.
So that you might ſee his Eyes fiery, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
inflamed, his Hands to tremble, his Breath
to be ſhort, his Accents of Speech fierce and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent;
by all which and abundance more ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
ſymptoms, you might conclude his
heart to be hot, and his thoughts ſollicitous,
and indeed the whole man, Body and Soul, to
be in an Agony. Now will you call this a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
or a rack and torture rather? A rack
certainly; which makes a man betray thoſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
which every Wiſe-man ſeeks to conceal,
and heightens thoſe paſſions which every good
man endeavours to ſubdue.</p>
               <p>And, which is yet worſe, (as I was ſaying)
this courſe looks like the accuſtoming of the
Beaſt to be rampant, and to run without the
Rein. For by indulging our paſſions in jeſt we
get an habit of them in earneſt, and accordingly
ſhall find our ſelves to be enclined to be wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
peeviſh and clamorous, when we apply our
ſelves to buſineſs, or more grave converſation.</p>
               <p>To all which add, That Gaming (and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at ſuch Games as we are ſpeaking of) doth
inſenſibly ſteal away too much of our time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100726:15"/>
from better buſineſs, and tempts us to be Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals
and Bankrupts of that which no Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
can ever redeem or repair. And this is ſo
notoriouſly true, that there is hardly any man
who ſets himſelf down to theſe Paſtimes (as
they are called) that can break off and recal
himſelf when he deſigned ſo to do. Foraſmuch
as either by the too great intention of his mind,
he forgets himſelf, or the anger ſtirred up by his
misfortunes, and the indignation to go off baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
ſuffers him not to think of any thing but
revenge, and reparation of his loſſes; or the
hopes he is fed withal trolls him on, or ſome
witchery or other tranſports him ſo beſides his
firſt reſolutions, that buſineſs, health, family,
friends, and even the worſhip of God it ſelf,
are all ſuperſeded and neglected for the ſake of
this paltry Game.</p>
               <p>All which conſidered, I am really afraid there
is more of the Devil in it than we are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aware of, and that it is a temptation of his to
engage us in that, where he that wins moſt is
ſure to loſe that which is infinitely of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.
Therefore upon the whole matter I think
it much ſafer to keep out of the liſts than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
where beſides the greatneſs of the ſtake a
man cannot bring himſelf off again without ſo
great difficulty.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Dear <hi>Philander,</hi> if my zeal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
(or what you will call it) hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
me in this Particular; ſure I am I have
no intention to reproach your practice, nor to
affront you for your motioning this ſport to me,
but ſpeak out of hearty good will, and to give
you caution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>O. <hi>Sebaſtian!</hi> I love you dearly, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100726:16"/>
thank you heartily for the freedom you have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with me. We good natur'd men (as the
World flatters us, and we love to be ſtiled) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
little or nothing our ſelves, and having
ſeldom the happineſs of diſcreet and faithful
Friends that will have ſo much concern for us
as to admoniſh us of our imprudences and our
dangers, as if we were mere Machines, move
juſt as other men move and prompt us, and ſo
drink, play, and do a thouſand follies for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſake, and under the countenance of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
example: God forgive me; I have too
often been an inſtance of that which you now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated:
I therefore again and again thank you
for your advice, and hope I ſhall remember as
long as I live what you have ſaid on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>But that you may work a perfect Cure upon
me, I will be ſo true to my ſelf as to acquaint
you faithfully with what I apprehend to be the
Cauſe of this Epidemical Diſtemper. I find
the common and moſt irreſiſtible
temptation both to Drinking and
Gaming,<note place="margin">Want of buſineſs, the occaſion of Drinking and Gaming.</note> is the unskilfulneſs of
ſuch men as my ſelf to employ
our time without ſuch kind of
diverſions, eſpecially at this Seaſon of the
Year when the dark and long Evenings, foul
Ways and ſharp Weather, drive us into
Clubs and Combinations. If therefore you
will deal freely and friendly with me herein,
and by your prudence help me over this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
you will exceedingly oblige me, and do
an act worthy of your ſelf, and of that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which brought you hither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>There is nothing, Dear <hi>Phil,</hi> within
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100726:16"/>
my power which you may not command me in.
Nor is there any thing wherein I had rather
ſerve you (if I could) than in a buſineſs of this
nature. But all I can do, and as I think all that
is needful in this Caſe, is to deſire you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on it again, and then I hope you will find
the difficulty not ſo inſuperable as you imagine.
It is very true, Idleneſs is more painful than
hard labour, and nothing is more weariſome
than having nothing to do: beſides, as a rich
Soil will be ſure to bring forth Weeds, if it be
not ſowed with more profitable Seed; ſo the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Spirits in Man will be ſure to prompt him
to evil, if they be not employed in doing good.
For the Mind can no more bear a perfect ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and intermiſſion, than the World a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this difficulty which you repreſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
preſſes young men only: Theſe indeed
having more Sail than Balaſt, I mean, having a
mighty vigour and abundance of Spirits, but
not their minds furniſhed with a ſufficient ſtock
of knowledge and experience to govern and
employ thoſe active Spirits upon; no wonder if
ſuch perſons, rather than do juſt nothing, and
in defect of real buſineſs, do greedily catch at
thoſe ſhadows and reſemblances of it, (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you ingeniouſly called Drinking and
Gaming.) Beſides, theſe ſort of perſons ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themſelves to have a great deal of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, are eaſily drawn to ſpend it the more
laviſhly, as out of an unmeaſurable Store. But
what is all this to men that are entred into real
buſineſs, and have concerns under their hand,
and the luxuriancy of whoſe Spirits is taken off
by cares and experience, and eſpecially who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100726:17"/>
cannot (without unpardonable ſtupidity) but
be ſenſible how daily the time and Age of Man
wears away. Now I ſay why time ſhould be
ſo burthenſom to ſuch as theſe, or what ſhould
betray them to ſuch infrugal expences of it, I
profeſs for my part I can give no account,
without making ſevere reflections on their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Aſſign what cauſes of it you can, or
make what reflections upon it you pleaſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the matter of fact is certainly true in the
general, That a Gentlemans time is his burden,
(whether he be young or old) and the want
of Employment for it, his great temptation
to ſeveral extravagances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt believe it to be as you ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you know the World bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than I do,<note place="margin">A Gentleman's Life as buſie as other mens.</note> and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
you will not miſreport it.
But really, <hi>Phil,</hi> it is very ſtrange
it ſhould be ſo; and I am ſure cannot be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
without very ingrateful returns to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
bounty, which hath made ſo liberal and
ample proviſions for the delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch perſons far above the rate of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
It is true, they have leſs bodily labour,
and no drudgery, to exhauſt their time and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
upon, (and that methinks ſhould be no grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance)
but then the prudent management of a
plentiful Fortune, (if things be rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered)
doth not take up much leſs time than
the poor mans labour for neceſſities of Life.
For what with ſecuring the Patrimony and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
the Revenue, what with letting and
ſetting his Lands, and building and repairing his
Houſes, what with planting Walks and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100726:17"/>
his Gardens, what with accommodating
himſelf according to his Quality, and hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
treating his Friends and Neighbours accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to theirs; and, to ſay no more, what with
keeping Accounts of all this, and governing a
numerous and well-fed Family, I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that (all this taken together) the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath indeed the more pleaſant, but a
no leſs buſie Employment of his time than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men: inſomuch that I cannot but ſuſpect
that he muſt be deficient in ſome principal
Branch of good Husbandry, and defrauds his
buſineſs that ſurfeits on leiſure.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as Divine Bounty hath exempted
ſuch men as we ſpeak of from the common
ſweat and anxiety of Life, by thoſe large Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies
his Providence and the care of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
hath provided to their hands, ſo the
ſame Divine Majeſty hath thereby obliged them,
and it is accordingly expected from them by
the World, that they be more publickly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to their Prince and Country, in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,
in making Peace, and ſeveral ways aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Government and promoting the ends of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society; upon which account as it is very
unjuſt that others ſhould envy and malign them
for their enjoyments, ſo it is apparent alſo, that
they are ſo far from having leſs to do than their
Inferiors, that on the contrary the Gentlemans
Life ſeems to be far the buſier of the two.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, Gentlemen having uſually
more ingenuous Education, and conſequently
are preſumed to have more exerciſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
minds, may therefore be able to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themſelves if all other buſineſs ceaſed,

ſuch delightful and profitable entertainments as
others are incapable of.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>That, Sir, that laſt Point is the thing I
would fain learn, namely, how to fill up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
ſpaces of Life (as you call it) ſo as to leave
no room for temptation to debauchery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I am heartily glad to ſee you of that
mind; but I aſſure my ſelf there is nothing I
can ſay to it, but what your own diſcretion
will prevent me in. However, if it be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that I ſhould enlighten your thoughts by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of my own, we will then, if you pleaſe,
examine this matter between us,<note place="margin">An eſtimate or account of the time and buſineſs of mans Life.</note>
and by that time we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the Period of our Lives
with the variety of buſineſs that
occurs in it, I am out of all doubt
that you will be then throughly ſatisfied that
we have neither ſo much time as to be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to us, nor if it was more than it is, ſhould
we be at a loſs for the beſtowing of it. And
this, without reſorting to any of the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances
afore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>Let us then in the firſt place ſuppoſe that the
Lives of Men at this Age of the World, and
particularly in this Climate and Country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
commonly to ſeventy years; for though
it is poſſible here and there one out-lives that
term, yet it is pretty evident by the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Calculations, that there is not above one
man in thirty or thereabouts that arrives at that
Age: However, I ſay, let us, at preſent, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that to be the common Standard.</p>
               <p>Now to diſcover what an inconſiderable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
this is, let us but ask the opinion of thoſe
that have arrived at it, and they will aſſuredly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100726:18"/>
tell us, that all that whole term when it is paſt
ſeems to be a very ſhort ſtage, and quickly run
over; or if we had rather truſt to our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
let us look back upon twenty or
thirty years of our own lives, which though it
bear a very great proportion towards the Leaſe
of our whole Lives, yet when it is over ſeems to
be but a little while to us, and that Time, as
it is uſually pictured, fled upon Wings—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I pray pardon me, if I a little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the thred of your Diſcourſe; you may
eaſily continue it again, and for failing I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
where you left off. That which I
would ſay by the way is this, I can verifie the
truth of what you were ſuppoſing, by my own
experience, and have often wondered what
ſhould be the reaſon of it, that men have quite
different apprehenſions of time paſt and time
to come. When we look back (as you well
obſerve) upon twenty or thirty years which
are gone, they ſeem but a trice to us; but if
we look forward, and forethink of ſo many
years to come, we are apt to phanſie we have an
Ocean before us, and ſuch a vaſt proſpect that
we can ſee no end of it. Now I ask your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
what it is that puts ſuch a fallacy upon us,
for other it cannot be; foraſmuch as the ſame
term of years, whether it be reckoned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or backward, paſt or to come, muſt
needs really be of the ſame length and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is verily ſo as you ſay, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
is very ingenious and pertinent to the
buſineſs in hand. But to give you an account
of the reaſon of that different eſtimate, I can
ſay but theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Either as it is in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100726:19"/>
the nature of hope to flatter us, ſo all things
ſeem bigger at a diſtance, and whilſt they are in
expectation only, than what we can find them
to be in fruition. Or elſe it muſt be, that what
is paſt of our lives we have freſh and lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon, by remembring the notable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that have fallen out within that compaſs,
by which means thoſe equally remote portions
of time are brought near to our eye.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary in the time which is to
come, we can have no remarks upon it; becauſe
not knowing what ſhall happen, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to fix our thoughts upon, and ſo it
looks like a vaſt Ocean to us. For you know
that things which are in confuſion ſeem to be
more than the ſame things when they are dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
into juſt order and method. And in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
you obſerve that twenty or thirty miles
which we are well acquainted with, and have
frequently traced, ſeem ſhort and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but the ſame length of Journey in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Way, ſeems very tedious and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us. Thus I think it is in the Caſe you
have propounded; but now, if you pleaſe, let
us paſs on where we were going.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, ſuppoſe the term of our lives be
eſtimated at the duration of about ſeventy years,
yet in the firſt place we muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
from this Summ a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part,<note place="margin">A Practical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the littleneſs of our ſpare time.</note> as taken up in
Childhood and Youth, and which
ſlips away we know not how, ſo
as to eſcape our obſervation, being wholly ſpent
in folly and impertinency, but certainly loſt to
all manly purpoſes: to which if you add the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of Old Age, which (though it do not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100726:19"/>
equally in all men, yet) always more or leſs
renders ſome part of our time uſeleſs; you will
think it no unreaſonable <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> if I ſuppoſe
that both together take up a third part of the
whole.</p>
               <p>Then in the next place let us conſider how
great a proportion is taken up in ſleep, in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking, in dreſſing and undreſſing, in
trimming and adorning, and, to be ſhort, in the
mere neceſſities of the Body. I have read of a
brave Saxon Prince of this our Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who allowed only eight hours in the Day,
or one third part of his time, to theſe uſes;
but I doubt few mean men follow his example:
and if we take meaſures from common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
we ſhall find that theſe meaner Offices
take up near, if not altogether half the time of
moſt perſons, And ſo another third of the
whole is gone, and only one poor third remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for all other occaſions.</p>
               <p>Then again, out of that remainder a very
great ſhare will be challenged by neceſſary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
the affairs of our Eſtate or Calling, and
the concerns of our Families; and theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are ſo importunate that they will not be
denied without culpable Ill-Husbandry, nor
gratified without a large proportion of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
remainder.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whether we will or no, another
part will be raviſhed from us by Sickneſs and
Phyſick, in Civility and Complement, in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
and being viſited, in Journies and News,
and a thouſand impertinences; ſo that he muſt
be a very good and wary Husband indeed that
ſuffers not great expences this way.</p>
               <p>And after all this, here is nothing for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100726:20"/>
and ſtudy, for meditation and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our own minds, nay, not for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Devotion towards God, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
Concerns of another World, which
in all reaſon may moſt juſtly put in for their
ſhares.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>All this is very true; but what do you
infer from this Account?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I dare truſt your judgment to make
Inferences from the Premiſes: For in the firſt
place I know you cannot fail to obſerve, and
that with a juſt indignation, that the lighteſt
matters of our Life have the greateſt ſhare of
our time ſpent in them; folly and infirmity,
infancy and dotage, take up the greateſt room
of all; then worldly buſineſs and pleaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt
the moſt of that which is left, and the
Mind and nobleſt intereſts have leaſt of all left
for them.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, you cannot but note
with admiration how very little ſhare God
Almighty hath even from the very beſt of men.
And you cannot but adore his Goodneſs which
rewards with Eternal Life that little time in
which men work in his Vineyard; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men come in at the eleventh hour or ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
it is too plain that ſcarcely an eleventh
part of our time is ſpent in his ſervice. But
that which I aim at in this Calculation is to
demonſtrate to you, that there is a great deal
more reaſon that men ſhould endeavour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to redeem time from leſſer occaſions than
to laviſh it in impertinences, that ſo our weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
Concerns may have the more tolerable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances:
And to be ſure he muſt be a very
ſoft and feeble man, that, after all theſe ends
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100726:20"/>
are ſerved, can complain that time lies upon
his hands, which was the thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I am now amazed at my own ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that could think fit to put ſuch a caſe to
you. Lord! what vain Fools are we, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of plenty when we are rather ſtraitned and
in want? What ſilly Prodigals we are, that are
ſo far from ſparing betimes, that we are not ſo
much as frugal, when all theſe claims and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
come in ſo thick upon us? I have often
heard it ſaid, that by keeping a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Incomes and Expences, a man might
eaſily preſerve an Eſtate from dilapidation.
but I now perceive that for want of a little of
your Arithmetick <hi>to number our days,</hi> we run
out our Leaſe of Life before we are aware; and
phanſying we have enough to ſquander away
upon every trifle, we have ordinarily little or
nothing left to defray the moſt weighty oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p>And, with your pardon, let me tell you, I
think now I have found where the Shoo pinches:
It is not (I perceive now) a ſurpluſage of time
that tempts us to ſeek out thoſe diverſions afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid;
but the mere vanity of our minds, which
hath a fondneſs for them and their Cuſtom and
Example have made them ſo natural and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
neceſſary to us that we think the time long
till we are at them. Not that we have much to
ſpare, for God knows we have little enough;
but becauſe we think much of all that which is
otherwiſe employed. And this I doubt is the
true reaſon why we are impatient of long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and offended with a long Sermon; which
whoſo obſerves would perhaps charitably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100726:21"/>
that the urgency of buſineſs would not
permit us to attend them; but we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
our ſelves of that pretence when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that time lyes upon our hands. To ſpeak
truth therefore and ſhame the Devil and our
ſelves too, We can hardly ſpare time for God,
becauſe we love him too little: but we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of ſpare time for our idle diverſions,
only becauſe we love them too much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Dear <hi>Phil,</hi> You have hit the very
Mark: But let us go on, and
ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">Innocent and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant employments of Time.</note> that our ſpare time were
more than it is or poſſibly can
be (upon the premiſes) yet it
will be no hard matter to find out more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
as well as more innocent entertainments
of it, than thoſe now in requeſt.</p>
               <p>For in the firſt place, there are ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
every whit as delightful as recreations
themſelves; ſuch as in particular, Planting and
Gardening, in which a man may not only have
the pleaſure to contemplate the admirable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and variety of the Works of God, but by
improving the nature of Plants, by altering the
ſpecies, by mixture and compoſition of ſeveral
beauties and perfections into one, by deducing
one out of another, exalting one by another,
and in a word by giving being and continuance
to ſeveral things, he becomes a kind of Creator
himſelf, if I may without offence uſe ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
This kind of buſineſs miniſters ſo
many and ſo raviſhing delights, that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Cato</hi> preferred it before all the pleaſure of
Youth, and thought the entertainment of his
elder years herein a good exchange for the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs
of younger years, which he had
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100726:21"/>
now loſt all uſe and apprehenſion of; nay, I
think <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf placed a good part of his
felicity in the delights of his Garden. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all I am certain that God Almighty who
knew beſt what ſatisfactions were to be found
within the whole ſphere of his Creation, and
was not invidious or niggardly towards men,
made choice of this for the entertainment of our
Firſt Parents in their ſtate of innocency, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their folly and ſin had damned them to care
and toil, and to the ſweat of their Brows.</p>
               <p>Again, There are ſome Exerciſes and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both of Body and Mind, which are very
ingenious as well as divertive, ſuch as Singing,
Muſick, Painting, and the like; in which a
man rather puts a pleaſant deception upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in point of time, than wholly loſes it. And
they are ſo far from debauching his mind or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his paſſions, that they only exalt a mans
phancy, but otherwiſe compoſe his temper even
to admiration.</p>
               <p>And if you will promiſe not to laugh at my
peculiar humour, I will refer another Inſtance
to this Head, and tell you, That methinks the
playing with a pretty humour'd Child of three
or four years old, or more or leſs, is ſcarcely
inferior in delightfulneſs to any of the former;
where you ſhall obſerve innocency of mind,
benignity of temper, ſweet and gentle paſſions,
eaſie and unforced mirth, unfeigned love, pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
endearments of affection, pleaſant endeavours
to ſpeak and expreſs it ſelf, little dawnings of
reaſon and phancy, and innumerable other
things, which a man can feel rather than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
I called this my peculiar phancy, but I
do not know why it ſhould be peculiar to me;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100726:22"/>
I ſuppoſe it may be more general, however
I confeſs to you I am much the better pleaſed
with it, becauſe I find in the Goſpel that our
Saviour himſelf was not diſpleaſed with it.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe, there are ſome Offices of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and charity which afford a man unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
delight in the diſcharge of them; ſuch as
comforting a Friend or Neighbour in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or aſſiſting and counſelling him in his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
promoting Peace and making an end of
Controverſies, relieving a poor man in his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all which, beſides the ſatisfaction a
man hath in his own mind upon conſideration
that he hath done well and worthily, he is alſo
ſenſible of a reaction, and as it were by reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
participates of the pleaſure thoſe perſons
find by his good Offices towards them. For to
ſay nothing of any of the other, what a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is it to our own bowels, to obſerve the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
and Guſto with which a poor hungry
man feeds upon that which you charitably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
him with. And it will do a mans heart
good to take notice of the ſtrange change
wrought in ſuch a perſon by a bountiful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
his countenance more cheerful, his
ſpirits brisk, his heart light, his whole temper
more ſweet and ingenuous; all which who can
be acceſſory to without a kind of vertuous Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſm?</p>
               <p>All theſe which I have named are ſincere and
manly pleaſures, without noiſe and without
danger, which neither raiſe a mans paſſions nor
drown his reaſon; they are neither ſo fine and
ſpiritual that the Body can have no participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, nor ſo groſs and feculent that the
mind ſhould be aſhamed of them. And in ſome
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100726:22"/>
or other of theſe every man that pleaſes may
ſpend his vacant hours with ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>But let me now go a little higher, and what if
we take in ſomewhat of the other World to
ſweeten the preſent Life? What think you, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all,<note place="margin">Of Prayer, and reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> of Prayer to God and reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
may not a man beſtow
ſome of his time in theſe with
as much pleaſure as devotion?
and, ſo to allude to the Modern
Philoſophy, fill up the void ſpaces of his Life
with Celeſtial matter?</p>
               <p>As for the former of them, Prayer, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you well obſerved that ſeveral of thoſe men
that complain as if they were over-burthened
with time, yet love to make as ſhort work with
this as they can; wherein they betray either
ſome meaſure of Atheiſm in their hearts, or a
great deal of ſenſuality in their affections: and
I cannot tell whether they more contradict
themſelves, or diſcover their ſhameful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the nobleſt pleaſures of Life. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that it is highly agreeable to the beſt reaſon
of a mans mind, that he ſhould do all honour to
the Divine Majeſty, and daily pay his homage
to his greateſt Benefactor; and nothing ſure
can be more delightful than the exerciſe of our
higheſt powers about their proper Object. And
beſides that, Prayer is the known way to obtain
the Divine Bleſſing, upon which all the pleaſure
and comfort of our Lives depend, and never
fails of ſucceſs one way or other.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, I ſay, and abundance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantages of it, it is the very pulſe of the
Soul, which keeps the Spirits florid and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
It anſwers to the Motion of the Lungs in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100726:23"/>
the Body, and exhales thoſe melancholy Vapors
that would choke and ſuffocate our hearts:
By it we put our ſelves under the Diviue Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and our Spirits are heightened and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Patronage of ſo high a Genius, who
can ſecure us againſt all aſſaults and dangers
whatſoever. When we have commended our
ſelves to the Divine Providence by Prayer, our
hearts are at reſt; we are ſecure ſleeping and
waking; we are never alone, but have always
one to ſecond us; whatever the iſſue and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of our endeavours be, our minds are quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
if things anſwer our wiſhes, we have a
double ſatisfaction, that God Almighty favours
us, as well as that our labours are ſucceſsful; if
things miſcarry, we impute no folly, nor omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our ſelves, we have done all that was fit
for us to do, but it pleaſed Divine Wiſdom to
diſappoint us. The frequent approach of the
Divine Majeſty puts a gravity upon a man's
countenance, checks and keeps down all exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
of paſſions, begets an ingenuous modeſty,
and makes men as well aſhamed as afraid to do
an unworthy action.</p>
               <p>To all which add, that by the advantage of
our Prayers we are inabled to become a publick
Bleſſing, and every private man a Benefactor to
the whole World; than which thing what can
be either greater in it ſelf, or more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a great and generous mind? Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what can a brave and publick-ſpirited man
employ his time in with more delight, than in
that which (whatſoever his Fortunes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
condition be) will make him a Bleſſing
not only to his Friends and Neighbourhood, but
to the Country and Times he lives in, that even
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100726:23"/>
Kings and Princes are really beholden to him.
Nor is it neceſſary that much time be taken up
herein to ſerve all theſe great ends, nor much
leſs is it my intention to commend affectedly
long Prayers, a little time and a great deal of
heartineſs beſt doth the buſineſs of Religion,
and that little ſo employed will make all the
reſt paſs away the more ſweetly and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>And then for reading and medltating upon
the Holy Scripture, the Pſalmiſt hath told us,
that the good and bleſſed mans <hi>delight is in the
Law of God, and</hi> that <hi>therein he meditates day
and night.</hi> And ſurely any man may be able to
entertain a few moments in it. If curioſity ſway
with us, there are as admirable things in the
Holy Scriptures as the mind of man can deſire;
if we affect Hiſtory, we have there the antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt faithful Monuments in the World,
thoſe, without which all mankind had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in their Nonage and Childhood to this day,
as being ſo far from able to give an account of
the beginning of the World and original of
things, that they could not have looked back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
many Ages, but they would have been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
bewildered in Miſts and Fables as abſurd as
the wildeſt Fictions of Poets. Beſides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Record all the wonderful Methods of
Divine Providence, (which are the aſſurance
and comfort of the preſent Age, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to Vertue and Foundation of Piety and
Religion) had been buried in oblivion.</p>
               <p>If we ſeek after Knowledge, either natural,
moral or prudential, where is there ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treaſury of it to be found, where we have
not only the Relations and Obſervations of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100726:24"/>
wiſeſt men in all Ages paſt, but the diſcoveries
of the Divine Majeſty, the depths of infinite
Wiſdom (that knows the true reaſon of things)
laid open.</p>
               <p>If we are pleaſed with the foreknowledge of
things to come, as what man of Soul can chuſe
but deſire to ſee beyond the Curtain, then all
the Preſages, Prognoſticks and Divinations, all
the moſt rational inductions of the wiſeſt men,
are but ſilly ſurmiſes and idle dreams to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of the Holy Prophets, which give us
light to the Worlds end, and a view of another
World, and have both aſſured their own credit,
and warranted our belief of what is yet to come
by the well-known accompliſhment of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Predictions.</p>
               <p>If we would improve our ſelves in Vertue,
what ſuren Rule can we have than the expreſs
Declarations of God himſelf? Who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to him what ſhall pleaſe him, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to us better than he that made us, and
knows what is fit for us to do? And what more
full, plain, compendious and higher Inſtitution of
Religion can there be than the Holy Scripture?</p>
               <p>This brings God near to us, and us near to
him; here you know his mind, you ſee his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and hear him ſpeak; here you may ſtand
as it were upon an <hi>Iſthmus</hi> or Promontory and
take a view of both Worlds; this is the light
of our Eyes, the Rule of our Faith, the Law of
our Conſcience, and the Foundation of all our
Hopes. All this together ſure cannot chuſe
but make the reading of the Scripture become
a very ſerious, and yet a very delightful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
And now upon the whole matter,
what think you, Dear <hi>Phil.</hi> may not a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100726:24"/>
entertain himſelf and his time without the
relief of Drinking and Gaming?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>What think I, ſay you? Why, I think
worſe of my ſelf than ever I did. I do not
wonder now at what you ſaid when we firſt came
together, <hi>viz.</hi> That you could always find em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for your Time; but I wonder at my
own folly: for I plainly ſee now that no man
can have time to be a burden upon him that
hath come honeſtly by it, I mean, that hath not
ſtollen it from nobler Entertainments to beſtow
it upon a Debauch.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>But yet this is not all neither. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
I have ſatisfied you both of the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſome lighter, but innocent Exerciſes,
which I named in the firſt place; and alſo of
the great importance of Prayer and reading the
Scripture, which I laſt ſpoke of: yet as on the
one hand I would not have a man employ all his
vacant hours on the former, ſo neither on the
other hand do I think he is bound
to exhauſt them wholly upon the
latter:<note place="margin">Of Study and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and the difficulties of it.</note> No, <hi>Phil,</hi> our Bodies are
compounded of various humors,
our Souls conſiſt of ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
God is a good and benign Being, and
conſults the good and comfort of all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
he hath created. Beſides all the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
therefore (and thoſe which I have ſuppoſed
without naming them particularly) there is a
way of entertaining our ſelves, called Study
and Meditation. Study, I ſay, in general, not
confined to any Subject, but only directed to
the general end of improving our ſelves and
the time God hath given us in the World.</p>
               <p>For why ſhould we abject our ſelves that have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100726:25"/>
rational ſouls, an active vigorous Intellectual
Spirit in us? Is not this able to employ it ſelf,
our time and our bodily Spirits too? Is not our
mind large enough to embrace the whole
World? Can we not bring upon the Theater of
our imagination all the occurrences of time
paſt, as well as preſent. Muſt we needs only
pore upon the things juſt before our eyes! Muſt
our underſtandings lye fallow and barren unleſs
they be continually ſtirred up by our ſenſes?
Are our ſouls only given us for Salt to keep the
Body ſweet, or ſervilely to cater for our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
powers, and not rather to ſubdue and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them?</p>
               <p>Why ſhould not we remember we are men,
and improve our beſt Talent, ſharpen the ſenſe of
our minds, and enlarge and greaten our Spirits?
What hinders but that a man may converſe
with himſelf, and never have better Company
than when he is moſt ſolitary? How can a man
want Company that hath an Angelical Nature
within him, or need diverſion that hath the
whole World before him to contemplate?</p>
               <p>What ſhould diſcourage or hinder men from
this courſe? is it the pains and difficulty? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World is pleaſanter when a man is
once uſed to it: Is it for fear we ſhould exhauſt
our ſelves, and like the Spider ſpin out our own
Bowels in our Web? There can be no danger of
that, an Immortal Soul never wears out; and if
the Body goes by the worſt, ſo long as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is bettered, there is no loſs in all this. Or
ſay it ſhould be to no great fruit that we apply
our ſelves to Study, yet at leaſt this is gotten by
it, That we employ our time and keep our ſelves
out of harms, which is as much as we now ſeek
for.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>It is generally the fault of Eloquent
and Contemplative Men to outſhoot the Mark
they aim at, and whilſt they talk finely, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
very unpracticable things. Pardon me, Dear
<hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> if I ſuppoſe this infirmity hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
thoſe great accompliſhments in you at
this time. No doubt but Meditation is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
entertainment of Time, and queſtionleſs he
that hath once got the knack of it, nothing in
the World is ſo pleaſant to him: but you muſt
conſider, there are very few who have ſo much
command over themſelves as to hold their minds
long ſteady and intent, and perhaps fewer that
have ſufficient knowledge to employ their
thoughts at home; it requires a great Stock for
a man to be able to ſet up this Trade by himſelf.
Beſides, many mens Spleens are ſo near their
Heads, and there is ſo great affinity between the
Animal Spirits and Vapours, that he that goes
to exerciſe the one ſtirs up the other: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
the greater the intention of mind is
with which a man ſets himſelf to think, the
greater Cloud is raiſed, and the more impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it will prove for ſuch a man to diſcern any
thing clearly. Your Advice therefore is very
good for them that can receive it; but this is no
<hi>Catholicon,</hi> no general Receipt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you, Sir, moſt heartily for
the modeſt and ſeaſonable check you gave to the
cariere of my Diſcourſe: I muſt confeſs upon
ſecond thoughts that all men are not fit for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
and therefore it cannot be their Duty;
yet I muſt tell you withal, I ſuſpect more are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
than uncapable: and I doubt ſome are
more afraid of awakening their conſcience than
ſtirring their ſpleen by it. However, I have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100726:26"/>
another Expedient to propound (for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
we are upon) which will ſupply the place
of the former, and which, I am ſure, can be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to no Objection; and that
is,<note place="margin">Of friendly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence, and the great benefits of it.</note> Conference or Diſcourſe:
which when I have recommended
to you, I ſhall have delivered my
whole mind.</p>
               <p>God Almighty hath given us Speech to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
our ſelves to one another. We are not
left alone in the World ſo but that every man
hath ſome Friend or Neighbour to hold corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with; why ſhould we not then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
our ſelves, our friends and our time in
friendly Communication, without the help of
the Bottle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This requires no great inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mind, no great Stock is required in this
Caſe; this will ſtir up no Vapours from our
Spleen; and by this way we may not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
our ſelves, but elucidate our own thoughts,
enlarge our experience, reſolve one anothers
difficulties, and mutually pleaſe and profit one
another.</p>
               <p>And the more effectually to recommend this
Expedient to you, I will firſt take the confidence
to affirm, and do not doubt but I ſhall by and
by make it evidently appear, That this is not
only a very gentile and creditable way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
but alſo (if it be rightly practiſed) a
moſt pleaſant and delightful, and (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may ſeem the greateſt Paradox of all) one
of the moſt healthful Exerciſes in the World.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe you will eaſily grant me
when you conſider, that Diſcourſe is that which
principally diſtinguiſhes a Wiſe man from a
Fool. For what elſe do we take our meaſures
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100726:26"/>
of one another by? If a Man diſcourſe of
weighty matters, and keep cloſe to the Point,
and ſpeak ſharply in the Caſe, we account him
a worthy man. But contrariwiſe if he talk flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
inſipidly and impertinently, we have no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
or reverence for ſuch a Perſon, let his
outward appearance and circumſtances be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
what they will.</p>
               <p>It is certain we cannot know a Mans thoughts
or the ſenſe of his mind till he expreſs them: A
Fool we ſay is a Wiſe-man ſo long as he holds
his peace, and a Wiſe-man differs nothing from
a Fool till he ſpeaks. For a mans actions may
be by rote or cuſtom or the direction of ſome
other perſon, but a mans diſcourſe is his own.
<hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
ſaid our Saviour. The tongue will betray
not only the inclinations and paſſions of the
heart, but the very ſenſe and capacity of the
mind; and the latter much more than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as the Liquor will carry the tincture of
the Veſſel. 'Tis poſſible indeed for an evil and
vitious man to talk vertuouſly, and a ſilly man
may get into a Road of wiſe Sayings; but the
Leſſon he hath conn'd will ſoon be at an end, and
then he will no more be able to hold out at that
rate, than a flaw'd Veſſel to make the ſame ſound
with a good one. Wiſdom and folly are widely
different in their natures; but it is Diſcourſe that
lays them open and makes the diſtinction conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous:
why then ſhould not a man by practice
endeavour to become expert at that which, if
he be maſter of, will be his Glory, but to be
ſure will make his Character.</p>
               <p>But now for the vulgar methods of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
which commonly conſiſts of Drinking
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100726:27"/>
and Gaming, they are no better
than Levelling Practices,<note place="margin">Drinking and Gaming are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Practices.</note> that
obſerve no diſtance, nor make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſtinction amongſt men, the
Maſter and Servant are at <hi>Hail Fellow,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
and the Clown are upon the Square with
one another, the Man of Parts and Learning and
the verieſt Ideot and Coxcomb are upon even
Ground in thoſe Entertainments.</p>
               <p>As for Drinking, I cannot ſufficiently won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at that abjection of mind in Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who, as if they conſented to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation,
will contend for Victory with their
Inferiors at equal Glaſſes: when it is notorious,
that a Porter ſhall bear more than a Gentleman;
and a fine Wit ſhall be baffled and diſordered
with that which a thick ſcull'd dull Sot will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away well enough, and come off as wiſe a
man as he entred. But ſuppoſe the Gentleman
ſhould outdo the Clown, and the Witt the
Dunce; yet as the Match was made very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently,
ſo the Victory would be inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>And then for Gaming, I have heard of an
Ape that hath been too hard for his Maſter at
that moſt ingenious Game of Cheſs. But I have
known one very near to a Natural that hath
been a great Maſter at it. And certainly it is
very eaſie to imagine that in thoſe other Games,
which are governed by Chance, the Victory
may fall to the leſs worthy Perſon. It ſeems
therefore a very mean thing to be eagerly intent
upon that to which a Wiſe man hath no better
title than a Fool, and, if we believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
much leſs. To be ſure no man can be ſo
vain as to think himſelf the wiſer or better
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100726:27"/>
man for his Conqueſt. But now Diſcourſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminates
mens real abilities, and bears an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Teſtimony to a mans worth, and the
Conteſts of reaſon are therefore truly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
becauſe the wiſer man is ſure to have the
Victory.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, For the pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulneſs
of Diſcourſe, it cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but that the Higher Powers in a man are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the ſweeteſt delights, in the exerciſe
of themſelves; and the more ſtrong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
the Conſtitution of thoſe
Powers is,<note place="margin">The Pleaſures of Diſcourſe.</note> the more quick and
raviſhing muſt the ſenſe of their
peculiar pleaſure conſequently be. This the
experience of all ſtudious men bears teſtimony
to, amongſt whom one Truth ſifted out by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is more pleaſant than all the Entertainments
of an Epicure. For in Diſcourſe there is a
very grateful reliſh in the mere bandying of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to and fro: Great curioſity in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
prettineſs in an hanſomely dreſs'd
probability, ſurprize in Paradoxes ingeniouſly
maintained, admirable beauty in that ſtrange
variety of Colours in which a good Wit will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
things, far beyond the hand and skill of
a Painter; all which, with a thouſand other
Particulars which I paſs by, render the pleaſure
of Diſcourſe as much tranſcendent to all inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſenſuality as Reaſon it ſelf is above ſenſe,
or a Man ſuperior to a beaſt.</p>
               <p>And now in the laſt place for that ſeeming
Paradox concerning the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
of Diſcourſing,<note place="margin">Diſcourſing an healthful Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</note> it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that they who are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of the health of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100726:28"/>
to the end that they may invigorate all
their powers and faculties, have to that purpoſe
found out appropriate Exerciſes to all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
parts: for ſo they fay, walking is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good for digeſtion, by gently agitating the
Stomach and Bowels; riding is ſingularly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to the Head; playing at Bowls helps the
Reins; and the uſe of the long Bow, is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended for opening the Breaſt and
Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I think I may be bold to ſay,
that whatſoever each of theſe is to its reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
part and member, that will ſmart and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conference perform to the whole man.
For as to the very bodily powers, it warms the
Heart and Stomach, dries the Brain, opens the
Lungs, quickens the motion of the blood, and
brings a freſh and florid Colour into the face
and whole habit. And then as for the better
part of man, Diſcourſe raiſes the phancy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
the memory, clears the thoughts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens
the judgment, and improves the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
of the mind. To which add, if you
pleaſe, that it diverts melancholy, puts off do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
baniſhes anxious thoughts and ſollicitude,
and in a word holds a man ſo fully employed,
that it leaves no room for the very temptations
of the Devil.</p>
               <p>And now I appeal to you, judge whether I
have performed my promiſe or no: If I have,
then beſides all the aforementioned here is a
manly employment of time always at hand, an
exerciſe that every one is capable of that hath a
tongue in his head and a ſoul in his body. Thus
we may treat our Neighbour, and coſt us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what we (it ſeems) have too much
of, I mean Time. And thus we may profit our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100726:28"/>
ſelves, and oblige him too beyond all other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I have a great reverence for your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but in truth I cannot tell what to ſay to
this Goſſipping kind of diverſion, and till this
moment I never thought lip-labour had been of
ſuch value. As for thinking men, the World
is content to let them enjoy the reputation of
being wiſe, or at leaſt to ſuſpend their judgment
of them till they ſee the contrary in the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
of ſuch men in all the inſtances of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and pleaſant converſation. But as for talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative
men (I need not tell you) they have ever
been accounted troubleſome and impertinent.
And for your own part, Good <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> give
me leave to ſay that your practice confutes your
Doctrine; for after all this which with great
Wit and Eloquence you have ſpoken in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of diſcurſive converſation; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that every one who knows you,
knows your ſingular dexterity in managing any
Subject that falls under Debate in your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
yet you of all men are generally obſerved
to be the moſt ſilent and reſerved. It is true at
this time you have been diſpoſed to talk very
freely with me, (for which I am greatly obliged
to you;) but at ſeveral other times it is a hard
matter to pump any thing out of you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee plainly that there is a wrong as
well as a right Handle to every thing, and a
continual proneneſs in men to miſtake one
another. Whenſoever any Vice is cenſured
or expoſed, men preſently think the contrary
extreme to that practice muſt needs be the
Vertue; ſo whilſt I have been recommending
ingenuous and friendly Conference, you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100726:29"/>
me as if I had made it my deſign to plead
for impertinent talkativeneſs: which truly I am
ſo far from, that I think the World doth that
ſort of men no wrong in the cenſure it paſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; amongſt whom (if it be a wiſe man's
Lot to be caſt) he will think himſelf in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Parrots, and for his deliverance be
tempted to pray for deafneſs as a great Bleſſing.
No, <hi>Phil,</hi> no, I would neither have men ſay all
they can, nor much leſs talk whether they can
or no. But I would have them firſt think to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their ſpeaking, and then ſpeak, that a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be made of their thoughts: I would
that men ſhould bend their minds whenever they
relax their tongues, and try the ſtrength of one
anothers heads in reaſoning rather than in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But then as for what your ſelf or others have
obſerved of my carriage in Company, I confeſs
the Obſervation is rightly taken, and I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
aſſign you the occaſions
of it;<note place="margin">Juſt occaſions of Taciturnity or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> which are (as far as I
know my ſelf) ſuch as theſe:
In the firſt place, it ſometimes
falls out, that the Subject which
other men are diſcourſing of, is
not very agreeable to my mind; as in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
times, the common Theme is News;
which as it is uſually managed is frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with pragmaticalneſs and cenſure of the
Government under which we live, or at leaſt
the effect of it is the filling one another with
fears and jealouſies, and the tormenting a mans
ſelf before the time, with his own or other
mens dreams and ſuſpicions. Now in this Caſe
I am generally ſilent, at leaſt till I can find a fit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100726:29"/>
tranſition, and have the good luck to turn the
ſtream of Diſcourſe ſome other way.</p>
               <p>Again, ſometimes I am in the Company of
thoſe who are every way my Betters; and there
I think it as much more adviſeable to hear than
to ſpeak, as it is better to reap than to ſow.</p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo I meet with a Company of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultorious
Wits, who skip ſo haſtily from one
thing to another, that they over-run me; and
whilſt I am meditating what to ſay pertinently
to the Queſtion in hand, they are gotten into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Subject: A man muſt ride Poſt, or be
left behind by ſuch Diſcourſers.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this, ſometimes a mere melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
humour ſeizes me; which ſo benums me,
that I am for that Fit altogether uſeleſs in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But let that be as it may, or however my
practice falls ſhort of my counſel, I am certain
my example is not ſufficient to counterbalance
the Reaſons I have given. Wherefore let me
again heartily recommend it to you, not only
for its own benefit, but if it were but to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede
and lay aſide thoſe other ſoft and ſilly diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which have of late ſo far uſurped upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society, as well nigh wholly to ingroſs to
themſelves all mens vacant hours, and a great
deal more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>You have the Aſcendant of me, and
may perſwade me to what you will: But, Good
Sir, do not convert me from a Good-Fellow to
a prating Fool. If I had been uſed to ſtudy, and
been converſant in Books, as you have, I might
have been in a capacity to pleaſe my ſelf, and
perhaps the Company too with Diſcourſe; but
for want of that Education, ſilence will general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be my beſt diſcretion.</p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:100726:30"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Books, <hi>Phil!</hi> It is neither Books nor
much reading that makes a wiſe man. How
many ſhrewd men have you known, and very
well accompliſhed in moſt parts of Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that never had any great matter of Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
And on the other ſide, amongſt the great
number of thoſe that have had all the advantages
of Bookiſh Education, how few are thoſe that
are really the better for it! With many men
reading is nothing better than a dozing kind of
Idleneſs, and the Book is a mere Opiate that
makes them ſleep with their eyes open. 'Tis
perverted into an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thinking wiſely,<note place="margin">Of the uſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Books and Reading.</note> and made
a creditable pretence for diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of buſineſs. Such mens ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
is only an artifice to reconcile the eaſe
and voluptuouſneſs of ſloth with the reputation
of wiſdom; a gentile and wary kind of Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm,
that ſurfeits without pain or ſhame, and
in which men ſpend their time without profit to
themſelves or uſefulneſs to the World.</p>
               <p>Again, there are ſome with whom Bookiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is a Diſeaſe: For by over-much reading
they ſurcharge their minds, and ſo digeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
They ſtuff themſelves ſo full of other
mens Notions, that there is no room for their
faculties to diſplay themſelves. Such as theſe
after all their reading can no more be accounted
learned, than a Beaſt of burden may that carries
a Students Books for him. Only ſo much Meat
is properly nouriſhment to the Body as a man
can macerate and digeſt, as he can apply to the
reparation of his Body, when he can ſeparate
the ſuperfluities, and be ſtronger and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer
after it, more than this breeds ill humors,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100726:30"/>
obſtructs the paſſages, and impairs the ſtate of
health inſtead of advancing it; and ſo much
Study only is profitable as will excite a mans
thoughts as will afford hints or ſallies to the
minds, or as will furniſh him with matter for
meditation and diſcourſe, which two laſt things
are the two great inſtruments of improving our
ſelves, and therefore are to preſcribe the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of our ſtudy and reading.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it was well ſaid by a Great Man
of our Countrey, That reading indeed might
make a full and copious man, but meditation
made a profound man, and Diſcourſe a clear,
diſtinct and uſeful man. For reading at moſt
doth but make a mans mind equal to that of the
Author he reads; but meditation ſets him upon
the ſhoulders of his Author, by which means he
ſees farther than he did or could do. Or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the one may fill up all the preſent capacity of
a mans mind, the other, <hi>viz.</hi> meditation, ſtretches
and enlarges thoſe capacities. And then for
Diſcourſe (which is that we are now ſpeaking
of) beſides the advantages which it hath in
common with meditation, it opens and unfolds
a mans thoughts, and ſo brings his Notions to a
Teſt, and makes proof of the ſolidity or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his conceptions: by which means,
as on the one hand he ſhall not run away with
the ſhadows of things inſtead of the ſubſtance;
ſo on the other hand, when his apprehenſions
are ſifted, and approved to be right and ſound,
his mind will be confirmed againſt wavering,
and he will become conſtant and conſiſtent with
himſelf. I have often obſerved with equal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and wonder, that by the mere propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a difficulty to another, I have preſently been
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100726:31"/>
able to reſolve that which was too hard for me,
whilſt I revolved it only in my own breaſt.
For by that opening and unfolding of our
thoughts we let in light to our own judgments
and ſee clearer than we did before.</p>
               <p>Beſides, a man is too apt to have a partial
fondneſs to the iſſue of his own brain; but when
he hath brought his conceptions to the impartial
Touchſtone of other mens judgments, and as it
were tried them by the light, he will neither be
apt to be upon all occaſions over-confident, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
and dogmatical; (as you may obſerve
many reſerved ſtudious men to be, who when
once they give vent to their thoughts labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a kind of incontinency of mind, and will be
continually dictating and aſſerting at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
nor on the other ſide will he ſtumble at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
rub, and ſtagger at every objection, and ſo
give up the beſt Cauſe upon the ſlighteſt (but
unforeſeen) Attack.</p>
               <p>And there is one thing more very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this matter; namely, that by Conference
a man is accuſtomed to methodize and digeſt
his thoughts in order; by which means his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are not only rendred more beautiful, but
are more at hand, and alſo more perſpicuous
and fitter for uſe. Whereas contrariwiſe, (let
a man have read never ſo much, and meditated
too into the bargain) without this expedient all
his Notions will lye very odly and confuſedly,
and come out all in an heap or huddle. In ſumm,
He that uſes himſelf only to Books, is fit for
nothing but for a Book; and he that converſes
with no body, is fit to converſe with no body.</p>

               <p>In truth, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> though I am very
ſenſible of my own defects in Point of Learning;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100726:31"/>
yet in that little experience which I have had in
the World, I have ſeen ſo many inſtances of the
ill uſe, or rather no uſe that ſome men have
made of it, that I am not only convinced there
is ſome truth in what you ſay, but am the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inclined to be content with my own educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I have known ſome mighty Bookiſh men
like full Veſſels without vent, as if they were
troubled with the Gripes; their Notions fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in them, but they cannot utter them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to their own eaſe or the profit of others.
And again, ſome mens learning hath ſerved only
to make them pedantick and troubleſome, to
make a noiſe with words and terms of Art every
whit as offenſive the clatter of the Table-men,
which you laugh'd at even now. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
by your favour, it cannot be doubted
but Learning hath mighty advantages; and I
verily think you ſhould ſpeak againſt your own
conſcience if you condemned it in the general:
Wherefore you muſt excuſe me if I continue of
the opinion, that it is next to impoſſible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more of it than I can pretend to, to hold
ſuch converſation as you are putting me upon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Excuſe me, Dear <hi>Phil.</hi> I do not in
the leaſt put any ſlight upon Learning, or the
means of it, Books and Study: I know well it
is of admirable uſe in a wiſe mans hand, becauſe
it gradually and inſenſibly opens mens minds,
and both gives them a quicker ſight and affords
them a larger proſpect. And even on the moſt
ordinary parted men it hath at leaſt this effect,
to calm the Spirits, and to ſweeten their temper,
by ſubduing the fierceneſs and ferity of mens
conſtitutions. And therefore I heartily wiſh,
that no Gentleman (eſpecially) were permitted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100726:32"/>
to attain his State and Fortunes without this
qualification. So that all I was ſaying was only
this, that you nor any man of your capacity
ought to diſcourage your ſelves upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of your leſſer advantages that way; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as a wiſe and a good man may (though
perhaps not with the ſame eaſe) with a very
little of it maintain an ingenuous and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Converſation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps it may be ſo as you ſay: But
then certainly a man muſt have very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
natural abilities to ſupply that defect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, <hi>Phil,</hi> that needs not neither;
for Diſcourſe will both ſupply
the want of acquired abilities,<note place="margin">Converſation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves a man more than Books and Study.</note>
and alſo improve the natural. I
ſuppoſe you remember the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Solomon, As Iron ſharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Iron, ſo doth the countenance of a man his
friend.</hi> I confeſs I have heard that paſſage of
the Wiſe man applyed to the viſiting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
a friend in adverſity, which certainly
doth mightily buoy up and ſupport a mans Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
when he finds that he is not altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of his friend, but owned by him in the
loweſt ebb of his Fortunes. But I think it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
whit as true and applicable to that we are
ſpeaking of, as if he had ſaid that the company
and converſation of a friend doth as well quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
a mans wits, and improve his underſtanding,
as one Iron Inſtrument is ſharpened by another.
For as I ſaid before, Conference and Diſcourſe
give us the advantage of whatſoever he (we
converſe with) hath read or thought upon that
Subject, and ſo we reap the benefit of his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of his meditations too. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100726:32"/>
that, we exerciſe our own judgment upon
the matter ſo digeſted and prepared for us, the
very preſence and attention of our friend ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
the attention of our minds, his Queſtion
prevents our extravagancy and wandring, and
keeps us in a method, and his expectation from
us holds our thoughts cloſe and ſteady to the
Point in Debate. By all which not only the
Stock of our Knowledge is improved, but the
Patrimony alſo; I mean, the very powers of the
Soul. In conſideration of all which, that Great
Man of our Country, whom I cited but now,
doth not ſtick to pronounce, That if it ſhould
be a mans hard fortune to have no body to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
withal, it were better he ſhould talk to a
Poſt than not open his mind at all.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>There you nickt it, <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> by that
laſt word (whoever was the Author of it) I
perceive a Wiſe man may make ſome uſe of ſuch
a Tool as I am, if it be but to reflect and Echo
back his own thoughts upon himſelf. But in
earneſt, Sir, now that you have encourag'd me,
I begin to think ſomething better of my ſelf,
and am reſolved to try what may be done in
the way you recommend. But what would you
have a man diſcourſe about? I am afraid, if
there be not ſome care in the choice of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
all will degenerate into Goſſipping and
impertinent Chat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>There is no need of ſollicitude in that
Particular, foraſmuch as any, even the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and occaſional Subject, will enable us to
attain the end we aim at, provided it be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
home; I mean, talk of what matter you
will, if ſo be you do not talk flatly and careleſly
about it, but ſet your thoughts on work and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100726:33"/>
they will bring forth both pleaſure and profit.
For the mere exerciſe of our minds improves
them as well as that of the body doth the ſtate
of bodily health; and whilſt our thoughts are
intent, though we are not ſenſible how time
ſlips away, yet we ſhall be ſenſible in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
that we have not quite loſt it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, you have obſerved Muſicians to make
the moſt curious deſcant upon the plaineſt
ground, and have ſeen ſeveral of the Indian
Manufactures, where the moſt exquiſite Art
hath been beſtowed upon the meaneſt materials:
'Tis not therefore the Theme, but the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it that is conſiderable; for, as I ſaid, let
that be what it will, if you purſue it with a
Train of thoughts, and eſpecially if you be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
to take notice of, and apprehend thoſe
hints that will thence he occaſionally ſtarted,
you ſhall quickly be amazed to find your ſelf
led before you were aware into ſome ſpacious
and beautiful Field of Contemplation, wherein
you may at once both loſe and refreſh your
ſelf.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, I acknowledg to you, that
the pitching upon ſome good and uſeful Subject
at firſt is both the ſhorteſt and the ſureſt way to
attain our end. For the very importance and
concern of a weighty affair naturally rowzes up
our minds, and collects and fixes our looſe and
ſcattered thoughts; as you ſhall ſeldom ſee any
man drowſie and inattentive whilſt a matter of
conſequence to his Life or Credit or Fortunes is
in agitation.</p>
               <p>Therefore that having thus prepared you to
it, I may now ſpeak a great truth to you, and
that you may effectually ſhake off all the foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100726:33"/>
in faſhion, and make converſation profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And if indeed you would awaken your
ſenſes, and improve your ſelf and your time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
let me above all things in the World
commend to you Religious Communication, talk
of the Concerns of a Soul, and of another
World. This is a Subject of
that weight and moment,<note place="margin">Diſcourſe about religious matters recommended.</note> that it
cannot fail either to make you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or the Company you ſhall
be in grave and ſerious; and it is withal ſo vaſt
and large, that you can never fear to be run on
ground; for it will always afford you freſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true the Subject is copious enough,
and I may be ſure to have it all to my ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no Body will talk with me about it. Who
is there now adays that troubles his head with
Religion, or eſpecially makes it any part of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
If perhaps any mention of it fall in
by the by, it is preſently let fall again, as if it
were too hot for mens fingers, and at moſt it is
made but a kind of Parentheſis, which may be
kept in, or left out of the Diſcourſe without
interruption of the ſenſe. You have found me
out a Subject indeed, but now you muſt ſeek me
out Company too to treat upon it. For as the
World now is, this will ſeem ſo irkſom a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that no time will be ſo tedious as that
which is ſpent upon it, and ſo we have loſt the
whole deſign we were levelling at.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Who (ſay you) will diſcourſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
Why, every Body ſure that thinks of
it: for it is a matter that comes ſo home and
cloſe to every man, that he muſt be a ſtark
Sot, and deſtitute of the common ſenſe and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100726:34"/>
diſcretion of a man, that is not mightily affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it.</p>
               <p>For tell me, is there any man ſo abſurdly
vain as to think he ſhall not dye? Can any
man that obſerves the frail contexture of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the innumerable accidents he is ſubject
to, think himſelf immortal? Or can he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook
the common condition of mankind,
and when he ſees men daily drop away and dye
in their full ſtrength, and in ſpight of all helps
and advantages of preſervation; yet be ſo fond
as to imagine he ſhall eſcape the common lot?
And ſeeing what happens to another man to day,
may befal himſelf to morrow; or however, he is
certain that he cannot be of any long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in this World; who, I ſay, that is ſenſible
of this can chuſe but pry beyond the Curtain,
and bethink himſelf what ſhall come after.</p>
               <p>Is it not the very temper and conſtitution
of our minds to be inquiſitive of the future? Is
it not a great part of our Prerogative above
Beaſts, that whereas they are wholly taken up
with what's preſent to them, and neither mind
what is paſt nor to come; we by the largeneſs
of our ſouls embrace both, and do we not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
count him an Ideot that is ſo ſhort-ſighted
as not to ſee beyond his Noſe end.</p>
               <p>Doth not every Wiſe man provide for what
may be,<note place="margin">The importance of Religion.</note> and do not even the moſt
cold and incredulous ſuſpect at
leaſt there may ſome thing
concern us after the preſent life; and is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man that can, if he would never ſo fain, quite
rid his thoughts of it? Sure therefore every
man that thinks he ſhall dye, (that is every man
that lives) thinks ſomething of Religion, if it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100726:34"/>
be but for fear of the Worſt. Perhaps you
will ſay there are ſome men, who though they
know they ſhall dye, yet think they ſhall dye as
the Beaſts dye, and have no concern hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but are they worthy to be accounted men
that can phanſie ſuch a thing? A Beaſt indeed
hath life and ſenſe and motion, and participates
of ſome kind of phancy and memory: but doth
it underſtand a Diſcourſe, or weigh an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Is it able to infer from Premiſes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
things gone and paſt, and recal them
to mind at pleaſure? Can it compare things
together, gather the reſult, diſtinguiſh or paſs a
judgment upon appearances? will any man be ſo
ridiculous as to ſay, Beaſts are conſcientious
too, that they reflect upon their own actions,
and accuſe or excuſe themſelves accordingly?
or have they free will to determine their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which way they pleaſe, even againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of their ſenſes? Now he that conſiders all
theſe vaſt differences, will, if he have the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a man, conclude it very improbable that
a Creature of this admirable make ſhould be
only deſigned to be a Pageant for a day, and be
totally diſſolved at the date of this ſhort life;
eſpecially if he conſider withal that theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and capacities which we have ſhewn man to
be indued with, do not only put him upon the
thoughts and expectations and deſires of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtate; but do render him marvellouſly fit
for it, and capable of it; inſomuch that ſeveral
of the nobleſt of theſe endowments are wholly
in vain, if there be no ſuch thing, and that a
Man died as the Beaſts do.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, doth not every man that hath
eyes in his head to obſerve the admirable ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100726:35"/>
of the World, conclude that it muſt be the
Workmanſhip of a God, and he a great, a wiſe, a
good and a juſt Being; and can he think ſo, and
not reſolve there muſt be a great neceſſity of,
and reality in Religion that is in the reverend
obſervance of that Great Majeſty that deſerves
it, and who hath both made us capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it to him, and obliged us thereunto.</p>
               <p>Now if all, or but any part of this be true,
who is ſo mad as to have no concern for this
God, Religion and another World? and who
is there that having any concern for them, can
chuſe but think fit to make it ſome part of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
the employment of ſome part of his time,
and the Subject of his moſt ſerious debates? Hath
any man a moſt important Cauſe <hi>ſub Judice,</hi> and
his Tryal drawing on, and doth he never think
of it, or diſcourſe his Caſe with his friends?
Hath any man a great Eſtate in a Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
or a huge Patrimony in reverſion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeaks of it? Hath any man either a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Friend or a formidable Enemy, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
expreſſes himſelf concerning the one or the
other? Surely therefore ſeeing Religion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
all theſe Concernments, a man may find
thoſe that will diſcourſe with him on the
Point.</p>

               <p>I readily conſent to you, that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Religion is a moſt ſerious Affair, and
worthy of the greateſt conſideration; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
(as I have ſaid) there are very few will
correſpond with a man in diſcourſe about it:
To tell you truly, I am ſomewhat of opinion
that it is not fit for that kind of treatment.
As it is a ſacred, ſo it is a ſecret thing, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
only between God and a man's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100726:35"/>
and therefore is rather the Theme of
a man's thoughts, the ſolitary employment of
his own heart, and ſo fit to be kept up in the
Cloſet of his Breaſt, and not ſo proper matter
for Diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>And I as readily yield to you, Dear
<hi>Phil,</hi> that the ſoul and ſpirit of Religion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
retired and inward, and ſo inacceſſible to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, that they can neither ſee it, nor judge
of it. But though the firſt ſource
and ſprings of it lye very deep,<note place="margin">Religion reſts not in the mind only.</note>
yet why the ſtreams of it ſhould
not iſſue forth both in words and actions I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend. I have read of a ſort of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Apoſtolick times called Gnoſticks, who
gave out that it was ſufficient to retain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
belief and a right ſenſe of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in their minds and hearts, although they
neither made profeſſion of the faith with their
mouths, nor practiſed the laws of it in their
lives and converſations. This I look upon as
an hypocritical artifice of theirs, to the end
that they might make a ſaving Bargain of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
a device to ſleep in a whole skin, and
neither run any hazards, nor put themſelves to
any difficulties for Conſcience ſake; and if they
got nothing by Chriſt Jeſus, they thought they
would be ſure to loſe nothing by him. But as I
am very confident a man of your ſincerity can
harbour none of their deſigns, ſo I aſſure my ſelf
what you have ſaid is not upon their Principles:
Yet I muſt tell you, when the Apoſtle levell'd a
blow at them he reach'd your phancy alſo: for
he ſaith expreſly, <hi>With the heart man believeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is
made to ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:100726:36"/>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>O pardon me, Sir, I make no Queſtion
but that when a man is called to make profeſſion
of his faith, and to diſcover what Religion he
is of, then to diſſemble is to betray it, and to
be ſilent on ſuch a critical occaſion is to revolt
and apoſtatize from it; and in that ſenſe (I
take it) another Apoſtle hath required us, <hi>To
render to every man that asketh us a reaſon of
the hope that is in us,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Be
not aſhamed of your Perſwaſion, but owne and
defend your Religion, at the greateſt and moſt
adverſe Tribunals where-ever it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached.
But this is not the Caſe: We are
not now ſpeaking of what muſt be done upon
an authoritative inquiſition into our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or in times of perſecution; but what is to
be done in times of peace, and in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
and then and there I am ſtill of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that at leaſt it is not an expreſs Duty to
talk of Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Nor do I differ from you therein.
For I do not aſſert it as an univerſal Duty to
make Religion the matter of our Diſcourſe:
But my meaning is, that it will exceedingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
us to do ſo ſometimes. And I verily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
my ſelf, that he that hath a quick ſenſe of
God upon his mind, will have ſavoury expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of him ſometimes upon ordinary occaſions
(if a fooliſh modeſty do not too much overcome
him) as well as witneſs a good confeſſion in
times of perſecution. For as our Saviour ſaid,
(in the paſſage I mentioned before) <hi>Out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> And
it ſeems to me more eaſily conceiveable, that
there ſhould be a great fire without any ſmoke,
or a great light without any heat, than that ſuch a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100726:36"/>
man as is inwardly principled with the fear and
love of God ſhould be wholly tongue-tyed, or be
either able or willing altogether to ſtifle and
ſuppreſs his ſentiments. <hi>Can a man carry fire
in his boſom</hi> (ſaid the Wiſe man) <hi>and not be
burnt?</hi> Such an holy fervour as I ſpeak of will
aſſuredly both ſeek and find a vent for it ſelf,
and break out upon all fitting occaſions in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and affectionate expreſſions; by which
means a man in the firſt place eaſes his own
breaſt, and beſides, thus this holy fire not only
preſerves it ſelf from extinction, but propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
it ſelf alſo, warming and inflaming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>You have heard, I ſuppoſe, of an odd Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
among the Jews, who out of a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
reverence of the name of God, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it from prophanation (as they ſuppoſed)
ſo long forbad the common pronuntiation of it,
till at length by the intermiſſion of uſing it they
had quite forgotten how to pronounce it. And
thus I am afraid it would fare with Religion, if
men ſhould (out of I know not what conceit)
forbear all Diſcourſe of God and another
World, the reſult would be, that in time both
would be forgotten.<note place="margin">Religions Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in times of proſperity as of perſecution.</note> Not is it
(as you ſeem to imagine) only
times of perſecution that ought
to rowſe up our Spirits, and call
for expreſſions of our zeal; for the
Road of buſineſs, the ſucceſſively
flowing Tide of variety of entertainments in
this World, the ſoft Charms of pleaſant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
the blandiſhments of continual proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
and the ruſt upon our minds contracted
by lying ſtill in eaſe and ſecurity, do more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100726:37"/>
the ſtate of Religion than thoſe trying
times you ſpeak of. And therefore Atheiſm is
well known to be a Weed that thrives moſt in
the beſt Weather. The Seed that was ſown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſtony ground fell away when the hot Sun
ſcorched it, becauſe it had no depth of earth;
but that which was ſown among the Thorns was
choaked too, though the Soil was never ſo good;
in a word, Stormy Weather in the Church may
tempt men to be falſe and treacherous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negadoes,
but I believe it never made an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt;
that and prophaneneſs are the ill fruit
of proſperity. So that you ſee there is need
that the Spirit of piety ſhould exert it ſelf as
well in the one ſeaſon as in the other.</p>
               <p>Neither will the publickly ſtated times or
forms and exerciſes of Religion ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it againſt this danger, without ſuch volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
efforts and fallies of it as we are ſpeaking
of: For in regard God is not to be ſeen, and
the World is before us, the World to come is
at diſtance, and the preſent World at hand, ill
examples are numerous and good ones few and
rare, and in a word, we dwell in ſo cold a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that we had need not only to uſe a great
deal of exerciſe, but frequently to rub up one
another. Therefore as <hi>Socrates</hi> is ſaid to have
brought down Philoſophy <hi>(è Coelo in urbes)</hi> from
ſpeculation to practice, from high Notions to
the common Affairs of Life; ſo it ſeems neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to us not only to be religious at Church, and
devout in our Cloſets, but to allow it a ſhare in
our daily and ordinary converſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if you be for that, what think
you of a demure ſort of people amongſt us, that
as if their tongues were tipt with Religion will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100726:37"/>
be always canting in a Scripture-phraſe.<note place="margin">Of Hypocritical Canting.</note>
Theſe men ſeem to
think it prophane to ſpeak intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly

<hi>Shibboleth</hi> of the Godly party: And ſome
of them arrive at ſuch a pitch either of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy
or melancholy, (I am loth to pronounce
whether) that (upon the matter) they allow
no other Diſcourſe to be lawful but what hath a
tincture of Religion. Now for my part I look
upon theſe people as very abſurd and ridiculous,
and therefore I hope you do not intend to give
them countenance in what you are ſaying.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>So far from it, <hi>Phil,</hi> that I account the
former of the two ſorts of men, which you ſpeak
of, to be no better than a Generation of nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Phariſees, foraſmuch as nothing betrays hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
ſo much as overdoing, and by that
courſe of theirs they render Religion loathſome
and ridiculous, and tempt men to think it all
Trick and Cheat. And for the other, they
ſeem to be a pitiable, but crack-brain'd ſort of
men, who render Religion very uncomfortable
to themſelves, and indeed impracticable and
impoſſible. God knows we are not Angels but
men, and have concerns for the preſent World
as well as for the other; and conſequently it can
be no fault, but a juſt Duty, to take care of
them, and in order thereto to deliberate, to
take advice, and to diſcourſe about them.</p>
               <p>And this I am ſo confident of, that I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the Apoſtle when he forbids <hi>that any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
communication ſhould proceed out of our mouths,</hi>
and enjoins <hi>that it be ſuch as is good to the uſe of
edifying,</hi> intended we ſhould interpret the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100726:38"/>
expreſſion by the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that inſtead
of rotten and filthy talk we ſhould tend ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to the contrary, that we might turn the
ſtream of mens Diſcourſe to that which is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and profitable. And when he adds, <hi>That
it may miniſter grace to the hearers,</hi> I think he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that very thing which I have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
to you, namely, that we ſhould
take all fair opportunities of bringing Religion
into Plea, and of ſuggeſting good Meditations
to one another. But I can by no means think
he reſtrains all communication to that Subject,
provided that which is about other matter be
not lewd or fooliſh, but ſavoury
and ingenious,<note place="margin">Common Diſcourſe lawful.</note> uſeful and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
And this I am the more
confirmed in by another paſſage of the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,<note place="margin">Col. 4. 6.</note>
where he directs that <hi>our
ſpeech be ſeaſoned with grace as
with ſalt.</hi> Which, as I underſtand it, imports
as if he ſaid, that our moſt common converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould have ſome reliſh of our Religion; not
be wholly religious, no more thon our meat
ſhould be all ſalt, but ſeaſoned with it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, when our Saviour forewarns us,
<hi>that for every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they
ſhall give an account at the day of judgment,</hi> I can
by no means think his meaning was that every
word that hath not immediate relation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſhould be accounted idle, and as ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
damnation. Far be ſuch an Interpretation
from the merciful and condeſcending Laws of
our Saviour: if this were ſo, Chriſtianity was
a moſt anxious thing, and the lives of men muſt
be perpetually vexed with ſcrupuloſity. But I
take it, he intended only to repreſent to us, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100726:38"/>
the Judgment to come ſhall be very exact and
particular, ſo as to take notice not only of our
actions, and the greater paſſages of our lives,
but that our very words alſo ſhall come into eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and conſideration.</p>
               <p>You ſee therefore I am ſo far from countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
either an hypocritical Cant, or a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Melancholy, that I do not think Religion
ought importunely to thruſt it ſelf into conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
to the excluſion of every thing beſides it
ſelf; but that it have place in our Debates, and
where there is room for choice, there it is my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that we give it alſo the precedence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Well, ſo far we are agreed: But I pray
give me leave to go a little further with you.
What kind of Religions Conference is it you
would be at? Would you have men enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Diſputes about Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
This I the rather ask,<note place="margin">Of Diſputes in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and miſchiefs of them.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is another ſort of
men (beſides thoſe we now ſpoke
of) who ſeem to be mighty zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of Religion; but their heat breaks out
wholly this way, and they fill the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are with noiſe and clamour, with duſt
and ſmoak: Nothing can be ſaid in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
but inſtantly a Controverſie is ſtarted,
the Cudgels are taken up, and to it they go:
Scarcely any Body is Orthodox enough for
them; for they ſpin ſo fine a Thred, and have
ſuch Cobweb-Divinity, that the leaſt bruſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it is not to be endured: and yet withal
they are as poſitive and decretal in their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that the Pope himſelf is no body to them.
One would think they were Privy-Counſellors
of Heaven, they define with ſo great confidence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100726:39"/>
what will and what will not pleaſe God, and
damn to the Pit of Hell all that come not up ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
to their definitions and determinations.
Theſe, I aſſure you, are men that bear a great
part in the World, therefore I would fain know
your opinion of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Phil,</hi> I have no opinion of
them at all: I phanſie neither their Faith nor
their Charity; the one I account to be a great
deal too big, and the other as much too little.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Agreed again. And now I'll tell you
my thoughts a little more fully on this Point:
I have always lookt upon this Diſputative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs,
as no better than a new-faſhioned
Knight-Errantry, which puts men continually
upon queſt of Adventures and makes Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of every Wind-mill that comes in their
way. For theſe men, if there do but happen to
be an inconſiderate expreſſion let fall by any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
preſently raiſe ſuch a tragedy upon it, as if
Faith conſiſted wholly of Punctilio's, or a Line
was made up of Points, and that every petty
opinion were of moment enough to overturn the
World. The contrary whereof I take to be
ſo true that I ſuſpect whether that be of any
moment in Religion which admits of Diſpute;
for methinks it is not agreeable to the goodneſs
of God to ſuffer any thing of that univerſal
concern to all men to remain very obſcure and
controverſial. I ſhould think therefore this
knotty kind of Timber never fit for edification.
In plain truth (if you will pardon a rude Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude)
I phanſie theſe great Maſters of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to be like the ordinary Profeſſors of Rat-Catching,
who commonly draw more Vermine
to the place than they deſtroy; ſo theſe raiſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100726:39"/>
more Controverſies than they can decide, ſtart
more Difficulties than they can aſſoil, and ſo
beget ſchiſms, gratifie pride, inflame differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and foment heart-burnings amongſt men,
that might otherwiſe live peaceably together
here, and for ought I know go to heaven hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Moſt ingeniouſly ſpoken, Dear <hi>Phil,</hi>
and according to my very heart. If I thought
I could match your wit I would add, That
whenever I ſee a Knot of theſe Diſputants toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it puts me in mind of a Story or Fable,
which you will, of a Company of Apes that
had gotten a Gloworm amongſt them, upon
which they heaped Sticks and other little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
matter, and laying their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blow with all their might, as hoping to
make ſome ſtrange improvement of that little
ſhining Particle. But when they have done all
they can, are neither able to encreaſe the light,
nor much leſs to warm themſelves by it. So
theſe buſie diſputing Wits, after all their blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering,
neither bring any uſeful truth to light,
nor warm their own or other mens breaſts with
any ſpark of true Piety or Charity; but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
frequently obſcure the one, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the other.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore diſputing in Religion that
I would provoke you to; but the improvement
of the indiſputable Rules of it, to make your
ſelf and thoſe you converſe with, ſenſible of the
vital Principles and Powers of Chriſtianity, not
to chafe one another into a paſſion, but to rub
up one anothers Sentiments, and mutually to
warm one anothers hearts with Devotion. By
wiſe and affectionate applications to beget an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100726:40"/>
equal fervour of Spirit. And in a word, that
when Friends are met together they ſhould, like
Flint and Steel, raiſe both light and heat by
their mutual and amicable Colliſions.</p>
               <p>And why, I pray you, Dear <hi>Phil,</hi> ſhould not
Religion have its turn in our Converſation?
What reaſon can be given that pious men ſhould
not diſcourſe as freely and favourily of holy
things, as they or other men concerning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
affairs? Why ſhould our leſſer Concerns
for this World, our ſecular buſineſs, be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Subject of our Communication? Why, when
ſome talk of their Trades, their pleaſures and
of News, and the like, ſhould not we talk of
our Callings as we are Chriſtians, of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of our ſouls, and the hopes in another
World? Why may not we diſcourſe of our
heavenly Countrey, whither we are going, as
well as other men buſie themſelves about Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, which perhaps they never ſaw,
nor ever ſhall be concerned in?</p>
               <p>You your ſelf acknowledge Religion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the moſt ſerious and attentive Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our minds, and upon the ſame account
(if you be conſiſtent with your ſelf) you will
be induced to believe it the moſt worthy and
commendable Subject of Diſcourſe, as having
all thoſe advantages that can recommend any
Subject to the Debate of ingenious men, as it
were eaſie to make appear if it were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I value your judgment, but muſt
make uſe of my own; if therefore it be not too
troubleſome to you, let me entreat you to make
out that more fully to me, and then I promiſe
you I will either comply with the reaſons you
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100726:40"/>
give, or will ſhew you mine to the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart, Sir; and to do it
with as much brevity as may be: I will deſire you
to conſider in the firſt place whether this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
Religion, doth not contain in it the moſt
noble and excellent Points of enquiry, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
be not the moſt worthy, not only to
take up the affections, but to exerciſe the wits
of men upon.<note place="margin">Religion the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Subject of Diſcourſe.</note> Such as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
about the Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, the wiſdom of
that Providence that manages
and governs the World, the nature of Spirits,
and particularly of the Soul of Man, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and Freedom of Will, of the Nature
and Obligation of Laws, of the grounds of
Faith and the efficacy of it, of the nature and
ſucceſs of Repentance, of Redemption and
the way of propitiating God to man, of the
Judgment to come, the Reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Eternal Life, with abundance more of
the like nature; Points all vaſtly great and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
profound and difficult, yet equally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and diſcoverable: ſuch as are able to ſtir up
and provoke the greateſt capacities, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
and encourage the meaneſt; in a word, ſuch
things, as that there is nothing elſe within the
whole Sphere of Knowledge, that either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
or deſerves ſuch ſerious Debates.</p>
               <p>Now how trivial and childiſh a thing were it
whilſt we have all theſe wiſe and concerning
matters to treat of, to be taken up only with
Dogs and Horſes, with Drinks and Sawces, with
Faſhions and News (as is too commonly the
practice.)</p>
               <p>And if you will pleaſe to conſider well the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100726:41"/>
aforeſaid Particulars, and eſpecially if you make
tryal of the courſe I am adviſing you, you will
find theſe Subjects to be every
whit as pleaſant and delightful as
they are neceſſary and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.<note place="margin">Pleaſantneſs of religious Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>
For what can be imagined
able to miniſter more delight than the lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of another World and Eternal
Life, when men modeſtly reaſon together, and
endeavour to affect one anothers hearts with the
certainty and unſpeakable felicity of living for
ever? of the raviſhing contentment of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
everlaſting friendſhip? of being out of the
reach of Fate or Chance, out of the Sphere of
Mortality, Sickneſs and pain, care and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
of being exempted from all weakneſs, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
paſſion and infirmity? of being exalted
above all temptation, and ſecured againſt all
poſſibility of apoſtaſie? If Diſcourſe of this
nature doth not affect a man beyond all other, it
muſt be becauſe either he hath not the ſenſe of a
man, or not the faith of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſe men ſhould take a Subject ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
lower, and confer together about the
Providence of God that governs the preſent
World. What a beautiful thing is it to obſerve
all the variety of ſecond cauſes to move in a juſt
order under the firſt, toward certain and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ends, the Glory of God and good of men!
And that though the Divine Wiſdom may loſe
and confound us in that admirable maze it
ſeems to make, yet there is nothing defective
or redundant in the whole World, no room
for Chance, nothing unforeſeen, no croſs acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that hinder; the projection, the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
is all along carried on, and at laſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100726:41"/>
attained: But eſpecially if we confine
our Contemplations of Divine Providence to
that more peculiar Object of it, his Church, it
will become yet more viſible and more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
where if we wiſely confer times paſt with
the preſent, and view the whole proceſs, we
ſhall find that even Schiſms, Hereſies, Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and the greateſt calamities of the Church
tend to its advantage in Concluſion. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, that which comes neareſt to a man,
and muſt needs affect him moſt in the affair
of Providence, is that thereby he finds himſelf
under the protection of a mighty Being, that
nothing befalls him without the conſent of his
Great Patron, that he is not left to himſelf to
ſcuffle with ill Fortune and ſecond Cauſes as well
as he can; but he is the charge of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Favourite of Heaven: This certainly is
highly pleaſant and ſatisfactory above any thing
in this World.</p>
               <p>Or if we go lower yet, and make the Subject
of our Diſcourſe to be about Peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence,
of the bravery of a Victory over a man's
paſſions or temptations, of the unſpeakable
comfort and ſatisfaction in doing good; any of
theſe will afford us an entertainment beyond the
flavor of Wine, or the odd variety of Chance in
a Game, and indeed (to ſpeak to the Point) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other Subjects of Diſcourſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
And although it be true that there
is none of theſe but a man may contemplate with
great ſatisfaction by himſelf alone, and in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
yet as all ſocial Exerciſes of the Body are
more refreſhing than thoſe that are ſolitary, ſo
it is here, the comfort that reſults from theſe
Contemplations is doubled and multiplied by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100726:42"/>
reflection in friendly Conferences. And all
this together ſhall be my firſt Argument by
which I recommend Diſcourſe of Religion;
what think you of this, <hi>Philander?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I think very well of it: But, I pray
you, let me hear out the whole Cauſe, and then
I'll give my Anſwer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Why, then my ſecond Plea for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Diſcourſe, is from the conſideration that
it is far the moſt ſafe, prudent and inoffenſive
matter of Communication, and that in ſeveral
reſpects:<note place="margin">Religious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> In the firſt place it
kindles no Coals, ſtirs up no
ſtrife, inflames no Bodies choler,
and touches upon no mans inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
or reputation. You cannot talk of your
ſelf without vanity or envy; you can hardly talk
of your Neighbours without ſome ſuſpicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;
nor of thoſe that are fartheſt off, but
we are in danger that ſome Body preſent may be
concerned for them, as being of their Family or
Acquaintance: It is very difficult to talk of
News, but you will make your ſelf of ſome
Party or other, and of Opinions without giving
offence where you did not intend it; and you
can ſcarcely ſpeak of your Governours and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
ſo as to avoid all imputation either of
flattery or pragmaticalneſs. But here you may
talk ſecurely, and have this aſſurance, That if
you profit no Body, you ſhall hurt no Body; if
you do not benefit others, you ſhall not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
your ſelf. And then in the ſecond place,
and in conſequence of the former, this kind of
Diſcourſe will invite no Eves-Droppers to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
and carry Tales of what paſſed amongſt
Friends in their Families and Privacies. For
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100726:42"/>
although there be hardly any place ſo inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nor any retirement ſo ſacred and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as to be a ſufficient ſanctuary againſt this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent
ſort of Vermin; yet beſides that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion afford them the leaſt hold or
handle, the diſcourſing gravely of it is the
moſt effectual charm in the World to lay
them, ſo that they ſhall either not be able, or
not be willing to miſreport you. To which
add in the third place, That this Courſe is one
of the moſt effectual and unexceptionable ways
of ridding our ſelves of the Company of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
people, which I reckon no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of this kind of Converſation. For
this grave and ſerious way will certainly either
make them better, or make them weary of our
Company; that is, we ſhall either gain them,
or gain our time from them; the leaſt of which
two is very deſirable, and this is the effect of
my ſecond Plea for pious Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I will trouble you but with one more, and
that is from the Gentileneſs of
this way of Converſation;<note place="margin">Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</note> it is
the moſt humane, civil and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
way of treating men, and
therefore moſt becoming a Gentleman. We
account it ſome degree of rudeneſs to talk
French or Latine, or any other Language,
which the Company in which we are do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand;
for it looks as if we were either jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of them, and therefore would not have
them know what we ſay to others; or elſe it is
as if we had a mind to upbraid their ignorance
who cannot correſpond with us in ſuch a tongue.
And methinks as it is uſually accounted a Piece
of Pedantry, and an Argument of defect of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100726:43"/>
education, for a Student to quote his
Authors, to talk in Scholaſtick Phraſe, and to
vent his Metaphyſical Notions in the Company
of Gentlemen; ſo neither is it very decorous
and civil on the other ſide to be talking altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the peculiar Phraſe of Faulconry and
Hunting in the Company of a Student: and it
favours either of great defect (of other matter
of Diſcourſe) in our ſelves, or of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and inſolence towards thoſe others ſo
treated. The Law of Civility is, to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and condeſcending, to give fair play and
ſcope to all we converſe with: Now nothing
doth this like to religious Diſcourſe, foraſmuch
as this being every man's Calling and Concern,
there is no man but is or ought to be preſumed
to be in ſome meaſure skilful at it. When we
talk of that we talk ſo as we may all talk, we
parly of that which every man's profeſſion and
intereſt obliges him to conſider, and which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man's Conſcience admoniſhes him of, and
we ſpeak in the true univerſal Dialect which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man underſtands.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall be my whole Apology at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
for religious Conference: I could ſay ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things more in the Caſe, but I will do like a
wary Advocate, and reſerve them to reply to
your Objections. And now, Dear <hi>Phil,</hi> what
think you upon the whole matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay, or what can I ſay,
but that a good Cauſe hath happened upon a
good Advocate, a Cauſe able to make an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
man eloquent, and Eloquence able to make
a very indifferent Cauſe paſſable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Thank you for nothing, <hi>Phil.</hi> Do
you think I will be put off with a ſtale Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100726:43"/>
I have, I think, demonſtrated that
religious Diſcourſe is both the moſt manly and
rational, the moſt pleaſant and comfortable,
the moſt prudent and wary, and to all this the
moſt gentile and obliging. Deal now like a
Friend and a Gentleman with me; tell me
what flaws you have obſerved in my reaſoning,
or what Objections you have to what I have
ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>To deal plainly and faithfully with you,
and my ſelf too, I think your Reaſons are unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable;
and I have nothing to object, but to
what you ſaid in the laſt place about the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileneſs
of this way of Converſation: and that
is only this, Methinks you talk in this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as if you came out of a Cloyſter, or rather
out of another World; for your Diſcourſe is
not calculated for the Age we live in: Alas! the
World is not at the paſs you ſuppoſe, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with Books, which fill you with fine Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
but had you read men as much as I have
done, you would find, as I ſaid before, that it
would be a very difficult thing to get any body
to keep you Company at that rate, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the Arguments you have given or
can give for it. You have read (and ſo have I)
of one <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that came to our Saviour on
purpoſe to confer with him on the buſineſs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
World; but it is obſerved he came by
Night, as if he was aſhamed of his enterprize;
and beſides, his Name is upon this occaſion (for
ought I know) become a by-word and name of
reproach to this day. And we have heard of
ſome other perſons who in great agonies of mind
have been inquiſitive into thoſe affairs, and made
Religion the principal Theme of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100726:44"/>
But then was then, and now is now;
thoſe men would now be ſuſpected as not well in
their wits that affected ſo antick a Garb: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that even Divines themſelves, who for the
honour of their Profeſſion, and upon account
of the nature of their Office and Studies, may
better be allowed to entertain ſuch Diſcourſes;
yet (whether it be out of modeſty, or deference
to the humour of the Age) it is eaſily obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that they generally decline the way you
recommend, and maintain Converſation at the
rate of other men. Judge you therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at this time of Day if a man in health ſhould
talk ſo, he would not be counted an Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal
Perſon; or eſpecially if a Gentleman
ſhould uſe it, he would not be wondred at as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
and unfaſhionable.</p>
               <p>Nay, that is not the worſt of the Caſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:<note place="margin">About Prophane Diſcourſe.</note>
For the now modiſh way
of treating Religion (if by
chance it come in the way) is
either to find ſlaws in it, and by Sceptical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms
to undermine the very foundations of
it, or elſe by Drollery to burleſque and render
it ridiculous. To talk malapertly and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
againſt it, and now and then to break a
Jeſt upon God Almighty, is an Argument of
wit; but to ſpeak gravely and reverently, is dull
and tedious beyond meaſure, the ſure ſign of a
formal Fop or a Phanatick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>God forbid! Though I know you
underſtand the World better than I do, becauſe
(as you wittily upbraided me) my Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is moſt with the dead; yet I am in good hope
you are now miſtaken, and that the ſtate of the
Living is not ſo prodigiouſly bad as you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100726:44"/>
it. I know there are a ſort of Tap-inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Debauchees (whoſe wit is broached with
the Hogſhead, and runs on tilt with it) that
love to put tricks upon every man and every
thing that is graver and wiſer than themſelves;
nor do I ſo much wonder at it (conſidering the
men) foraſmuch as if Religion be true they muſt
expect to be damned; and if it obtain its juſt
veneration they muſt expect to be the ſcorn of
mankind. It is not ſtrange therefore if they
(conſulting their own intereſt) either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it or blaſpheme it, that they may have
their revenge upon it before hand. But take
courage, <hi>Philander,</hi> for theſe mens tongue is no
ſlander, neither upon due conſideration is there
more of wit than of Vertue in their Ribbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</p>
               <p>As for the more cunning part of them, who
will needs be ſceptical, and think to give proof
that they have more wit than other men, only
becauſe they have leſs faith and modeſty; who
knows not how eaſie a thing it is to carp and
make Objections? and that a triffling captious
Coxcomb can ask more Queſtions than a Wiſe
man can anſwer? As any man may pull down fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
than another can build up. It is one ſign of
a good judgment to be able to ask a diſcreet and
pertinent Queſtion, and another to diſcern what
ſatisfaction is fit to be expected; and then in
the third place there is ſuch a Vertue as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
to ſit down and reſt ſatisfied with ſuch an
Anſwer as the nature of the thing will admit of,
all which thoſe captious Hypercriticks are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of.</p>
               <p>And then for the prophane Droll, every
man of ſenſe and good manners knows, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100726:45"/>
Wit without Bounds is the very definition of
ſcurrility, and that it is an eaſie
thing to pleaſe a man's ſelf in the
one if he have no regard to the
other,<note place="margin">Of Drollery.</note> but will let fly at every thing that comes
in his way. For my part, I look upon it as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
whit as great an inſtance of dullneſs, as of
impiety, to need ſo large a ſcope for wit as theſe
men allow themſelves. A good and true
Wit will find matter enough within the Bounds
of ſobriety, and not think himſelf ſtraitned
though he ſpare God and Religion. The men
therefore you ſpeak of are like blind <hi>Bayard,</hi>
bold and dull; and if they now and then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
upon ſomething more than ordinary, who
knows but the Devil may help them to it, who
is always very ready to aſſiſt in this Caſe?</p>
               <p>Therefore, my good Friend, ſetting both
theſe kinds of men aſide, who are not the Copy
but the very ſcandal of the Age they live in;
let us conſider impartially what elſe there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to diſcourage ſuch a way of converſing as we
are upon. I have made it plain already, that
all the reaſon in the World is for it; and it is
as certain that there are no Laws againſt it, nor
doth Authority ſo much as diſcountenance it in
the leaſt. Beſides, there is, I am confident, as quick
a ſenſe of Vertue and piety in the preſent times,
as in the beſt times of our Forefathers. And if
there be ſome lewd and profligate men againſt
it; yet there are others, and thoſe of the beſt
Quality, who think it ſo far from unbecoming
their Rank, that nothing is more ſavoury and
acceptable to them than pious Diſcourſe. And
ſome of theſe, as I am informed, meet at one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
Houſes uſually every Week, or as often
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100726:45"/>
as their occaſions permit, and there whilſt they
walk in the Garden or ſit together by the fire
(according as the Weather invites them) they
make it their buſineſs to reinforce upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
minds the great Principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to affect their hearts mutually with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of them. And when this is done
(they ſay) they return home as much raiſed in
their Spirits, and cheered in their very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,
as the moſt jolly Good Fellows do
from their merry aſſignations.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>This is a pretty piece of News you tell
me: But I pray you (by the way) do you know
any of theſe men well? Are they not Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticlers?
I tell you plainly I ſuſpect this practice
looks aſquint that way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>No; very far from it I aſſure you.
Thoſe I know of them are perſons moſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Laws of their Countrey, conſtant
and devout Frequenters of their Pariſh-Church,
true Friends of the Clergy, zealouſly affected
towards the Common-Prayers and all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Liturgy, and do as much abominate
and diſcountenance every Inſtance of that facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gadding, Goſſipping pretence of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
as any ſort of men whatſoever do or
ought to do; but having a quick ſenſe of
piety and a great concern upon them for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
World, they endeavour by the aforeſaid
means to preſerve and improve this temper in
themſelves, and to propagate it to others; and
this they do the more ſecurely, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by no Law; and the more innocently,
as condemning none of thoſe that do not imitate
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:100726:46"/>
But I do not mention this particular Club of
perſons with intention to make them a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for all others; for beſides that their cuſtom
is only voluntarily taken up, and upon no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of any neceſſary obligation upon
them ſo to do, for then it would be a great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon the Conſciences of men: there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſeveral inconveniences not unlikely to attend
the practice, if not prudently managed, which
I need not name; that therefore which I aimed
at in the mention of theſe mens uſage was (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other proofs) to ſhew that the World
was not ſo abandoned of true zeal and piety as
you ſuggeſted, that prophane Diſcourſe hath
not ſo univerſally obtained, nor that godly
Conference was ſo antiquated and exploded;
but that a Gentleman might ſtill adventure to be
found at it, without impeachment of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or dignity.</p>
               <p>And moreover, I humbly conceive, that
by how much the more there is of truth in
your obſervation, by ſo much the more are
all ſerious and ſenſible men bound to put to
their endeavours to turn the ſtream of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
from froth and folly, to this great
and important Concern. For if this be out of
faſhion, the more is the ſhame; and it is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pities but that we ſhould ſtrive to bring it
into faſhion, if it were but to run down that
prophane humour you ſpeak of. And eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to repair the diſhonour done to the Divine
Majeſty by thoſe ſcurrilous Libertines, who with
equal madneſs and folly let their tongues run
riot againſt him.</p>
               <p>What I ſhall we be mealy-mouth'd in a Good
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100726:46"/>
Cauſe, when they are impudent in a bad one?
Shall we be aſhamed to owne God, when they
defie him? Is God ſo inconſiderable a Being,
that we dare not ſtand by him? Are piety and
Vertue things to be bluſhed at?<note place="margin">More Arguments for religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note>
Is eternal ſalvation become ſo
trivial a thing, that we ſhould
be unconcerned about it? Do we
yield the Cauſe to theſe half-witted Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates?
Do we acknowledge the Goſpel to be
indeed ridiculous, or do we confeſs our ſelves
the verieſt Cowards in the World, and judge
our ſelves unworthy of eternal life? For ſhame
let us be ſo far from being either cow'd or by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs'd
by ſuch examples, that we reſolve to make
better where we cannot find them? Why ſhould
we think ſo meanly of our ſelves, as to follow
only, and not to lead? In a word, Why may
not we begin a good faſhion, rather than fall in
with a bad one?</p>
               <p>Beſides, I perſwade my ſelf this will be no
very hard thing to do if we conſider the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Majeſty of ſincere and generous
piety, and the guilt and baſe ſpiritedneſs of
Vice and prophaneneſs; if we be ſoft and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that grows rampant and intolerable; but
if Vertue ſhine out in its own rays, it dazzles
and baffles all thoſe Birds of Night. If men
will be perſwaded to aſſert their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
manfully, to talk of God worthily and
couragiouſly, the verieſt Ruſſians will preſently
be gagged and tongue-tyed, as in Conjurations
(they ſay) name but God, and the Devil vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
ſo enter reſolutely into pious Conference,
and it will preſently lay all the Oaths and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100726:47"/>
and ſcurrilous talk of thoſe deſperate
Wretches.</p>
               <p>And (by the way) this is the moſt gentile
and alſo the moſt effectual way of reproving
that kind of perſons, namely, to deal with
them as Scholars deal by one another, when any
one ſpeaks falſe Latine, they only repeat it after
him in true Latine, and as it ought to be; ſo
here let us ſpeak right things of God when they
ſpeak amiſs, and there needs no more to damp
them; they will either turn on your ſide and
ſpeak as you do, or leave the Field to you.</p>
               <p>This, this, <hi>Philander,</hi> therefore is the only
way to mend the World, and without this it
will hardly ever be done. It is not good Books
and Preaching that will retund a prophane hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
for ſuch perſons will either not read and
hear them, or not conſider them; nor is it
Prayer and Faſting too that will caſt out this
deaf (but not dumb) Devil. But when good
men are as bold as evil men are impudent, I
mean as openly good as the other are bad, when
piety is daring, and (if you will pardon the
expreſſion) Hectors lewdneſs out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
then, I ſay, the World will, if not
grow devout, yet at leaſt grow modeſt and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
towards Religion, when vertuous men give
evidence that they believe themſelves, when
they demonſtrate that the Kingdom of God is
not in word only, but in power; when their
Principles and pretenſions appear in their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
their Diſcourſes, their whole Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
when they continually breathe of
God and of Heaven.</p>
               <p>And (to ſay no more) by this courſe alſo a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100726:47"/>
man ſhall gain a worthy reputation and eſteem
to himſelf; for whereas a baſhful, puſilanimous
complying humour, that will crouch to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
for fear of offence, and faulter and mince
the matter of prophaneneſs to curry favour
with lewd men, ſhall be deſpiſed and trodden
down by every body. A brave generous Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of his Principles, and of God's honour,
that fills the place and Company where he is
with the ſweet odours of piety and devotion,
procures himſelf a veneration where-ever he
goes, he looks like <hi>Moſes</hi> when he came out of
the Mount, his face ſhines and all men ſee a
glory about him; inſomuch that thoſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find in their hearts to imitate him, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuſe but reverence and admire him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I think your mind is an inexhauſtible
Fountain of Arguments on this Subject. Every
occaſion affords you a freſh tide of Eloquence;
either you have very much ſtudied this Point,
or it is wonderfully pregnant of its own proofs:
For my own part I cannot bear up againſt you.
I confeſs I thought when we firſt entred on this
Particular, it was impoſſible that I ſhould ever
be of your opinion therein; but now I am ſo
far from having any thing material to object,
that I proteſt I am clearly ſatisfied that it would
be a very wiſe thing, and well worthy of our
endeavours to bring it into uſe and practice: I
mean, as much as poſſibly we can to exclude i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Tales and Drollery out of our Converſe, or
at leaſt to confine them to a narrower compaſs,
and ſo to make way for this great affair of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>But yet let me tell you, though you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100726:48"/>
me you have not ſilenced others; there
are thoſe will elude the Arguments they cannot
anſwer, and expoſe what they are reſolved not
to comply withal: They will ſay, This talking
of Religion is a Mountebank trick to impoſe
upon the people, that it is a deſign of vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or an artifice to ſeem better than we are:
They will tell you that ſincerely good men uſe
to be modeſt and ſilent, and to enjoy their ſenſe
of piety in ſecret. In ſhort, when you have
ſaid all you can to recommend this way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
they will ſay it is no better than Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſm
or Phanaticiſm; and having affixed
ſuch a name upon it, they will run both you and
it down preſently.</p>

               <p>Hearty thanks, Dear <hi>Phil,</hi> for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me in mind of that danger which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
I ſhould not have been aware of. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
I am ſo far unskilled in the World,
that I was apt to think it was ſufficient to a
Cauſe to be back'd with good Proofs, and that
when a buſineſs had recommended it ſelf to the
reaſon and conſcience of men the work was
done. I little thought men muſt be wheedled
into a compliance with their own judgments,
and much leſs that they would be ſo diſingenuous
towards themſelves as to put a cheat upon their
own ſenſes; nor did I ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider the power of Names
to make good evil,<note place="margin">Godly Diſcourſe not Phanatical, nor the Badge of any Sect.</note> and evil good,
and that the beſt thing in the
World may be run down by the
mere blaſt of an odious Nick-name: Lord!
what a venemous breath hath Common Fame,
that it can change the nature of things? What
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100726:48"/>
an huge Leviathan is vulgar Opinion, that it
ſhould be able to oppoſe it ſelf to the beſt reaſon
of Mankind, and to God Almighty too? If
this be ſo, who would exerciſe their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or dare to propound any generous thing to
the World, and not rather ſet himſelf adrift
to run with the Tide.</p>
               <p>But yet this comforts me, that it looks like a
Confeſſion of the inſuperable ſtrength of my
Arguments, when men reſort to ſuch ſubterfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
It is a ſign they dare not encounter me on
the Square, that uſe ſuch foul play, and that
men are deſtitute of reaſon when they betake
themſelves to libels and reproaches.</p>
               <p>Let us then reſume a little courage, it may be
we ſhall conquer at laſt becauſe our Adverſaries
deſpair of an honourable Victory. That which
I contend for (you know) is this, That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
men to take all fit and fair occaſions to
ſpeak worthily of God, and to make advantage
of friendly converſation towards the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one another in morals, as well as in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or any other Concerns, and can any one be
ſo abſurdly malicious as to call this Phanaticiſm?
Doth that deſerve the odious Name of a Party
which is the great and univerſal Concern of all
Mankind? Is that to be accounted the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<hi>Shibboleth</hi> of a Sect which ſpeaks a Good
Man and a Chriſtian? Is that to be made a mark
of infamy which the beſt men in the World
wear as a Badge of Honour? Are we minded
that this word Phanaticiſm ſhould have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of an Oſtraciſm, and put a diſgrace upon
men for being too good.</p>
               <p>If men in their Intercourſes and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100726:49"/>
deliberated about ſetting forth of ſome
new God, or at leaſt of ſome new Religion,
there were juſt Cauſe of ſuch an odious imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but to take opportunity to ſpeak of the true
God, and the old Religion gravely and piouſly,
it cannot be that this ſhould be Pruitaniſm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be ſo to be in earneſt in Religion, which
God forbid. Sure it is not the Character of any
mere Sect amongſt us to love God; and if it be
not, then neither can it be ſo to talk of him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately,
ſince the latter is the eaſie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
iſſue and expreſſion of the former. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
I remember, called his tongue his glory;
and is that alone of all the powers of Soul
and Body exempted from any part in doing
honour to the Creator?</p>
               <p>Are all men Puritans when they are ſick or
upon their Death-Beds? And yet then there are
very few are ſo modiſh as to wave the talk of
Religion, or to talk lightly and drollingly of
it. Either therefore all dying men are Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or elſe they teach us then what we ought to
practiſe at other times, if we be not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
careleſs and deſperate.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe that are really Phanatick, and
are continually canting in a loathſom manner of
Religion, thoſe Parrots, that talk without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſenſe or apprehenſion of what they ſay, or
thoſe Ricketty Phariſees, that are all head and
ears and tongue, but feeble in their hands and
feet, that talk but do nothing; let theſe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Puritans or Phanaticks, or what men pleaſe:
But let no diſhonour be reflected upon thoſe that
underſtand and believe what they ſay, and live
up to what they believe and profeſs. For
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100726:49"/>
though it may pleaſe thoſe who have a mind
to put a ſlur upon this inſtance of real piety
which I am vindicating, to confound it with
that other hypocritical guiſe of it, which I have
now condemned, that ſo they may expoſe it to
contempt and diſhonour; yet as it is certain
theſe two are as different things as Senſe and
Non-ſenſe, or as Life and Varniſh, ſo (impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
men being Judges) that very Paint and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry
bears evidence of the excellency of that
Sincerity which I am recommending. For
you know men do not uſe to counterfeit that
which is of no value, painted beauty is a great
Argument of the deſireableneſs of that which is
true and native; ſo there is certainly a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
admiration of holy Diſcourſe, and a great
power and charm in it, otherwiſe it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſo artificially pretended to by ſuch men,
nor eſpecially be ſufficient to give countenance
(as we find it doth) to their ſiniſter purpoſes
and deſigns: the World, I ſay, would not be
ſo ſottiſh as to be impoſed upon by religious
Cant, nor deſigning Hypocrites be ſo ſilly as to
go about to abuſe the World this way, if it were
not an acknowledged Caſe that there is a real
worth in that which they endeavour apiſhly to
imitate. So that the Objections againſt us are
unanſwerable Arguments for us, and we have
great aſſurance we ſhall carry our Cauſe when
our very reproaches turn to our honour.</p>
               <p>But what if after all this,<note place="margin">Godly Conference an effectual way to ſupplant Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm.</note> 
                  <hi>Phil,</hi>
I ſhould take the boldneſs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
that ſuch holy intercourſe
as I am ſpeaking of, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
under thoſe Conditions and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100726:50"/>
Qualifications I have put upon it, is ſo far from
Phanaticiſm or Puritaniſm, or any Sectarian <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
that on the contrary (if the practice of
it became general amongſt good men) it would
be the moſt effectual way in the World to daſh
thoſe formal diſguiſes out of Countenance, and
to put all Phanatical tricks out of all requeſt and
reputation. This, I believe, will ſeem a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox
to you at firſt; but I am very confident
you will be of my mind when you have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
That the only, or at leaſt the principal
thing which that ſort of men ſupport themſelves
by is the Gift of tongue, a peculiar knack of
talking religiouſly: For if you look into their
lives and temper, they have no advantage of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men; and if you examine either their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
or their abilities, theſe will not mend the
matter: and yet they have ſtrange authority
and influence in the World; they charm men
into ſecurity of their honeſty by their talk, they
caſt a miſt before mens eyes that they are taken
for godly men, let their pride and paſſion, their
covetouſneſs and ambition, be otherwiſe as pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
and notorious as they can. This Talent
of talking is ſo valuable, it redeems them from
ſuſpicion, with this Paſſ-Port they go undetect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they are Saints from the teeth outwards,
and Fools admire them, and ſo they compaſs
their ends.</p>
               <p>Now were all ſincerely good men ſo ſenſible
of this as they ought to be, and would they in
earneſt apply themſelves to grave and ſerious
and pious Diſcourſe in the habit of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
theſe Jack-Daws would be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of their borrowed Feathers, and thoſe craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100726:50"/>
men would not have a Mask or Vizard left
them to cheat the World withal.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, perhaps they would out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoot
thoſe good men in their own Bow, and
talk at an higher rate in hypocriſie than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could do in ſincerity. But for anſwer: Do
but conſider whether there be not a greater
power in Life than in mere ſhew and pageantry,
whether that which proceeds from the thoughts
and heart and Principles within be not likely to
have more vigour and ſpirit than that which
hath no root, no foundation; but is begotten
and lives and dyes between the tongue and teeth.
Do not you obſerve that nothing ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parages
a Picture as the preſence of him for
whom it was drawn? Life hath a thouſand vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours
and beauties which no hand of the Painter
can reach and diſplay. So hath ſpiritual Life,
when it puts forth it ſelf, a ſpirit, a warmth,
an air, or whatſoever you will call it, which
cannot be ſo imitated, but it will ſhame and
detect the Rival. The great miſchief of the
World therefore, and the only ſecurity of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
is, that the Truth and Life diſappears,
and gives its Counterfeit the Stage intirely to
act upon; but let that appear and confront its
Adverſary, and Hypocriſie will be ſenſible of an
unequal match, and bluſh or withdraw it ſelf.
When, I ſay, men that feel the power of Religion
in their own ſouls will be perſwaded to expreſs
themſelves habitually, manly and judiciouſly, they
will baffle and confound all theatrical Pretenders
to Religion. And now, <hi>Phil,</hi> what is become of
that formidable Objection, as you and I thought
it at firſt? May not we now adventure to talk of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100726:51"/>
Religion without the danger of Phanaticiſm?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I ſee clearly we may; and not
only ſo, but you have now convinced me that
for that very reaſon we ought to do it, as the
beſt way to ſupplant Phanaticiſm. But at the
worſt, if there were ſome danger that I ſhould
incur the raſh cenſure of ſome that I value, and
were likely to be called Phanatick for my pains,
I would not ſtick to ſerve ſo many great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ends at that hazard, if I could.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Bravely reſolved, my good Friend!
now you ſpeak like a man and a Chriſtian;
there's the very Point of Vertue: He that is
too tender and delicate hath not the courage to
be good, and he that will venture nothing here
will win nothing in the other World. You
know my ſenſe already, that good nature is an
excellent and uſeful Companion of Vertue; but
as the Caſe may happen, a little moroſity is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to preſerve them both; But, I pray you,
why did you put an <hi>if</hi> at the laſt? after all do
you queſtion whether it be poſſible to diſcourſe
piouſly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>No, good <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> that is not it;
for you have convinced me of the fecibleneſs, as
well as the excellency of that kind of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
but you know (as I have ſaid before)
that is out of the road of Diſcourſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the difficulty of bringing thoſe one conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
with to it, it is natural for a man to follow
his old Biaſs: If I were once entered into ſuch a
Communication, I am ſure I ſhould embrace it,
and I think I could continue it. But there is a
ſheepiſh kind of modeſty in this (as well as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things) that checks and reſtrains a man
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100726:51"/>
from beginning that which neither he nor his
Companions have been uſed to. If therefore
you can help me to conquer my ſelf as well as to
anſwer Objections, to overcome my temper as
well as to ſubmit my judgment, I would then ſet
about it as well as I could.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart; only with this
Condition, as well as I can (as you ſay) But I
pray give me leave to ask you a Queſtion by
the bye, and not to decline that which you have
put to me; the Caſe is this, It is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that good men find ſuch a modeſty (as
you ſpeak of) to reſtrain them when they are
ſetting themſelves to begin ſome good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
inſomuch that ſometimes with very
great difficulty (if at all) they can ſcrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to it; but contrariwiſe, lewd and
prophane men rant and Hector at an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rate, they will blaſpheme and burleſque
Religion when they are in their humour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard to God and man: now ſeeing the
former have all the reaſon in the World on
their ſide, and the other as much againſt them,
what is it that makes this difference in their
ſpirit and temper?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>That I may come the ſooner at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of my own difficulty, I will anſwer your
Queſtion as briefly as I can; and I think it may
be reſolved into theſe ſeveral
Cauſes,<note place="margin">what makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men ſo bold in their aſſaults upon Religion.</note> firſt, Prophane men are
generally very groſly ignorant;
for I cannot imagine that any
thing elſe ſhould make them
bold with God Almighty. And though they
pretend to wit, yet a man to their own tooth
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100726:52"/>
hath told us, That a certain Doſe of that thing
called Wit is a neceſſary ingredient into the
Compoſition of a very ridiculous Fool. And I
have heard it hath been ſaid by a better man than
he, That a ſmattering in knowledge (which is
the meaſure of a Wit) diſpoſes men to Atheiſm,
whereas a full proportion would carry them
through to the ſenſe of God and Religion.
The ſecond Cauſe I aſſign is, That theſe men
having abandoned Vertue, they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
loſt all good nature and civil reſpect;
and are delivered up to inſolence and an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
humour. And thirdly, I make no great
doubt but the Devil, whoſe work they do, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
them in it. And now you will eaſily think
there needs no other concurrence; yet I will add
another, and that is Drunkenneſs: for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it ſhould be out of the power of the
Devil himſelf to tempt a ſober man to ſuch a
villainy; but in the rage of Drink God is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and every thing that is ſacred. But now to
my Queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Phil,</hi> let me kiſs your hands for
your ingenious Anſwer to my Query: and then
in the ſecond place, I wiſh I could anſwer yours
as well. The plain truth is (as I have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to you before) I have been in that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and therefore cannot wonder to find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man there; and though I cannot always
conquer my baſhfulneſs, yet in ſuch Caſes I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
endeavour it, and I will tell you by what
methods, and ſo I hope the ſame remedies may
relieve us both.</p>
               <p>Firſt then when I enter into Company with
deſign to engage them in good Diſcourſe, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100726:52"/>
if it be poſſible, to make ſome Friend
privy to my Plot, who perhaps ſhall ſit at ſome
diſtance from me, but underſtanding his Cue
ſhall be always ready to ſecond me in what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake;
and ſo by an honeſt Conſederacy we
can carry on the buſineſs. And this I do eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if I apprehend the Company to conſiſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of prophane perſons or captious Witts.
For if a modeſt man ſhould in ſuch a Caſe begin
an unuſual Diſcourſe, and have no body to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, he will not only miſcarry of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but be abaſhed and confounded. But if
he have one prepared to comply with him, they
ſhall both have time to recollect themſelves,
and to carry the Ball of Diſcourſe whither
they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>when</hi> I am deſtitute of
the aſſiſtance of ſuch an Aſſociate to ſecond
and relieve me, then if I apprehend I have
an opportunity of diſcourſing uſefully, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to begin whatever come of it, that is, I
forcibly break ſilence,<note place="margin">Means to raiſe our Spirits to a fit temper for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> though it
be with trembling and paleneſs
and faultering and without any
well contrived expreſſions: And
when once the Ice is broken the
worſt is paſt, then preſently my
colour and ſpeech and ſpirits will return again.
For to proceed is very eaſie then, becauſe, as I
have noted before, the Objects of Religion lye
ſo ready to a mans thoughts that he cannot be at
a loſs in the Sequel of his Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In order hereto I endeavour to raiſe in my
own heart a great zeal of God's Glory, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
deſign of doing good to thoſe I converſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100726:53"/>
with. And therefore I think with my ſelf I am not
only to ſtand upon my guard and ſecure my ſelf
from infection, nor much leſs to be a mere
Negative, and content my ſelf to do no
hurt to my Acquaintance, but that it is expected
from me I ſhould benefit them, and ſeaſon
their intercourſe with ſomething vertuous and
graceful.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I endeavour in the whole Conduct
of my ſelf, and the habit of my life, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at a ſeriouſneſs of ſpirit and a deepneſs of
thought, without which neither ſhall I be in
temper to begin or carry on any ſuch weighty
Diſcourſe with others, nor will they expect it
from me; a light trifling jeſting Spirit is good
for nothing but ſport and may-game. Such as
can ordinarily find in their hearts to ſtep aſide
to a quibble or a clinch, are generally men ſo
unfit for Religion, that they are ſeldom uſeful
to themſelves in any ſecular buſineſs: But a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
man hath his thoughts about him, and his
very mien and countenance raiſes the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Company, and ſo they are half pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to receive his impreſſions. Now to bring
my ſelf to this temper, I often repreſent to my
ſelf God's Omnipreſence, and that I am before
a mighty, wiſe and moſt reverend Majeſty, who
takes notice of all my carriage and demeanour.
I think frequently of the Judgment to come,
and the wonderful accuracy and folemnity of
it, of the unſpeakable concerns of Hell and
Heaven, and the whole affair of another
World. By theſe Conſiderations I curb the
levity and wantonneſs of my ſpirit, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
both furniſhed with fit thoughts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100726:53"/>
and alſo with a proper temper to
communicate them.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, I make it my earneſt endeavour
to be as much above the World as I can, I mean
to have as indifferent an eſteem of Riches and
Fame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is poſſible, that my heart may
not eagerly and intently run upon them: For
I find by woful experience, that whenſoever it
warps that way, I am ſure to be liſtleſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
in any ſuch enterprize as we are ſpeaking of,
but whenſoever I can contemn them, then I am
as it were all ſpirit, and have ſo lively impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of another World upon me, that I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
make it viſible to my Companions.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all theſe I pray daily and earneſtly
for God's Grace and aſſiſtance, that he will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where be preſent to me by his Holy Spirit,
and put uſeful thoughts into my heart, and give
me courage to expreſs them, ſo as to beget the
like in others.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, is the method I take with my
ſelf; and having, I thank God, often ſucceeded
well with it againſt a Cowardly heart of my
own, I cannot but expect it will have greater
and more ſignal effects upon you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>God verifie the Omen. However, I
thank you moſt heartily for the Receipt, which
I will keep as long as I live.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>But I pray, Good <hi>Phil,</hi> do not make
it publick; for though I envy no Body the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of my experience, yet I would be loth the
World ſhould know what a ſhameful Difeaſe I
have been ſick of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir, timidity is but a natural infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and hath not much ſhame attending it: But
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100726:54"/>
I muſt tell you, as my Confeſſor or Phyſician,
which you will, of another Diſeaſe I labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſo ſhameful and ſcandalous, that ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Body will owne it; and that is ignorance, if
I had courage enough for the buſineſs (we have
all this while been ſpeaking of) yet I am afraid
by my unskilfulneſs I ſhall ſpoil all: let me
therefore pray you to afford me your advice in
this Caſe alſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Fear it not, <hi>Phil,</hi> a man of your cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
countenance, ſprightly vigour, and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of temper, can never labour under any ſuch
Diſeaſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Good <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> be not too ſecure of me;
for this is a buſineſs of that nature, that unleſs
it be done gracefully it had better be let alone,
and eſpecially becauſe the enterprize is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
new and unuſual; therefore the greater
dexterity and management is required, to give
it a good appearance at its ſetting out, and ſo
to lay a foundation for its coming into common
uſe and reputation: and beſides, it concerns you
in Point of your own credit to furniſh me out
well, for ſeeing it is you only that have put me
upon it, the diſhonour will redound to you, if
I miſcarry in the undertaking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>In earneſt, Sir, and without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
you are known to be a man of ſo good
Parts that you can never want Materials, and
then your ſweetneſs of addreſs will not fail to
give great advantage and acceptation to your
Diſcourſes. Now it is an hard thing, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you are pleaſed to think me wiſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I muſt ſhew my ſelf to be a Fool; but that's
a ſmall matter between Friends: therefore ſince
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100726:54"/>
you will have it ſo, I will tell you the effect of
my Obſervation in this matter.</p>
               <p>And the firſt thing to our purpoſe which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
is, the example of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
(and who can we better
learn of?<note place="margin">Prudential advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſerence.</note>) And he, I obſerve,
had a dexterity of applying eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
accidental occurrence to his holy purpoſes,
as it were by a kind of Chymiſtry ſeparating
the groſs matter, and ſubliming ordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to heavenly Doctrine: inſomuch, that
there was ſcarcely any common affair of Life,
ſuch as eating or drinking, or recreation, no
diſeaſe or infirmity of the Body, no Trade and
Occupation, ſuch as Merchandice or Husbandry,
no building or planting, plowing or ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nay not ſo mean employments as Womens
leavening their Bread, grinding at the Mill, or
ſweeping an Houſe, but he ſpiritualized them
and applied them to his deſigns.</p>
               <p>Now if we would learn of him, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to imitate this dexterity, we might with
great eaſe and without all violence ſurprize men
into Religion; and not only at every turn intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
pious Diſcourſe, but render the Subject of
it intelligible to the meaneſt capacities, and
withal by thoſe ſenſible reſemblances give ſuch
lively touches upon the minds of men, as that
what we delivered upon thoſe occaſions would
ſtick and remain with them.</p>
               <p>And there is no great pains or skill required
for the doing of this, the principal requiſite to
it is a zeal of God's Glory, and ſuch a conſtant
and fixed eye upon it as ſhall make us apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of the opportunities that preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100726:55"/>
and then a little humility to condeſcend
to the weakneſs of people; which two things
preſuppoſed, a very ſmall exerciſe of fancy
would draw the parallels, and make the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as any man will quickly find that will ſet
himſelf about it.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, when we viſit a ſick Friend
or Neighbour, what a fair opportunity have we
to diſcourſe of the Immortality of the Soul,
and what an eaſie tranſition is it from a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to a Saviour? Or why may we not as well
chear up our afflicted Friend with the comforts
of Religion, as well as amuze or divert him
with impertinent Stories? Or ſuppoſe Friends
be together, and diſpoſed to be merry, why
may not ſome word come in ſeaſonably of the
everlaſting friendſhips in Heaven, or of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Feaſt of a good Conſcience? Why may
not the common Chat about News be elevated
to the conſideration of the good tidings of the
Goſpel? What hinders but our Diſhes of Meat
may be ſeaſoned with a gracious word or two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Food of our Souls? When men are
talking of Old Age, it would be no great ſtrain
if thence our thoughts riſe up to Eternal Life.
Nor any great ſlight of phancy is requiſite to
improve all the accidents of our lives to the
contemplation of Divine Providence, which
orders and governs them. In a word, every
thing is capable of improvement if we be not
wanting; we ſhall never want opportunity if
we embrace it; any thing will ſerve an intent
mind and a devout heart to theſe purpoſes.</p>
               <p>My ſecond remark is, upon the Cuſtom of
thoſe ſeveral perſons in the Goſpel, that upon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100726:55"/>
divers occaſions entred into Conference with
our Saviour, which I note they always began by
way of Queſtion or Doubt, as men deſirous to
be informed rather than affecting to teach or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate.
This was not only the way of <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Joh.</hi> 3. of the Woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4.
and of the young rich man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. who
came in earneſt to be inſtructed; but of the
Scribes and Phariſees and Sadduces, who came
to diſpute: And indeed I have heard, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
way of propounding a Queſtion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
and replying to the Anſwer, was the
old way of Diſputation. And certainly this is
of great uſe in our Caſe, for the more eaſie and
acceptable introduction of the ſerious matters
of Religion into ordinary Converſation. When
we do not violently break in upon the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but civilly make our way; not abruptly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
our Sentiments, but inſinuate them; not
malapertly reprove other mens errours, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliouſly
dictate our own Opinions; not fall
upon Preaching, or throw down our Gantlet,
and challenge the Company to a Combate: but
modeſtly appear in the Garb of Learners, and
propound a Caſe, as to men wiſer than our
ſelves, for our own ſatisfaction. This courſe,
inſtead of offending, exceedingly obliges thoſe
we apply our ſelves to; foraſmuch as every man
is glad to be accounted wiſe and fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with.</p>
               <p>As ſuppoſe you ſhould ask the perſons you
are with what they think of ſuch or ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for the Immortality of the Soul, or for
the proof of a particular Providence; or ask
their advice how to anſwer ſuch an Objection
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100726:56"/>
that comes in your way againſt either of thoſe
or any other fundamental Point of Religion:
And though ſuch Queſtions may at firſt ſeem
merely ſpeculative; yet if they be purſued wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and with that intention, they will infallibly
lead to practice.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſe you put a Caſe about Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as namely, What are the Rules and
meaſures of ſobriety, ſo as alſo to avoid ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity;
How far is worldly care evil and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and how far innocent and allowable; What
is the predicament of careleſs and common
Swearing, and what kind of ſins it is reducible
to.</p>
               <p>Or more generally, How a man may diſcern
his own proſiciency in Vertue, and what prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of a man's ſelf is flatly neceſſary againſt
the uncertainty of Life, and to ſecure the great
ſtake of an intereſt in another World.</p>
               <p>Or, to name no more, What the Company
thinks of ſuch or ſuch a paſſage in a Sermon you
lately heard, or in ſuch a Book. Theſe and a
thouſand more ſuch eaſie inlets there are into
good Diſcourſe without imputation of pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalneſs,
and which a little preſence of mind
will improve to what purpoſes we deſire.</p>
               <p>Another thing that I have obſerved in order
to this affair is, what I have learned from the
Cuſtom of prudent men, to inſinuate that by a
Story which would not be ſo well received if it
were directly and bluntly delivered. Telling of
Stories, you know, is a common Theme of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and if a man have any graceful way
of telling them, and eſpecially uſe any pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the choice of them; he hath the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100726:56"/>
in his power, and may lead them to what
Diſcourſe he will: And beſides, men will admit
of that to be ſaid in the third perſon which they
will not bear in the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Now to this purpoſe ſuppoſe a man ſhould
have in readineſs a Story of ſome remarkable
judgment of God upon ſome notorious ſin, that
he would by all means deter thoſe he converſes
with from, no body could take offence at the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and yet every mans Conſcience would make
application of it. Or ſuppoſe a man ſhould in
lively Colours deſcribe ſome excellent perſon, he
would not only put all the Hearers into the
thoughts of thoſe Vertues that were ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
but ſtir up jointly a modeſt ſhame in them
for their own ſhortneſs, and an emulation of ſo
brave an example. But to be ſure he ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
give himſelf an introduction (without affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
of diſcourſing of which ſoever of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Vertues he pleaſes. Theſe and many ſuch
other ways there are which your own prudence
and Obſervation will repreſent to you better
than I can; by which a diſcreet perſon may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
any Company (in which it is ſit for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man to be found) in good Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>But I will not omit upon this occaſion to tell
you a Story, which I have from very good hands,
of two very eminent men, both for Learning
and Piety, in the laſt Age (or rather the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the preſent) the one of them a great
Prelate (indeed a Primate) and the other a
Church-man of great note and preferment.
Theſe two Great Men, as they often met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to conſult the intereſt of Learning, and
the affairs of the Church, ſo when they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100726:57"/>
that, they ſeldom parted from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without ſuch an encounter as this: Come,
Good Doctor, (ſaith the Biſhop) let us now
talk a little of Jeſus Chriſt; Or, on the other
ſide, ſaid the Doctor, Come, my Lord, let me
hear your Grace ſpeak of the goodneſs of God
with your wonted Piety and Eloquence, let us
warm one anothers hearts with Heaven, that
we may the better bear this cold World. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell you the words that paſſed between them,
nor can you expect it from me; but I am ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
aſſured of the matter of fact. And this
they performed with that holy reverence and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
zeal, with that delightful ſenſe and feeling,
that afforded matter of admiration to thoſe of
their Friends or Servants that happened to be
preſent, or to overhear them. Here is now an
Example of holy Conference without a Preface,
and yet without exception; a Precedent not
only juſtifying all I have ſaid, but eaſie to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
where-ever there is a like ſpirit of piety:
a few ſuch men would put prophaneneſs out of
countenance, and turn the tide of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>Shall I crave of you to tell me the names
of thoſe two perſons?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Their names are ſo well known, that
I think you might ſpare the Queſtion; but they

God there were more of them. I doubt I ſhall
never be able to imitate, but I am reſolved to
write after ſo fair a Copy as well as I can:
therefore pray you, if you have any further
directions for the guiding of my hand, let me
have them.</p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:100726:57"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee you are in earneſt; God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
on your heart for it. All that I have to
ſay, or (as I think) can be ſaid more, may be
ſummed up in theſe few following Cautions:</p>
               <p>Firſt, You muſt remember that (which was
ſaid before) you are not always to be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
at Diſcourſe of Religion; other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſo it be manly and pertinent, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lawful, but neceſſary in its ſeaſon. The
Wiſe-man tells us there is a time for all things;
to overdo is to do nothing to the purpoſe; and
to exclude all other innocent and ingenious
Converſe for the ſake of Religion, is to make
Religion irkſome, and the certain way to ſhut it
quite out of the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe religious Conference is
not always a Duty, therefore it is a peculiar
ſeaſon and opportunity that makes it at any time
become ſo, and conſequently that is to be
watched and laid hold upon. My meaning is,
that when men are in drink or in paſſion, it is
no fit time to enter on this Subject; for it will
be but to caſt Pearls before Swine; it can do
thoſe perſons no good at ſuch times, and it may
do us hurt and Religion too. But when men
are in the calmeſt and ſobereſt moods, then is
the only time for this intercourſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is very adviſeable that we make a
diſtinction of perſons, as well as times, for this
buſineſs. You know the World is not all of a ſize,
ſome are our Superiors, others are our Inferiors
or Equals; there are ſome very acute and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, ſome dull and ignorant; ſome are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptious,
others ſincere and plain-hearted; ſome
prophane, and others pious; in a word, there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100726:58"/>
are old and young, rich and poor, cheerful and
melancholy, and abundance other ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in mens circumſtances: All which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a peculiar Addreſs, if we intend to faſten
any good thing upon them. But of this I need
ſay no more, knowing to whom I ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Again, fourthly, It is a matter of prudence
that our eſſays of this kind be rather perfective
than deſtructive, that is, that we do not take
upon us authoritatively to quaſh and controul o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſcourſe, but rather take advantage of
any occaſional paſſages and hints, from whence
to improve and raiſe it inſenſibly to that we
would be at.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That out of indulgence to the levity,
and in compliance with the curioſity of mens
minds, we ſhould not always harp upon one
String; but ſometimes deſignedly lay aſide our
buſineſs, and then reſume it again, as in Muſick
to ſink and let fall a Note, and by and by get it
up again; that by ſuch variety we may afford
the more delightful entertainment to thoſe that
are our Companions. And now, I doubt, I have
quite tired you; therefore it is time to bid you
a good Night.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Dear <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> ſhall I tell you a plain
truth? When firſt we came together this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
your Converſation methought was ſo
much out of the mode, that though I conſidered
you as an honeſt Gentleman, yet I ſuſpected I
ſhould have uneaſie Company with you: But now
I phanſie you are like ſome of thoſe old ſtately
Buildings I have ſeen, which are a little rough
and weather-beaten without, but for all that
are ſubſtantially ſtrong, and expreſs very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100726:58"/>
art within; or as I have heard it was ſaid of
<hi>Socrates,</hi> that he was like Apothecaries Boxes,
that had the Picture of an Ape, a Satyr, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a Serpent without ſide, but contained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Medicaments: ſo you, that I feared
would be my Diſeaſe, have been my Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;
and, which is more, have ſet me up for
one too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
               <p>Nay then good night again, if you be
for Complements: But if you have any real va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
for me, I hope you will now do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of your Company at my Houſe ſome other
Evening.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Never doubt it, Sir, your dead men
ſhall ſcarcely haunt you more than I will do.
But good night heartily.</p>

CONFERENCE.</head>
                  <p>In the former Conference, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<hi>Philander</hi> of the great importance of
Religion, and the wiſdom of making it as well
the Subject of Social Communication as of reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Meditation: Accordingly they two meet on
purpoſe this ſecond time to confer about it. But
<hi>Biophilus,</hi> a ſceptical perſon, being in their
Company, he at firſt diverts them from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
by other Diſcourſe; till after a while, under
the diſguiſe of News, he is wheedled into this
Subject before he was aware: And then he puts
them upon the proof of thoſe Principles which
they would have ſuppoſed. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this occaſion
the foundations of Religion are ſearched into,
and particularly that Great Point concerning <hi>A
Judgment to come,</hi> is ſubſtantially proved:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100726:61"/>
Which being done, and <hi>Biophilus</hi> thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſomewhat more inclinable to be ſerious, they
then purſue their firſt intentions, and diſcourſe
warmly and ſenſibly of another World, and of the
neceſſary preparations for it, ſo long till they not
only inflame their own hearts with devotion, but
ſtrike ſome ſparks of it into <hi>Biophilus</hi> alſo.</p>
               </argument>
               <sp>

                  <p>YOU ſee, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> I am as

                  <p>Very good again: But nevertheleſs,
with your pardon,<note place="margin">A touch of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean Doctrine.</note> Gentlemen, I
ſhould argue the quite contrary
from your Premiſes. For if there
be a Judgment to come, (as you are pleaſed to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100726:62"/>
ſuppoſe) and that a man muſt render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all his actions another day; This,
methinks, ſhould curdle all his delights, and the
very thoughts of ſuch a thing filling him with
perpetual fears and ſollicitude about it, muſt
needs make Life very tedious to him. But if
there be no ſuch thing to be feared hereafter,
then Life will ſeem ſhort, becauſe it will be
ſweet and comfortable: and then alſo a man
ſhall in effect live a great while in a little time,
when there is nothing to diſturb his thoughts,
to impeach his pleaſures or interrupt the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, even in the Caſe which you put,
Death will be ſure to come ſhortly, and that will
ſpoil his ſport.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>That is very true and very ſad: If
therefore you could find out a remedy for that,
you would do ſomething to purpoſe. But
whenas you cannot but obſerve that there are
ſeveral ſorts of Brute Creatures that out-live
Mankind, (I mean though they know not what
it is to live, yet) they continue longer in the
World, and have as well a quicker ſenſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
as a more unlimited and uncotrolled en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of it; in both which reſpects we have
too great cauſe to envy their happineſs. If
Mankind after all this muſt be perpetually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
too with ſuſpicions of what may come
after, they are doubly miſerable, and under the
hardeſt fate of all Creatures.</p>

                  <p>That very thing which you now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
is to me a very great Argument of what
you oppoſe. For upon thoſe very conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Life of man in this World is
ſhorter than that of ſome other leſs conſiderable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100726:62"/>
Creatures, and that the pleaſure thereof is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
alſo by the expectation of the future;
upon thoſe very grounds (ſay I) there is great
reaſon to believe that there is ſuch a thing as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
World wherein he may have amends
made him for whatever was amiſs or defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
here. For it is not credible with me that
ſuch power and wiſdom as is plainly diſplay'd
in the Conſtitution of man, ſhould be ſo utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtitute of goodneſs, as to contrive things
ſo ill, that the nobleſt Being ſhould be finally
the moſt unfortunate.</p>
                  <p>To which I muſt add, that therefore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of ſuch a Judgment to come as we
ſpeak of, neither is nor can be mere matter of
dread and horrour, (as you ſeem to ſuppoſe)
but is either terrible or comfortable, reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to mens preparations for it:<note place="margin">Of the different proſpects different men have of the other World.</note> I
cannot wonder if the thoughts of
it do ſo fright and diſcompoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
men, ſo that they could with
all their hearts wiſh there was no
ſuch thing. But moſt certainly to wiſe and
virtuous men, it is ſo far from being formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that contrariwiſe the hope of it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
joy of their hearts, the ſupport of their
Spirits, their greateſt ſecurity againſt all the
croſs accidents of this World, and in a word
their Port and Sanctuary.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are ſine Sayings, <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi>
but when you have ſaid all you can, and made
the beſt of the Caſe, when it comes to the
proof, I do not find men in love with dying,
nor to have ſo comfortable an opinion of that
other World you ſpeak of; but that they could
with all their hearts be content to quit their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100726:63"/>
in the latter, ſo they might put off the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
I remember once when I was preſent at
an Execution, amongſt the reſt of condemned
Malefactors, there was one who either was ſo
ſecure of his own innocency, or ſo confident of
the ſufficiency of his preparations for Death, or,
which I rather ſuſpect, ſo elevated and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with the Harangues of the Prieſt, that
he ſeemed to long for his near-approaching
end, and pretended he would not exchange his
condition for that of any of the Spectators there
preſent: But by and by comes the ſurprizing
News of a Pardon or Reprieve, and the poor
man was ready to leap out of his skin for joy.</p>
                  <p>And I have often obſerved men, who when
they have been deſperately ſick, and paſt all
hopes of Life, then (as it is uſual with men in
danger of drowning to catch hold of any thing
that offers it ſelf for their ſupport) to ſet a
good face on the matter, and (as we ſay) make
a Vertue of Neceſſity, and welcome the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Death with ſeeming courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy:
But in this juncture, let but a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
appear that gives them any hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they preſently ſtart back from the brink of
another World, as from an horrible Precipice,
and ſmile upon the Meſſenger that brings the
good tidings of Life. I cannot ſee therefore
that men do indeed believe themſelves in this
matter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no doubt, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> but
that (as you ſay) ſome men may talk only, and
ſet a good face upon that which they have no
comfortable ſenſe of. And no wonder if ſuch
mens courage fails them when they have moſt
uſe of it: for it is not imaginable that it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100726:63"/>
ſhould be eaſie to brazen it out againſt Death.
But this is no more reproach to true Faith in
God and hopes of another World, than it is to
generous courage and valour, that now and
then you ſhall ſee an huffing ſwaggering Hector
turn recreant when he is put to it in earneſt.
It is acknowledged to be very eaſie to brag and
vapour when no danger is near; but it requires
real bravery to ſtand to it when a man is briskly
encountered: Now as you will not ſay there is
no ſuch thing as Valour, becauſe there are ſome
Cowards that pretend to it; ſo neither (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume)
will you think fit to ſuppoſe there is no
faith, becauſe there is ſome hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if you were as well ſatisfied as I am
or pretend to be of the truth of that we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
upon, namely, of another World;
yet your experience of the common courſe of
mens lives would force you to acknowledge,
that even amongſt thoſe that do profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſuch a thing, there are but very few who
appear to be habitually well prepared for ſo
great a tryal; and therefore no wonder if ſuch
perſons be ſomewhat ſtartled and diſcompoſed
at an immediate ſummons, and could be very
glad to have further day given them to make up
ſo great an Account. For however a tolerable
courſe of living may make a ſhift to ſupport a
mans hopes whilſt Death is looked upon at a
diſtance; yet when it comes to the Point, that
a man muſt dye indeed, it is very reaſonable to
expect that ſuch men as we now ſpeak of ſhould
be not a little ſollicitous in ſuch a concern,
where they know the miſcarriage is fatal, and
the beſt proviſion poſſible will be little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:100726:64"/>
But notwithſtanding all this, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and have been ſundry perſons in the
World, who though they have had the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection to themſelves and to the preſent
life with others, yet have as heartily wiſhed
and longed for the Great Day, as it was lawful
for them to do. They know it is their Duty to
maintain the ſtation God hath ſet them in, till
they have a fair diſmiſſion; but bating that
conſideration, I doubt not but many a good
man would ſue out his <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> and gladly
embrace an opportunity of bidding farewel to
the World.</p>

                  <p>You ſay well; but how ſhall this Caſe

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps you have not heard any man
ſing his <hi>Nunc dimittis;</hi> or if you
had,<note place="margin">Heroes that can deſpiſe Death.</note> it may be you would not
have believed him to be in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt:
But what think you of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
<hi>he deſires to be diſſolved, and to be with
Chriſt?</hi> and particularly 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
a violent Death approaching him, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that occaſion he by way of contemplation
places himſelf, as it were, upon a Promontory,
where he could look backward and forward, and
take a view of both Worlds; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon that which he was leaving, he finds
that he had diſcharged his part well and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whilſt he was in it; <hi>I have fought the good
ſight,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe, I have
kept the faith.</hi> But then when he looks forward
and takes a proſpect of what was to come, here
he triumphs and exults with joy, <hi>Henceforth is
laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100726:64"/>
God the righteous Judge ſhall give me:</hi> As if
he ſaid, <q>I know no cauſe that I ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be aſhamed to live, or afraid to dye; I
have no reaſon to be very fond of life,
who have met with ſo many afflictions in it,
yet I that have born them ſo undauntedly hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
can have as little reaſon to leave the
World now in a pet of impatience: But
upon the whole matter, I ſee great advantage
on the other ſide, and the other World is as
much better than the preſent, as Harveſt is
than labour, as Victory than battel, and as
being at home than in travel and on a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or what do you think of ſo many thouſand
Martyrs, who have not only gone out of the
World with ſmiles in their faces, and ſongs in
their mouths, but have choſen Death when they
might have lived as freely, as happily, and as
long as other men: They were not worn out
with Age, nor vexed and wearied with poverty,
nor diſtracted by any diſaſter; they had as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and ſenſible Conſtitutions as other men, as
much natural affection to themſelves, and as
ſound reaſon to judge what was beſt, and yet
deſpiſed the preſent Life and World in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of that to come.</p>

                  <p>Nay, as for thoſe men of old, which
you ſpeak of, I cannot tell what to make of
them: But I would fain ſee ſuch a man now.</p>

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I make no Queſtion but I could direct
you to ſuch men now; but it may be you will
not believe they deſpiſe Death, becauſe you ſee
them yet living; however, what think you of
the man that hath the bravery to deny himſelf
thoſe profits and pleaſures which other men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100726:65"/>
themſelves, (ſo long as they ſee no infamy
or external danger attend them) what think
you of the man that dares to be vertuous in a
lewd Age and in evil Company, and hath the
courage and proweſs to confront a whole World
with his Example? What think you of the man
that ſits ſo looſe to the World, that he can bear
Proſperity without being ſupercilious, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
without being dejected, that can be in
want without repining, and can be liberal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
upbraiding? Or, to ſay no more, What
think you of the man that ſcorns to crouch
and ſneak, and paraſitically to humour and
flatter others for his ſecular intereſt or ſecurity?
Such men as theſe are to be found in the preſent
Age; and where-ever you find any ſuch man, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelf there is a perſon that believes
himſelf, or rather that believes in God, and
hath as real a perſwaſion of the World to come,
as other men have of that which they ſee with
their eyes, and touch with their fingers.</p>

                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe there are ſome ſuch men as
you ſpeak of, and I do account them brave and
worthy perſons: but theſe inſtances come not
up to the Point, foraſmuch as ſome of theſe
will quail at the approach of Death as well as
other men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>It may happen ſo, that a vertuous
man may be a little diſcompoſed at the rude aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
of Death, and yet without any blemiſh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his Faith or Vertue: For in the firſt
place, you know all men have a natural love of
Life, and an abhorrence of Death, and from
hence may proceed ſome ſudden reluctancies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is neither within the power of reaſon, nor
is it the Office of Religion, utterly to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100726:65"/>
and extinguiſh theſe firſt motions; but to
ſubdue and govern them, ſo as that a man may
(after ſome conflict) purſue the choice of his
mind notwithſtanding them, and this latter you
ſhall ſee them perform.</p>
                  <p>And then beſides, you know there are ſome
men of more timorous natures than others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that a great meaſure of Vertue will not
do the ſame thing in ſuch, as a leſſer proportion,
aſſiſted by hardineſs of temper, will do in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For Nature will be Nature ſtill; and
therefore you ſhall obſerve that even amongſt
thoſe that have no apprehenſion of any thing
to come after Death, (if we may believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
and ſo conſequently can have no cauſe of
fear; yet will be found thoſe that are as timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as thoſe that expect a Judgment to come,
witneſs your friend Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, you cannot but be aware that a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
Diſeaſe, or pain, or any of thoſe Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of Death, do ordinarily infeeble the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of the mind, as well as of the body,
and diſorder mens reaſon ſo, that it is hard to
pronounce of mens proweſs by the Combat they
then maintain; therefore the ſureſt way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
this matter, is that which I directed you
to before, namely, when you ſee a man in his
full ſtrength voluntarily and underſtandingly do
that which will certainly draw Death after it,
this hath certainly more bravery and ſelf-denial
in it, more contempt of life and the world, and
more argument of hopes in another world, than
can be drawn from the contingencies in the very
agony of Death.</p>

                  <p>Nay, truly for my part I wiſh it had

much knavery and ſophiſtication in it, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

their peace, their loyalty, and almoſt out of

                  <p>Hearing and telling of News ſeems to
me to be juſt ſuch another diverſion as tipling is.
And it is much the ſame thing whether a mans
Head be full of vapours, or of Proclamations:
Wind in the Brain makes men giddy as well as
Wine, and men reel and ſtagger to and fro as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
by the impulſe of uncertain rumours, as
thoſe that are intoxicated with the ſtrongeſt
Liquors. Beſides, juſt as he that knows not
how to entertain himſelf at home, uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
himſelf to the Tavern or the Ale-houſe

and ſuch as are negligent of their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
to buſie themſelves in matters that do not

                  <p>With reverence to publick opinion, I
ſhould think the quite contrary in both Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
For in the firſt place it is notorious that
the male-content is always liſtening after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
and I cannot tell whether his head be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of little Stories, or of Maggots; whereas
the man in good humour and contented, minds
only his own buſineſs, and lets it alone to God
and the King to govern the World.</p>
                  <p>And then for the other Particular, it is the
eaſieſt thing in the World to obſerve that your
right News-Monger cares not a ruſh which end
goes forward, or whether the ſtate of things be
good or bad for his Country, ſo there be News
for his own entertainment.</p>
                  <p>But after all, now I think better of it, I have

                  <p>So it ſeems; for I perceive you are ſo

therefore broach you by degrees. In the firſt

                  <p>I am not skilful in that kind of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
neither do I remember that it was told
me in thoſe terms how the Country lies, but
perhaps this may tend to your ſatisfaction; I
am aſſured that they have no night nor dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
there, for the Sun never goes off their
Horizon, nor are there any long Evenings and
tedious nights, which we complain off in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
by this Character I ſuppoſe you may

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>O Sir, the Air is ſweet and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
beyond compare; it is <hi>Aether</hi> rather then
Air, there is neither violent heat nor cold, no
diſtinction of Summer and Winter, and indeed
no ſuch things, but a perpetual Spring; ſo
that Flowers bloſſome, and Fruit ripen all the
Year long; and by reaſon of this ſerenity and
conſtancy of the Air, the Country is ſo health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that there is never any epidemical or
raigning Diſeaſe, no man feeble and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nay, not ſo much as wrinkles or grey
hairs upon any mans head or face, inſomuch,
that you would think the Inhabitants were all
abſolutely immortal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>If that one thing alone be true, I

                  <p>O very populous, yet by reaſon of
its prodigious fruitfulneſs it can never be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtockt;
for, they ſay, it yields a freſh Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
of all kind of Fruits every Month, and
that a moſt abundant one; foraſmuch as no
weeds, nor thorns and bryars grow there, but
only that which is good for the uſe of man,
and, which is moſt of all wonderful, all this is
brought forth ſpontaneouſly, without the toil
and labour of man,</p>
                  <p>They ſay alſo there are no kind of wild
Beaſts there, either to affright and annoy the
people, or to devour the Fruits of the Land;
nay, not ſo much as any Serpents, or other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
Creatures or troubleſome Inſects, and
all this is owing to the clemency of the Air, the
peculiar nature of the Soil, together with Gods
Bleſſing upon both.</p>

                  <p>I perceive a man may eat well, and
when he hath ſo done may ſleep in a whole skin
there, that I like; and I would to God it
were not a Romance which you give us: But go
on, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> what is the Polity and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>The Government is perfectly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical,
and the Prince is abſolute; yet I do
not hear that any of his Subjects wear wooden
Shoos, or feed upon Cabbage, but all of them
enjoy their liberty and property as ſecurely and
fully as in any Commonwealth in the World.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſquabbling about Priviledges, no
interfering between Prerogative and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Dominion and Common Right; the King
commands what he will, and the people wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
obey him: for his Wiſdom and Goodneſs
moderate his Will and Power better than all the
Boundaries of written Laws.</p>
                  <p>And this I am informed of too, that though
there be ſeveral Degrees of Subjects, as there
are amongſt us, becauſe otherwiſe there could
be no ſufficient encouragement to induſtry,
nor no capacity in the Prince to ſet marks of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
upon thoſe that deſerve extraordinarily of
him; yet from hence ariſe no emulations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Nobility, nor any oppreſſion of the
Commons; the people do not envy and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
againſt the Great Ones, nor on the other

                  <p>A rare temper of Government this!
and not leſs admirable than that of the Air you

But what are the ſtaple Commodities of the

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>As for that, you muſt know it is not
with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> as with moſt other Countries,
where uſually one Province abounds with
what another wants, and the other needs what
that can ſpare; and ſo there is a neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
Intercourſe between them, both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their neceſſities mutually, and to diſcharge
their ſuperſtuities; and herein you know lyes
both the reaſon of Trade, and the ſecurity of
Alliances between ſeveral Countries in our Parts
of the World. But now <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> being (as
was wont to be ſaid of <hi>Egypt)</hi> a Country ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient,
depends not at all upon Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and therefore as it needs nothing from
abroad, ſo conſequently it ſends out few or
none of thoſe Commodities it abounds with;
but rather (as I ſhall tell you by and by) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
Foreigners to come over to them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
amongſt them, and ſo to partake freely of
the advantages of that happy Land.</p>
                  <p>Yet I muſt tell you, they have very great
rarities in thoſe Parts, and ſuch as are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
deſired by all other people that underſtand
the worth of them; as in particular, to ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
ſome few which are not at all to be found
any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, they have the true <hi>Elixir
Vitae,</hi> a very precious Balm, far beyond that of
<hi>Gilead,</hi> that perfectly cures all Diſeaſes, both
inward and outward, I had almoſt ſaid of body
and mind. This operates without any pain to
the Patient, and in outward applications, heals
all kind of wounds, and leaves no ſcar or mark
behind it.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo an admirable Water, which
ſo quickens all the fenſes, and peculiarly the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100726:69"/>
ſight, that a man by the help of it ſhall ſee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by a Teleſcope, and pierce into the
very Secrets of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The common Food of the Country is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
anſwerable to the deſcription of <hi>Manna,</hi>
and hath that peculiar taſte which every man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and ſatisfies all the powers of Nature.
They have alſo a delicious Wine called <hi>Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
Chriſti,</hi> which amongſt other Vertues makes
men forget all ſorrows whatſoever: And this
they uſually drink in an Amethyſt Cup, which
preſerves them from Surfeits or Intemperance,
what proportions ſoever they drink.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the reſt, they have a ſort of <hi>Nitre,</hi>
ſo very powerful and abſterſive, that it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away
all ſpots, blemiſhes and aſperſions, and
makes thoſe that uſe it ſo very beautiful, that
they raviſh the eyes of Beholders.</p>
                  <p>It were endleſs to go about to enumerate the
Commodities of this Country, which clearly
outgoes the Holy Land, though it was ſaid that
in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days Gold and Silver were there
as common as the Stones of the Street: And
for proof of it, the Inhabitants are generally
ſo rich and proſperous, that there is not one
poor man in the whole Land, not one to be
found, that doth need or will ask an Alms. The
hungry and naked, thoſe grievous Spectacles (too
ſadly common in moſt other places) are not to
be ſeen there; of which, amongſt other cauſes,
theſe are aſſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> there is no fordid and
cruel <hi>Miſer</hi> there, who hoards up what others
ſhould live upon; nor is there any waſtful Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
or Epicure, who devours his own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
folks portion too. In ſhort, they ſay all
deſirable things are there in ſuch abundance,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100726:70"/>
that every man is as rich, as full, and as happy
as he pleaſes.</p>

                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>If all this was poſſible to be true,
which I muſt beg your pardon to declare I have
not faith enough to believe, yet the felicity of
this Country could not be long-liv'd; for it will
certainly derive upon it ſelf the envy of all its
Neighbours: and the effect of that will be, that
thoſe who have the beſt Iron will quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Maſters of all this Wealth.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> as for that there is
no danger; for the Country is altogether inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible,
ſave only by one narrow way, and that
is ſo well guarded and defended, that to this
day no Enemy hath ever had the confidence to
aſſail it. And beſides all, the Inhabitants are
in ſuch perfect peace and amity one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and maintain ſo inviolably their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
towards their Sovereign, that as no Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner
hath any encouragement to enterprize
upon them by treachery, ſo neither can he
without mighty folly think himſelf conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough to prevail by force againſt ſuch an
united ſtrength.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>Now you ſpeak of that, I pray give
me leave to ask you one Queſtion more, What
is the humour of the people, both amongſt
themſelves, and towards Strangers?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>That is as admirable in its kind as
any thing I have told you yet. The Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
of the people is ſaid to be univerſally ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine,
and conſequently they are ſprightly and
cheerful, ingenious and complaiſant, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
and yet grave, without fraud and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
jealouſie; they neither intend any hurt,
nor do they ſuſpect any. Amongſt other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100726:70"/>
of their ſedate cheerfulneſs, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
addicted to Muſick, and their Songs
are obſerved to be compoſed for the moſt part
in praiſe of their Prince, the ſplendor of his
Court, the Glory of his Atchievements, and
the felicity of his Reign.</p>
                  <p>So far are they from wrath and choler, that in
the memory of man there hath not been one
Law-Suit commenced amongſt them; and,
which is more, not one Theological Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which uſually are attended with ſo much
heat and animoſity in theſe Parts of the World.
But as for Tale-Bearers, Whiſperers, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters,
and all that melancholy and envious
Brood, there is not one of them to be found in
all the Country; every man there loves his
Neighbour as himſelf, and is as tender of his
intereſt and reputation as of his own.</p>
                  <p>And then for their temper and carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Strangers, they are infinitely civil and
obliging: They deride not other mens habit,
or mien, or language, or cuſtoms, or complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but contrariwiſe, whenſoever any ſuch
come amongſt them, they welcome them hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
treat them with all inſtances of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and by all poſſible obligations and indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
invite them to become one people with
themſelves, and as much as in them lies are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to contribute their aſſiſtance towards their
Voyage.</p>

                  <p>This is a very ſtrange Relation as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>They ſay we Engliſh-men (above all

by our credulity: But if that be the
humour of our Country-men, I muſt beg their
pardon if I a little vary from them in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
I confeſs I am not ſo ill-natured as to
ſuſpect that every Body I converſe with hath
deſigns upon me; nor yet am I ſo ſupinely ſoft
and credulous, as to be at every Bodies mercy;
or ſo greedy of News, as to ſwallow all that
comes without chewing. And as to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
before us, I poſitively affirm to you, I had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100726:71"/>
this ſtrange Relation (as you eſteem it) from
one that came from the place, and was an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs
of what he reported, and therefore
could not be deceived himſelf in what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated:
And then his Quality was ſuch, as that
he could have no intereſt to impoſe upon me
therein; for he was no leſs a man than the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Son of the Great Monarch of the Country,
and he came as Ambaſſadour Extraordinary
from the King his Father, on purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
and incline our people to participate of
that happy Region, and of all the admirable
advantages aforeſaid, and aſſured us, That all

                  <p>I, Good <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> he told you ſo;
but how are you ſure he was not an Impoſtor;
and deſigned to put tricks upon you and our

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>As for that, his very Perſon and Mien
ſpake for him, both which were ſo Auguſt and
Grand, as that no mean man could bear out the
Port he uſed: beſides this, he came not in a
clancular way, but made his Publick Entry,
and his Train and Equipage was Grave and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick,
like himſelf, far beyond the empty
pomp and pageantry of a Counterfeit. His
Commiſſion and Letters Credential alſo were
publickly ſeen, read and allowed; and they
were ſealed with ſuch a Seal, as no wit of man
could imitate or counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>Add unto all this, I have ſeen the Map or
Chart of the Country, I have peruſed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
of the Laws of the Kingdom, theſe eyes
have read the Records of their Hiſtory, and

                  <p>What would I have more? Why, I

                  <p>You ſay well: But can you think it
reaſonable to require that ſo great a Prince
ſhould ſend many Ambaſſadors on ſuch an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
when he aims not at his own Greatneſs,
or the accommodating of his own Affairs, nor
hath any need of our alliance and aſſiſtance; but
merely deſigns our benefit? Or can you expect
that he ſhould ſend every day freſh Envoys, and
that not only to whole Countries, but to every

ſuch a Prince ſhould condeſcend to this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
can you think it would be eaſie to find many
fit perſons for ſuch a purpoſe, who would be
willing to forſake the Glories of ſuch a Court,
or the contentments of home in ſuch a Region,
and to expoſe themſelves to the difficulties and
hazards of Travel, as well as to the change of
Air and Diet, and a thouſand other inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
attendant upon ſuch an Expedition? No,
<hi>Biophilus,</hi> it was an inſtance of wonderful good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that ſuch a Prince ſhould ſend one Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
on ſuch an Errand, and admirable Charity
and ſelf-denial in him that undertook and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
it.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſpeak reaſon, I muſt acknowledge,
in that particular; but yet I can never believe,
that if there were any ſuch Country as your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
amounts to, it ſhould lye undiſcovered
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100726:72"/>
to theſe Parts of the World until now. What!
<hi>Drake, Candiſh, Columbus, Davies,—</hi> none
of them in all their Travels take notice of ſuch
a place, nor give the leaſt intimation of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
now.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>That is no ſuch ſtrange thing as you
make it, if you call to mind how long a time it
was before the World would believe there
were <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and yet it is plain that ſo long
one full half of the World was unknown to the
other. Or if you remember, that time was,
(and that not an ignorant Age neither) when
the Roman Empire was thought to embrace the
whole Earth, which as now we are certain took
not in one fifth (perhaps not one tenth) of it.
Do you not know that <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars were
accounted the Boundaries of humane Travels,
and that for a great many Ages both the torrid
and frigid Zones (as they are called) were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
uninhabitable, and all that time the
World was ignorant of it ſelf? beſides, you
know, it is not very long ſince thoſe vaſt Tracts
of Land, the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> were firſt diſcovered by
ſome of thoſe perſons you have named; and,
to ſay no more, I pray how many Ages paſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the heads of Mankind before this our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country of <hi>Britain</hi> (as conſiderable as it is,
and we juſtly eſteem it) came into any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or conſideration with the reſt of the
World: think it not ſtrange therefore if <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
was ſo lately diſcovered.</p>

                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>But that which I principally intended
to ſay was this, You afford me matter of great
wonder, that you ſhould be ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a place very newly diſcovered, (if it be
diſcovered) but eſpecially that you ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100726:73"/>
ſo many ſtrange things of it, before any
one perſon hath gone from hence, and returned
hither again to confirm thoſe reports of it.</p>

                  <p>Ifs and Exceptions are endleſs, and I
know no way to make a man believe that hath
no mind to it; yet I will give you all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
I am able, and that which I think is
ſufficient in ſuch a Caſe. You muſt know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that this Country hath not been wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered
till now, as you ſuppoſe; for I my
ſelf have ſeen a Book of great Authority and
Antiquity, which though ſomewhat obſcurely
and figuratively written, yet certainly pointed
at ſuch a place, and in ſome meaſure deſcribed
it too, to him that attentively read and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it. And beſides, there are ſome very
credible relations concerning ſome certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that have heretofore made very fortunate
Voyages thither.</p>
                  <p>But as to that you object, that no man hath
gone from hence thither, and returned again to
us to bring us the Tydings; you will eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your ſelf therein, if you conſider what I
intimated before, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe who once get
thither can have no inclinations to make a
Change ſo much to their diſadvantage, as it
muſt needs be for them to return hither again.
Beſides, though they ſay the paſſage is not very
long thither, yet it is no common Road; and
therefore very few will (at leaſt unneceſſarily)
undertake it.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100726:73"/>
in that, if a man be well reſolved on the

inſtructions which the Ambaſſador left behind
him for that purpoſe when he was amongſt us,
there are great ſtore of very skilful and faithful

ſo raviſhed with your relation, that if there
be ſuch a place in the World I will find it out
by God's help. I thank God I am no Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Content,
either with my Native Country, or
my private Fortunes; yet I ſee no reaſon we
ſhould like Muſhromes live and dye upon the

to the place where we happened to be
born, eſpecially if we may thus much mend
our ſelves by the change. I am a Citizen of the
World, and that ſhall be my Country where I
an fare beſt.</p>
                  <p>But will you go with me, <hi>Sebaſtian?</hi> Then I
ſhall not only be out of all doubt of the truth
of your Narrative, when I ſee you ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it your ſelf, as to adventure all upon it;
but I ſhall with much more cheerfulneſs change
my Country, when I do not change my Friend,

<hi>Philander:</hi> By God's Grace I will go
with you; and to aſſure you of my intentions,
I will now acquaint you that I have been this

making preparations for the Voyage.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But how ſhall we diſpoſe of our Eſtates
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100726:74"/>
here? and what Commodities had we beſt to
furniſh our ſelves with to carry over with us?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>As for the diſpoſal of our preſent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
I can tell you there are very ſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
betwixt this Country and that; for the
Prince himſelf will be your ſecurity, if you
put your Effects into ſuch hands as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
But as for Merchandiſe to carry with
us, there will be no need of that; for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which we have in our eye is ſo gloriouſly
rich and plentiful, the Prince is ſo noble and
benign, and all the Inhabitants ſo kind and
charitable, that we ſhall be ſure as ſoon as ever
we come there to be furniſhed <hi>gratis</hi> with all
that our hearts can wiſh: and moreover, if we
ſhould put our ſelves to the trouble of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
our Baggage with us, it would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incumber us in our Journey, but would alſo
ſeem to be ſuch mere traſh and lomber when we
come there, that we ſhould be aſhamed of it
and of our ſelves too, for ſetting ſuch a value
upon it.</p>
                  <p>But there is another thing, and much more
material, which I muſt needs tell you of, in order
to our more favourable reception when we come
there, that is, we muſt before-hand quite alter
our Habit and Garb, and not ſo much as ſmell
of the Earth we came from: amongſt other
things, we muſt diſuſe our ſelves from Onions
and Garlick, and from Fleſh too, that we may
the eaſier accord with the Diet of the Country;
and we muſt refine our ſpirits, that we may be
ſit to breathe in that pure Air; and having ſo
done, there needs no more but to carry with us
great minds and large ſouls, to qualifie us both
for the Society and the enjoyments there.</p>

But, Good Lord! what a Dream have

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi>
you have all this while amuzed us with: Now
I can unriddle the whole buſineſs: I have now a
Clue to guide me through the maze of your

have uſed. I am ſure 'tis Heaven only can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Character you have given; that is the
place where there is no pain, ſickneſs, nor
death; there is no Night nor darkneſs, but a
perpetual Day; there is to be found the true
Balſome that cures all the Diſtempers and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100726:75"/>
wounds both of Body and Mind; there are to
be had all the other Rarities which you have

                  <p>By your pardon, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> have I
done you any wrong? You ask'd for News, and
I have told you good and true News; News
of more importance, and more comfortable
than any the Coffee-Houſe affords; not ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured
Stories of Whigg and Tory, nor ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
about <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> Turk and Count
<hi>Teckley;</hi> but a great truth of a Kingdom that
cannot be ſhaken, a Kingdom wherein there is
righteouſneſs and juſtice, unity and joy, love
and good-will, everlaſting peace and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life; a ſtate of that felicity, that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make us weary of this World, and to
render the time of our life tedious to us till we
come to the enjoyment of it; in a word, that
is ſufficient to make all the ways of Vertue

                  <p>Yes, Fellow-Traveller, I hold my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
For though I find I
was miſtaken in the particular,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Philander</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the contemplation of Heaven.</note>
yet not in the general; it was
an Earthly Paradiſe that I had in
my thoughts all the while you
were diſcourſing figuratively to us, and I had no
other apprehenſions of your deſign, and therein
<hi>Biophilus</hi> was more in the right than I, who was
confident there could be no ſuch Country in this
World as you deſcribed: but I heartily thank
you for the deception; you have cheated us
into our own advantage. And now that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
you, I do not change my Courſe,
though I change my Port; I hope I ſhall not be
ſo abſurd, as to be more in earneſt for an
Earthly Country than for an Heavenly.</p>
                  <p>Who would not gladly be at everlaſting reſt,
and in an unchangeable Condition? We are
<hi>but Pilgrims and Strangers in this World,</hi> but
there we ſhall be at home, and in our Father's
Houſe; here we are continually toſſed with
Winds and Seas, tormented betwixt hopes and
fears; there we come into harbour, and ſhall
be ſafe as upon a Rock, ſtable and ſettled as the
Mountains.</p>
                  <p>Who can chuſe but wiſh to live for ever,
and would not be contented to dye once, that
he might be out of the reach of Chance or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for ever after? Everlaſting Life! what an
Ocean of joy and felicity is contained in it!
It puts me into an Ecſtaſie to think of it! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he doth not love himſelf, or doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
himſelf, who would not gladly leave an
uncertain, troubleſome, quarrelſome, fooliſh,
diſputing, ſuſpicious, envious World, upon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100726:76"/>
far eaſier terms than the attainment of it. But
to live with the Ever-Bleſſed Jeſus, to ſpend E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
in the Society of good and wiſe, kind
and peaceable men, to enter into everlaſting
friendſhips, inviolable peace, unchangeable fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity!
I am raviſhed and tranſported with the
thoughts of it.</p>
                  <p>When once I had the happineſs to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a poor man, blind from his Mother's
Womb, who never had ſeen the Sun, nor could
have any Notion of Beauty or Colours, nor of
any of that variety of delightful Objects which
the eye and light preſent to us, and entertain us
with; when afterwards (I ſay) by a ſtrange
Cure this poor man had his eyes opened, and
found a Crowd of new delights preſs in upon
him, he thought himſelf ſurrounded with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and was almoſt diſtracted with wonder.
And certainly no leſs but a great deal more,
will our ſurprize be when we come to Heaven,
where probably we ſhall have new powers open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which ſhall diſcover ſuch Glories to us as
we were not capable of perceiving before, if
they had been preſented to us; but moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we ſhall then have new Objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to entertain thoſe powers we have, and
thoſe tranſcendent to all we ever had experience
of before.</p>
                  <p>Or when I think of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
firſt coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they had lived
for ſome hundreds of years in the Condition of
Slaves under the jealous eye of a barbarous
Prince, treated with hardſhip and ſeverity,
and expoſed to all the indignities, inſolences and
cruelty of a faithleſs and ingrateful people;
and then after this, (leaping as we ſay out of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100726:76"/>
the Frying Pan into the Fire) were carried into
a vaſt and howling Wilderneſs, and there
ſpending forty years more amidſt Seas and
Mountains, in danger of Wild Beaſts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
with Enemies, having no City of refuge,
no Strong Holds, no Friends, no Allies, no
comfort or ſupplies, but from hand to mouth;
when (I ſay) theſe poor people arrived at laſt
at the Promiſed Land, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a
Land of Olive-yards and Vineyards, a Land
flowing with Milk and Honey, and the Glory
of all Lands, and found themſelves peaceably
poſſeſs'd of it, under their own God, their
own Prince, and their own Laws, and flowing
in ſuch plenty of all good things, that they
now became the admiration and envy of all
their Neighbours, who had been the Subject of
their contempt and ſcorn before: I can but
phanſie how they were aſtoniſhed at the change,
what a wonder they were to themſelves; and I
am apt to believe, that for ſome time after they
could not but ſuſpect they were under a pleaſant
illuſion of phancy, and that all their felicity
was no better than a Dream.</p>
                  <p>So aſſuredly, when we ſhall firſt come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
our ſpiritual <hi>Canaan,</hi> to the enjoyment of
an happineſs of God's preparing, who hath all
the Ingredients of felicity in his power, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
wiſdom to contrive and compound them,
and unſpeakable goodneſs to beſtow them, and
who, as the Scripture expreſſes it, hath from
the beginning of the World been deſigning and
preparing ſuch a ſyſteme of joy and felicity as
may at once both moſt delight his Creatures,
and diſplay all his aforeſaid Attributes; when,
I ſay, we ſhall firſt obſerve the ſtrange change
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100726:77"/>
between a narrow, ſtingy, neceſſitous, unquiet,
ſickly, peeviſh and contentious World, which
we have left behind us, and the ſettlement and
peace, plenty and glory of that we enter upon;
it will not be eaſie for us (without larger minds
than we have now) to know how to behave our
ſelves; we ſhall be apt to be oppreſt with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and, if it were poſſible, to dye with exceſs
of joy.</p>

                  <p>Shall I be ſollicitous for my eſtate and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accommodations, when I know, whether I go
to Heaven or no, I muſt ſhortly leave them all
behind me? And ſurely if they cannot ſave me
from death, they ought not to hinder me of
eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Or ſhall I hanker after Onions and Garlick
and the Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as you called the
pleaſures of the body, which will certainly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
me, if I do not forſake them firſt. No, I

                  <p>With all my heart, dear Friend; for
though I doubt we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
much company with us,<note place="margin">The advantages of good company in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> yet
perfect ſolitude is ſomewhat
uncomfortable, and there are
great advantages of ſociety. For
if any body ſhould be ſo abſurd as to laugh at us
on our journey, we can the better deſpiſe them.
If either of us ſhould happen to be heavy and
weary in our way, we may animate and quicken
one another. If any difficulty befal, that may
be too hard for any one of us, by our united
ſtrength we may be able to encounter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it. If either of us ſhould ſwerve a little
out of the narrow way, towards the right hand
or towards the left, the other may recal and
rectifie him. Beſides, the great additional
comfort it will be when we come at our journies
end, not only that we ſee one another happy,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100726:78"/>
and enjoy one anothers ſociety, but eſpecially
when we reflect upon the good ſervice we have
done to one another in bringing each other
thither, we ſhall have our joys redoubled by
the reflection, and feel not only our own indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
ſhares, but that alſo of each other.</p>

Heaven as confidently as if you had travelled

or any body elſe ſee ſuch a place as Heaven.
For Gods ſake therefore leave theſe Enthuſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

of the caution you give us: aſſure your

ſelf-love that you have, and only wiſh you had
the ſame faith that we have. We are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with certainties for uncertainties;
for if Heaven be not certain, we are ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe is. And as for the things of this
world, they are ſo far from it, that nothing is
more certain, than that we muſt part with them
ſhortly, whether we will or no: But as for the

                  <p>I tell you, all is but dream and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
there is no proof in the world for it. All
you have to ſay is, that men muſt believe; as
if you ſhould ſay, ſhut your eyes and ſee, you

No, give me good proof, or I'le not

                  <p>Remember your ſelf, good Neighbour,
are not you a Chriſtian? Do not you believe
that Jeſus Chriſt came from Heaven on purpoſe
to make diſcovery to us of thoſe celeſtial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and to ſhew us the way thither? And
did not he confirm his report to us by undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Miracles? Did he not come into the world
miraculouſly, and return thither again viſibly?
Did he not from thence ſend down admirable
tokens of his Preſence and Authority there,
eſpecially on the famous day of Pentecoſt? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
do you not ſee all wiſe men provide for
another world, and that generally good and
virtuous men, when they come to die, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
with joy in contemplation of it, as if
they really ſaw Heaven open to receive them?</p>

                  <p>Whether or no I believe as much as
you do, yet I believe this one thing inſtead of
all the reſt, that we are born to be cheated.
For what with the illuſions of our own melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
phancies, what by the prejudices of our
education, and the imperious dictates of others,
what by the authority of unaccountable Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and publick Fame, and what by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of Politicians, it is an hard matter to
know what elſe to believe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> I am both ſorry and
aſhamed to hear you talk at this rate. And I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100726:79"/>
do not wonder now, that you were ſo deſirous
to decline this kind of diſcourſe when we fell
upon it. I hope you take me for your Friend
as well as your Neighbour, and <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> here
for a diſcreet and worthy Gentleman, ſuffer
your ſelf to be perſwaded by us to think and
ſpeak more ſoberly and becoming your ſelf in
theſe great matters, or if you will not think
like a Chriſtian, yet talk like a man; for let
me tell you, you ſeem not only to reject Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
but all Religion in general, and upon
thoſe terms you will be as little fit for this
world as for that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>For what a ſad creature is a man of no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at all? What State or Civil Government
will be able to endure him, whom no Oaths can
oblige or faſten upon? How can there be any
Civil Society with him that hath no Faith, that
can neither truſt nor be truſted? What ſecurity
can ſuch a man give that he ſhall not diſturb the
State, violate the perſon of his Prince, falſifie
his truſt, betray his friend, cut his Neighbours
throat, if he be under the awe of no God, the
expectation of no rewards nor puniſhments in
another world? What ſecurity can there be, I
ſay, in dealing with ſuch a man, what ſincerity
in his friendſhip, what ſafety in his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
For all theſe depend upon the reverence
of Religion, which he that is wholly deſtitute
of, muſt needs become <hi>devotum caput,</hi> a wolfes
head, the peſt and vermine of humane ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Do not therefore, dear <hi>Biophilus,</hi> at once
both ſtifle your own Conſcience, and affront
the common ſenſe and reaſon of mankind. Do
not under the pretence of being more witty
and ſagacious than other men, reaſon your ſelf
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100726:79"/>
into brutality, and whilſt you grow over-wiſe
in your own eyes, be the moſt fatally miſtaken
and loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould you abandon your ſelf to deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and leave your ſelf without any refuge
in adverſity, we are well and chearful here at
preſent, God be thanked; but the time will
come when God will ſtand us in ſtead, when
we ſhall have need of the retreats and comforts
of Religion. Above all things in the world,
leave not your ſelf without hope in your latter
end, do as becometh a man of your parts and
diſcretion, ſuſpect your own ſuſpicions, and let
not the opinion you have, that other men are
under prejudices, prejudice you againſt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for believing. Come deal ingenuouſly,
and open your breaſt, propound the grounds
of your ſuſpicions, the objections you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Religion; and though I cannot promiſe
you that I will anſwer them all to your ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet I doubt not but here is one that
will.</p>

                  <p>Look you, Gentlemen, you put me
into a great ſtrait; for if upon this invitation
of yours, I do not diſcloſe my mind to you, I
ſhall ſeem diſingenuous, and you will think
worſe of me than perhaps I deſerve; and on
the other ſide, if I do diſcover my ſentiments,
it is probable, that my Creed will fall ſo many
Articles ſhort of yours, that we ſhall break
out into ſome heats, and endanger the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our neighbourly converſation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſince it ſeems to be your deſire, I will be
plain with you, in confidence, that as you are
Gentlemen, you will deal ingenuouſly with me,
and if you can do me no good, you will do me
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100726:80"/>
no hurt; my meaning is, that if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
you do not convince my reaſon, I hope you
will not defame my perſon, nor expoſe me to
the inſolencies of the Rabble, who believe in
groſs and by whole Sale, and throw dirt upon
all that chew what they ſwallow.</p>
                  <p>Now in the firſt place,<note place="margin">The Epicurean Creed.</note> that
you may not think me a perfect
Sceptick, I declare to you, that
I acknowledge the Being of a God, and that
not only becauſe the generality of mankind, and
even <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf owned ſo much, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not conceivable how the world ſhould
be without one; for no wit or reaſon of man
can evince to me, how any thing ſhould begin
to be without ſome neceſſary and eternal Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent,
to begin the motion, and to bring it into
Being; or which is the ſame thing in effect,
there can be no ſecond Cauſe, if there be no
firſt.</p>
                  <p>But then beyond this you muſt pardon me,
for to deal ſincerely with you, I do not think
that this God minds or troubles himſelf about
the world after he hath made it. Much leſs
do I ſee any ſufficient ground for that which
<hi>Philander</hi> hath been talking ſo warmly about,
namely, a world to come. And for eternal
life (which men ſpeak ſuch great things of) I
profeſs I look upon it as a flat impoſſibility,
for as much as I ſee men die, but ſee no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for a belief, that there is any life or exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
out of a body.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome other points of affinity with
theſe that I withold my aſſent from; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you have challenged me to a rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
therefore to give fair play, and to put
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100726:80"/>
the buſineſs between us to an iſſue, I will
inſiſt but upon one point, and that ſhall be the
ſame which we fell into by chance at our firſt
coming together; namely, whether there be
ſuch a thing as a publick Tribunal or general
Judgment, where mens actions ſhall be review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and cenſured after this life. Prove me but
this one point ſufficiently and plainly, and I
will grant you all the reſt.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Now you ſhew your ſelf a man, and
a ſhrewd one too, though not a
Chriſtian.<note place="margin">The great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral influence of the belief of a Judgment.</note> For I muſt acknowledg
that you have with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
pitcht upon the very Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
point of Religion: and
which, if it be proved (as I do
not doubt but it ſhall be) will infer all the
reſt: but if it miſcarry, all falls with it The
perſwaſion of a Judgment to come is the great
awe upon mens Conſciences, the principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of virtue and piety, the reſtraint and check
upon vice and wickedneſs, and indeed the ſinew
of Civil Government, and bond of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
This both ſuppoſes the Being of a God
(which you grant) and of a Providence alſo
(which you deny); for if there were not a God,
it is evident there could be no Providence in this
World, nor Judgment in another: and this,
if it be granted or proved, neceſſarily draws
after it rewards and puniſhments in the life to
come; for otherwiſe a Judgment would be but
a matter of curioſity, and a trouble to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
You have therefore, in making choice
of this for the critical or deciſive point, given
great proof of your own ſagacity, and put the
matter upon a right iſſue.</p>

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>What proof do you require of this?
Why ſhould not the teſtimony of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſatisfie you? For in the firſt place, if
there be a God (which you have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
you cannot but think it reaſonable, that if
he intend to judge the World, he ſhould give
ſome intimation of it to the ſons of men before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
ſince they muſt needs be ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the knowledge of it, and then in the
next place the Scripture cannot be denied to be
as expreſs and full in this particular, as it is
poſſible for words to make it. There God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
and conſirms it innumerable times, and
the more to awaken men to the conſideration
of it, and preparation for it, he is ſaid to have
appointed a ſet time for it, he hath foretold
who ſhall be the Judge, with what pomp and
retinue he ſhall come attended, what meaſures
he ſhall proceed by, and what ſhall be the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances

with the Opinions of men, you might complain
I did you wrong; for in ſuch a caſe your denial
would have as much authority as their aſſertion:
but I hope God may be believed upon his own
word, eſpecially in a buſineſs of this nature,
which depends ſo much upon the determination
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100726:81"/>
of his will; for who can tell Gods mind better

                  <p>I, but that is the Queſtion, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi>

                  <p>That which we call by the name of
holy Scripture, is nothing elſe but a collection
of ſuch declarations of the mind of the Divine
Majeſty, as he hath thought fit from time to
time to make to the ſons of men. And thoſe
Books, which are ſo called, have been reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
by wiſe men in all Ages upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
as ſuch all imaginable care hath been
taken to preſerve them from corruption or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation,
and ſeveral of the beſt of men
have expoſed their lives, rather than conſent
to the deſtruction of them. Now why ſhould
you call in queſtion the Authority of theſe
Books, which you cannot do without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wiſdom of the moſt able, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of the moſt honeſt of men, and upon
the ſame terms you derogate from the Faith of
all mankind, and muſt (if you will be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial)
abrogate the credit of all the old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
in the World. For as much as (beſides
all other conſiderations) theſe Sacred Records,
I mean the Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
do bear an irrefragable teſtimony to
each other, and as a pair of Indentures, juſtifie
one another. Which you will eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of, if you conſider, that theſe two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100726:82"/>
were written in ſeveral very remote Ages,
and conſequently by perſons that could hold no
correſpondence one with another, and were in
the cuſtody of thoſe that were of ſuch contrary
intereſts and opinions, that it was impoſſible
they either would or could conſpire together
to put a cheat upon the World in them. Now
if notwithſtanding theſe two Books (in the
circumſtances aforeſaid) ſhall verifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo as that whatſoever the Old Teſtament
promiſes, the New Teſtament performs, what
the one foretold the other repreſents the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of; what ground is or can there
be to ſuſpect the truth of them? For if ſeveral
Witneſſes, and thoſe of ſeveral Countries, and
of contrary intereſts, ſuch as never ſaw the faces
of one another before, and therefore neither
would nor could combine together and contrive
their ſtory, and eſpecially being examined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
too, ſhall notwithſtanding jump in the
ſame matter of fact and circumſtances alſo,
there is no man ſo humorſome and abounding
in his own ſenſe, but will allow their evidence
to be good and ſubſtantial; then much more is
there very good ground to believe theſe Books,
which have all theſe advantages, and ſeveral
other, which I will not inſiſt upon.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are pretty things which you
ſay; but this is not that kind of proof I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from you: if this be all the ſatisfaction
you can give me, I am where I was.</p>

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>No, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> this is not all I have
to ſay; but I thought fit to remonſtrate to you
the ſufficiency of this kind of proof in it ſelf,
which men of your way are apt to make ſo
ſlight of, and thence to convince you, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100726:82"/>
thoſe men that take up with this alone, are not
ſuch ſoft and credulous people as you are wont
to repreſent them.</p>
                  <p>But what if I had no other
proof but this,<note place="margin">It is juſt prudence to prepare for a day of Judgment, thought the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: were leſs than it is.</note> I do not find
that you are able to reply any
thing to it, it is an eaſier thing
to hough at an Argument, than
to anſwer it. Beſides, if this way of probation
were far leſs conſiderable than it is, yet you
know that any evidence will ſerve againſt none,
and the meaneſt Arguments will carry a cauſe
when there is nothing to be ſaid on the other
ſide. If you could but pretend to prove on
your part, that there were no ſuch thing as a
Judgment to come, you had then ſome reaſon
to be ſtrict in your demands of proof from me
of what I aſſert: but in a true balance the leaſt
grain or moment in the world will caſt the ſcale
when there is nothing againſt it. Now ſince
you know well enough, you can offer no kind
of proof of an aſſertion contrary to this we
have before us, nothing in the earth but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
doubts, grave ſuſpicions, and, perhaps it
may not be ſo, I appeal to your impartial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whether it be not more fit to ſuſpect (at
leaſt) that it is ſo where there is ſome proof
of it, than to ſuſpect it is not ſo where no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is given for the negative, nay indeed
where none can be given.</p>
                  <p>Negatives, you know, are hard to prove in
general, but eſpecially in ſuch a caſe as this is:
For he that undertakes to prove ſuch a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
hath but one of theſe two ways to do it,
<hi>viz.</hi> either he muſt affirm, that he hath ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole ſtate of Nature, and ſeen all the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100726:83"/>
Cauſes that are in working, and then muſt aſſert
<hi>de facto,</hi> that there is no ſuch thing upon the
Loom as that he denies; and alſo that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
underſtands the whole mind and will of
God, and that he intends no ſuch thing; or elſe
he muſt demonſtrate by reaſon, that it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impoſſible, and a flat contradiction, that any
ſuch thing ſhould be: either of which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
without intolerable abſurdity, affirm in the
preſent caſe.</p>
                  <p>So that, as I ſaid, you have nothing but bare
ſuſpicions on your ſide (whatever Arguments I
have on mine.) Now beſides the inequal ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of nothing againſt ſomething, be it never
ſo ſmall, do but conſider what ſtrange impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it is to adventure ſo great a ſtake, as all
your intereſt in another World amounts to,
upon a meer <hi>non putâram;</hi> for what if ſuch a
thing ſhould happen to prove true at laſt, what
will become of you then, what a ſad condition
are you caſt into!</p>
                  <p>Wiſe men are wont to value not only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,

alſo; now ſeeing it is not impoſſible
but ſuch a thing may be, and it is of infinite
conſequence, if it ſhould be, there is all the
wiſdom in the world to be provided for it. You
will ſay, It may not be; but that is all that
Inſidelity it ſelf can enable you to ſay, and then
ſure it is far ſafer to ſuppoſe that it may be, for
no hurt can come of that, but the danger is
unſpeakable on the other ſide, if it ſhould prove
to be true. In a word, in ſuch a caſe as this is,
it is a wiſe mans part rather to believe upon
ſlight evidence, than to disbelieve upon great
preſumptions.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe you ſhall have preſently, and
do not think I triſle with you, or decline the
proof I promiſed, becauſe I proceed thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
and ſlowly with you: The true reaſon
whereof is, becauſe I would rather your own
prudence ſhould incline you to believe, than
that my Arguments ſhould preſs you to it, and
I much more deſire that you ſhould be ſafe,

it is only your concern that we go upon, have
therefore a little patience that we may rightly
underſtand one another, and ſince you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
Scripture-proof, give me leave to ask you
particularly what kind of proof you expect of
this matter under our conſideration.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, I hope you do not require
ſenſible evidence of a day of
Judgment,<note place="margin">What kind of proof and what meaſure of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> you were ſaying even

and therefore you did not
believe it. Poſſibly thoſe words
ſlipt from you undviſedly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is (you know) a thing
future which we are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
about, and ſenſible proof cannot be
required of that without flat contradiction: it
is as if a man ſhould deſire to ſee that which
confeſſedly is not to be ſeen, and that a thing
ſhould be that is not, or be and not be at the
ſame time; you know you cannot have ſenſible
evidence to day that the Sun will riſe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
in ſhort, neither of any thing paſt nor
future, but only of that which is preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:100726:84"/>
There are ſome men in this Age, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you may be acquainted with them, who
will only appeal to their ſenſes, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they reject the notion of God and of Spirits,
meerly becauſe they can ſee no ſuch things.
Now if I thought this were your Opinion, I
muſt go another way to work than I intended;
but if it will content you that I make the point
ſeem reaſonable and clear to the eyes of your
mind, though I do not gratifie your bodily
eyes with a ſtrange proſpect, then I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
as I deſigned.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, we are agreed for that. I did,
I confeſs, ſpeak of ſeeing Heaven, but there
was no contradiction in that; becauſe if there
be any ſuch place, it is ſuppoſed to be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exiſtent, and therefore may be viſible: yet
I do not expect to ſee the Judgment till the
time comes, becauſe futures are not to be ſeen,
but foreſeen. Go on therefore, and give me
rational evidence, and it ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>But there is another thing I deſire to
be reſolved of, namely, what meaſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of rational evidence you will be ſatisfied
with. The reaſon of my inquiry is this, ſome
men there are who highly pretend to a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to believe upon juſt grounds, but when it
comes to tryal, they are humorſome and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptious,
they will require ſuch evidence as the
nature of the thing cannot admit of (even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it to be true) they expect ſuch proof as
ſhall leave no room for cavil and exception,
ſuch as a man can find no evaſion from, but that
will extort an aſſent from him whether he will
or no. Now I muſt tell you, this is very hard
and unreaſonable in any caſe whatſoever, for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100726:84"/>
as much as the wit of man is fitter to pull
down than to build up, and it is the eaſieſt
thing in the world to find ſhifts and cavils, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that he muſt believe very little indeed,
that will admit of nothing which ſome ſlight
objection or other may be made againſt. God
himſelf hath provided no remedy for contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and ſuch men muſt go on, and periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cure; for no Argument can eſcape a capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humor.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if ſuch ſtrict demands of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were at any time allowable, yet can they
by no means be reaſonably inſiſted upon in ſuch
a caſe as this; for if ſuch irreſiſtible evidence
were to be had in this matter, there would be
no room for virtue, it would then be a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
action to believe, and no inſtance of choice,
nor any Argument of a virtuous mind? For
what can be praiſe of rewardableneſs of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which a man cannot chuſe but do; or
what excellency is there in Faith, when there
is no pretence in the world for unbelief?</p>
                  <p>Therefore all that you can juſtly and wiſely
expect in the preſent caſe is, that there be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground given you for a diſcreet choice,
and over-weight enough in one ſcale to incline
the judgment of a prudent man, ſo far that he
ſhall ſee it is more reaſonable that he believe,
than that he do not. This is very properly
to be eſteemed conviction of our reaſon; this
is the juſt Standard of prudence, and this is the
Principle that wiſe men govern themſelves by
in weighty affairs. And indeed, if no man ſhould
determine himſelf to the purſuit of a buſineſs
until there were no objection, no excuſe, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or pretence to the contrary, all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100726:85"/>

                  <p>Yes, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> let me put
you in mind of one thing more,
which is, that <hi>Biophilus</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you to hold the ſcales even,
otherwiſe an over-weight in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them will not be diſcernable; my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that he agree to be ſincerely indifferent,
and willing to believe on the one ſide as well
as on the other: for I have found by my own
experience, that whilſt a man retains a partial
fondneſs for an Opinion, it is not all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the world ſhall beat him out of it, he
will ſee all that which makes for him as through
a magnifying glaſs, and ſo think it great and
conſiderable, and contrariwiſe all that which
is againſt him ſhall ſeem little and deſpicable.
But when a man comes to this paſs, that he is
content one ſide ſhould be true as well as the
other, then (and not till then) the beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
will carry it. Therefore unleſs you premiſe
this, you will ſtrive againſt the ſtream, and
diſpute in vain.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Thank you heartily for that, <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
It is very true, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> that if you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
reſolution and prejudice againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
I am to make to you, that will be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of proof againſt all the Arguments that
can be brought, and then we had as good ſtay
here as go further and loſe our labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:100726:85"/>
But why, good <hi>Biophilus,</hi> ſhould you not lie
as fair towards the Doctrine which I am aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as towards the contrary?
Nay,<note place="margin">It is greatly a mans intereſt that Religion ſhould be true.</note> why ſhould you not look
upon it as greatly your intereſt,
that there ſhould be another
World, and a Judgment at the
end of this? It is certain, you and all of us
muſt dye, there is no peradventure in that, and
it were a moſt ſad and diſmal thing to think of
it, if death put an utter end to a man, ſo that
all his comforts and all his hopes expire with
him. And I wonder in my heart how any man
can think of death with any meaſure of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon thoſe terms; and that it doth not
make him ſullen and melancholy all the days of
his life. You will ſay he muſt yield to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but that is a remedy worſe than the diſeaſe
(if it be poſſible) to ſeek a cure for death in
deſperation; to tell me there is a neceſſity of
dying, is only to tell me there is no help in the
caſe, which is the very thing I complain of.</p>
                  <p>And this conſideration is ſo much the more
ſharp and cutting, by how much the more a
mans life hath been pleaſant and comfortable.
As for a man that hath all his life time been
oppreſſed with calamities, pinched with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
covered with obloquy, or afflicted with
horrible pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may ſeem eaſie to him
to dye, that ſo he may have that reſt in the
grave which he could not have above ground;
and though he thinks he ſhall be ſenſible of no
comfort there, yet he ſhall fare as well as other
men in that ſtate. But for him that hath had
good treatment in the world, pleaſant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,
tempting fortunes and enjoyments,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100726:86"/>
for ſuch a man to think of death, which will
ſpoil him of all his ornaments, and level him
with the duſt, that will interrupt all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
put an end to all his deſigns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
and draw a dark veil over all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
I ſay, if ſuch a man hath nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him againſt death, if there be no life after
this, but a man muſt for ever forſake and be
forſaken of all his felicities, I cannot ſee how
he can poſſibly avoid an unſpeakable abhorrence
of it: nay, that's not all neither; for methinks
it ſhould render all his preſent enjoyments not
only inſipid and loathſom, but even a very tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him whilſt he is in the midſt of them.</p>
                  <p>Now why ſhould any man reſiſt the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in this caſe, the only conſolatory againſt
the ſumm of all calamities, which is the hopes
of another life? Why ſhould he be willing to
dye as the beaſt dyes, and to abandon himſelf to
the grave to rottenneſs and oblivion? It were
certainly better never to have been born, than
both to live in perpetual fear of dying, and
being dead, to be as if a man had never lived;
better never to have taſted the ſweets of life,
than to be only tantalized, and by that time he
begins to live, to begin to dye, and then be
eternally deprived of what he juſt had a ſmack
and a ſight of.</p>
                  <p>Nay farther yet, if a man had lived only
like a beaſt, it had been no great matter to
dye like a beaſt: If, I ſay, a man lookt no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than his fodder, had no ſenſe of any thing
but eating and drinking, and had a Soul in him
that ſerved only for ſalt to keep the body from
putrefaction, ſo that he never lookt about him,
made no improvement of himſelf, and had no
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100726:86"/>
deſigns in his head, it were leſs matter if he
returned to the earth, which (like a Mole) he
did nothing but root in and turn over whilſt he
was upon it. But for a man of an active Soul,
of improved parts, of reaſon and wiſdom and
uſefulneſs, to be ſmothered in the grave, ſo
that all his Notions and Diſcoveries, all Arts
and Sciences, nay, all his Vertues and Gallantry
of mind, all his hopes and deſigns ſhall be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
broken off and buried in oblivion; this
is ſo ſad and diſmal a thing, that it is able to
diſcourage all ſtudy and induſtry, all care and
culture of a mans ſelf; for why ſhould I ſtrive
to live like a man, if I muſt dye like a beaſt?
Why ſhould I take pains to know, when <hi>by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
knowledge, I ſhould but increaſe my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?</hi>
For as much as the more I know, the more
I ſhall feel my ſelf miſerable, and indeed become
guilty of my own torment: ſo that if there
were no hopes after this preſent life, it would
be a more adviſeable courſe for a man to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
himſelf to the moſt dark and ſqualid Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm,
rather than to weary and wear out
himſelf in the queſt of knowledge, and better
never to apply himſelf to any ſtudy, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
any pains or coſt upon himſelf, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if it were poſſible, it were deſirable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to know any thing, or to think at all. For
why ſhould a man put a cheat upon himſelf?
Why ſhould he take not only unprofitable, but
vexatious pains? In a word, why ſhould he not
ſo live as he muſt dye? To all which add, that
if there were indeed no other world nor life
hereafter; and if there be any man that can
find in his heart to be fond of living upon thoſe
terms, he muſt of neceſſity be a pitiable ſlave
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100726:87"/>
whilſt he continues here the perpetual fears of
death cramping him, and keeping him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
bondage, that he ſhall not have the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or courage to dare to do any brave action;
but contrariwiſe he will be unavoidably tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a wretched Coward and baſe Fellow,
and become a ſordid Paraſite, to flatter and
humor every body meerly upon the account of
ſelf-preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Why therefore ſhould any man be fond of
ſuch an uncomfortable, nay, ſuch a ſottiſh and
debaſing opinion? Why ſhould not a man chuſe
rather to erect his own mind, and be willing
to hope well of himſelf by cheriſhing an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
that he may ſurvive his body, and live
eternally?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no queſtion, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> but
that living for ever is very deſirable, if a man
could hope for ſuch a thing abſolutely, and not
clogged with conditions. As for death it ſelf,
that would have no great matter of formidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in it, if it be either (as I ſuppoſe it) a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
interciſion of all ſenſe: or much leſs, if it
were (as the men of your perſwaſion uſe to
ſpeak) only a dark paſſage to another light.
But the miſchief is, that upon your Hypotheſis,
a judgment muſt paſs upon a man firſt, before
he can arrive at that other life. Now that is
the terrible thing, if I were rid of the danger of
that, it would (as you ſay well) be my intereſt
to believe all the reſt, in ſpight of all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the contrary.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not deſign to impoſe upon you;
for it is very true, there is no paſſage into the
other World, without undergoing a Teſt or
Tryal, whether we be fit for eternal life or no.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100726:87"/>
And it is moſt certain alſo, that if a man dye
an impious, a wicked and baſe perſon, it were
better for him that either he had not been born,
or elſe that the grave and oblivion might cover
him to all Eternity. But what need this fright
any man whilſt he is alive, and may provide
himſelf accordingly? eſpecially ſince the grace
of God puts it in our choice and power to be
good, and ſo qualified, that we may be out of
all danger of miſcarrying in the Judgment.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> can it be thought that God
Almighty ſhould ſeek the ruine of his Creatures,
or that he can have any deſign upon them to
make them eternally miſerable? If he had, there
would not be the ſolemnities of a day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for he would not need to inſnare us in
forms of Law, but might without more ado
have deſtroyed us when he pleaſed, and who
could reſiſt him, or diſpute the caſe with him?
Undoubtedly he is too great a Majeſty to have
any little ends to ſerve, and therefore we can
ſuſpect no hurt from him, and there could be
nothing but the overflowings of his own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that provoked him to make us at the firſt;
and therefore there can be nothing of envy,
malignity, or cruelty in any of his counſels and
deſigns about us.</p>
                  <p>And that all theſe are not meer-ſayings or
ſanguine conjectures of mine, but real truth
(beſides all other ways of probation) you may
be aſſured by this conſideration, that in all
Gods demands from us, as the terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of our happineſs, or (which is all one)
in all the duties he requires at our hands, and
in all th obligations of Religion, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſevere and diſcouraging, nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100726:88"/>
harſh and difficult, much leſs impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
nay, in truth, if things be rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
I believe there will be nothing to be
found in any inſtitution of Religion that ever
was heard of in the world that could go ſo much
againſt the grain with men, as to tempt them
to run the hazard of dying eternally, rather
than to comply with it. And if any ſuch were
to be found, it were ground enough to aſſure
us, that ſuch Inſtitutions proceeded not from
God; for ſuch is his Wiſdom and Benignity,
that he can impoſe nothing as a ſevere Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
purely to abridge our liberty, or to
break our ſpirits, and oppreſs our powers,
but only to raiſe and improve us according
to our utmoſt capacities, and as neceſſary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to train us up as Candidates for eternal
life.</p>
                  <p>I will not deny but there are ſome reſtraints
put upon us, and ſome difficulties we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to encounter, otherwiſe Religion would
have no excellency in it, nor could we have
either the glory or the pleaſure in obtaining
our end and happineſs, if it were won without
ſweat and labour. But I do confidently aſſert,
that theſe difficulties (whatever they are) we
ſhall find juſt reaſon to undergo with all chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
if we do but compare what Religion
promiſes, with what it commands or impoſes.
And as for the Chriſtian Religion in particular,
all this which I have ſaid is ſo remarkably true
of that, that if any thing hath been repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a branch and neceſſary duty thereof, which
is of a contrary nature to what I have now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
I do not doubt with great eaſe to make
it appear, that ſuch ſuggeſtion is either a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100726:88"/>
miſtake, or a notorious ſcandal. Why
then, I ſay, ſhould a man think either ſo ill of
God or of himſelf, as to be afraid or unwilling
to fall into his hands? You cannot forebode
any evil from him, if you are ſatisfied that he
is perfect and happy, full and glorious, juſt
and good; and therefore you muſt condemn
your ſelf of prodigious folly, in not complying
with reaſonable and equitable Laws, and of
being wilfully acceſſory to your own calamity,
if you dare not undergo his Judgment. So that
upon the whole matter there can be no reaſon,
why you ſhould be unwilling to believe there
is ſuch a thing, and that is all I deſire of you
at preſent, and I heartily conjure you to be true
to your ſelf herein.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, That it is very agreeable to the
Nature and Attributes of God (according to
thoſe notions which we have of him) that he
ſhould call Mankind to ſuch an account, and
judge them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That God Almighty actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
and diſplays ſuch a Providence in this
preſent World, as gives earneſt before-hand,
that he really intends to judge it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three things make way for and ſucceed
each other naturally, and all together amount
to a full proof of the Point in hand. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when I have opened and made them out
ſeverally in the order I have laid them down, I
will leave it to you to collect the reſult of
them.</p>
                  <p>1. I ſay the nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind is ſuch,<note place="margin">Mankind is of ſuch a nature, and endued with ſuch powers, as make it reaſonable for him to expect Judgment.</note> as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
him capable of undergoing
a Judgment in another World;
and therefore it is reaſonable
that he expect it accordingly.
This will appear by the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
following.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place it is notorious, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is endued with a large and comprehenſive
mind, which is not confined to the meer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his ſenſes and things preſent before
him, but hath a vaſt ſcope and proſpect, by
means of which he ſurveys the Univerſe, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
the whole World, and takes within his
verge, as well things paſt and things to come,
as thoſe that are preſent, which no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is capable of but himſelf. The Beaſt hath
no kind of notice of or concern for what was
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100726:89"/>
in former time, nor no ſollicitude about what
may come after; but only applies it ſelf to the
preſent exigencies or conveniences of the body.
But man is very curious and inquiſitive into
Hiſtory, and how things paſt of old long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was born, and is alſo very thoughtful
and anxious what may befal hereafter when he
ſhall be dead and gone. Now this one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alone makes him look as if he were a Being
that were concerned in the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in all the revolutions of Providence,
and at leaſt of more conſequence than to be a
meer Pageant for the ſhort time of this life, or
a Muſhroom to ſhoot out of the earth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to it again, and ſo be as if he had never
been.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we may obſerve, that the mind of
man doth not only conſider the abſolute na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things as they lye ſingly and ſeverally
before it, but compares them together, and
eſtimates their relative natures, the mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
that they have to each other, and the
various aſpects and influences they have upon
each other; and ſo comparing and conferring
things together, raiſes obſervations, makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
deduces concluſions, frames general
maximes, thereby brings things into order and
method, and raiſes Arts and Sciences. All or
any of which things no Creature below himſelf
makes any pretence to, or gives any token of.
From whence we may conclude not only the
preeminence of his Nature, but that he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to higher purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, mankind is endowed with liberty
of choice and freedom of will, by virtue of
which he doth not only move himſelf by his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100726:90"/>
own internal Principles and vital Energy, but
alſo can determine himſelf to this object or
that, and either purſue or deſiſt the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at his own pleaſure: inſomuch that he is
neither carried by the ſwinge of any ſuperiour
cauſes, nor fatally allured by the powerful
charms of any objects from without, no nor
by the efficacy of any arguments ariſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
nor any impreſſion whatſoever (ſaving
that of God Almighty) can overbear or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede
his own reſolution, but that he can act or
deſiſt, ſuſpend proſecution or purſue his own
choice, and apply himſelf to this object or
that, and follow this argument and motive or
the other; he hath ſuch an Helm within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he can ſail againſt Wind and Tide;
he can move himſelf in a calm, and ſtay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a ſtorm: in a word, he can move which
way, when and how far he will, and ſtop his
own carriere when he pleaſes. The truth of
this we find by daily experience, and we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
pleaſe our ſelves too much in this Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of our Natures. We ſee that which is
better, and follow that which we know to be
worſe; we hear arguments and reject them,
becauſe we will do ſo; we are perſwaded to
the contrary, and yet go on; and when and
whatſoever we act, we find at the ſame time we
could have done quite contrary, if we had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Other Creatures either act meerly as they
are acted by ſuperiour Cauſes drawn by inviſible
wyers, or fatally inclined by the objects and
motives before them; but we are put into the
hand of our own counſels, and wholly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our ſelves, as to our inward reſolutions
and determinations. Now this, as it is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100726:90"/>
diſcrimination of our Natures from theirs,
ſo it hath this peculiar effect, that it renders a
mans actions properly his own, and imputable
to himſelf and to nothing elſe, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fits him to undergo a Judgment for them.</p>
                  <p>But further yet, to make Mankind more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a Judgment, he hath a directive Rule
or Law of Reaſon within him, whereby to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
himſelf both in his elections and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that is, he acts not only freely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinately
in reſpect of any cauſe without
himſelf, but he hath a light within to guide
and direct thoſe free powers of his, that they
may not run riot and move extravagantly, by
the means of which he is enabled both to make
choice of his deſigns, and to ſelect fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
methods of accompliſhing them. For as
he is not ſtaked down to ſome one particular
buſineſs (as generally other Creatures are) but
hath great ſcope to expatiate in, and variety
to pleaſe himſelf withal; ſo he hath a Card or
Compaſs given him to ſail by in that vaſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
which lyes before him: that is, he hath a
faculty of diſcerning the difference of things,
and conſequently can judge what is worthy to
be propounded as his poſt and deſign, and alſo
to meaſure and adjuſt the means thereunto,
which renders him more ſit to give an account
both of his elections and proſecutions.</p>
                  <p>Nay farther yet, humane Nature by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of this light within him, hath not only
a capacity of apprehending and judging of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
good and evil, or ſuch things as are only
pleaſant and profitable, or the contrary, but
hath alſo notions of higher good and evil,
which we commonly call Moral; that is, he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100726:91"/>
finds himſelf obliged to have regard to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe beſides and better than his body,
namely, either to the Deity, or to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Mankind, or at leaſt to his own bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, his Soul and Mind. None of which
are at all conſidered by any creature below man,
and there is hardly any part of Mankind (at
leaſt that deſerves to be ſo eſteemed) which doth
not think it ſelf concerned in all theſe. For
we ſee, whoſoever hath any thing of a man in
him, doth think ſome actions to become or
not become him reſpectively meerly as he is a
man, which would admit of no difference, but
be all alike in a Beaſt: whereupon it is, that a
man cannot diſpenſe with himſelf in the doing
of ſeveral things, which are in his power to
do, no not in the dark and the greateſt privacy,
becauſe every man that in any meaſure under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
himſelf, hath a reverence of himſelf, and
the effect of this betrays it ſelf in that quick
ſenſe which Mankind hath peculiarly of ſhame
and honour, which argues him to be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſomething higher than his ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Above all this, it is conſiderable that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
hath not only a ſpeculative apprehenſion
of moral good and evil, but a practical and
very quick and pungent ſenſe of it, which we
call Conſcience, by which he not only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and calls to mind whatſoever hath paſt
him, but reflecting alſo upon the ends and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of his own actions, and comparing
what he hath done both for matter and manner
either with the rule of Reaſon within him, or
ſome other Law, he cenſures and judges himſelf
accordingly. If he hath done well and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that is, hath approved himſelf to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100726:91"/>
he then applauds and comforts himſelf,
and feels an unſpeakable ſatisfaction in his own
mind: As for Example, If a man have behaved
himſelf gallantly towards his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
if he have carried himſelf ingenouſly and
gratefully towards his Friends, his Patrons or
Benefactors; if he have been beneficent to any
part of Mankind; if he have demonſtrated love
to God, or goodneſs and good men; if he have
reſtrained his own rage and paſſions; if he have
reſcued an innocent from the hand of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor,
or done any thing of like nature, the
heart of every man naturally in ſuch a caſe feels
ſuch an inward delight as ſweetens his ſpirits,
and cheers his very countenance. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if he have been falſe, treacherous and
ingrateful; if he have been cruel and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
or have ſaid or done any baſe thing, he is
preſently upbraided, accuſed, condemned and
tormented by himſelf. Now what is all this
but <hi>Praejudicium,</hi> a kind of anticipation of the
Judgment to come?</p>
                  <p>But if any man ſhall pretend this thing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Conſcience, which we now ſpeak of, to be
no natural endowment of Humanity, but only
the effect of Cuſtom and Education; ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may eaſily undeceive himſelf, if he will but
conſider, that all this which I have ſpoken of
Conſcience, both as to the matter and form of
it (or <hi>Syntereſis</hi> and <hi>Syneideſis,</hi> as Learned men
are wont to diſtinguiſh) is ſo univerſal to all
Mankind (at leaſt that have not done violence
to themſelves) that it can with no colour be
imputed to Education, but muſt be reſolved
into the very nature and ſenſe of the Soul. And
moreover, a different notion and apprehenſion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100726:92"/>
of the fore-mentioned particulars, is ſo deeply
implanted in the minds of men, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
any contrary Cuſtom or Education
ſhould abſolutely and totally efface it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is the ſenſe of Nature, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a preſage of the Divine Judgment.</p>
                  <p>To all which add in the laſt place, That the
mind of man ſeems plainly to be above the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and independent of it; for as much as we
ſee, that not only our Reaſon and the powers
of our Souls, are ſo far from decaying with the
body, that contrariwiſe they grow more ſtrong
and vigorous by thoſe very cauſes which impair
the body, I mean, by age, exerciſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Beſides, it is eaſily obſervable, that our
Souls do, as often as they pleaſe, act quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the intereſts and inclinations of our
bodies, and frequently controul the paſſions
thereof, as well as correct and over-rule the
Verdict of our Senſes. Therefore it is not at all
probable, that they ſhould periſh with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but ſurvive to ſome further purpoſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if we take in what I intimated before,
namely, the conſideration of the ſhortneſs of the
time of this life, which is ſo very inconſiderable
for ſo excellent a Being, as the Soul to diſplay it
ſelf in, that it ſeems unworthy of all the aforeſaid
perfections, and more unworthy of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of that Wiſdom which made us, to order
it ſo, unleſs it be that Mankind is placed here only
in a ſtate of probation, and is to be tryed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in order to a more laſting ſubſiſtence and
duration. Which in conſideration of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes,
he cannot but be thought capable of, at
leaſt if there be a Judge as fit to judge him, as he
is fit to undergo a Judgment. Which brings me
to my ſecond Branch.</p>

                  <p>Hold a little, I pray, good <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi>
you have ſpoken many things well and worthily
of the preeminence of humane Nature, and
ſome of them ſuch as are not only ſufficient to
errect a mans ſpirits, and provoke him to hope
well of himſelf, but alſo do render it in ſome
ſort probable, that we are deſigned for ſome
higher uſes, than we commonly apply our ſelves
to. Nevertheleſs you have not reached your
point, nor will all you have ſaid attain the end
you propounded, unleſs you go farther, and
prove the Soul of man to be a Spirit or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
ſubſtance (as the men of your way are
wont to ſpeak) that ſo there may be a plain
foundation for its exiſtence out of the body.
Without which, let it he as excellent a Being
as it can, and adorned with as many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as you can imagine, it cannot be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſtanding at a Tribunal, and undergoing
ſuch a Judgment in another World as we are
ſpeaking of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I could have wiſhed you would have
given me leave to lay all the parts of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
together before you, that ſo you might
have taken a view of it intire and all at once:
and then you might have objected, as you ſhould
have ſeen cauſe. But however I will comply
with your Method, and as to that which you
have thought fit now to interpoſe, I anſwer
theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I ſay, It is not neceſſary to the buſineſs
in hand, that the Soul be proved to be ſtrictly
immaterial and capable of exiſting and acting
out of the body; for as much as at the day of
Judgment I ſuppoſe the body ſhall be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
and then if it ſhould be ſo, that all the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100726:93"/>
powers of the Soul were laid aſleep by death
until that time; yet now upon a re-union with
their proper Organs, they would revive again.
So that I did not in my proof fall ſhort of the
mark I aimed at, but you out-ſhoot the point
in your demand: For whether the Soul be a
ſpiritual ſubſtance or no, ſo long as thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which we have enumerated, belong
to it, there is nothing wanting to make it capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of undergoing a Judgment. But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſpeak my own mind plainly,
and to come home to your ſatisfaction, I muſt
tell you,<note place="margin">The Soul of man proved to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material.</note> that as for my part I
do not doubt but that the Soul
of man is properly and ſtrictly
of a ſpiritual Nature; ſo I am
confident that thoſe things which we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to it, do ſufficiently prove it to be ſo;
ſeeing it is impoſſible to ſalve thoſe <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
or to give any tolerable account of thoſe
great accompliſhments and performances of the
Soul before ſpecified from meer matter, let it
be modified or circumſtantiated how it can.</p>
                  <p>Simple perception of objects is of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rank of humane perfections, and indeed is
not proper to humane Nature, but common to
Brutes; yet this ſeems impoſſible to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by meer matter. For the eye, though it be
a very admirable and exquiſite Organ, can by no
means be ſaid to perceive the objects of ſight,
but only to tranſmit or preſent them to ſome
perceptive power. It doth, I ſay, only as a glaſs
repreſent the Species or image of the thing,
which even a dead eye or an hole, will in
ſome meaſure perform; but it makes no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the object at all, as appears by this,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100726:93"/>
that all objects are tranſmitted reverſed, or
with the heels upward, through the eye, and
ſo left, till ſome higher power ſets them right
and on their legs, and judges of their diſtance
and other circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be ſo, that matter thus advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
diſpoſed and improved, as in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
ſtructure of the eye, cannot perform
that one act of ſimple perception, what ſhall
become of all thoſe nobler actions of the Soul?
and into what ſhall they be reſolved? Such as
ſelf-motion, the ſtrange celerity of thought,
memory of that which is paſt, prudence and
forecaſt for that which is to come, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other ſtrange operations. Is it imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that meer matter ſhould underſtand, argue,
diſpute, conſider and confer the relation of one
thing to another, and thence infer conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and make concluſions? Is it likely that
meer body and quantity ſhould be ſenſible of
ſhame and honour, nay be conſcientious too,
and accuſe, condemn, and torture it ſelf; or
which is moſt wonderful of all, check, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul,
deny, limit, and mortifie it ſelf? He that
will undertake to ſhew how all theſe things
may be performed by Atoms and motion only,
is a ſubtil Mechaniſt indeed, and I do not
doubt but at the ſame rate ſuch a man may be
able to make a new World, when he pleaſes,
with the ſame Atoms as Materials. For it is
evident, there is more intricacy in this little
world of Man, than in the whole fabrick of
Heaven and Earth beſides.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if matter or body cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the aforeſaid operations, then the Soul
of man, which doth perform them, muſt be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100726:94"/>
acknowledged to be a ſpiritual ſubſtance.</p>

                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>In troth you talk very ſhrewdly; but
for my life, I cannot underſtand what you mean
by this thing which you call Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I reject the notion as gibberiſh and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Softly, good <hi>Biophilus,</hi> what reaſon
is there for that haſty concluſion? Muſt we
needs deny every ſuch thing to be, as is hard
to underſtand? Muſt we, like dull Boys, tear out
the Leſſon that is difficult to learn? Is nothing
true but what is eaſie, nor poſſible but what is
facile? But beſides, let me tell you upon ſecond
thoughts, there is not more difficulty in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Nature of Spirits, than there is
in conceiving how all the aforeſaid operations
ſhould be performed witout them, no nor half
ſo much neither; ſo that nothing is gotten by
the objection; for it is a very vain thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
difficulty, when at the ſame time you are
forced to acknowledge the thing to be neceſſary.
But why, I pray you, what is the cauſe that
ſpiritual ſubſtance is not as intelligible as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal?</p>

                  <p>O Sir, there is a vaſt difference in

                  <p>Nay, believe me, there you are out,
you ſee and feel only the accidents of a bodily

than you can ſee or feel a Spirit.</p>

                  <p>Pardon me, at leaſt I ſee and feel the

                  <p>That is cloſe and to the purpoſe, I

other things.</p>

                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, there is it now. I perceive
now, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> you have a deſire to ſee with
your mouth, and hear with your eyes. For as
reaſonably every jot may you expect to do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe, as to frame a ſenſible imagination
of a Spirit. That which we call Imagination
(you know) is nothing elſe but the impreſs of
the colour, bigneſs, or ſome other accidents
(of a thing that hath been preſented to our

diverſified by our phancy. But now if a Spirit
have no colour nor bulk, nor ſuch other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to be repreſented to our phancy through
our outward ſenſes, how is it poſſible you ſhould
have an image of it there? No, no; ſpiritual
Beings are only capable of affording us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Idea, namely, our higher faculty of
Reaſon from obſervation of their effects and
operations, concludes their Eſſence, and takes
an eſtimate of their Nature; and indeed it is a

of that kind of Beings.</p>

to come is,<note place="margin">The natural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons men have of God, render it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect that he will judge the World.</note> that as on the one ſide
Mankind appears to be fit and
capable of being judged hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
ſo on the other hand it is
agreeable to the Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, and to thoſe notions we have
of a Deity, that he ſhould call the World to
ſuch an account, and this appears briefly thus.</p>
                  <p>The moſt common and moſt natural notion
which men have of the Divine Majeſty is, that
he is a Being abſolutely perfect, that is, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other accompliſhments) that he is a moſt
powerful, wiſe, juſt and good Being; there is
hardly any body that thinks of a God, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
him under theſe Attributes and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and he that diveſts him of any of theſe
Perfections, renders him neither an object of
fear nor of love, and conſequently not a God:
inſomuch that were it not for politick ends,
namely, to avoid infamy or other puniſhment
amongſt men, doubtleſs thoſe that deny to him
any of theſe Attributes, had as good flatly deny
him to have any Being at all.</p>
                  <p>Now if theſe things be included in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
notion of God, they not only capacitate
him to be a Judge of the World, if he pleaſes,
but give great aſſurance that he will do it; for
if he be a wiſe Being, he cannot but ſee how
things go, and particularly how his Creatures
carry themſelves here below; if he be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
he hath it in his hand to rectifie thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
he obſerves amongſt them, and both
to puniſh the evil and to reward the good. And
if he be good and juſt, it cannot but be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him that he will ſet things to rights
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100726:95"/>
one time or other, when his Wiſdom ſhall
think fit; but it is evident, this is not done
exactly and anſwerably to thoſe Attributes of
his in this World, therefore there is no reaſon
to doubt but he will aſſuredly do it in another
World; and therefore the Scripture tells us,
<hi>He hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the
world in righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

a God (and that not only political<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as you ſuſpect) but upon the Principles of
Reaſon) yet I muſt profeſs to you, I do not
think the natural notion of God includes thoſe

                  <p>Ah, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> I am heartily ſorry to
find ſo unworthy a notion of God ſtill to find
any room in your thoughts (though it were but
in ſuſpicion only.) It is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
indeed,<note place="margin">God not a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Agent.</note> that if he be only
a neceſſary Agent, then all fear
of a Judgment is diſcharged, and as certain
that all Religion can then be nothing elſe but a
groundleſs Superſtition at the beſt. For then
God muſt needs be a very tame Deity which
men may play withal, and abuſe at pleaſure,
as the Frogs did by their wooden King in the
Fable.</p>
                  <p>But then in the Name of Goodneſs, what
need is there of any God at all, if a neceſſary
Agent will ſerve the turn? Why can we not
as well ſuppoſe the World to be eternal, as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100726:96"/>
make ſuch a contemptible Being, as a neceſſary
Agent is, to be eternal, only to give begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the World.</p>
                  <p>Or rather, why if we attribute one Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>i, e.</hi> Eternity to him, why not all the reſt,
which ſeem to be inſeparable from it? For as
much as it is not imaginable how the firſt Cauſe
ſhould be the meaneſt of all, and he that gave
thoſe other perfections to other things, ſhould
be deſtitute of them himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Or how can we believe that ſuch a fettered,
impotent, unthinking and unwiſe Being, ſhould
make a World in that beauty and perfection
which this World conſiſts of? Or at leaſt how
is it poſſible that a natural or neceſſary Agent
(which is like a Gally-ſlave chained down to
his Bench, and confined to his Task and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
ſhould make a World with ſuch curioſity
and diverſity of things, yet with that exquiſite
order and harmony which we obſerve in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  <p>Do you think that the frame of things could
not poſſibly have been any otherwiſe than they
are? Can you phanſie that nothing could have
been better nor worſe than it is now? If you
ſee any footſteps of wiſdom or choice, any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
that any thing ſhould have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than it is, you forgo your neceſſary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent?</p>
                  <p>Do you not ſee great and manifeſt inſtances
of deſign and contrivance in the order of things,
<hi>viz.</hi> one thing fitted to another, and one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to another, and all together conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to ſome publick end and uſe? Now ſure a
neceſſary Agent could not guide things ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it hath no ends or deſigns of its own.</p>

                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:100726:96"/>
Again, if God be a neceſſary Agent, I would
fain be reſolved how it comes to paſs that we
are not ſo too? I think you granted me even
now that we chuſe our own way, propound
ends to our ſelves, and voluntarily purſue
them, when we could (if we pleaſed) as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chuſe and act contrary, and this we juſtly
glory in as the perfection of our Nature. Now
how to conceive that I ſhould be a free Agent,
and that he who made me ſo ſhould be a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, that is, that the effect ſhould be more
excellent than the cauſe, neither I nor (as I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect)
any body elſe can underſtand?</p>
                  <p>But I need not in this place induſtriouſly ſet
my ſelf to confute this odd conceit of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a neceſſary Agent, becauſe in my third
Branch I ſhall fundamentally undermine it, and
(as I think) leave neither colour nor pretence
for it, and therefore with your leave I now
haſten to that.</p>

                  <p>My third and laſt
Point for the proof of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come is this:<note place="margin">There is an actual Providence in this World, therefore there will be a Judgment in the next.</note> God doth
actually exerciſe ſuch a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in and over the World for
the preſent, as gives great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that he will judge it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
For theſe are as it were the two ſeveral
ends of the ſame chain, a Providence here, and
a Judgment hereafter. They do naturally and
mutually draw on each other. If there be a
Judgment to come, there muſt be a provident
Eye over the World for the preſent in order to
it: that is, God muſt ſo mind the World, that
he perfectly underſtand how things go, how
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100726:97"/>
men carry themſelves, what there is amiſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, what requires puniſhment, and
what deſerves a reward; otherwiſe he cannot
be ſaid to judge, foraſmuch as without this it
might rather be ſaid, there is a day of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
coming, than a day of Judgment. And
on the other ſide, if there be a Providence in
this World, and it be true that God obſerves
how men carry themſelves towards him, it muſt
ſpeak his intention to reward and puniſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in proportion to ſuch obſervation; for
otherwiſe that Providence would be fruitleſs
and to no purpoſe, it would be a meer matter
of vain curioſity, and a needleſs trouble to the
Divine Majeſty, as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> objected. But
now that God doth exerciſe ſuch a Providence
in this World, as from whence we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
preſage a Judgment to come, I think
will abundantly appear by theſe three things.</p>

               <p>1.<note place="margin">Prophecy a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Argument of a Providence in the World.</note> Firſt, I ground the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Providence in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
World upon the Prophecies
and Predictions of things before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
which have been verified
by real effects in their reſpective times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
It is evident, that whoſoever is able
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100726:97"/>
certainly to foretel things before they are, muſt
ſee through all the Series of Cauſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſuch events: eſpecially if he define alſo
the preciſe time and other circumſtances of the
accompliſhment; but above all, whoſeover
ſhall declare before-hand, not only what ſhall
come to paſs according to the courſe of natural
and neceſſary Cauſes, but alſo ſuch things as are
caſual and contingent, or ſubject to the choice
and indifferency of free and voluntary Agents,
muſt have a mighty reach with him, and make
a very curious and accurate inſpection into the
Conjunctions and Conſpiracy of all things, as
well as into their particular Natures, Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Inclinations: for as every Effect muſt
have its Cauſes before it can be; ſo the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſuch effect muſt depend upon a certain
knowledge of thoſe reſpective cauſes which are
pregnant of it; therefore if there ever have
been ſuch a thing as Prophecy, there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>Now for the matter of fact, or that there
have been certain and punctual predictions of
things long before they came to paſs, is the
conſtant belief of all Nations, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
it muſt give the lye to the greateſt and
beſt part of Mankind. You may remember
that <hi>Tully</hi> purſues this Argument in his Books,
<hi>De Divinatione,</hi> and he there gives too many
and too remarkable inſtances of it, to be denied
or eluded; but I ſhall chuſe to ſet before you
only two paſſages out of the holy Scripture to
this purpoſe. For though I perceive you have
not ſuch a reverence for thoſe Books as they
deſerve, yet ſuch palpable matters of fact as I
ſhall inſtance in, and which were of ſo publick
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100726:98"/>
a concern and general notice, as whereupon
the revolution of whole Nations depended, can
afford no ground for calling in queſtion the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
truth of them. And let me tell you,
I make choice of theſe inſtances out of thoſe
Writings, for no other cauſe but for the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the fact, and the eaſineſs of confutation,
if it had been otherwiſe than true.</p>
               <p>The former of the two paſſages is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the ſlavery of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
thence, above four hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to paſs, and the accompliſhment
(when the time came) anſwering the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
preciſely to a very day, ſo as to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the whole body of the people, and the
remembrance of it perpetuated by an anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Solemnity ever after, as you may ſee <hi>Exod.</hi>
12. 41.</p>
               <p>The other inſtance is the Babyloniſh Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
which was foretold above ſeventy years
before it came to paſs, and that in a time of
the greateſt unlikelihood that any ſuch cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
ſhould befal; namely, it was propheſied
of when the Jews were in the greateſt peace
and proſperity. And then for the term of this
Captivity, that was foretold to laſt 70 years,
neither more nor leſs; and both theſe periods
(as well as other circumſtances) were exactly,
and to admiration, hit in the event of things.</p>
               <p>Now in both theſe inſtances, the things were
propheſied of ſo long before-hand, there were
ſo many obſtacles in the way of their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,
and ſo much of the will of man alſo
intereſted in both the caſes, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſuch punctual exactneſs is to be ſeen
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100726:98"/>
in the Event, that it is plainly impoſſible that
humane wit ſhould ſo much as gueſs probably
at them; therefore the Predictions muſt be
grounded upon Divine intimation: and then
God is ſo far from being a neceſſary Agent,
that it is apparent he minds the World, and
looks narrowly into all the parts of it, from
one end to another, and governs and manages
inferiour Cauſes.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Miracles neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily argue a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> My ſecond proof of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Providence in this World
is from Miracles. By a Miracle
I mean any thing coming to paſs, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the matter or manner of it above the
power of natural Cauſes, or at leaſt contrary
to their eſtabliſht courſe and order; whether
it be effected by heightening them above their
ordinary pitch, or accelerating their motion,
or by ſuddenly bringing thoſe cauſes together
which lay at a diſtance; or whether it be by
depreſſing, ſuſpending or ſuperſeding any of
them.</p>
               <p>And I reaſon thus: If any thing have ever
been brought to paſs above the capacity or out
of the method of the natural and common
Cauſes, then there is an active Deity which
exerts his power in that caſe. Or if ever the
courſe of Nature hath been interrupted, it muſt
be by the interpoſition of the ſupreme Cauſe:
For it is neither intelligible, that Nature ſhould
go out of courſe of it ſelf, without its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and failure; nor poſſible that being once
ſo out of courſe, it ſhould ever be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it ſelf into its former order without the
help of Omnipotency: therefore if ever there
have been a Miracle in the World, there is
proof of a Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:100726:99"/>
Now that ſuch extraordinary things, as we
here ſuppoſe, have happened, cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without great ignorance, or denied without
impudence. I know there is a ſort of witty
men (in their way) who endeavour to put a
ſlight upon Miracles, and therefore are very
captious and critical in ſuch caſes as this; but
if they can elude ſome occurrences that have
been believed or pretended miraculous, yet
they will never be able to evade them all. And
if there have been but one acknowledged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in all the time of this World, it will be
ſufficient to prove a Providence. They will
perhaps impute ſome Cures that have been ſaid
to be done by Miracle, to the efficacy of ſome
Medicine, although they can neither tell us
what that ſpecifick Remedy was, nor much leſs
tell us how the Symptoms ſhould ſo ſuddenly
ceaſe upon the uſe of it. It may be they will
tell you in the general (with confidence enough)
that the ſtrange things done in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in
the Wilderneſs, were effected by the ſudden
application of Actives to Paſſives; but cannot
ſo much as pretend to ſatisfie any man how
ſuch remote Cauſes were brought together and
exalted to ſuch an extraordinary degree of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
as to produce ſuch admirable effects on
the ſudden as thoſe caſes import.</p>
               <p>Or if they could ſpeak tolerable ſenſe in ſome
of thoſe particulars, yet what natural account
can be given of the raiſing of the dead? or of
unlearned mens ſpeaking all kind of Languages
in an inſtant? What natural Cauſe will they
aſſign of the Suns ſtanding ſtill in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time?
Or of that preternatural Eclipſe at our Saviour's
Paſſion? What could intercept the Suns light
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100726:99"/>
when the two Luminaries were in oppoſition?
Or what reſtored it to its motion again when
it was interrupted, as in the former inſtance?
Or to its light again when it intermitted, as in
the latter inſtance? To endeavour to give na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
accounts of theſe things, will prove as
abſurd and ridiculous to reaſon, as to deny the
matter of fact, is void of Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>But if any of theſe inſtances will not paſs
with ſuch men, becauſe they were over, long
before our time, or becauſe the truth of them
depends upon the Authority of Scripture; there
are other innumerable paſſages in all Ages not
liable to that exception, that cannot be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into any Cauſe leſs than a Supreme and
Omnipotent. Amongſt which, what will they
ſay to this which happens almoſt every year?
Namely, that after a long wet ſeaſon, it ſhall
ſuddenly clear up and be fair weather again,
and contrariwiſe after a long dry ſeaſon, it ſhall
unexpectedly be wet and rainy. Whereas if
they look only to natural Cauſes, the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
muſt happen. Foraſmuch as the more
rain hath been at any time, the more may be
ſtill, becauſe there are the more vapors from
whence Clouds are raiſed; and the longer a
dry ſeaſon hath laſted, there is every day the
leſs reaſon to expect rain, becauſe there want
vapors out of which it ſhould be raiſed. Now
to impute this ſudden and admirable change on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Winds, is to beg the Queſtion; for
it is well enough known, that the Winds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon vapors as well as rain; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it to the Stars, is to confeſs an humorſom
reſolution, that right or wrong we will ſhut
God out of the World. But this leads me to
my</p>

3. Third proof of a preſent
Providence,<note place="margin">More ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> from the more
frequent and ordinary inſtances
of a Divine influence upon the
affairs of the World. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of which, though they are not accounted
miraculous, becauſe they are common, yet they
give ſufficient indication of Divine adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And of this kind, there are ſo many
which offer themſelves to an obſervant mind,
that to ſeek flaws, and go about to make ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
objections againſt ſome few of them, will
be rather an Argument of reſolved unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to believe, than of any juſt grounds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.
For like as in a great Cable made up
of ſeveral ſmaller cords, if perchance ſome of
the threds ſhould flaw or break, yet the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will be able to bear the ſtreſs of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
uſe it ſhall be put to.</p>
               <p>Now under this Head I reckon in the firſt
place, as very obſervable, that there is ſcarcely
any great thing ever brought about in the
World, which God may not be ſeen to have
an hand in; and that may be collected general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the inadequateneſs of the viſible means
to moſt notable productions: As when great
preparations are defeated or laid aſide, and
mean and inconſiderable ones do the buſineſs.
This is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved long ago,
<hi>That the battle is not to the ſtrong, nor the race to
the ſwift, nor bread to men of underſtanding:</hi>
And we cannot want an Example of it nearer
hand, when we remember the Reſtauration of
his now Majeſty: For it pleaſed God to deal
in that particular, as he did by <hi>Gideons</hi> Army,
when he diſmiſſed the greateſt part of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100726:100"/>
and did his buſineſs with a few, and thoſe
very unlikely for ſuch an Atchievement.</p>
               <p>But more admirable than this, is the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the holy Scripture in all Ages, both
from total abolition by the flames of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and from corruption, by the capricious
phancies of ſuch men as would neither ſincerely
believe it, nor abſolutely reject it. Such alſo
is the preſervation of the Chriſtian Religion,
when all the wit and all the power of the
World combined together againſt it; and ſuch
was the ſucceſs of the Apoſtles in propagating
that Religion, and planting the Chriſtian
Church, when a few Fiſher-men leavened the
World with a Doctrine quite againſt the grain
of it, and naked Truth prevailed againſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Art and Intereſt in conjunction.</p>
               <p>Hitherto alſo I reduce the maintenance of
Magiſtracy and Civil Government; and I look
upon it as a ſtanding evidence of a Providence,
that the ſtrong bands of wicked and refractory
men ſhould ſtand in awe of a ſingle man like
themſelves, only becauſe he is inveſted with
Authority. This, if it be duly conſidered, is
very ſtrange, and can be reſolved into nothing
but a Providence. Nor is it leſs ſtrange, that
conſidering the great numbers of evil men,
their ſecrecy and cloſeneſs, their cunning and
falſhood, their envy and neceſſity, their activity
and ſelfiſhneſs, they ſhould be able to do no
more hurt in the World than they do. Why
do they not aſſaſinate whom they pleaſe? Or
what is the reaſon that they do not forſwear
men out of their lives and fortunes, and act
whatſoever their revenge or covetouſneſs or
luſt ſhall prompt them to? And no account can
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100726:101"/>
be given of this, but the powerful reſtraint of
Providence.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are remarkable Examples in
all Ages of evil men dogged by their own guilt,
and tortured by their own Conſciences, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
no body elſe either accuſed or hurt them;
and on the other ſide, as frequent inſtances of
vertuous men, who have been very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
under great difficulties, and whoſe ſpirits
have been born up with an admirable bravery
under ſuch preſſures as would ordinarily cruſh
and ſink other men: and this, although the
perſons thus carrying themſelves, were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of no remarkable ſtrength or courage.
Neither of which paſſages can be reſolved into
any other Cauſes, than the mighty influence of
a Providence.</p>
               <p>Nay further it is very obſervable, how
ſtrangely ſometimes ſecret ſins are brought to
light, eſpecially ſuch as Murder and Treachery,
and where all Arts and advantages were made
uſe of for concealment; ſuch perſons becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own accuſers, when no body elſe could
do it for them, and not unuſually their own
Executioners too.</p>
               <p>Above all theſe, there are ſome inſtances of
vengeance befalling very flagitious men, ſo
ſignally, and with ſuch pat and ſignificant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
that (without any uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
we may be led by the ſuffering to the ſin,
as in the famous caſe of <hi>Adonibezek, Judg.</hi> 1. 7.
whoſe barbarous uſage of threeſcore and ten
Kings, cutting off their Thumbs and great
Toes, and making them, like Dogs, gather
their meat under his Table, was repaid upon
himſelf in the ſame ſeverity. Of kind to which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100726:101"/>
are thoſe pannick fears, and ſhiverings that
oftentimes attend blood-guilty men as long as
they live: and though they may have eſcaped
revenge from the hand of men; yet this, as a
<hi>Cain</hi>'s mark ſet upon them by the hand of God,
indelebly ſticks by them, and follows them to
their Graves.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to ſay any thing more on this
ſubject, foraſmuch as every man that doth not
wilfully ſhut his eyes, may collect inſtances to
this purpoſe, both from the Government of
the World in general, and from his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in particular. For beſides the quiet ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and comfortableneſs (in token of the Divine
favour) which uſually attends a vertuous courſe
of life, and the anxiety, torment and uneaſineſs
which as frequently (in teſtimony of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
diſlike) attends a wicked and flagitious
one; it is not a very unuſual, nor (to be ſure)
an unpleaſant ſight, to behold the former
crowned with ſignal ſucceſs and worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
and the latter puniſhed with ſhame
and beggery: and this ſometimes ſhall happen
in ſuch circumſtances, when there is nothing
to which this different ſucceſs can be imputed
but meerly Divine Providence, foraſmuch as
the latter ſhall otherwiſe be more cunning for
the World, and every whit as induſtrious and
frugal as the former; but Divine Providence
only makes the diſcrimination, whilſt the one
is under the bleſſing of Heaven, and the other
is apparently blaſted and curſed.</p>
               <p>And now what think you, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> upon
the whole matter: have I not acquitted my
ſelf in all the three things I propounded? And
now laying all theſe things together, is not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100726:102"/>
here ſufficient evidence to determine a prudent
man in the caſe, and to ſatisfie him that there
is a Providence in this World, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that there will be a Judgment hereafter?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot tell, <hi>Sebaſt.</hi> I confeſs you have
ſaid many very conſiderable things, and ſome
of them beyond what I could have expected in
the caſe. But I have one main Objection, which
eſpecially touches the laſt Branch of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and which, if it ſtick by you, all you
have ſaid will ſignifie nothing; but if you come
clearly off from it, I ſhall not know what to
think of the buſineſs. It is this, in ſhort: I
do not ſee any ſuch ſetled and conſtant method
in the management of the affairs of this World,
as muſt neceſſarily argue a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
for in particular,<note place="margin">A Vindication of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarity of ſome of its Diſpenſations in this life.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all you have ſaid,
it cannot be denied, that very
often the beſt of men are oppreſt
and born down by ill Fortune;
and contrariwiſe evil men are
very happy and proſperous: therefore it may
ſeem that thoſe inſtances which you collect in
favour of your opinion, may happen by chance,
rather than by the diſpenſation of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and then if there be no Providence in
this World, by your own Argument, there can
be no Judgment hereafter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>If that be all, or the main of what
you have to object, I am in hope to ſee ſome
good iſſue of this Conference: for in the firſt
place you know, that which is impeached by
this Objection, is but one ſingle inſtance out of
many which I have brought for the aſſertion
of a Providence; and conſequently if this ſhould
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100726:102"/>
fail, or if I ſhould yield you all that the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
pretends to, yet ſo long as the other are
unſhaken by it, that great Doctrine may ſtand
firm notwithſtanding; for it is but as if you
ſhould peck one ſingle ſtone out of an huge
building, or (as I ſaid before) find a flaw in
ſome one thred of a great Cable, neither of
which can weaken or endanger the one or the
other. But then beſides, you cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that this which you now mention, is an
old thred-bare exception worn out of all faſhion
by the old Atheiſts and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and which
hath been can vaſſed and baſſted over and over
by men of all Ages and of ſeveral Perſwaſions,
by <hi>Job,</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>Solomon,</hi> nay, by <hi>Tully,
Seneca, Plutarch,</hi> and ſeveral others, that it is
a great argument of the poverty of your Cauſe
to be ſeen in it now a-days, and may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
my labour in confuting it. However be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you think fit to give it countenance, I
will briefly ſay theſe three things in the caſe,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That ſome meaſure of intricacy or
obſcurity in the diſpenſation of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is no argument againſt it, but for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That there are very great reaſons
aſſignable why it may pleaſe the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to proceed ſometimes indiſcriminately, and
keep no conſtant viſible method in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of good and evil in this preſent life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Yet however this be ſometimes
obſcure, there are at other times ſufficient and
legible inſtances of a diſtinguiſhing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>1. Some meaſure of intricacy in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Divine Providence, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100726:103"/>
an argument againſt it, that it is a great
argument for it. For if we do not make God
a meer neceſſary Agent (which I hope I have
ſatisfied you in) we muſt allow ſomething to
his Prerogative and Soveraignty, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
grant that he may do ſome things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he will do ſo, and whereof he doth not
make us acquainted with the reaſons; and we
may very well allow to his Wiſdom, to have a
reach beyond us, and to have other meaſures to
govern the World by, than we could have made
for him. What, ſhall we call God to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Management? Shall he not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the World at all, unleſs he order it juſt
as we would have him? This is apparently ſo
far from being reaſonable, that it would be
much more ſo to conclude on the contrary;
namely, that if there were no depths in the
Divine Counſel which we could not fathom,
no Meanders in the way of Providence, which
we could not trace, it would be very ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
whether there were any thing of Divinity
in the whole buſineſs. For if things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
managed one way without any variation,
we ſhould be apt to think all was under the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
Laws of a fatal Neceſſity. If on the other
ſide there were no rule to be obſerved, no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
of any method, then we ſhould be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to think Chance ruled the World; but
when we obſerve an intermixture of theſe two,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there is a rule, though there be ſome
exceptions from it, then we have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that all is under a powerful and a free
Agent, who if he be alſo infinitely wiſe, cannot
but ſee reaſon for ſeveral things which we cannot
comprehend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:100726:103"/>
2. There are very great and weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
aſſignable why in this particular inſtance
of Providence (namely in the diſtribution of
good and evil in this World) the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhould not be obliged to gratifie our curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
with a plain account of his proceedings,
but make ſome exceptions to his general rule;
amongſt which theſe following are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſuch a conſtant and viſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of diſtributive Juſtice, as your objection
ſeems to require, would be ſuch an irrefragable
and palpable evidence of a Providence, as
would leave no room for the diſcovery of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
or a virtuous diſpoſition; it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
men of the liberty of their choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would be Atheiſtical, or devout and
religious: and conſequently there would be no
excellency in Piety and Vertue. For (as I have
ſaid before in a like caſe) it could be no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of love to God or goodneſs, that a
man took care to ſerve and pleaſe God, if he
conſtantly ſtood over us in a viſible and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Providence, ſo as that every offender
were taken in the very fact, and preſently led to
execution; and on the other ſide, if every
virtuous action were forthwith rewarded and
crowned. In ſhort, it is not agreeable to the
Mind of God to over-run the freedom of our
choice, ſince he hath endowed us with it, nor
to ſuperſede that diſtinctive faculty of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for ſhould he do ſo, he ſhould act contrary
to himſelf and to his own Glory, as well as to
the nature and condition of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Again, Secondly, A checkered and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
method of Divine Providence, wherein
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100726:104"/>
there is an intertexture of proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
in the fortunes of virtuous men, tends
more to their improvement than a more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and conſtant Providence would do. For
as a continued courſe of proſperity is too apt
to tempt men to be wanton and careleſs; ſo a
perpetual ſeries of adverſity would be as apt
to ſink and depreſs their ſpirits: but a middle
way of interchange in their condition, balar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
them on both ſides, and maintains them in
a more even temper and converſation. And
for this reaſon it pleaſes the Divine Wiſdom to
make ſuch falſe ſteps as you are apt to imagine
them to be.</p>
                  <p>To which add in the third place, That here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
lies the very ſecret of Divine Wiſdom, and
by this very way he doth moſt effectually aſſure
us of the point in queſtion (namely, a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come) in that there is ſuch apparent
neceſſity of it. For if the Divine Majeſty
ſhould let the preſent World run at random,
and interpoſe himſelf in no caſe to check the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or puniſh the diſorder, there would ſeem no
reaſon to expect juſtice from him hereafter,
who gave no token of it all this while; and
then on the other ſide, if he interpoſed ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and conſtantly, as to leave no irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
unpuniſhed, nor any brave action unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
there would be no buſineſs left, nor
no need of a day of Judgment. Whereas by
affording us ſome plain inſtances of his diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
in this World, we are ſatisfied that
he minds how things go, and is able to judge;
and yet by permitting ſeveral other things to
run riot, and ſeemingly to be unanimadverted
upon, he hath as it were cut out work for a day
of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:100726:104"/>
3. Notwithſtanding all this, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there are ſome ſufficient and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inſtances of a diſtinguiſhing Providence in
this World, I have granted to you, that
ſometimes the ways of God are intricate and
involved, and I have offered at ſome reaſons
of it, to which many others might have been
added, and amongſt the reſt, that by this means
we may be kept humble and modeſt, and taught
to admire and reverence God, rather than to
judge or pronounce of him. For theſe, I ſay,
and other reaſons beſt known to infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
he thinks fit ſometimes to loſe us in the
Meander of his ways; yet I ſay they are not
always thus obſcure, but ſometimes he treads
ſuch plain and direct paths, that we may eaſily
follow him. And of this I have ſet before you
ſeveral examples already, and whoſoever will
diligently attend to it, may eaſily collect more;
but I will not omit to put you in mind of one
great and ſtanding one, and (as far as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
beyond all exception, and that was in the
Hiſtory of the Jewiſh Nation, who were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
ſure to be happy and moſt remarkably
proſperous ſo long as they ſtuck to the true
God and the Laws he had given them by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and as ſure to be ſignally miſerable and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous,
whenſoever they apoſtatized from
their God, or debauched their Religion. So
that that people was placed as a light upon a
mountain, and were an illuſtrious inſtance to
all the World of that great Truth we are now
diſcourſing of; and if there were no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of this kind, that alone would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the purpoſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, if the ſtory be true,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100726:105"/>
there was a very ſtrange Fate attended that
people.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Fate, do you call it? What colour
or pretence in the world is there for imputing
thoſe admirable revolutions to Fate? Could
blind Fate make diſtinction of perſons and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and apply it ſelf in the diſtribution of good
or evil in proportion to mens deſerts or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages?
Do not diſparage your own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo much, as to uſe the word Fate in ſuch
a caſe. No, aſſure your ſelf that was a ſignal
diſplay of Divine Providence, and ſuch an one
as you cannot expect or demand a greater.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>But if it were the effect of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as you will needs have it, I wonder how
it comes to paſs that there is no ſuch thing now;
or why all the reſt of Mankind
was neglected by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,<note place="margin">A viſible Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over the Jews.</note>
and only that people, and
in that age and corner of the
World, ſo carefully managed by it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>O <hi>Biophilus,</hi> ask not God an account
of his Prerogative, nor much leſs preſcribe to
him how he ſhall govern the World. What if
he pitying the dark ſtate of the world then,
did ſomething extraordinary to relieve and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
it: and what if having once given ſuch
abundant proof of himſelf, he ſhall think that
ſufficient to all after-ages? Or, to ſay no more,
what if it pleaſes him to make Faith in ſome
reſpects more difficult now than it was then?
Who ſhall expoſtulate the matter with him,
eſpecially ſince he hath not left us deſtitute of
ſufficient grounds to determine a prudent man
in the caſe? Which is all I have pretended to
aſſert all this while, and I think I have made
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100726:105"/>
it good at laſt, though with ſome tediouſneſs of
diſcourſe, for which I beg your pardon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> do not ſlander our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo much, as to ſuſpect we ſhould think
any thing tedious that is ſo much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
I thank you heartily for the pains you
have taken with us; for although (I thank
God) I have long lived under a firm perſwaſion
both of a Providence here, and a Judgment
hereafter; yet I am greatly rejoyced to find all
ſure under me, and when my reaſon encourages
my devotion: and eſpecially I think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to you for the ſatisfaction you have given
my Neighbour: is it not ſo, <hi>Biophilus?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>I tell you plainly, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> hath ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
me, and I cannot tell what to ſay more
for the preſent, but I will conſider further of it
at leiſure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I, but do it quickly, good <hi>Biophilus,</hi>
you Sceptical Gentlemen are apt to take too
long time to conſider of theſe matters; you
know, dye we muſt, and that ſhortly too, ſo
that we have not any long time to conſider in;
what an horrible ſurpriſe would it be, if whilſt
we ſtand doubting and diſputing, we ſhould
hear the ſound of the laſt Trump, and be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to that great Tribunal? When Death
once arreſts us, there is no Bail will be taken,
we muſt come to a ſtrict account, and await an
irreverſible Doom, ſo that there is no dallying
in this matter.</p>
                  <p>If either of us had intelligence that an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were coming upon us with deſign to aſſault
us and take away our life, although it were a
perſon of but ordinary reputation that brought
us the news, yet it would ſtartle us, and we
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100726:106"/>
ſhould not ſtand diſputing the truth of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
but preſently either prepare our ſelves
to appeaſe him, or arm our ſelves to encounter
him; and then if no Enemy appeared, we could
ſecurely expoſtulate the falſe Alarm after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Or if there came a report, that the
Sea had broken its banks, and overflowed the
plain whereon our houſes ſtand, I aſſure my ſelf
that neither of us would ſtand gravely delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
whether it were poſſible or no, or cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about the neglect of repairing the banks,
or leaſt of all loſe ſo much time as whilſt we
could ſend Meſſengers, and expect their return,
but firſt get us up to the mountains, and there
at leiſure inform our ſelves of the truth of all
circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Noah,</hi> for no leſs than one hundred
and twenty years together, preached repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and foretold a Flood coming to drown
all the World, no queſtion but the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of men laught at him as timorous hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal
perſon: They could object how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
a thing it was he talked of, a thing that
no man had ſeen, or had ever happened to the
world before: They would diſcourſe philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically
in the caſe too, and repreſent it as a
very abſurd thing, to imagine that the water
ſhould riſe above the earth, and overflow the
tops of their ſtately houſes; for (might they
ſay) where ſhall there be water enough to do
it? from whence ſhould it come? or how
ſhould this Fellow have notice of it before
all other men? And perhaps they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that at worſt they ſhould have time to
ſhift for themſelves when they ſee it come in
earneſt, and eſcape as well as others. Hereupon
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100726:106"/>
they ate and drank and feaſted and made merry,
and laught at that preciſe Coxcomb with his
new Machine of an Ark: but ſo, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>ſhall the coming of the Son of man be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> whilſt we dream, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſlumbers not: whilſt we doubt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
God is in earneſt: and the time draws
on apace, when Chriſt Jeſus, the Judge of the
World, ſhall come <hi>in the glory of his Father and
of all the holy Angels,</hi> the Heavens ſhall then
melt away, and the Earth be on fire from one
end of it to another; the dead ſhall riſe out of
their Graves, and make an huge Aſſembly; the
Books of all mens actions ſhall be opened, and
the Devil together with every mans own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
ſhall be the Accuſers. Then ſhall all
thoſe that are conſcious to themſelves to have
lived virtuouſly and holily, look up with joy
and comfort to ſee their Saviour become their
Judge; to find a vindication from all thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
cenſures that have paſt upon them here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
to come to an end of their labours, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of their ſervices, the accompliſhment of
their faith and hopes. Lord, what joy will be
in their countenances, what glory upon their
heads! How the Angels ſmile upon them, and
welcome them to their journies end, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
opens in an admirable Scene of light and
glory to receive them!</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, all that are privy to
themſelves to have lived wickedly, baſely and
unprofitably, ſhall look pale and tremble, <hi>and
call upon the rocks and mountains to hide them
from the face of the Lamb that fits upon the
Throne;</hi> for they ſhall ſee all black and diſmal
about them, no tears will move pity, no Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100726:107"/>
will perſwade, no excuſes will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
no Appeal be allowed, no refuge to
be found, nor Reprieve to be hoped for; but
they ſhall hear that dreadful Sentence, <hi>Depart
accurſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and his Angels,</hi> and ſhall ſee Hell open her
mouth to receive them into unquenchable
flames.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>I aſſure you I like this temper (as you
call it) ſo well, that I do not deſire to feel
more of it. But if you are reſolved to go on
to torment me, I pray do me the favour firſt to
anſwer me this queſtion. If theſe things be ſo
as you repreſent them, how comes it to paſs
that men unconcerned about Religion, dye as
comfortably oftentimes as any others? The
reaſon of my queſtion is this, becauſe you will
pretend that whilſt men are well in health,
and ſwimming with the Tide of proſperity,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100726:107"/>
they may either artificially put off the thoughts
of theſe things, though they be true; or the
noiſe of buſineſs, and the careſſes of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
may obſcure all apprehenſion of another
World. But ſure, when men find themſelves
dying, and that there is but one way with
them, it ſhould be too late for them to flatter
themſelves, or to admit of the flatteries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
then ſurely prejudices ceaſe, and men
are at leiſure to think the glory of the World
cannot dazle their eyes when it is leaving
them, and they it: what then, I ſay, can be
the reaſon if theſe things be true (which you
ſpeak ſo affectionately of) that
there is not as remarkable a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in mens temper of ſpirit
when they come to dye,<note place="margin">How it comes to paſs that there is no greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the laſt act of mens lives.</note> as there
ſeems to be in their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whilſt they are alive?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I apprehend your queſtion very well,
and the reaſons of your asking it too. And for
anſwer to it, I pray tell me what is the reaſon
that men that love their health and their Eſtates
both very well, will nevertheleſs be Drunkards
and Whore-maſters and Gameſters, though
they ſee by daily experience that theſe are very
ſure methods to out them of both? You will
tell me, I ſuppoſe, that they feed themſelves
with abſurd and unreaſonable hopes which fool
their diſcretion, or that they are bewitched and
beſotted with thoſe kind of pleaſures, and ſo
conſider nothing at all. Why, juſt ſo it is
here, the things we ſpeak of are undoubtedly
true, and the miſcarriage in them is fatal; but
men are careleſs and incogitant, and ſlip into
the pit of deſtruction before they are aware;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100726:108"/>
they live merrily, becauſe they never think of
any thing, and they dye as ſottiſhly as they
lived.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is another ſort of men that are
captious and conceited, who will chop Logick,
as we ſay, with God Almighty; they will have
not only their reaſon ſatisfied, but their curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
alſo, or they will not believe; they muſt
ſee a Spirit and Heaven and Hell, or one muſh
come from the dead to tell them News out of
the other World, or they will not be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Now God will not indulge this humor of
theirs, and they are reſolved to venture him,
that is, they will be damned rather than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there are others take a great deal of
pains to disbelieve, they will uſe all the Arts
of Sophiſtry, all the tricks and evaſions of wit,
intrench and fortifie themſelves in their Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
conceits; in a word, they will cheat their
own reaſon, outface their own Conſcience, and
bring upon themſelves a ſtupid inſenſibility of
all that is good and vertuous, and ſo, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
they dye quietly, and go ſilently into
the bottomleſs pit.</p>
                  <p>To all this you muſt conſider, that it is very
probable that many of theſe men may be very
far from dying chearfully, though we are not
able to obſerve their Agonies and torments;
for it may very well be, that when they once
begin to conſider what a deſperate condition
they are in, the very thoughts of that, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their bodily diſeaſe in conjunction,
preſently overwhelms their ſpirits, and makes
their paſſage out of the world more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
but never the more comfortable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:100726:108"/>
But after all, you ſhall find ſome of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
perſons, when they come to dye, ſadly
bewail their folly and careleſneſs of this kind;
but where-ever did you hear of an holy and
vertuous man that ever repented of his choice
or pains in Religion, or care of his Soul, and
ſollicitude in preparation for this occaſion?
It's poſſible indeed ſuch a man may expreſs no
tranſpoets, becauſe his body is like other mens,
and the ſtrength of his diſeaſe may infeeble
his ſpirits and cloud his reaſon, and ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the exerciſe of his faith and hope. And
on the other ſide, the profane and irreligious
man, though perhaps (as you ſuppoſe) he
cannot or will not diſſemble at the approach
of death, yet he may be ſottiſh and inſenſible,
and then whatſoever difference of ſtate they
are entring upon, there may be no diſcernible
difference in their departure hence; and ſo you
ſee your queſtion will not ſerve to the purpoſe
you propounded it for.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Come, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> leave theſe ſceptical
artifices, theſe captious queſtions, do not ſeek
out ways to muzzle your own Conſcience, or
impoſe upon your reaſon; a Judgment there
will be, and it is all the wiſdom in the world
to be prepared for it. It is in our power by
the grace of God to order mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſo,<note place="margin">The wonderful comfort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of being ſecured againſt a day of Judgment.</note> that we ſhall rather hope
and wiſh for it than fear it, and
what vaſt odds is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them two? You are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that it is only a Judgment
following death, that makes death terrible, at
leaſt to our minds and underſtanding. Indeed
it's poſſible our bodies may be diſturbed at the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100726:109"/>
aſſaults of it; but meer death can never ſhake
our minds, or diſcompoſe one thought, if we
are ſatisfied that all will be well after it: and
what an happy and deſirable condition were it,
to be out of the reach of that King of terrours,
to ſee light through that dark Vault of the
grave, to out-live all a mans fears, and to live
to his hopes? What a ſtrange alteration will
that one thing make in a mans projections and
deſigns, in his countenance and in his ſpirit,
and in the whole management of himſelf; for
who can be afraid of any other accident that
hath no cauſe to fear death? Who will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
about riches, or be much diſcompoſed
whether his temporal affairs ſucceed well or ill,
that is provided for Eternity? Who will ſtoop
ſo low, as to lay any ſtreſs upon fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
that hath approved himſelf to God
and his own Conſcience, and can ſtand the
ſhock of the great Tryal of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
He that is in a condition not to fear
death, will have no reaſon to fear men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
or Spirits or ſolitude or darkneſs, but may
be as bold as a Lyon, and cannot probably be
tempted either to expreſs a mean paſſion, or
to do a baſe action; to be ſure he will crouch to
no body, flatter and humor no body: for no
body can hurt him, and ſo his life is eaſie as
well as comfortable, foraſmuch as he hath no
body to pleaſe but God and his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>But, as I was ſaying, this is to be prepared
for; Salvation is not a matter of courſe, nor
the Judgment a meer piece of ſtate and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but infinitely ſacred and ſolemn; the Judge
is wiſe and holy and juſt, the Tryal ſtrict and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100726:109"/>
ſevere, the Doom irreverſible, the miſery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
if a man miſcarry, as well as the
felicity unſpeakable, if he ſtand right at that
Tribunal: and to all this the critical time
draws on apace; we feel our ſelves daily dying,
therefore it concerns us to do what is to be done
out of hand.</p>

in ſuch a concern? Can any thing ſeem trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
that may at once ſecure us from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>That is ſoon ſaid, I confeſs, but not
ſo ſoon done. Beſides, I am never the wiſer
for ſuch a general advice; for there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Religions in the World, that it's hard to
know which to truſt to. Some ſublime Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to ſuch an height of Spirituality (as they
call it) that a man cannot tell what to make of
it; and again, ſome make no more of it than
honeſt Morality. Some dreſs it up ſo fine and
gawdily with ſo many Trappings
and Ornaments,<note place="margin">The different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of Religion, a great temptation to See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pticiſm.</note> that it's hard
to find what the naked truth of
the thing is; and others render
it ſo plain and coarſe, that a man
is tempted to deſpiſe it. Some
repreſent it ſo thin and ſubtle, that a mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can take no hold of it; and others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it ſo groſly and abſurdly, that a man had
need have a good ſtomach to it, or he could not
digeſt it. Some make it a very eaſie thing, a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100726:110"/>
trick of Wit, a meer Notion, but the becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Party, or a bare believing; nay, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Garb, an hair Shirt, or a Fryers Girdle
doth the buſineſs. With others it is a matter
of infinite difficulty, and hath ſo many nice
and ſtrict obſervations belonging to it, that they
are able to diſcourage any pretence to it. In
a word, it ſeems to me to be what the Painter
pleaſes, foraſmuch as I ſee ſome deſcribe it out
of the pleaſantneſs of their own ſanguine phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and others out of the black humor of their
hypochondriac paſſions: So that upon the whole
matter, I think I had as good maintain my own
Character, and withhold my aſſent till men
are better agreed amongſt themſelves upon the
point.</p>

                  <p>God forbid, <hi>Biophilus,</hi> for that you

                  <speaker>Bioph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, have you leſs charity for men

Muſt a Sceptiſt be certainly damned, if there
be a Judgment?</p>

                  <p>Far be it from me to be uncharitable
towards any men, if I could help them; but I
muſt tell you, I have leſs hope for that man that
hath no faith at all, than for him that hath a
bad one; and it muſt be a very bad Religion
indeed that is not better than none. For though
by reaſon of the variety of Perſwaſions (which
you take notice of) a man may be fatally ſo
miſled, as to periſh in a blind Devotion; yet
certainly he that is ſo phantaſtically wiſe, as
to be of no Religion at all, cannot be ſaved.
But what need is there of either of theſe? There
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100726:110"/>
are a great many falſe Religions, it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
but there is a Truth too, and that not
ſo hard to diſcern as you repreſent it, if a man
ſincerely apply himſelf to the ſearch of it.</p>

matters. I know you are a witty man; but
do not turn the edge of it againſt your own
Soul. Come, I'll tell you a Religion that all
the World ſhall agree in, and my Soul for
yours, you ſhall be ſafe, if you will comply
with it. Do not ſtare, it is no
more but this,<note place="margin">A ſure Religion.</note> 
                     <hi>live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly
and godly in this preſent
world;</hi> or if you will have it in other words,
reſolve with your ſelf not to do that thing
(whatever come of it) that you cannot anſwer
to God and your own Conſcience, and do every
thing within your power that may approve and
recommend you to both, and thence-forward
fear not a day of Judgment.</p>

                  <p>Now you ſpeak to the purpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that I muſt needs ſay is good counſel,
and ſuch as I think all the World is agreed in;

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>God proſper your reſolution, <hi>Biophilus.</hi>
And now, <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> that we are happily come
to this point, I pray give me leave to put <hi>Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>'s
queſtion a little more home to you. I
thank God I am ſenſible of the great day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
and make ſome conſcience of being
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100726:111"/>
provided for it; but becauſe I would not for all the
world be miſtaken in my meaſures in a buſineſs
of that moment, I crave the aſſiſtance of your
judgment how far that care extends, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
what it compriſes. The reaſon of my ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
herein (beſides the conſequence of the
thing it ſelf) is,<note place="margin">Scrupulous and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical rules of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the day of Judgment repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> becauſe I have
heard it delivered as a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rule by ſome men, That
the only ſure preparation is,
that a man live every day as
if it were the laſt he had to
live. Which Doctrine hath often raiſed ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in my mind, and I ſuſpect it may have had
the like effect upon others; and to tell you
my thoughts plainly, I look upon it as unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable
and inconſiſtent with the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of life; for moſt certainly on that day,
which I thought would be the laſt I ſhould live,
I would not fail to diſmiſs all other buſineſs
whatſoever, I would ſcarce eat or drink or
ſleep, but wholly apply my ſelf to acts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now if that rule be true, Religion is a
more anxious thing than I was aware; and if
it be not true, I pray make me underſtand
what is the truth in this matter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not know why you ſhould lay
much ſtreſs upon my judgment in ſuch a caſe;
but if you will have my opinion, it is plainly
this, that the rule you ſpeak of is far more
devout than judicious; for as you well obſerve,
ſince God Almighty hath cloathed our Souls
with bodies, and placed us in a world of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
it cannot be that he ſhould expect we
ſhould in the whole courſe of our lives ſo ſingly
and ſolely apply our ſelves to the affairs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100726:111"/>
World, as we ſhould think fit to do juſt
when we are going off the ſtage, and ſolemnly
preparing our ſelves for an immediate appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
at Gods Judgment-ſeat. If therefore
thoſe men (you ſpeak of) had preſcribed that
we ſhould every day think of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as not knowing how ſoon it may be upon
us, or that we ſhould take care every day to
advance in our proviſion for it, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
a great and a neceſſary Truth; but
when they ſpeak as if they meant, that we muſt
do nothing any day, but what we would do, if we
were ſure it were our laſt day, they thwart the
very order of Divine Providence in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, and the conſtitution of the world;
they condemn the practice, and call in queſtion
the ſtate of the beſt of men; they lay a ſnare
for the Conſcience of the weak and timorous:
and in a word, they obtrude an impracticable
notion for the moſt concerning and neceſſary
Truth.</p>
                  <p>But you are not to wonder, or be troubled
at it. For though there is generally more
defect of devotion than of knowledge in the
World, yet there are ſome particular men
wherein the former exceeds the latter, and ſuch
men pleaſe themſelves in a pretty ſaying, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to judge of the prudence of it;
and whilſt they go about to awaken ſome ſecure
and careleſs perſons to a ſerious ſenſe of their
eternal concern, are not aware that they afford
matter of everlaſting ſcruple and offence to
thoſe that are truly tender and conſcientious.</p>
                  <p>It were eaſie to give you ſundry inſtances of
this ſuperfine high ſtrained Divinity; but there
is one I will mention for its affinity with that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100726:112"/>
before us, <hi>viz.</hi> you ſhall find it dogmatically
delivered by ſome ſeeming great Caſuiſts, That
in certain and indiſputable things, it is a mans
duty to do that which is beſt of the kind, and
in uncertain and controverted caſes to take the
ſurer ſide. Now if theſe things were laid down
as prudential advices only, to direct a man
which way to incline himſelf, they were very
uſeful; but to make them expreſs meaſures of
duty, is to make more Laws than God hath
made, and condemn more things for ſin than
he condemns, and conſequently cannot chuſe
but imbroil the Conſciences of men. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Prayer be better than ſecular buſineſs, then
upon this Principle I muſt turn <hi>Euchite,</hi> and
ſpend all my time in devotion. Suppoſe there
be fewer temptations in a Monaſtick life than
in common Converſation, then every one that
is careful of his Soul, muſt retire into a Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
If there be difficulties attending Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
and publick Employment, then I muſt
fold up my hands and do nothing but go into
my Cell, and pray God to mend the World,
though I be called to the other. If bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
and Games have ſome ſnares in them,
I muſt allow my ſelf no recreations; nay, I
ſhall be put endleſly and anxiouſly to diſpute,
whether it be better to give a poor man two
pence or a ſhilling or five ſhillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſhall pray three times a day or ſeven
times a day; whether an hour or two hours.
And indeed every thing I go about will afford
inextricable difficulties upon theſe Principles.</p>
                  <p>But that by the way only: As for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in hand, trouble your ſelf no farther than
to live every day well, and to be ſure to do
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100726:112"/>
nothing you cannot anſwer; be always getting
ground, and growing better and better; as
near as you can, do every day ſomething that
may turn to account another day, and then
comfortably await Gods time.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I have heard much of the fame of his
Piety, but I never had the happineſs to know
him. For Gods ſake let us have his ſtory, ſince
you will not gratifie me in my firſt requeſt.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sebaſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I remember the time well when I
made much the ſame requeſt to him, which you
have now done to me. And he after he had
for a good while modeſtly declined, giving me
ſatisfaction therein by ſuch excuſes as it is not
neceſſary I ſhould now repeat, and I had replied
to them as well as I could; at length yielding
to my importunity, he began thus.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Dear Friend (quoth he) though from the
firſt date of our acquaintance our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100726:113"/>
hath been ſo intimate, and my breaſt
hath been ſo open to you, that I ſcarcely
know any thing by my ſelf that you have not
been privy to; yet becauſe you are pleaſed
to entertain the curioſity to inquire further
after me, I will not ſtick to tell you as well
what happened to me before the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our friendſhip, as alſo ſuch things as
(in regard they paſſed only betwixt God and
my own Soul) may be unknown to you, though
they were tranſacted ſince.</p>
                     <p>Know then, (ſaid he) that about ſuch time
as I had out-grown the meer follies and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of my youth, and began, together with
the advance of my bodily ſtrength and vigour,
to make alſo ſome eſſays of underſtanding and
diſcretion, I quickly found that by the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide
of my blood, and the great increaſe of
bodily ſpirits, ſeveral very impetuous paſſions
and inclinations boiled up in me, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
thoſe ſmall efforts which my reaſon
(as yet) could make to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>This I then thought (and do ſtill) to be a
caſe common to other men with my ſelf; and
ſince I have conſidered of it, I am apt to think
that our wiſe Creator ſo ordered the matter,
that theſe two Combatants, Senſe and Reaſon,
ſhould grow up and enter the Liſts together,
to the intent that as Reaſon ſhould not be
without its Antagoniſt to hold it in play: ſo
on the other ſide, thoſe bodily powers ſhould
not be left without a Guide to conduct, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
and manage them.</p>
                     <p>However, hereupon bodily inclinations
growing daily ſtronger and ſtronger, and my
Reaſon and Conſcience not being yet foiled
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100726:114"/>
or corrupted, there aroſe a very ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
in me between them, and that as yet of
very doubtful iſſue; foraſmuch as both being
parts of my ſelf, I could not eaſily reſolve
which ſide to incline to.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time (as God would have it)
calling to mind the ſolemnity of my Baptiſm,
I remembred that then when I was dedicated
to Chriſt, and entred as a Candidate of eternal
Life, I had renounced the fleſh with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and luſts. Hereupon therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to withſtand them if I could, and to
this end begged the aſſiſtance of Gods grace,
and (by the advice of my Parents and thoſe
good perſons, who having been Sureties for
me, had a deſire to diſcharge their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that Truſt which lay upon them) I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
my ſelf to the Biſhop for Confirmation.
Whereby having obtained not only the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of my Spiritual Father, but made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion now my own act and choice;
and beſides, had put ſuch a publick obligation
upon my ſelf, as would render it very ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for me to go back or retreat, I from that
time forward was under a more awful ſenſe of
God and Religion, and felt frequent motions
of the holy Spirit within me.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here I remember I a little interrupted him,
applauding his ſingular felicity in being ſo early
ingaged in the way of Heaven, by which means
that courſe was now grown habitual to him,
and his accounts much eaſier at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But he proceeded, ſaying,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p> It is true indeed
it was Gods great goodneſs to awaken me to
a ſenſe of my duty thus early, as I have told
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100726:114"/>
you; but then what by the allurements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which have always too poinant a reliſh
with younger years, what by ingagement in
buſineſs which grew upon me afterwards, and
what through the contagion of example which
ſurrounds a man with too common inſtances
of careleſneſs in theſe weighty matters, I was
drawn off from any cloſe attendance upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
until it pleaſed God in his wiſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Grace to lay his hand upon me in a
dangerous fit of ſickneſs; and this partly, as
it ſtained all the beauty of the World, which
heretofore allured me; partly alſo, as it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
and infeebled thoſe bodily powers which
before were too potent in me, but principally
as it gave me leiſure and inclination to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
my ſelf; I thereupon (ſeeing nothing but
death before me) fell into a great concern for
another life, and ſo by degrees came to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
reſolution of making Religion my chief
buſineſs, and took all the care poſſible, that
ſo I might be prepared for the great day of
Tryal.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe this is the point which (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
you inquire after, I will acquaint you
with the method I purſued; and to deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with you (as I hope I did with my own
Soul) the ſtreſs of my preparations lay in
theſe three things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe I was ſure that an holy life
muſt needs be the beſt Paſs-port for the other
World; therefore I conſidered how I might
keep my ſelf cloſeſt to my duty, and walk in
all the Commandments of God as blameleſs
as it was poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe I knew that I had failed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100726:115"/>
heretofore, and feared I ſhould again in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things fall ſhort of my duty; therefore
I bethought my ſelf how I might do ſomething
extraordinary, if not to make up thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
yet to ſhew at leaſt the ſincerity of my
love to God and Religion, and the value I
had for the World to come.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and principally, In conſideration
of the Purity and Juſtice of God, and the
ſtrictneſs of his Laws, I deſired and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to intereſt my ſelf in the Satisfaction
and Interceſſion of my Saviour.</p>
                     <p>1. For the firſt of theſe, namely, the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my ſelf to God in the integrity of an
holy life, I conſidered that eternal Life not
being a thing of courſe, or naturally due to
men, but the ſingular gift of God, our hopes
of it and title to it muſt depend upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of ſuch conditions as he ſhould think
fit to impoſe: and foraſmuch as no man can
know Gods mind, and what he will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with, unleſs he himſelf reveal it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the firſt place I did not content my
ſelf with humane Writings and Moral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
nor much leſs to conform my ſelf to
the meaſures and cuſtoms of the World, but
ſet my ſelf daily and diligently to ſtudy the
holy Scriptures, and took the meaſures of my
duty, and the rule of my life thence. And
to this I joyned daily and earneſt prayer, that
it would pleaſe Divine Goodneſs not only to
make me underſtand his Will, but guide and
enable me to perform it; that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
me from prejudices, from inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
from fooliſh opinions and raſh actions:
and this I performed not cuſtomarily and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100726:115"/>
as if I complemented God Almighty,
but with my utmoſt vigour and intention of
ſpirit, and never thought I had acquitted my
ſelf therein till I found my heart warmed with
its own motion.</p>
                     <p>More particularly, becauſe I found that
hard ſtudy and ſicklineſs of body, had made
me ſomewhat ſubject to diſorders of the Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcible
(as heretofore health and plenty had
inclined me to the Concupiſcible); therefore
I vehemently implored the Divine Grace for
my relief, and have been frequently conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to allay a ſtorm of paſſion with a ſhower
of tears.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, I took ſpecial care to keep out
of vicious and licentious Company, which I
was confident if it did not taint me with ſome
ill example, would be ſure to cool my heat,
and abate my edge to Religion: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe,
I contrived as much as poſſibly I could
to keep ſuch Converſation as was likely to
provoke and inflame me in the courſe I had
propounded to my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And leſt all this ſhould not be ſufficient to
ſecure me of my intentions, every evening I
erected a petty Tribunal within my ſelf, and
called my ſelf to account for the day paſt, if
I had ſlipped any opportunity of doing or
receiving good; if any raſh word or action
had eſcaped me; if any earthly or ſenſual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
had been ſtirring in me; if I had been
guilty of any inſtance of injuſtice, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
might riſe up in judgment againſt me,
I repented and made my peace with God and
man, as far as it was poſſible, before I ſlept. I
examined my ſelf alſo what progreſs I had
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100726:116"/>
made that day towards Heaven, whether, now
I had ſpent a day of my life, I was a days
journey onward of my way, and what I had
to ſhew for the expence of that day. I always
took, as I ſaid, the Evening for this buſineſs,
both in regard of the privacy and quiet of
that ſeaſon, and alſo becauſe I found that
then the ſolitude and darkneſs of the nights
were eaſie, and the ſleep comfortable when I
had firſt cleared all ſcores; and beſides, I was
cautious, leſt the interpoſition of ſleep ſhould
have made me forget the paſſages of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
day, if I had deferred the account of
them till the next.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, I found it neceſſary (and
accordingly practiſed) to ſet one day aſide in
every month, and more ſolemnly and wholly
dedicated it to this buſineſs, to romage my own
heart, to compare my ſelf with my ſelf, and
to obſerve how much I advanced in my great
deſign.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond part of my care (as I told
you) was to efface thoſe errours of my life,
which had either wittingly or unwillingly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
me. Now to this purpoſe, I was very
deſirous to do ſome exemplary good things,
that I might lift up the head, and raiſe the
ſpirit of Piety in the World; and the rather,
to the intent, that if I had done any hurt by
ill example formerly, I might, when I could
not revoke the act, yet prevent the contagion
of it. And beſides, I was watchful of, and
gladly embraced all opportunities of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
the ſincerity of my love to God,
though it was by a coſtly or difficult ſervice;
for I made no doubt, but the more there was
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100726:116"/>
of ſelf-denial in a virtuous action, the greater
was the evidence of Grace and Divine Love
in performing it. Upon this account I could
well have been content it would have pleaſed
God to have given me a juſt occaſion of ſome
ſmart, but tolerable ſufferings for that; and
with this proſpect I have put my ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome meaſures of Charity that were to the
very utmoſt of my ability, if not beyond it;
I have interpoſed my ſelf voluntarily for the
reſcue of ſome deſolate and oppreſſed perſon
from a potent Adverſary, and thereby deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the trouble upon my ſelf which I protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that perſon from; I have put my ſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to reclaim ſome peeviſh deluded Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or ſome vicious perſon, from whom I have
had very ingrateful treatment for my good
will, that by all or ſome of theſe I might
ſhew that I loved God as well as my ſelf: not
that I had any proud conceit or opinion of
Supererogation in any thing I could do or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
ſo far from it, that I am ſenſible, that
when I have done all I can, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my ſelf an unprofitable ſervant, and
that I have not done ſo much as was my duty
to do. Notwithſtanding, as a Subject, that
hath been in Rebellion againſt his Prince, or
ſome way or other diſobliged him, will be
glad to be imployed in the moſt difficult ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
that he may ſhew his Loyalty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his Favour: So I who was ſenſible, that
in many things I had offended the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
could not chuſe but prize an occaſion of
doing ſomething more than matter of ſtrict
duty, that I might ſhew, that nevertheleſs I
loved him: And indeed it ſeems to me, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100726:117"/>
thoſe who pretend ſo much modeſty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
as to be ſcrupulous of over-doing in
this manner, are only in reality afraid of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him too much, which I am ſure is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
And therefore I find that ſuch free-will
Offerings give a mans heart great aſſurance,
and enable a man to look with the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
erection of mind towards God and the
day of Judgment. So I obſerved <hi>Nehemiah,
Chap. 13. verſ.</hi> 14. when he had ſhewn himſelf
publick-ſpirited and generouſly, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
difficulty and hazard to himſelf had
aſſerted the intereſt of the oppreſſed Jews and
their Religion, he then with an holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
addreſſes himſelf to God in theſe words,
<hi>Remember me, O Lord, for this, and wipe not
out the good deeds which I have done,</hi> &amp;c. This,
I take it, is <hi>laying up in ſtore a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the time to come,</hi> this is, <hi>making
friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that
when we fail they may receive us into everlaſting
habitations.</hi> Such actions, I ſay, either of
Piety or Charity aforeſaid, are as it were the
drawing a Bill upon God Almighty, to be
paid in the other World, and making a wiſe
and frugal Purchaſe of a Reverſion in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore (as I told you) I ſtudied all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
and conſulted the utmoſt of my
ability to do ſome remarkably good things,
that might be beneficial to the World or to
Religion when I was dead and gone, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ſow ſuch ſeed as whoſe fruit
ſhould by the grace of God be freſh and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the very day of Judgment.</p>
                     <p>3. But when all was done, I laid the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtreſs of all upon the third and laſt part of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100726:117"/>
my preparation, and that was in intereſſing my
ſelf in the Satisfaction and Interceſſion of my
Saviour. For beſides the many and great fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
I was ſenſible of, I conſidered alſo the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Divine Nature was ſuch, that <hi>he
found folly in his Angels,</hi> and deteſted ſin
where-ever he found it; that his Law was
ſtrict and perfect; that it was impoſſible any
thing ſhould be acceptable to ſuch a Majeſty,
or make amends for the breach of ſuch a Law,
but that which was perfect too; that nothing
could make atonement for ſin but a Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpot; that nothing could ſucceſsfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for us but the only Son of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſet an infinite value upon the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the light and grace of the Goſpel. I with
all heartineſs and thankfulneſs embraced the
Terms of the new Covenant: I endeavoured
to affect my ſelf with the higheſt ſenſe of love
and gratitude towards my Lord Jeſus Chriſt.
I pleaded his Sacrifice in my Prayers, I fed
my Faith with his Blood, I raiſed my hopes
by having ſo powerful an Advocate with the
Father; I comforted my ſelf againſt the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of the Devil and my own Conſcience,
and all my black and melancholy thoughts, by
the conſideration that he was appointed Judge
of the World, that was in humane Nature,
who had been ſenſible of our infirmities, had
experience of our temptations, and had ſo
much good will to us as to dye for us. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and adored his Divinity, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
him before men, I gloried in his Croſs
and Sufferings, I frequently obſerved the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of his Death and Paſſion in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I joyned my ſelf to his Church, I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100726:118"/>
his Miniſters, I reverenced all his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions;
and in a word, as the higheſt and
trueſt honour I could do to him, I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be like him, by imitation of his ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
purity, meekneſs and goodneſs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
that upon theſe terms he would own
me when he comes again in his glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                     <p>This (ſaid he) hath been the courſe and
care of my life, from ſuch time as I became
in earneſt ſenſible of the concern of another
World, and this is the ſumm of my conſtant
preparations for the day of Judgment; and
in this poſture I endeavour always to be found
whenſoever God calls me. I confeſs I ſhould
be right glad (if it pleaſe God to give me
opportunity) to make ſome more ſpecial and
particular preparations againſt the approaches
of death, if I could be aware of it, and to
trim and ſnuff my Lamp againſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
comes; but for that Gods will be done:
however by his Grace I hope I ſhall not be
utterly ſurpriſed nor diſmayed, having made
this habitual proviſion for it. </p>

holy, and a wiſe man,
and the relation which you have
given us, as from his own mouth,
exceedingly ſits the Character of
ſuch a Perſon; for there is both a lively Spirit
of Piety breathing in it, and withal ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
and proportionable modeſty, as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
aſſures the real truth of the whole Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
foraſmuch as I cannot ſuſpect you would
impoſe upon us herein; nor can I believe it eaſie
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100726:118"/>
(if poſſible) for an evil man to draw a Scene
of Vertue with ſo many Arguments of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
For my own part, I have been all along
ſo affected with it, that nothing hath grieved
me ſo much, as that you ſeemed to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
an end of your ſtory, as well as the good
man to the end of his life. And now I have a
thouſand queſtions, which I would gladly put
to you further about him, but that I am afraid
of being too troubleſom to you, eſpecially
ſince it grows late. However I pray pardon me
whilſt I interrogate you a little about the laſt
Act of ſo brave a Perſon. I remember you ſaid
he intended, if God gave him opportunity, to
make ſome more particular and ſpecial prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
at the approaches of death; now I have
a great curioſity to inquire, whether it pleaſed
God to afford him ſuch opportunities as he
wiſhed, and what uſe he made of them. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie

                  <p>Why therein, dear <hi>Phil.</hi> I will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you as well as I am able. You muſt know
therefore, that <hi>Eulabes</hi> having through the
courſe of his whole life maintained a ſtrict tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and now well advanced in years, it
happened to him (as it is uſual in ſuch caſes)
by the good Providence of God, to have a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
and leiſurely diſſolution; he was neither
racked to death by the intolerable pains of the
Gout or Stone, nor hurried out of the world in
the fiery Chariot of a violent Feaver, not ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by an Apoplexy, nor ſtupefied by a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy,
but was mildly and gently ſummoned
by a lingring ſickneſs, ſo that inſenſibly he felt
himſelf dying. By this means he had both time,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100726:119"/>
ſtrength and underſtanding to ſettle every thing
according to his wiſhes. When therefore he
ſaw the Harbingers of death draw on towards
him, and that he could not long maintain the
little Fort of life againſt the Confederate force
of ſo many infirmities as beſieged it, he then
diſpoſed himſelf for a Surrender.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, having formerly in better
health made his Will, and ſetled his temporal
Affairs, he now diſmiſſed all buſineſs, forbid all
impertinent talk, all troubleſom Viſitants, and
diſcharged his Phyſicians alſo, as finding no
farther uſe of them; and forthwith ſent for the
Phyſician of his Soul, the Miniſter of his Pariſh,
a plain, hearty and ſincerely good Man. And
he being come, my Friend addreſſes himſelf to
him, giving him hearty thanks for all the pains
he had taken in the courſe of his Miniſtry in
that place to do their Souls good. Wherein
(ſaith he) it hath pleaſed God ſo to order it,
that you have often come home to my caſe, and
touched the very diſtemper of my heart, as if
you had been within me; for which I humbly
thank Almighty God, and again and again
thank you, and pray God reward it in another
World.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, (proceeded he) that great Judge
of all the World is calling me to account of all
the actions of my life; I have therefore ſent
for you to audite them before-hand, that ſo by
your aſſiſtance I may either know my errours,
and repair whatſoever is amiſs, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ilſt yet I
have a little time left me to do it in; or if I
have ſtated my matters rightly, may appear
with the better aſſurance at that Tribunal. I
have always found you faithful in your Doctrine,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100726:119"/>
and I do not doubt but you will be impartial in
this application.</p>
                  <p>At this point I offered to go out, and leave
them private; which he perceiving, took me
by one hand, and the Miniſter by the other, and
then continued his diſcourſe. I will give you
(ſaid he to the Miniſter) the Hiſtory of my life,
at leaſt I will not conceal from you any main
paſſage of it, be it for me or againſt me, that
ſo you may paſs a judgment upon my ſpiritual
ſtate; and I deſire you, my dear Friend <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
to be preſent, who have been privy to
the moſt critical moments of it, to the intent
that you may witneſs againſt me before this
Man of God, if I falſifie in any thing. This
ſaid, he laid open the courſe of his life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſeveral other things, which either I do
not now ſo well remember, or think not fit to
repeat, he delivered the ſubſtance of that,
whereof I have given you a large account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and then he conjured him in the Name of
God to deal freely and plainly with him upon
the whole matter.</p>
                  <p>The holy Man, like a Jury, in a manifeſt caſe,
without long deliberation quickly brought in a
Verdict of comfort to him. Which when <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labes</hi>
perceived, with his eyes fixed upon him,
and a countenance ſomewhat cheared; Well,
ſaid he, God be thanked, if it be ſo, as I hope
it is; for I reſt aſſured Almighty Goodneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes
not the meaneſt ſincerity. But I humbly
and earneſtly befeech you, Sir, give me alſo
the Abſolution of the Church, that I may go
out of the World under the comfort of ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and authentick a Teſtimony. Which when
the Miniſter had ſolemnly performed, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100726:120"/>
him further to adminiſter to him the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that ſo (ſaid
he) ſeeing as it were my Saviour crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my eyes, and pouring out his Blood for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
I may the more firmly believe the pardon
of my own ſins, and upon the wings of Faith
and affection raiſe my ſelf towards Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This, after the interpoſition of Prayers and
Mediation and holy diſcourſe, was adminiſtred
to him; but, Lord, what an ecſtaſie of devotion
was the good Man now in! What tokens of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
affection, thankfulneſs and intention of
mind were then to be read in his countenance
and deportment! Moſt certainly Chriſt Jeſus
was preſent really, though not carnally, and
his Soul fed it ſelf moſt ſavourily upon him.
Theſe things being done, he diſmiſſed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
for that time, not without real expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his thankfulneſs to him for his pains and
aſſiſtance, nor without a liberal alms to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
at his diſcretion amongſt the Poor, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
intreating him to remember him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
in the Prayers of the Church, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might be holpen on his journey towards
Heaven, where he hoped ſhortly to arrive.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this, when by ſome repoſe he
had recovered a little ſtrength, his Family was
called together to his Beds ſide, with ſome others
of his Friends and Relations; all whom he moſt
earneſtly cautioned againſt looſneſs of life, and
profaneneſs of ſpirit, aſſuring them in the words
of a dying man, of the great reality and infinite
importance of Religion; he charged them, as
they would anſwer it at that great Day which
was certainly coming, that they ſhould not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themſelves either to be debauched into care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100726:120"/>
and lukewarmneſs, nor abuſed and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into phantaſtry and opinionativeneſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but perſiſt in the good old way, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
their Miniſter, keep to the Church, and
make the ſerving of God the greateſt care and
buſineſs of their lives. Then he diſcourſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
to them of the vanity of the World,
the uncertainty of life, the comforts of Religion,
and the joys of Heaven, till his ſpirits began to
be ſpent, and his ſpeech a little to falter. At
other times he retreated into himſelf, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
converſe with God by Prayers and
holy Meditations, in which what were the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of his Faith, what the holy raptures of
his Love, what humble abjections of himſelf
at the feet of Chriſt, what reſignations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the will of God, what pleading of the
promiſes of the Goſpel, and recumbency upon
the Interceſſion of his Saviour, we could not
be privy to further than as we ſaw his hands and
eyes earneſtly lift up to Heaven, ſometimes a
ſtream of tears falling from his eyes, and other
times interchangeably a chearful ſmile ſitting
upon his countenance; in which poſture bodily
ſtrength being now exhauſted, he with a gentle
ſigh reſigned up his Soul to God.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you the laſt paſſages of this
good Man (now no doubt in Heaven) if I have
not tired you with the relation, though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I am not very apt to ſuſpect that, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have done it in compliance with your
deſire; and beſides, I judge of other men by
my ſelf, and becauſe I am never weary of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or ſpeaking of him; therefore imagine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men may be of the ſame mind.</p>

                  <p>Ah! Sir, ſo far from being weary of ſuch
kind of diſcourſe, that I could willingly have
forgot all other things for it, and been glad this
Evening-Conference had continued till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
morning; but I conſider Devotion muſt
not too much intrench upon Civility; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I return you my hearty thanks for my good

                  <p>I thank you both for your good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and your charitable offices towards my
ſatisfaction, and I do already aſſure you of this
fruit of it, that by your Converſation I have
learnt that all Religion is not acting a part,
and playing the Hypocrite, which I was apt to
ſuſpect heretofore; for I ſee you are ſo really
hearty and in earneſt in it, and yet men of
greater ſagacity than my ſelf, that I tell you
truly I begin to think it becomes me ſeriouſly
to conſider of it. Good night to you, good
