            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce <hi>your Honour</hi> made me happily acquainted with most of your <hi>Relations,</hi> specially with those of your truly-reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and well-ordered <hi>Family</hi>; though I often joyed to see such varietie of <hi>rare endowments</hi> in one Noble Lady, yet (amongst them all) I could not but with more admiration observe, how as well your many <hi>devout discourses,</hi> as your
<pb facs="tcp:115737:3"/>
               <hi>pious Actions</hi> (the apparent steps, by which you climb to Heaven) were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly maintained by many <hi>Recesses,</hi> and <hi>Retirements</hi> for private <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Meditation</hi>; and how your greatest pains, and delight was more freely spent upon the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> This made me gratefully, and willingly ambitious, to present <hi>your Honour</hi> with some book, that should endeavour to facilitate some part of your study in the <hi>Bible.</hi> By which means I might both give a publick Testimonie of my thankfull acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to your <hi>Honour,</hi> and some other of my Noble <hi>Friends</hi>: and withal take an occasion to discharge a part of my Function, by inciting others, to follow such an <hi>eminent example</hi>; while I give a just approbation of your love to <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Piety</hi> in all kinds, and particularly of your frequent reading of <hi>Gods holy word,</hi> which is best able to make you <hi>wise
<pb facs="tcp:115737:3"/>
unto salvation.</hi> To which study there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have many earnest exhortations, as well in the Old, and New <hi>Testament,</hi> as in the writings of the most devout, and <hi>Reverend Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And good reason. For the <hi>word of God</hi> is the food of our souls. Therefore it should be the very <hi>joy of our hearts,</hi> and <hi>sweeter</hi> in our mouths <hi>then honie, and the honie-comb.</hi> So it was to the heart, and palate of him, that was a man after Gods own heart. Who, in the front of his Divine Songs, and Hymns, sings the <hi>blessednesse</hi> of Him, that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth himself in it,</hi> Day, and Night. As he did, so we have all just cause to admire, and congratulate him, that is <hi>feasted every day,</hi> with such spiritual food, and, while he is so, cannot but learn the surest way to <hi>repose his soul, every night</hi> (after such Angelical repast) upon
<pb facs="tcp:115737:4"/>
that pillow that passeth all understanding. I mean that <hi>Peace of God,</hi> that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be so well purchased, as by often feeding on the Word of God, and concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and converting it into such juice, and blood, and such spirit, and vigor, as may preserve, and cherish us, in all our waies.</p>
            <p>Of no lesse use is the studie of <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God,</hi> that we see in his holy word: therefore revealed, that we should often <hi>look into it,</hi> saith St. <hi>James.</hi> And I will not conceal the force of St. <hi>James</hi> his word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) that we should <hi>prie,</hi> and <hi>peep,</hi> and <hi>look narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and carefully into it, that nothing escape our sight. For there we shall find the means of purchasing that, without which it will prove, that we have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost our selves.</p>
            <p>If I shall need to say more, I will onely adde this confirmation of what I said, from holy <hi>David</hi> his calling it a <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn
<pb facs="tcp:115737:4"/>
to his feet</hi> and <hi>Gods word,</hi> Ps. <hi>119.</hi> Would we have <hi>a Light to conduct us</hi> into all necessary Truths? We must have it there. Would we have <hi>an Oracle to inform us</hi> infallibly of what we may trust to, in our greatest hopes, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? We must have it thence. That <hi>Divine Light</hi> will never mislead us. And the <hi>word of God</hi> we may safely rely upon.</p>
            <p>Therefore they are wise, that <hi>receive it meekly</hi> (I speak it in the words of an Apostle) And <hi>a good understanding</hi> have all they that do thereafter (saith the Royal Prophet.)</p>
            <p>I wish your <hi>Honour,</hi> and all yours, both those parts of Happinesse. Which is no more, in effect, then to wish the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of what you have, and your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in what you do. So shall you continue a pattern to all those, to whom this book shall come. Which comes as
<pb facs="tcp:115737:5"/>
presented <hi>under your name,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as it were <hi>from the hands of your Honour.</hi> For whom, and for all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to you, and for all the rest of my Noble and Worthy Friends, it is, every day, my hearty prayer, that you, and they may be preserved to everlasting <hi>Felicity,</hi> by the continual blessing and mercy of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</hi> So praies</p>

            <head>The Authours Advertisement to the READER.</head>
            <p>I Was the briefer in my Marginal Notes, (which some of my friends have thought fit to place at the bottom of the Page) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when I resolved to send this Paraphrasticall Exposition to the Presse, I resolved also to present ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble Friend of mine, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work (in the Scholar's Language) out of which, the grounds, and reasons of my proceeding in this way of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase might have been easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. And indeed that book was chiefly intended, as a Prolegomenon to this, and the like Essayes; to show, before hand, some Grammatical and Critical Observations (Hebrew and
<pb facs="tcp:115737:6"/>
Greek) which I have met with in the course of my studies: and to make the truth of them appear, by variety of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofs, and examples out of the Holy Text. So should I have eased my self of giving a particular reason of these, and the like Expositions, in a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and troublesome way. But that (being of a greater bulk, and proving a more chargeable attempt) I am forced to give over, till I am better inabled to impart it to others, by the help of the Printer. In the mean time, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to publish this brief Exposition of the hardest, and knottiest piece of the Hebrew Text. This of the <hi>Minor Prophets</hi> (as they are usually stiled) may well be called so; their intricate Prophetical passages, being cloathed with many unusual, and <hi>difficult words,</hi> and <hi>phrases,</hi> and <hi>proverbs,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew-forms</hi> of speach, that require a careful,
<pb facs="tcp:115737:6"/>
warie, <hi>observant, and pious Reader.</hi> Of all other parts of holy writ, such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies have need of Readers so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and, every time they come to them (that they may pierce into such mysteries with profit) <hi>prepared</hi> with humble and heartie prayers, or short ejaculations to <hi>Almighty God (whose word it is</hi>) that he would enlighten our understandings by <hi>his Holy Spirit (who spake by the Prophets.)</hi> So prepared, while we read in these books of so many things, so fully prophesied, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told before, with intermixture of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers excellent, and holy precepts, we shall plainly perceive (what we have most need of in these wicked daies) both the <hi>proofs of a Deitie,</hi> foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ordering, governing and disposing all things, in several Ages, with infinite Power, Wisdom, Mercie, and Justice: and also plentie of <hi>Divine Directions,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115737:7"/>
and <hi>Counsails,</hi> that much conduce to the true knowledge of the way of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>To make such antient, and useful, and holy Writers speak plain English, I thought it needful, not onely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with the Latine and Greek <hi>Fathers,</hi> and other <hi>Interpreters, Expositors,</hi> and <hi>Criticks</hi> that have gone before us: and to acquaint my self with the <hi>Storie of those times,</hi> to which they chiefly refer: but, besides that, to labour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that <hi>Idiome, and Dialect,</hi> which <hi>the Holy Ghost</hi> pleased to make use of, as best understood, and affected by them, to whom those writings were first intended. And from whom they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so profitably conveyed to us, if we studie not the <hi>stile, and garb</hi> of that Original Language: their little stock of <hi>ambiguous words</hi>: their <hi>concise elleiptical Sentences</hi>: and other short, and <hi>emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb facs="tcp:115737:7"/>
expressions.</hi> All which appearing to us somewhat strange, and unusual, must be carefully and discretely examined, before they can be fitted to the right sense, and mind of the place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And, as well as these, we must both ponder, and labour to expresse their intelligent, and convincing waies of proposing &amp; Rhetorically inlarging what they would say by strange <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>Hyperboles</hi>; by bould, and <hi>unusual Metaphors</hi> (that no other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ventured upon) by delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Prosopopoeias,</hi> and <hi>Paronomasies</hi> (wherein they are more rich, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and happie, then any other Tongues) By their <hi>Dialogismes,</hi> and Colloquies) not in the Psalms, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles onely, but in several other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) that the Reader shall now and then sodainlie fall upon, without any plain item given, for distinction of the persons,
<pb facs="tcp:115737:8"/>
that are the Interlocutors. By their frequent <hi>Transposition</hi> of letters and words. By sodain <hi>Apostrophes,</hi> and <hi>Mutation of Persons,</hi> and <hi>Numbers</hi> (when a man would least expect it.)</p>
            <p>To which I may adde their many other schemes, and ornaments, that are set down in <hi>a kind of Poetical libertie.</hi> Such as we may evidently see, <hi>Isai.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the description of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s entertainment, after his death, afforded him by those of his Military Profession, that had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to their long home. Such another we find in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> (c. 32. 21. &amp;c.) in the like gratulation, that other Men of the sword gave to the great King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in his descent to the same place. No man would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these literally, or, as a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast, or Interpreter, propose them down-right in that way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115737:8"/>If we desire more examples in these <hi>Figurative</hi> Relations, after a <hi>Divine Poetical way,</hi> we may see them, in the <hi>Royal Prophets Description</hi> of Almighty Gods sodain approach in great Majesty, as riding upon a Cherub, or upon the wings of the wind. Psal. 18. 7, 8. &amp;c. This the <hi>Evangelical Prophet</hi> follows, in his swift cloud, (<hi>Isa.</hi> 19. 1.) More may appear in the <hi>Prophet Habakkuks questions,</hi> about the manner of Gods coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> toward the Holy Land. (chap. 3. 8, 9. &amp;c.) And the Prophets <hi>Isai, Ieremy, Ioel,</hi> and <hi>Haggai</hi>'s deliverie of the overthrow, and desolation of Nations, (<hi>Isai.</hi> 34. 4, 5. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and v. 28. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Haggai</hi> 2. 21, 22. After whom, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> goes the same way. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>We have yet more in <hi>Iob</hi>'s manner of teaching us Gods providence, and
<pb facs="tcp:115737:9"/>
protection over his servants. <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 6. &amp;c. which is paralleld. 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. 19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. and elsewhere. And what I said of <hi>Iob</hi> puts me in mind of his description of <hi>Leviathan</hi> (chap. 41. 9, 10.) and <hi>Salomons</hi> eloquent Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis of old age. Eccles. 12. To which we may adde the Copie, that the holy Psalmist first set, to what we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served before out of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> which we find <hi>Ps.</hi> 77.17. &amp;c. and 114. 1.2. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They that meet with such divine Rhetorical or Poetical places, cannot well paraphrase them to the Reader, in another language, unlesse they take some libertie from that holy Rhetorick, and Poetrie, which they have before their eyes in such a Description, or such a place of the Original Copie. In imitation of which, many learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in several languages, have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently expressed many places of holy writ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115737:9"/>When we meet with such <hi>high Pathe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tical streins</hi> in sacro Codice, we should reverently receive and deliver them, as the issue of divine <hi>Prophetical Raptures.</hi> And while I, in some places, endeavour to do so, I hope, I shall be so interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all good Christian intelligent Readers. Who, though they love a Translator, that will keep close to the footsteps of his Author: yet they will expect, that a Paraphrast should inlarge himself according to the true scope, and sense of the place, and follow the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text closer then the words. For instance, when (in some of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited places of Scripture) I read of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon darkened</hi>: the falling of the <hi>Stars</hi>: the turning of the earth into the <hi>old Chaos,</hi> &amp;c. If I am a Paraphrast, to an indifferent intelligent Reader, it will be enough (without particular mention of the Sun, Moon, Stars, or Chaos) to expresse the disgrace and
<pb facs="tcp:115737:10"/>
downfall of the principal Governors, and chief men of that place, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and disorder of the common people. For that is the meaning of it. And these figurative speaches, among the Jews, were so easily interpreted, out of the usual tearms of the Oriental countries, that when <hi>Ioseph</hi> had dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "that the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Stars,</hi> did reverence to him, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could presently of himself, para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase upon the dream, and tell the meaning of it, <q>For what is this dream? saith he, Shall I, and thy Mother, and thy Brethren come indeed, and fall on the ground before thee?</q> This was so readily said by the good Patriarch, because they were the chief of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so as eminent in his house, as the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> in the Firmament.</p>
            <p>Many are the instances that I could give in the like kind, if I would venter to be tedious. But I have delivered the
<pb facs="tcp:115737:10"/>
Sum, and Substance of what I chiefly desired to say. Which, with the whole work, I humbly, and willingly submit to the judgement of the more judicious and learned Readers: specially to those that understand the Hebrew tongue, and the difficulty of many <hi>Hebrew Texts,</hi> which is very great. For, though all those things, that tend directly to our eternal happinesse, are plainly, and fully set down <hi>in sacrâ paginâ,</hi> yet some passages of <hi>holy Scripture</hi> there are, that cannot easily be fathomed. Which made a skilful Divine, and Reverend Father of the Church say, that some <hi>sacred texts</hi> are <hi>so shallow,</hi> that a lamb might passe over them without danger: and yet <hi>some so deep,</hi> that the greatest Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants (the wisest Clerks) would be troubled at them. St. <hi>Gregories</hi> expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like it, that <hi>some go down easily, like drink: other, like meat, must be broken,</hi> and <hi>cut,</hi> and <hi>chewed,</hi> before we can make
<pb facs="tcp:115737:11"/>
them fit nourishment. Those places Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines (above all other men) must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to apprehend as fully as they may.</p>
            <p>I say [<hi>as they may</hi>] because, I think, some of those places will pose the subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest, ablest, and most practised, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant readers of the holy Bible. In which, <hi>est aliquid prodire tenus.</hi> To this purpose, the <hi>Iews</hi> have a saying, that we cannot have a full satisfactorie resolution of all <hi>doubts, and queries,</hi> till <hi>Elias</hi> come. We must therefore be content, to follow him that said, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 3. 11.) holds true, as it ever will, which I conceave to be there spoken to this purpose, that <q>God hath given the hearts of men <hi>a
<pb facs="tcp:115737:11"/>
whole world of matter, for meditation:</hi> so large, so copious, that no man can ever fully go thorow with it, and find it out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such variety of matter affording new work of speculation for us, sometimes in plain, and easie: and sometime (to sharpen our appetite: and increase our industrie) in harder, and more intricate wayes, and terms: may move us willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to joyn the help of others to our own labour, and impart our helps to them. So, out of that <hi>plentie, and varietie of matter,</hi> our prayers, and good thoughts may have a continual, and profitable supply. Thence we may every day, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect something, to prepossesse that room in the heart, which otherwise vain phancies (and perhaps worse then vain phancies) may incroach upon.</p>
            <p>And if our meditations rise out of that <hi>plentie of matter,</hi> which the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> do best and most furnish us
<pb facs="tcp:115737:12"/>
withall: thence we have <hi>our Armoury,</hi> to strengthen us in our saddest combats with our ghostly enemies. And thence we have <hi>better then the balm of Gilead</hi> for curing the wounds, and diseases of the soul. There we have a kind of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with God himself,</hi> and the sight of his blessed will, and pleasure, in as clear a way and full measure, as is most expedient for us. In the most necessary things, we shall find it most apparently true. For, though the Scriptures may be hid to them that willfully perish (to such as come to them with the spirit of <hi>Pride,</hi> or with <hi>prejudice,</hi> or <hi>faction,</hi> or <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> or <hi>sinister respects.</hi>) Yet, if we come otherwise, with <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>faithful,</hi> and <hi>thirsty</hi> souls, we need not doubt, but we shall find God in that, which is <hi>his way,</hi> wherein he usually comes to us all.</p>
            <p>And God, of his infinite mercy, grant, that we may, all, so find him, to our everlasting comfort.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE To the ensuing Paraphrastical Exposition; BY THE Most Worthy and Learned Mr. <hi>IOHN PEARSON,</hi> Minister of St. <hi>Clements Eastcheape.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IF the Eunuch in the <hi>Acts,</hi> having a Prophet in his hand, and being asked this question, <hi>Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou what thou readest?</hi> could give no better answer than that, <hi>How can I, except some man should guide me?</hi> If this were the best account which could there be given where the Original Language was fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb facs="tcp:115737:13"/>
understood; What need of an Interpreter must they have, who, far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant both in time and place, can read the Prophets in no other than their mother-language, and that most different from the tongue in which those holy Authors wrote? As therefore the Generality of Christians could not read the Scriptures at all, except they were first translated; so when they are, many parts of them cannot yet be understood until they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted. And, as of all the holy writers the Prophets are confessedly most obscure; so amongst them the smallest must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be most intricate: brevity alwaies causing some obscurity.</p>
            <p>Now, though there be many Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators which have copiously written on the Prophets: Yet we shall not find that light which might be expected from them; because some have undertaken to expound those Oracles, being themselves either altogether ignorant of their language, or
<pb facs="tcp:115737:13"/>
very little versed in it. Others enlarge themselves by way of doctrines or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place, which may belong as well to any Authors as to those to which they are applied. Wherefore if any man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a desire to understand the Scriptures, I commend unto him those Interpreters, whose Expositions are Literal, searching and declaring the proprieties of the speach of the Author, and the scope and aim which he that wrote had in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it.</p>
            <p>Of these Literal Interpreters, useful to all Readers, those are most advantageous to the unlearned, who contrive their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions by way of Paraphase, and so make the Author speak his own sense plainly, and perspicuously; which is the greatest life that can be given unto any writing originally obscure. For if the Interpreter truly understand the mind of the Author, then without any trouble or circumlocution it becomes the same thing as if the Writer
<pb facs="tcp:115737:14"/>
had clearly at first exprest himself. And therefore proportionably to our opinion of the knowledge of the Paraphrast, we may rely upon the understanding of the Author.</p>
            <p>Thus in these smaller Prophets acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, especially by such as know most, to be obscure, that Interpreter which shall be able to deliver their mind, and contrive the same as if it proceeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from themselves, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be confessed the best Expositour. And no man can be able to perform this but he which is exactly knowing of all the idioms of the Hebrew tongue, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly acquainted with, and constantly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Prophets themselves, and the writings of the Iews.</p>
            <p>Now such a person as this is, hath taken the pains to benefit the Church of God with a paraphrase of this nature. The Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Stokes,</hi> who hath from the happy beginning of his studies been known most industriously to have prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb facs="tcp:115737:14"/>
that of the Oriental Languages, and hath for more then forty years constantly made Remarques upon the Hebrew Text, from which he hath raised unto himself a body of Critical Observations ready and most fit for publique view. Amongst many advantages accruing especially to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Scriptures, he hath made choice to publish this Paraphrase of the small Prophets: a work of more real, then seeming, value. Which I cannot sufficiently commend to the Reader, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in respect of it self (it is of so great use and benefit) nor in reference to his other works, which we may hope to see according to the entertainment given to this. And that (Christian Reader) he desires may be found correspondent to the desert thereof; Who is the Authors</p>

The Prophets (by whom I instructed you, and forewarned you of the plagues that would follow your rebellions, and of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and favours, that would crown all your good actions) never said any thing to you, but what they received from me. They all agreed in expressing of the same message, as <hi>men that walk together in the same way, are agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Your walking <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 5. 22. Exod. 16. 5.</note> with me, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in my waies, should have appeared in the like agreement of yours with me, and them. And if your actions had been so consonant to my will, and their admonitions, you had now been in as fair a way to the increase of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115737:97"/>
your happinesse; as your dissent from me, and them, hath brought you into the high way of ruine and confusion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When my Prophets came to you with threats in their mouths, it was no more then I put into them. If you will call it the <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1. 2.</note> roaring of a Lion, it was my voice. <hi>And will the Lion roar either in the forrest or in his den, but when the prey is in his view: so near that he may take it, when he will.</hi> Even so make you no other account, but that my Justice will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as sure those Prophetical threats, as the prey follows upon the roaring of the Lion. Therefore make your peace sodainly, unlesse you will expose your selves to a sodain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Do birds use to fall into a net, spred upon the ground, and be taken in it, unlesse it be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely so laid by the Fowler, that it may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them.</hi> So are your punishments prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically foretold, like snares that are laid for you in my Justice, and by my direction. When the Prophets have forewarned you, if you will not take heed, but by your own supine carelesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse fall into the net: you may thank your selves. [<hi>praemoniti praemuniti,</hi> if it be as it should be] And your timely repentance, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115737:97"/>
amendment of life, would be a likely means for the removal of the snare, in which the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> are thinking to catch you, and hold you fast. But if they once come near, as <hi>the Fowler will not remove the snare, till the birds be caught:</hi> so neither will God recal his sentence against you, nor they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their armies, till it be too late for you to escape.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>When by the sound of a trumpet,</hi> in time of war <hi>there is notice given to a City</hi> of the forces of the enemie approaching toward them, <hi>shall not that City be afraid,</hi> and prepare for the best way of prevention, or resistance? <hi>Why then do not your fears produce the like care,</hi> when your Prophets, that are your Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Isa; 58. 1.</note> make their voices like a trumpet, to rouse you up, and acquaint you with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at hand? For <hi>is there any such evil of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment denounced, or brought upon a City, of which God himself is not the Authour?</hi> Who therefore doth it, that you may either timely repent, or justly suffer.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And <hi>he keeping it not so secret, but that, by his Prophets, you are made privie to his full intention,</hi> and they unanimously agreeing in the message, you cannot but confesse, that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115737:98"/>
you are fairly and sufficiently forewarned, and consequently, if you use not the right means of prevention, that the true cause of all your suffering must be indeed from your selves onely, and your own impenitence.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Which of you now will not be afraid at the roaring of this Lion? And which of us that are Prophets, dare refuse to prophesie, and give you notice of that, which God himself</hi> (in such a fearful manner) <hi>injoynes us to speak,</hi> and we cannot but at our own peril, as well as yours, conceal from you?</p>
               <p n="9">9.

your Sacrifices, or Ceremonies, or any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act of seeming Obedience, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from a faithfull, and pure Heart.

I was so far from taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them, that <hi>I ever hated, and abhorred, your Festivall Dayes: And your sweet incense, or what else you offered in my house, at the time of your solemn assemblies, was not accepted by me, as any sweet savour,</hi> unlesse (with all) Piety and sincerity, and integrity of life did commend you unto me.</p>
               <p n="22">22 You thought that you did me great service in <hi>your Holocausts, and other oblations,</hi> but they <hi>never moved me so much, as to look fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably upon them,</hi> because you did not (with them) offer your selves, your soules, and bodies, as a reasonable, and lively sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto me.

And for <hi>your fat peace-offerings</hi> (which should have been the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of your thankfull hearts) they <hi>never gained any good liking from me,</hi> because the heart, and life of them was wholy wanting.</p>

with, what you sing: And such have yours commonly been. <hi>The like I may say of your Psalteries, and Harps,</hi> and other Instruments, which, being accompanied with sweet voices, you presented before me, as rare melodious Musick. But it was contradicted with such a discord in your lives, and actions, that it <hi>came into my eares, like a harsh sound</hi> not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. For, it is the harmony of good hearts, and the constant exercise of holy Vertues, that I account the sweetest Musick.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Especially, the constant execution of <hi>Iustice, and Iudgement.

               <p n="25">25.

sacrifice of Piety, Obedience and Thankfulness, which is the service, that I chiefly desired? For the main intention of your other sacrifices, was onely to keep you from Idolatry, and to exercise your obedience, and thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements unto me.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Arise, go to Nineveh that great city, and cry against it; for their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse is come up before me.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But Ionah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Ioppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it to goe with them unto Tarshish, from the presence of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the Sea, so that the ship was like to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man unto his God, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115737:137"/>
sea, to lighten it of them; but Ionah was gone down into the sides of the ship, and he lay, and was fast asleep.</p>
               <p n="6">6 So the Ship-master came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish not.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evill is upon us: what is thine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation? and whence co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest thou? what is thy countrey? and of what peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple art thou?</p>
               <p n="9">9 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew, and I fear the Lord the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? (for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had told them)</p>
               <p n="11">11 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? (for the sea wrought and was tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous.)</p>
               <p n="12">12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land, but they could not; for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Wherefore they cried unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this mans life, and lay not upon us inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thee.</p>
               <p n="15">15 So they took up Ionah
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115737:137"/>
and cast him forth into the sea, and the sea ceased from her raging.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord, and made vowes.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Ionah, and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah was in the belly of the fish three dayes and three nights.</p>

far as the famous port of Ioppe</hi> (the likeliest to accommodate him for this flight) <hi>he there accordingly found a ship ready to put saile for that place.</hi> To break off all further delay, <hi>he presently paid the fare, and took his place in the ship:</hi> hoping that the further he <hi>removed from the place of Gods peculiar presence, where he received his command,</hi> the further he should be from his employment to Niniveh, which he desired, by all meanes, to avoid <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Exod. 3. 11, &amp; 4. 13.</note> (as Moses once did his journey into Egypt.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>But</hi> (to show how hard it was to resist the will, and pleasure of him, that laid the command upon him) while Jonah thought himself secure, and at liberty, <hi>the Lord sent a violent wind into the sea, which raised such a sudden impetuous tempest in that place, that they seemed all in danger of perishing by ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This drave the fearfull Mariners into such a sit of devotion,</hi> as seldome takes them but in a sad storm.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115737:139"/>
In the mean time Ionah had got down into the lower parts of the ship, where he slept as securely, as if he had been no way concerned in this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and perilous storm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>In this posture was he, when the Master of the ship lighting upon him, ratled him up for sleeping so soundly</hi> in a time of common fear, and danger, <hi>and advised him,</hi> by their example, <hi>to fall to his prayers, and call upon</hi> his God, for his own and their safety, <hi>if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God would be entreated,</hi>

                  <hi>to be propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and gracious unto them, and preserve them from perishing</hi> in the Sea.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>But the Mariners</hi> (seeing the violence of the storm no whit abated, after their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse to their Gods, seconded with the prayer of Jonah, and the ordinary outward meanes of easing the ship of their portage) began to suspect, that there was some wicked miscreant among them, whom divine vengeance would not snffer to live, and for whose sake they suffered all this misery. Therefore according to their usuall course, in such extremities, they resolved upon casting of lots, and <hi>said among themselves, Come, let us cast lots, that thereby we may know, the true cause, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115737:140"/>
of all this evill. And when they had done so,</hi> after their blunt way, without prayer, or other enquiry after God, <hi>the lot,</hi> by divine Providence, <hi>fell upon Ionah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Upon this, they did not presently cast him out, whom the lot had (as they thought) so plainly discovered to be the man, that was persecuted with that storm. But, to inform themselves more particularly, <hi>they said unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause</hi> (as thou thinkest) <hi>this evill is brought upon us</hi>? Art thou guilty of any horrid sinne, that might deserve it? Examine thy self. <hi>what hath been thy course of life?</hi> (there may be some fault of thy own, in that) <hi>whence comest thou? Of what countrey, and of what people art thou?</hi> (thou mayest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps come from a wicked, and accursed place.)</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Ionah answered</hi> punctually, to that which most reflected upon the case in hand; <hi>that he was an Ebrew, and worshipped the Lord God of Heaven,</hi> (whither they did, or should have directed their prayers) <hi>who made the vast Sea</hi> (which terrified them now) <hi>and the dry land</hi> (where they longed to arrive in safety.)</p>

               <p n="11">11.

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Then spake the Prophet</hi> as from the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, <hi>and told them, that their safety could not be otherwise procured than by casting him over board,</hi> and so committing him to the

               <p n="1">1. <hi>IN the mean time Ionah</hi> (instead of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and blessing God for his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the sad, and penitent Ninivites) <hi>discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his great anger, and impatience,</hi> and too much respect, and tendernesse of his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and credit, which he would not have blemished with the wellfare of the Gentiles, against whom he had prophesied. And a strange thing this must needs seem to be, that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet should take it ill, that his Prophesie was seconded with their repentance, or that their repentance should be crowned with so much mercie, and deliverance. Specially, after him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had suffered so much for his disobedience and backwardnesse to prophesie to them: and been delivered out of the verie jaws of death, upon his own penitent, and humble supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

in his own behalf. For this, though it may be thought to show his tender love to his own people, that, by this repentance, and successe at <hi>Nineve,</hi> were convinced of what the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie of the <hi>Iews</hi> deserved at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; yet is it an evident Argument of great weaknesse in the Prophet, and great mercie in God, that would pardon such a fault to a weak servant of his, who seemed now to envie that favour to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which God had long before showed himself willing to bestow, though it were to the irritation of the <hi>Iews.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Yet the gratious Lord</hi> answers not the Prophet according to the heat of his passion, or the errour of his judgement, but in great mercy and meeknesse <hi>proposeth this question, Whether he thought, that he had just cause to be angry</hi> with him for sparing so great a City upon their true repentance?

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Now,</hi> (when the thin slight materials of Jonah his booth began to wither, and fade with heat) <hi>the Lord prepared a gourd,</hi> (or some shrub, that used to grow in those parts) <hi>to come over Ionah,</hi> like a Canopie, <hi>to shadow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his head from the heat of the Sun, which seemed not a little to afflict him.

               </p>
               <p>Their sins made up their full measure by neglect and <hi>contempt of the very Laws, of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> and of <hi>God</hi> himself.

                  <hi>apprehension</hi> of that strange course of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Justice.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>second Chapter</hi> resolves the holy <hi>Prophet</hi> (as it may do us) in <hi>that scruple,</hi> and showes him the <hi>progresse of God's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Iustice,</hi> overtaking the bloody, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, sacrilegious <hi>Chaldeans</hi> (in the height of their securitie) and falling the more heavily upon them, for their <hi>abusing the power,</hi> that was put into their hands, when they were permitted to be the scourges of men, that were <note n="(b)" place="bottom">c. 1, 13.</note> better than themselves.</p>
               <p>Which may read a Lecture to any, who contribute too much to the malignity of such wicked dayes. This may advise them (while they have time of Repentance) seriously to examine themselves, and their own cause. This being a Truth, that is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by this passage of <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> and this example in the Jewes, and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi>; That God may be so <hi>angry</hi> with the sins of his own People, or so <hi>willing to have their Pietie,</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> made known to the world, that it may produce some effects, that are little expected. So that either for the <hi>severe punishment</hi> of some (to whom
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:115737:199"/>
it is likely he means to show the more mercy, in a greater, and more terrible day.) Or for the <hi>Fatherly correction</hi> of others (that by outward calamities he will hasten to a better amendment of life.) Or for the <hi>exacter tryall</hi> of the <hi>Faith, Obedience, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> and <hi>Perseverance</hi> of others, (for whom he intends a weightier Crown of Glory in everlasting Mansions. For these, and the like respects, it may please God, to give way to the doing of many things, which may well seem strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the eies of men.</p>
               <p>And, while such things are in agitation, He may let them see many cruell, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious designes, seconded with as prosperous successes, as the evill hearts of the Actors could wish. We found it true, in the former Chapter, of the Chaldeans, and may, else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, of others, that were inabled to say, that <hi>God goes in, and out with their Forces:</hi> that <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Micah. 2. 13, 14.

                  <hi>He fights for them in the head of their Armies,</hi> and <hi>crownes their Actions with Triumphs,</hi> and <hi>Victories</hi> over far more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and religious undertakers than they are.

               <p n="3">3 God came from Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the holy one from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</p>

               <p n="11">11 The sun and moon stood still in their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Thou didst march through the land in indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p>

               <p>THe third Chapter, in a <hi>devout Prayer,</hi> or <hi>divine Hymne,</hi> set to an Instrument of Musick, admires the Justice, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Goodnesse of Almighty God.

any were more truely, and compassionately affected with it, than himself was; and I think he was never the lesse affected with it, when he made it a part of his solemn Musick.</p>
               <p>Shall I adde this too? that, though his Prayer could not move God any thing the more, by the advantage of the rarest skill in Musick, wherein it might be delivered: yet if the Prophet, or others, that used it after him, by the help of those solemn, and harmonious Tones had <hi>their own Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> any thing <hi>the more affected in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>: then was there Motive enough, why he should (for theirs, or his own sake) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to some <hi>Artist,</hi> that could fit it to a <hi>Musicall Instrument.</hi>

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115737:208"/>
                  <hi>comforts himself</hi> in the examples of Gods love and Providence over his Church: <hi>puts his</hi> own pious thoughts, and <hi>Resolutions into a Divine Meditation</hi>: and <hi>refers all to be set to a Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tune.</hi> As appears by the <hi>Shigionoth</hi> in the front: and the Musicall <hi>Sela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> in the body, and again by his <hi>Neginoth</hi> in the foot of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Song, and divine Ditty.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Shigionoth</hi> first it seems to be <hi>some Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall Tune, or Instrument.</hi> I agree with those that take it to be <hi>some erraticall, various, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Modulation:</hi> and I think it to be the same Tune, or Instrument, that the sweet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Israel made choice of, under the name of <hi>Shiggaion,</hi> in the Title of the seventh Psalm. Which is also a Prayer of Davids, made upon occasion of some words (or actions) of Cush the Benjamite, <hi>i.</hi> of Saul, that was like a Cush, or AEthiopian in this, that he would no more change his malice to David, than the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian his skin.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Selah</hi> (in the third, and thirteenth verse of this Chapter,) that is a Musicall note, which serves as a direction for the <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing up of the voice</hi> in that place, wherein it is fixed. And I like that which Kimehi joynes with it, the <hi>elevation of the heart too.</hi> We never meet with it, but in the Psalmes of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid (in whose time it seems to have been
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:115737:208"/>
taken up as a word of Art) and, after him, in this Prayer of Habakkuk.</p>
               <p>Then for the word <hi>Neginoth,</hi> It is properly referred to <hi>Instruments of Musick,</hi> especially those that were <hi>played upon with the fingers,</hi> and had the <hi>Voice joyned with them,</hi> as in the solemn Hymnes, and other Musicall Service of the Jewish Church.</p>
               <p>And he that had a more extraordinary skill in that way, and was the <hi>chief in composing, or overseeing</hi> that kind of Melody, is called here, by the Prophet Habakkuk, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this Prayer, and by the Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in the Title of the fourth Psalm. <hi>Menat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seach Binginoth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more I have to say, before I come to the Prayer it-self, that in this Chapter, (as it may well be expected where such <hi>Musick is</hi>) the holy Prophet, in expressing his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, seems to use a kind of <hi>Divine</hi>

But, after <hi>Darius</hi> was come to the Crown of <hi>Persia</hi>: God was pleased to expresse his pleasure (by <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zacharie</hi>) for their proceeding in the work of the Temple, mercifully intending to move the heart of <hi>Darius</hi> to favour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
               <p>Some there were that gave ear to these two Prophets, by the encouragement of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robabel,</hi> their Commander, and <hi>Iosuah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Iosedec,</hi> their High-Priest. Yet many of the common people, partly unwilling to undergo the labour of the work, and the danger of the enemie, that opposed it: and partly desirous to avoid the charge, and expense of such a Fabrick, had no mind to hear of that ear: and thought it far better, and safer, to live frugallie in those houses which they had built somewhat convenient for themselves, and so (as they thought) to secure themselves of the profits of the Country, and save their money in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, making no further contribution toward
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:115737:230"/>
those publick structures, which did but give offence to their enemies.

               <p n="1">1. IN the eighth moneth, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah, the son of Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Therefore say thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Turn ye unto me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Be not as your fathers unto whom the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, have cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Turn ye now from your evil waies, and from your evill doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me saith the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</p>

               <p n="7">7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth moneth, which is the moneth Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah, the son of Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</p>
               <p n="8">8 I saw by night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him were there red horses, speckled and white.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Then said I, O my Lord, what are these? And the Angel that talked with me, said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Then the angel of the Lord answered, and said, O Lord of hostes, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Ierusalem, and on the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Iudah, against which thou hast had indignation these three-score and ten years?</p>
               <p n="13">13 And the Lord answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the angel that talked with me, with good words and comfortable words.</p>
               <p n="14">14 So the angel that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with me, said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I am jealous for Ierusalem, and for Zion with a great jealousie.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:115737:241"/>15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Therefore thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Ierusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Ierusalem.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, My cities through prosperitie shall yet be spread abroad, and the Lord shall yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Zion, and shall ye choose Ierusalem.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Then lift I up mine eies, and saw, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold four hornes.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered me, These are the hornes which have scattered Iudah, Israel, and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And the Lord shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me four carpenters.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Then said I, What come these to do? and he spake, saying, These are the hornes which have scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iudah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lift up their horne over the land of Iudah to scatter it.</p>

                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:115737:243"/>7.

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>In the</hi> quiet silence of the <hi>night, I saw a vision</hi> (that promised, though in a dark, and mysticall way, a quiet and peaceable time for the advancement of the work about the Temple: and partly discovered, how many Angels were ready, with the Messias, to assist and defend the Church in that time: and much more, under that figure, how many helps would be afforded from heaven, for that more spirituall Church: whose founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be laid in that Citie, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Messias, and of his Apostles, and Disciples) In this vision (to show the speed and forwardnesse of them that were sent) I observed, <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Apoc. 6. 4.</note>

                  <hi>by a river side,</hi> (wherein again as the bottom, and the shadow of the trees bid us take notice, how obscurely these things are revealed, and how little hope appeared from men, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and tranquillity of the Church: so the trees being the sweet and humble myrtle, were a figure of meek and humble men, that were, for their holy life, accounted as a sweet odour unto God.) But after the view of this Horse-man, came more holy Emblems of our help. For <hi>behind him</hi> (as the Captain) there appeared other (as attendants) <hi>on red horses and speckled and white,</hi> (as if the red were to signifie those, that should attend their great Captain in prosecution of the revenge of the bloody enemies of the Church, whereof we spake before: and the other two, those that came for the punishment of such as were other waies spotted with sin: and for the protection of the <hi>pure,</hi> and innocent.)</p>

               <p n="12">12. <hi>Vpon this occasion, that great Messenger from the Lord was pleased to say</hi> (as the great Mediator for his despised Church) <hi>O Lord of Hostes, how long was it, ere thou wouldst have

this pitie upon Ierusalem, and other the Cities of Iudah,</hi> (which still appear but in their ruines and rubbish, and) <hi>which in thine anger</hi> thou didst keep under the Babylonian captivity, <hi>no lesse than threescore and ten years</hi> (the very age of a man.)</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And the Lord Iehovah himself gave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that great Angel, that had spoke so to me in most loving, and comfortable words.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. <hi>Hereupon that great Angel, and Embassador that had vouchsafed so far to commmune with me</hi> added this further, and <hi>said, Go and preach</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto thy people the Jewes, <hi>and say, Thus saith the Lord of Hostes, I have indeed been jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over Ierusalem, and Sion, and very jealous over them</hi> (because of their spiritual adulteries, which they have committed against me, and I have punished them, in some proportion to that jealousie.)</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOt long after these Visions, I was rapt into another extasie, wherein <hi>the Angel, that had conference with me before, seemed to come again and awake and rouse me up, as one out of a deep sleep and transe,</hi> that I might be the more attent, and observant of other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, that were then to be revealed unto me, by way of vision.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And he said unto me, what seest thou</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie? <hi>And I said, there is another sight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to my eyes,</hi> which takes me up with such admiration, that <hi>I cannot deliver it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Ecce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Methinks I see a Candlestick all of gold</hi> (one of the great ornaments of the house of God) <hi>and the bowl belonging to the top of it</hi> (whence the oyl was conveyed, as out of a fountain) <hi>and his seven lamps thereon, and seven several pipes,</hi> which emptied the oyl out of the bowl, and bestowed it the in match, or wick <hi>of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lamps: which pipes were upon the top of the shaft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And by this fair Candlestick stood two olive-trees, one upon the right side of the bowl,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:115737:254"/>
and the other upon the left-side thereof:</hi> which gave a continual supply of oyl to the bowls, and might signifie <note n="(a)" place="bottom">V. ult.</note> the two sons of oyl (as we call them) <hi>i.</hi> the two sacred persons, that have holy unction, the King and the Priest: and might intimate unto us, that a Prince and Priest we should have, till the times of the Messias, according to the Prophesie of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Though these mysteries both here, and in the Temple might have a farther light in this Candlestick; to show us the ecclesiastical fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the greater Church of God, wherein the several Ministers, like several and clear lamps, should shine forth in their doctrine, and conversation, that others, by their good light, may be brought to glorifie their father, which is in heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But, these things, at the first representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vision, I did not so discover, but, being wholly taken up with admiration, <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and said further to the Angel, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed with me, what is the meaning of these things, my Lord.</hi>

               <p n="12">12 The Lord will cut off the man that doth this: the master and the scholar out of the Tabernacles of Iacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts.</p>

               <p n="14">14 Yet ye say, Wherefore Because the Lord hath been witnesse between thee and the wife of thy youth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And did not be make one? yet had he the residue of the spirit: and wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed: therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wife of his youth.</p>
