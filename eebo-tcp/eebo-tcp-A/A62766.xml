            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat We Your Majeſties moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, having all along behaved our Selves with an humble and modeſt Patience and Submiſſion, amongſt the moſt Eminent Dangers, and moſt ſignal diſappointments; Can no longer be ſilent without rendring our Selves infamous to poſterity, as Perſons abandoning our own Safety, wanting Courage to defend Your Majeſties Life, Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and Love for our Country.</p>
            <p>And whereas by the Known Laws of this Realm (which Your Majeſty has obliged Your Self by Your Coronation Oath to obſerve) Your Majeſty is to uſe the Advice of Your great Council, the Parliament; for Redreſſing Grievances, and providing extraordinary Remedy againſt unuſual and Eminent Dangers. And whereas, Your Majeſty was Graciouſly pleaſed to the Infinite Joy of Your whole Kingdom, on the 20th. day of <hi>April</hi> laſt, to Declare to Your Parliament, That it was your Reſolution to Conſult with, and be Adviſed by Parliaments, in all Your Majeſties Weighty and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs.</p>
            <p>And whereas there never was any Affair ſo Weighty, and ſo Important as the Preſervation of Your Sacred Perſon and Kingdom, from the preſent Plots, Influences, Villanous Deſignes, and Bloody Conſpiracies of the Papiſts at Home in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their Adherents abroad, to which they are chiefly Encouraged by [the Hopes of a Popiſh Succeſſor, and] the Abſence of Parliaments, by whom alone the Principal Conſpirators can be brought to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And whereas we have been awakened to a greater ſenſe of our Danger, and of the nearneſs of our Deſtruction, as well by the Conſideration of the Terrour and Amazement of all Your Majeſties Subjects, during Your Majeſties ſuddain and violent Sickneſs, from which to their Infinite joy, and by the great Goodneſs of God you are ſo happily Recovered, as alſo by obſerving the Inſolence of the Papiſts to increaſe continually, and that they ſtill purſue their Accurſed Deſigns, by New and more deteſtable methods of Endeavouring to Corrupt Your Majeſties Evidence, and ſuborning Witneſſes to accuſe many Great and Innocent Proteſtants of Pretended Treaſons, (thereby the better to Conceal and Execute their own) whereby no mans Life or Eſtate can be ſecure.</p>
            <p>We do therefore Moſt Humbly Beſeech Your Majeſty, To the end that the aforeſaid Helliſh Conſpiracies may be throughly Examin'd, and Juſtice Effectually done upon the Conſpirators, and ſufficient and adequate Proviſions may be made for ſecuring Your Majeſties Royal Perſon, The Proteſtant Religion, The Ancient well-Eſtabliſht Government of this Kingdom, and all Your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, That the preſent Parliament Prorogued to the 26th. of <hi>January</hi> next, may Meet and continue to Sit till they have accompliſht thoſe Great Ends, which will render Your Majeſty the Moſt Beloved of Princes, will make Your Name Glorious to Poſterity, and Your Subjects moſt Happy under Your Reign.</p>
            <closer>And Your Majeſties moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, will chearfully with their Lives and Fortunes, Defend Your Majeſties Perſon and Government, and as in Duty bound will pray For and rejoyce In Your Long and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reign.</closer>
