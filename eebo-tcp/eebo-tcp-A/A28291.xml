         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ths space and more. But then the Wind came about, and setled in the West for many daies, so as we could make little or no way, and were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in purpose to turn back. But then again there arose Strong and Great VVinds from the South, with a Point East; which carried us up, (for all that we could do) towards the North: By which time our Victuals failed us, though we had made good spare of them. So that finding our selves, in the Midst of the greatest VVilderness of waters in the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Victuall, we gave our Selves for lost Men, and prepared for death. Yet we did lift up our Hearts and Voices to GOD above, <hi>who sheweth his Wonders in the Deep</hi>; Beseeching him of his Mercy, that as in the <hi>Beginning</hi> He discovered the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Deep,</hi> and brought forth <hi>Drie-land</hi>: So he would now discover Land to us, that we might not perish. And it came to pass, that the next day about Evening, we saw within a Kenning before us, towards the North, as it were thicker Clouds, which did put us in some hope of Land: Knowing how that part of the South-Sea was utterly unknown: And might have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the Dawning of the next Day, we might plainly discern that it was a Land Flat to our sight, and full of Boscage: which made it shew the more Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64462:4"/>
into a good <hi>Haven,</hi> being the Port of a fair <hi>City.</hi> Not great indeed, but well built, and that gave a pleasant view from the Sea. And we thinking every minute long, till we were on Land, came close to the Shore, and offered to Land. But straight waies we saw divers of the People, with Bastons in their hands, (as it were) forbidding us to land: Yet without any Cries or Fiercenesse, but only as warning us off, by Signes that they made. Whereupon being not a little discomforted, we were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising with our selves, what we should do. During which time, there made forth to us a small Boat, with about eight Persons in it, whereof One of them had in his Hand a Tip-staffe of a yellow Cane, tipped at both ends with Blew, who made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board our Ship, without any shew of Distrust at all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> And when he saw one of our Number, present himself somewhat afore the rest, he drew forth a little Scroul of Parchment (somewhat yellower than our Parchment, and shining like the Leaves of VVriting Tables, but otherwise soft and flexible,) and delivered it to our formost man. In which Scroul were written in Antient <hi>Hebre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reupon amongst our Selves, we were much perplexed. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Deniall of Landing, and Hasty VVarning us away, troubled us much: On the other side, to find that the People had Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and were so full of Humanity, did comfort us not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. And above all, the Sign of the <hi>Crosse</hi> to that Instrument, was to us a great Rejoycing, and as it were a certain Presage of Good. Our Answer was in the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue; <hi>That for our Ship, it was well; For we had rather met with Calmes and contrary winds, than any Tempests. For our Sick, they were many, and in very ill Case; So that if they were not permitted to Land, they ran in danger of their lives.</hi> Our other VVants wee let down in particular, adding; <hi>That we had some little store of Merchandize, which if it pleased them to deal for, it might supply our Wants, without being charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64462:4"/>
unto them.</hi> VVe offered some Reward in Pistolets unto the Servant, and a piece of Crimson Velvet to be presented to the <hi>Officer</hi>: But the Servant took them not, nor would scarce look upon them; And so left us, and went back in another little Boat which was sent for him.</p>
            <p>About three Hours after we had dispatched our Answer, there came toward us, a Person (as it seemed,) of place. He had on him a Gown with wide Sleeves, of a kind of VVater Chamolet, of an excellent Azure Colour, far more glossy than ours: His under Apparell was green, and so was his Hat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of a Turban, daintily made, and not so huge as the <hi>Turkish</hi> Turbans; And the Locks of his Hair came down below the Brims of it. A Reverend Man was he to behold. He came in a Boat, gilt in some part of it, with four persons more onely in that Boat; And was followed by another Boat, wherein were some Twenty. VVhen he was come within a Flight-shot of our Ship, Signes were made to us, that we should send forth some to meet him upon the water, which we present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did in our Ship-Boat, sending the principal Man amongst us save one, and four of our Number with him. VVhen we were come within six yards of their Boat, they called to us to stay, and not to approach further, which we did. And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Man, whom I before described, stood up, and with a loud voyce in <hi>Spanish,</hi> asked, <hi>Are ye Christians</hi>? VVe answered, <hi>We were</hi>; fearing the lesse, because of the <hi>Crosse</hi> we had seen in the Subscription. At which Answer the said Person lift up his Right Hand towards Heaven, and drew it softly to his Mouth (which is the Gesture they use, when they thank GOD;) And then said: <hi>If you will swear, (all of you) by the merits of the</hi> SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, <hi>that ye are no Pirates; Nor have shed bloud, lawfully, nor unlawfully, within forty daies past; you may have License to come on Land.</hi> We said, <hi>We were all ready to take that Oath.</hi> VVhereupon one of those that were with him, being (as it seemed) a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> made an Entry of this Act. Which done, another of the Attendants of the Great Person, which was with him in the same Boat, after his Lord had spoken a little to him, said aloud: <hi>My Lord would have you know, that it is not of Pride, or Greatnesse, that he commeth not aboard your Ship: But for that, in your Answer, you declare, that you have many Sick amongst you, he was warned by the</hi> Conservatour <hi>of</hi> Health, <hi>of the</hi> City, <hi>that he should keep a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> VVe bowed our selves towards him, and answered: <hi>We
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64462:5"/>
were his humble Servants; And accounted for great Honour, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Humanity toward us, that which was already done<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> But hoped well, that the Nature of the Sicknesse, of our Men, was not infectious.</hi> So he returned; And a while after came the <hi>Notary</hi> to us aboard our Ship; Holding in his hand a Fruit of that Country, like an Orenge, but of colour between Orenge-tawny and Scarlet: which cast a most excellent Odour. He used it (as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seemeth) for a Preservative against Infection. He gave us our Oath; <hi>By the Name of Iesus and his Merits</hi>; And after told us, that the next day by six of the Clock in the Morning, we should be sent to, and brought to the <hi>Strangers House,</hi> (so he called it) where we should be accommodated of things, both for our VVhole, and for our Sick. So he left us; And when we offered him some Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolets, he smiling, said: <hi>He must not be twice paid for one Labour</hi>: Meaning (as I take it) that he had Salary sufficient of the <hi>State</hi> for his Service. For (as I after learned) they call an Officer that taketh Rewards, <hi>Twice paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Morning early, there came to us the same <hi>Officer,</hi> that came to us at first with his Cane, and told us: <hi>He came to conduct us to the</hi> Strangers House: <hi>And that he had prevented the Hour, because we might have the whole day before us, for our Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For</hi> (said he) <hi>If you will follow my Advice, there shall first go with me some few of you, and see the place, and how it may be made convenient for you: And then you may send for your Sick, and the rest of your Number, which ye will bring on Land.</hi> VVe thanked him, and said: <hi>That this Care, which he took of desolate Strangers,</hi> GOD <hi>would reward.</hi> And so six of us went on Land with him: And when we were on Land, he went before us, and turned to us, and said; <hi>He was but our Servant, and our Guide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> He led us through three fair Streets; And all the VVay we went, there were gathered some People on both sides, standing in a Row: But in so civil a fashion, as if it had been, not to wonder at us, but to wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>om us; And divers of them, as we passed by them, put their Armes a little abroad, which is their Gesture, when they bid any welcom.

The Chambers were handsome and chearfull Chambers, and furnished civilly. Then he led us to a long Gallery, like a Dorture, where he shewed us all along the one side (for the other side was but wall and window) seventeen Cells, very neat ones, having partitions of Cedar wood.

And he told us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that as any of our Sick waxed well, he might be removed from his Cell, to a Chamber: For which purpose there were set forth ten spare Chambers, besides the number we spake of before.

Besides, there were brought in to us, great Store of those Scarlet Orenges, for our Sick; which (they said) were an assured Remedy for sicknesse taken at Sea. There was given us also, a Box of small gray, or whitish Pills, which they wished our Sick should take, one of the Pills

                  </gap>, and how it standeth with us. We are Men cast on Land, as</hi> Jonas <hi>was, out of the</hi> Whales Belly, <hi>when we were as buried in the Deep: And now we are on Land, we are but between Death and Life; For we are beyond, both the Old World and the New; And whether ever we shall see</hi> Europe, <hi>GOD only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. It is a kind of Miracle hath brought us hither: And it must be little lesse that shall bring us hence. Therefore in regard of our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance past, and our danger present, and to come, let us look up to GOD, and every Man reform his own waies. Besides, we are come here amongst a</hi> Christian People, <hi>full of Pietie and Humanity: Let us not bring that confusion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet there is more: For they have by Commandement, (though in form of courtesie) Cloystred us within these Walls for three daies: Who knoweth, whether it be not, to take some taste of our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions? And if they find them b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore for Gods love, and as wee love the weal of our Soules and Bodies, let us so behave our selves, as we may be at peace with</hi> GOD, <hi>and may find grace in the eyes of this People.</hi> Our Company with one voyce thanked me for my good Admonition, and promised me to live soberly and civilly, and without giving any the least occasion of Offence. So we spent our three daies joyfully, and without care, in expectation what would be done with us, when they were expired. During which time, we had every hour joy of the Amendment of our Sick; who thought themselves cast into some Divine <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Healing</hi>; They mended so kindly, and so fast.</p>
            <p>The Morrow after our three daies were past, there came to us a new Man, that we had not seen before, clothed in blew as the former was, save that his Turban was white with a small red Crosse on the Top. He had also a Tippet of fine Linnen. At his Comming in, he did bend to us a little, and put his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

some few of us; VVhereupon six of us only stayed, and the rest avoided the Room. He said; <hi>I am by Office Governour of this House of Strangers, and by Vocation I am a</hi> Christian Priest; <hi>and therefore am come to you, to offer you my service, both as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and chiefly as</hi> Christians. <hi>Some things I may tell you, which I think you will not be unwilling to hear. The State hath given you Licence to stay on Land for the space of six weeks: And let it not trouble you, if your occasions ask further time, for the Law in this point is not precise; And I do not doubt, but my self shall be able to obtain for you such further time as shall be convenient.

It seemed to us, that we had before us a Picture of our</hi> Salvation <hi>in</hi> Heaven: <hi>For we that were a while since in the Iaws of Death, were now brought into a place, where we found nothing but Consolations.

He said; <hi>He was a Priest, and looked for a Priests reward; which was our Brotherly love, and the good of our Souls and Bodies.</hi> So he went from us, not without Tears of Tendernesse in his Eyes; And left us also confused with joy and kindnesse, saying amongst our selves; <hi>That we were come into a Land of Angels<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which did appear to us daily, and prevent us with Comforts, which we thought not of, much less expected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day about ten of the Clock, the Governour came to us again, and after Salutations said familiarly; <hi>That he was come to visit us</hi>; And called for a Chair, and sate him down: And we being some ten of us (the rest were of the meaner sort, or else gone abroad,) sate down with him: And when we were set, he began thus. <hi>We of this Island of Bensalem</hi> (for so they call it in their Language) <hi>have this: That by means of our solitary Situation, and of the Laws of Secrecy, which we have for our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and our rare Admission of Strangers; we know well most part of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he that knoweth least is fittest to ask Questions, it is more reason, for the Entertainment of the time, that ye ask me Questions, than that I ask you.</hi> VVe answered, <hi>That we humbly thanked him, that he would give us leave so to do: And that we conceived by the taste we had already, that there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s no worldly thing on Earth, more worthy to be known, than the State of that happy Land. But above all</hi> (we said) <hi>since that we were met from the several Ends of the world, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped assuredly, that we should meet one day in the</hi> Kingdom <hi>of</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (<hi>for that we were both Parts</hi> Christians) <hi>we desired to know (in respect that Land was so remote, and so divided by vast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Seas from the Land where our SAVIOUR walked on Earth) who was the</hi> Apostle <hi>of that Nation, and how it was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Faith</hi>? It appeared in his face, that he took great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in this our Question: He said, <hi>Ye knit my heart to you, by asking this Question in the first place: For it sheweth, that you</hi> First seek the Kingdom of Heaven: <hi>And I shall gladly, and briefly, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your demand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>About twenty Years after the Ascension of our SAVIOUR, it came to pass, that there was seen by the People of</hi> Renfusa, <hi>(a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the Eastern Coast of our Island, (within night,) the Night was Cloudy and Calm,) as it might be some mile in the Sea, a great Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Light; Not sharp, but in form of a Column, or</hi> Cylinder, <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Sea, a great way up towards Heaven: and on the top of it was seen a large Crosse of Light, more bright and resplendent than the Body of the Pillar. Upon which so strange a Spectacle, the People of the City gathered apace together upon the Sands, to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; And so after put themselves into a number of small Boats to go nearer to this Marvellous sight. But when the Boats were come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (about) sixty yards of the Pillar, they found themselves all bound,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64462:7"/>
and could go no further, yet so as they might move to go about, but might not approach nearer: So as the Boats stood all as in a Theater, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Light, as an Heavenly Sign. It so fell out, that there was in one of the Boats, one of the Wise Men, of the Society of</hi> Salomons House: <hi>which</hi> House <hi>or</hi> College <hi>(my good Brethren) is the very Eye of this Kingdome; who having a while attentively and devoutly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contemplated this Pillar and Crosse, fell down upon his face: And then raised himself upon his knees, and lifting up his Hands to Heaven, made his Prayers in this manner.</hi>

               <hi>And for as-much, as we learn in our Books, that thou never workest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but to a Diviue and Excellent End, (for the Laws of Nature are thine own Laws, and thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedest them not but upon good cause) we most humbly beseech thee, to prosper this great Sign, And to give us the Interpretation and use of it in Mercy; VVhich thou dost in some part secretly promise, by sending it unto us.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>When he had made his Prayer, he presently found the Boat he was in, moveable and unbound; whereas all the rest remained still fast; And taking that for an assurance of Leave to approach, he caused the Boat to be softly, and with silence rowed towards the</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>But ere he came near it, the</hi> Pillar <hi>and</hi> Crosse <hi>of</hi> Light <hi>brake up; and cast it self abroad, as it were into a Firmament of many Starres; which also vanished soon after, and there was nothing left to be seen, but a small</hi> Ark, <hi>or</hi> Chest <hi>of</hi> Cedar, <hi>dry, and not wet at

all with water, though it swam. And in the Fore-end of it, which was towards him, grew a small green Branch of Palm; And when the wise man had taken it with all reverence into his Boat, it opened of it self, and there was found in it a</hi> Book, <hi>and a</hi> Letter; <hi>Both written in fine Parchment, and wrapped in Sindons of Linnen. The</hi> Book <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the</hi> Canonical Books <hi>of the</hi> Old <hi>and</hi> New Testament, <hi>according as you have them; (For we know well what the</hi> Churches <hi>with you receive;) And the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>it self; And some other</hi> Books <hi>of the</hi> New Testament, <hi>which were not at that time writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, were neverthelesse in the</hi> Book. <hi>And for the</hi> Letter, <hi>it was in these words.</hi>

Fears to come, for the time we heard him speak; And that we thought a Hour spent with him, was worth Years of our former life.</hi> He bowed himself a little to us, and after we were set again, he said; <hi>Well, the Questions are on your part.</hi> One of our Number said, after a little Pause; <hi>That there was a Matter, we were no lesse desirous to know, than fearfull to ask, lest we might presume too far.

This we found wonderfull strange; for that all Nations have Enterknowledge one of another, either by Voyage into Forein Parts, or by Strangers that come to them: And though the Traveller into a Forein Country, doth commonly know more by the Eye, than he that stayed at home can by relation of the Traveller; Yet both waies suffice to make a mutual Knowledge, in some degree, on both parts.

But then, that they should have Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Languages, Books, Affairs, of those that lye such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from them, it was a thing we could not tell what to make of; For that it seemed to us a condition and Propriety of Divine Powers and Beings, to be hidden and unseen to others, and yet to have others open, and as in a light to them.</hi> At this speech the Governour gave a gracious smile, and said; <hi>That we did well to ask pardon for this Questi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for me to tell you, how the vulgar sort of Mariners are contained from being discovered at Land; And how they that must be put on shore for any time, colour themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Names of other Nations; And to what places these Voyages have been designed; And what places of</hi> Rendezvous <hi>are appointed for the new Missions; And the like circumstances of the Practique; I may not do it; Neither is it much to your desire. But thus you see we maintain a Trade, not for Gold, Silver, or Iewels, Nor for Silks, Nor for Spices; Nor any other Commodity of Matter; But only for</hi> Gods <hi>first Creature, which was</hi> Light: <hi>To have</hi> Light <hi>(I say) of the growth of all Parts of the World.</hi> And when he had said this, he was silent; And so were we all. For indeed we were all astonished, to hear so strange things so probably told. And he perceiving that we were willing to say somewhat, but had it not ready, in great Courtesie took us off, and descended to ask us Questions of our Voyage and Fortunes, and in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that we mought do well, to think with our selves, what time of stay we would demand of the State; And bad us not to scant our selves: For he would procure such time as we desired. VVhereupon we all rose up and presented our selves to kisse the skirt of his Tippet, but he would not suffer us; and so took his leave. But when it came once amongst our People, that the State used to offer Conditions to Strangers, that would stay, we had work enough to get any of our Men to look to our Ship; And to keep them from going presently to the Governor, to crave conditions. But with much ado we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained them, till we mought agree what course to take.</p>

People thereof were of the generations of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by another Son, whom they call <hi>Nachoran</hi>; And that <hi>Moses</hi> by a secret <hi>Cabala</hi> ordained the Laws of <hi>Bensalem</hi> which they now use; And that when the <hi>Messia</hi> should come, and sit in his Throne at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> the King of <hi>Bensalem</hi> should sit at his feet, whereas other Kings should keep a great distance. But yet setting aside these <hi>Iewish</hi> Dreams, the Man was a wise Man, and learned, and of great Policy, and excellently seen in the Laws and Customes of that Nation.

And because Propagation of Families, proceedeth from the Nuptial Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I desired to know of him, what Laws and Customes they had concerning Mariage; and whether they kept Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age well; and whether they were tyed to one Wife? For that where Population is so much affected, and such as with them it seemed to be, there is commonly permission of <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Wives.</hi> To this he said; <hi>You have reason for to commend that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Institution of the</hi> Feast <hi>of the</hi> Family; <hi>And indeed we have Experience, that those Families that are Partakers of the Blessings of that Feast, do flourish and prosper ever after, in an extraordinary manner.

Nay they wonder (with detestation) at you in</hi> Europe, <hi>which permit such things. They say you have put Mariage out of Office: For Mariage is ordained a Remedy for unlawfull Concupiscence; And Natural Concupiscence seemeth as a spurre to Mariage. Eut when Men have at hand a Remedy, more agreeable to their corrupt Will, Mariage is almost expulsed. And therefore there are with you seen

Neither is it possible, that those that have cast away so basely, so much of their Strength, should greatly esteem Children (being of the same Matter) as chaste Men do. So likewise during Mariage is the Case much amended, as it ought to be if those things were tolerated only for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; No, but they remain still as a very affront to Mariage: The Haunting of those dissolute places, or resort to Courtezans, are no more punished in Maried men, than in Batchelers. And the depraved Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of Change, and the delight in Meretricious Embracements, (where sinne is turned into Art,) maketh Mariage a dull thing, and a kind of Imposition, or Tax. They hear you defend these things; as do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they say, this is a preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wisdome; and they call it</hi> Lots offer, <hi>who to save his Guests from abusing, Offered his Daughters: Nay they say further, That there is little gained in this; For that the same Vices and Appetites, do still remain and abound, Unlawfull Lust being like a Furnace, that if you stop the Flames altogether, it will quench, but if you give it any vent, it will rage; As for Masculine love, they have no touch of it; And yet there are not, so faithfull and inviolate Friendships, in the World again, as are there; And to speak generally, (as I said before,) I have not read of any such Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, in any People, as theirs.

His under Garment was of excellent whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Linnen down to the Foot, girt with a Girdle of the same; And a Sindon or Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the same about his Neck. He had Gloves, that were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and set with Stone; And Shoes of Peach-coloured Velvet. His Neck was bare to the Shoulders. His Hat was like a Helmet, or <hi>Spanish Montera</hi>; and his Locks cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led below it decently: They were of Colour brown. His Beard was cut round, and of the same colour with his Hair, somewhat ligher. He was carried in a rich Chariot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wheeles, Litter-wise, With two Horses at either end, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trapped in blew Velvet Embroydered; and two Footmen on each side in the like attire. The Chariot was all of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, gilt and adorned with Christal; save that the Fore-end had

Pannels of Sapphires, set in borders of Gold, and the Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end the like of Emarauds of the <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Next before the Chariot, went two Men, bare headed, in Linnen garments down to thefoot, girt, and Shoes of blew Velvet, who carried the one a Crosier, the other a Pastoral Staff like a Sheep-hook; Neither of them of Metal, but the Crosier of Balm-wood, the Pastoral Staff of Cedar. Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he had none, neither before nor behind his Chariot: As it seemeth, to avoid all Tumult and trouble. Behind his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, went all the Officers and Principals of the Companies of the City. He sate alone upon Cushions, of a kind of Excellent Plush, blew; And under his Foot curious Carpets of Silk of divers Colours, like the Persian, but far finer. He held up his Bare Hand as he went, as blessing the people, but in Silence. The Street was wonderfully well kept; So that there was never any Army had their Men stand in better Battel-Array, than the People stood. The VVindows likewise was not crouded, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one stood in them, as if they had been placed.

And because he meaneth to give you his Blessing, he hath appointed it in the Fore-Noon.</hi> VVe came at our Day and Hour, and I was chosen by my Fellows for the private accesse. VVe found him in a fair Chamber, richly hanged, and carpetted under Foot, without any Degrees to the State, he was set upon a Low Throne richly adorned, and a rich cloth of State over his head of blew Sattin Embroidered. He was alone, save that he had two Pages of Honor, on either Hand one, finely attired in

VVhite. His Under-Garments were the like that we saw him wear in the Chariot; But insteed of his Gown, he had on him a Mantle with a Cape, of the same fine Black, fastened about him. VVhen we came in, as we were taught, we bowed Low at our first Entrance; And when we were come near his Chair, he stood up, holding forth his Hand ungloved, and in Posture of Blessing; And we every one of us stooped down, and kissed the Hem of his Tippet. That done, the rest depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I remained. Then he warned the Pages forth of the Room, and caused me to sit down beside him, and spake to me thus in the <hi>Spanish Tongue.</hi>
