            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WHereas a Paper hath been for some time handed about in <hi>Manuscript,</hi> pretended to be the Speech of the abovesaid <hi>William Parry:</hi> This is to inform the Publick, that the said Paper is Spurious and Counterfeit; and that the True Genuine Speech is what is here presented to the World.<salute>Mr. Sheriff,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall not trouble you with an Account of the particular Crimes for which I am brought to this untimely End; but only in General deliver Five Principal Causes that have, <hi>in sooth,</hi> drawn so just a Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. First, Disobedience to my Parents. Secondly, Ill Company. Thirdly, the leaving my lawful Calling to engage in Affairs of State. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Bearing false Witness: And lastly, my Ingratitude to those that rais'd me.</p>
            <p>I shall say something upon each of these by way of Warning to all People, but especially to those who have been my Accomplices; several of whom do now hear what I say.</p>
            <p>First, Of my Disobedience to my Parents, who sent me to study the Law, <hi>albeit</hi> I prov'd a graceless Youth, given up to all manner of <hi>Naughtiness;</hi> and in one of my wild Frolicks <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>estsoons</hi> married without their Consent or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and was thereupon left by them to shift in the wide World: Where I lived many Years in the lowest Degree of Misery and Want, which when attended with Pride, Avarice and Ambition, is the Parent of all Evil.</p>
            <p>My Wants engaged me in ill Company, and taught me to associate with such who were secret Enemies to the Queen's Highness; particularly one <hi>Robin Trickster</hi> a <hi>Turn-coat Scrivener,</hi> and <hi>Maister Harry Madrigall</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Parish, afterwards Clerk of Her Grace's Guards. These Two, as it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thought, held private Intelligence with <hi>Mary</hi> late Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and were entirely devoted to Her and Her young Son <hi>Iames;</hi> who they affirmed had a better Title to the Crown than Her Highness. They perswaded me that Her Highness was an Enemy to God's Church. That <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when he had reduced his Rebellious Subjects, whom our Queen had takan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Her Protection, would lend his Troops to be employed against Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty: That <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> would by the Help of <hi>France</hi> (where She had great Power) prepare an Army to be sent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence invade <hi>England.</hi> That the Queen's Grace should be Deposed, and Her best Friends destroyed, especially the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> General for Her Highness in <hi>Holland,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham.</hi> They told me, They had both worked themselves into Her Majesty's Service, and advised me to do the same; which I accordingly did, with their Assistance, in the way of my own Profession.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10839:2"/>
But alas! I soon neglected my Calling as a Lawyer, to engage in Affairs of State, which was the Third Cause of my Misfortunes. Being employed to engross an Act of Parliament against <hi>Popery,</hi> I inserted a Clause which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the <hi>Protestants</hi> in the same Guilt and Penalty with the <hi>Papists.</hi> Then I endeavoured to set up an <hi>Inquisition</hi> against the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> has lately done in <hi>Planders,</hi> which was promoted by Direction from the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Her Abettors, in order to divide the <hi>Protestants</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>I shall not take up your Time with recounting the several Attempts I made for the Advancement of <hi>Popery,</hi> and of the Interests of <hi>Mary</hi> late Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and Her Son <hi>Iames.</hi> I therefore proceed to the Fourth Cause of my Misfortunes, I mean, the Breach of that Commandment which forbids us to <hi>bear false Witness against our Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> whom his Enemies allow to be the greatest Lawyer, ablest Statesman, and truest Lover of his Prince and Country of any in his Age; Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> that Noble Patron as well as Master of Wit and Learning; a Personage who seems born for Courts, and the Management of the greatest Affairs: My Lord Admiral <hi>Howard,</hi> who gave the Enemy that famous Defeat at Sea, which they have never since been able to recover; and another Lord of the Council, were the chief Enemies to the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and had perform'd the most eminent Services to the Kingdom. This my two Confederates <hi>wotted</hi> well enough; and thereafter perswaded me to forge an Accusation against them of High Treason. It is well known how sharp and Universal the Prosecution was, so that if their Innocence had not appeared unblemished in every Particular, they might probably have lost their Heads: And now my own Sufferings have brought me to a true Sense of my Crimes, I am heartily glad that wicked Design did not succeed.</p>
            <p>I now come to the last and greatest Cause of my present Calamity, which is, my Ingratitude to those that raised me.</p>
            <p>My two Companions and I, in order to pursue our Designs, began to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute our selves into the good liking of Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> L. <hi>Burleigh,</hi> who tho' he well enough understood our Principles, yet observing us to be Men of some Dexterity, and believing the solemn Protestations we made him, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, upon Promises of our Amendment, to pardon our past Offences, and take us into some Degree of Favour. We then professed the greatest Zeal for the Service of Her Highness; but still continued our Correspondence with the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> by the means of a <hi>Clerk</hi> to <hi>Robin</hi> the <hi>Scrivener.</hi> At home we made our Party so strong, that we attempted by the help of a certain <hi>Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,</hi> to bring the L. <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the E. of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and some others into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with Her Highness, by all the ill Offices and Representations that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny could suggest. Nay, we began to hope we had made some Impression: Which fed our Vanity to such a Degree, that I confess, I flatter'd my self with nothing less than immediately succeeding Sir <hi>Tho. Bromley; semblably</hi> the <hi>Scrivener</hi> had fixed his hopes on my L. <hi>Burleigh</hi>'s Staff; and <hi>Harry Madrigall</hi> expected to come into the Place of Sir <hi>Francis Walsington.</hi> But Her Grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately saw thro' the Design: The whole Kingdom began to resent our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices with the utmost Indignity: The Parliament publickly asserted the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of those great Men; and we were all discarded with the just Marks of Ignominy, to the Satisfaction of all good Subjects.</p>
            <p>What hath happened since, I need not repeat. I acknowledge my self just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doomed to the Execution of that Sentence pronounc'd against me. I must now leave you all, tho' notwithstanding my many Infirmities, I might by the Course of Nature have held out Three Years longer. May Her Majesty's Grace long Live and Reign. <hi>Amen.</hi> And I wish that every Body, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially my Accomplices, of whom I see several here before me, would take Warning by my Example.</p>
            <trailer>When he had thus finished his Speech, he was immediately <hi>TURNED OFF,</hi> in the Presence of above Five Hundred Spectators, both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> who <hi>for the Generality</hi> were very well pleased to see him make so good an <hi>EXIT.</hi>
