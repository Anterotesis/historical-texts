         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This we see is the resolute opinion of the most<note place="margin">The good &amp; godly resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, mesech &amp; Abednago</note> of them, that haue not the truth in their hearts. But it is a resolucion contrary to the resolucion of <hi>Sydrach, Mesech,</hi> and <hi>Abednago:</hi> for they sawe the multitude to doe that which they detested, and stoutly refused: and whereunto if they had framed their affections, and measured their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions according to the course and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the whole multitude, they had runne into wilfull rebellion againste the liuinge God, and committed horrible idolatry, in giuing worship vnto a false God, to a stocke, a block, to dirt, and drosse of the earth: they sawe the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to fall downe at the sounde of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and gaue solemne worship vnto the image, yet coulde not that president preuayle with them, they sawe it no sufficient warraunt for<note place="margin">To follovv the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is no good excuse.</note> them, no lawfull excuse before the liuing God whome they serued, and therfore absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued themselues, not to follow the multitude in an action so repugnant against the truth, and so great a derogation of the glorye of the high God. This was a good and a godly resolucion, wherein they constantlye perseuered, beeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as rebels againste the kinges decree, they were neither dismayed in respect of the multitude, nor tied vnto consent vnto the thing in respecte that the multitude helde it as a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20840:32"/>
necessary duty, and seruice done for the kinges pleasure: No although they sawe the Nobles, Princes, Dukes, Iudges, Receiuers, Counsailors, and all the officers and gouernours of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, yea all the nations vnder the kinges go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment to fall down and worship it, they were nothing mooued to commit such abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the Lord. The fierce and cruell coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of the king himselfe, the threats of his tortors, torments, and of death it selfe could not discourage them or remooue their hearts from this sounde resolucion, this godly and salutarye resolucion, seeing the kinges deuise to bee so meerely repugnant against the truth. Thus must euery good Christian, euery one that will thinke<note place="margin">Christians ought to haue this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> himselfe the true member of Christ, resolue him selfe, namely constantly and boldye to refuse to bowe their knees, or doe any outward action to <hi>Baal</hi> of Rome, to the dishonor of the true God, to fulfill and satisfie the sawcie, malapert, &amp; hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie minde of him that hath set himselfe againste God, crauing his honour to be done vnto him, and his power to be attributed vnto him: no, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we see many and mighty multitudes to<note place="margin">VVeaknes of potentates in yeelding seruitude to Antichrist.</note> bowe to him before our eyes, though we see Emperours, Kinges, and mightye potentates of the worlde to kisse his feete, and to afforde their neckes to bee his foote-stooles, and all the wise men of many nations to doe him reuerence: Let vs refuse it, for beholde it is meerely against the truth: and therfore the president of the mighty,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20840:32"/>
the president of the multitude, the president of generallities is nothing to vs that haue &amp; ought to gouerne oure affections by the worde of God.</p>
            <p>But we see a stronge resolucion in manye of<note place="margin">The resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of recusants.</note> the obstinate recusants of our time, euen of these dayes, which whether it doe agree with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that of these three men, it were not amisse to consider. But suche is the subtiltie of their shamelesse deuises, that it is almost impossible to discribe their resolucion rightly. For mark where as <hi>Sydrach, Misech,</hi> and <hi>Abednago,</hi> were willed to fall downe and worship the image, they stoode not mute, or dumbe, or with this bare desence: namely pardon vs, we are resolued not to do it, as our recusants do. But they did boldly yeelde a reason of their recusancie, sayinge that it was contrary to their duty to the liuing God, whom they ought onely to serue. But these men will maintaine their idolatry euen with this onely aunswere: Forsooth we are resolued, wherin, and how? Forsooth to perseuere in idolatrye, and to dissemble before men, and yet to carrye cleare<note place="margin">A speciall thing to bee noted in the resolution of our recusa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts.</note> consciences before God (as they say). Here is a notable thing to bee noted in their resolucion, namely that it is lawfull for them to dissemble, and to frame themselues in the outward action, like vnto the thing commaunded, and inwardly to carrye a contrary desire, and yet this is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of him (as they say) whom they pretend to serue.

For saith Christ vnto his disciples, if you were of the worlde the worlde woulde loue you, but I haue chosen you out of the world, and therfore doth the world hate you.
