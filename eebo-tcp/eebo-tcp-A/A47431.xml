         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have born so great a
Character in the World, and
have a Reputation so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal;
that I cannot but think
those People, who have Fathered
upon you <hi>the Account of</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
lately printed, have done
it only with a design to injure
you; for certainly a man of such
settled Principles as you are, of
thoughts so sedate and composed,
would never expose any thing to
the publick View, which you would
<pb facs="tcp:97119:3"/>
not set your Name to, and let the
Account of a Country, so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as <hi>Danmark,</hi> be put forth
without so much as any mention
of the <hi>Licenser</hi> or <hi>Printer,</hi> like a
common Pamphlet or Lampoon.
Monsieur <hi>Sorbiere</hi> put <hi>his
Name</hi> to a scandalous Description
of <hi>England,</hi> though he relates
several passages altogether as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
and ridiculous, as
that the Describer of <hi>Danmark</hi>
tells us, <hi>p 95. That being a
great Lover of Green Geese, he
could get none of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
People; till a superstitious
Old Woman told him, she had
four at his Service, imagining
that otherwise the Kite would
have them;</hi> or rather otherwise
being an Old Woman full of Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(as Hostesses usually are)
<pb facs="tcp:97119:3"/>
being afraid that the Gentleman
should lose his Longing.</p>
            <p>Besides, Sir, what Man of
Sense can think, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of your Parts would write so
tedious a Preface, that has so lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the World, that <hi>thinking
men</hi> may improve themselves by
Conversation and Travel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if that Author, instead of his
important Scraps of <hi>Latin,</hi> as
<hi>Divisos orbe Britannos. Res
est Ridicula &amp; nimis Jocosa,
<pb facs="tcp:97119:4"/>
Catull.</hi> had given us these two
Verses of <hi>Horace.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Dic mihi Musa virum, captae
post tempora Trojae.</l>
                  <l>Qui mores hominum multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

               </q>
We should have framed a greater
Idea of that Advantage from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s
Character of <hi>Ulysses,</hi> and
perhaps have found, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
as much by visiting the
Monster <hi>Polypheme,</hi> as any of
this Authors <hi>Disciples</hi> may do,
whom he would send for <hi>Maxims</hi>
as far as <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> and
to search <hi>for such Regulations
of Government as are fit for
Modles to the most civiliz'd</hi>
Europeans, <hi>amongst the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaters
and savage</hi> Americans;
<pb facs="tcp:97119:4"/>
who being <hi>great Philosophers,</hi> must
in pursuance of this Authors advice,
become <hi>very excellent Tutors.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sir, I am not of opinion, that you
would have our two Universities
to reform their Statutes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their Studies according to
some new Methods of Modern
Learning; for as their Habits are
the same, <hi>which they wore in</hi>
Harry <hi>the Eighth's time,</hi> and yet
are still very decent and becoming,
so their old Philosophy, has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it's peculiar uses; we see by
experience, that such as neglect and
despise the Disputations of <hi>the
Schools,</hi> who laugh at <hi>the dark
Terms and Subtilties of</hi> Aristotle,
and his Nice <hi>Commentators;</hi>
when they once come to writing,
find the Want of their Logick;
(for that and Grammar generally
revenge themselves upon their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries)
<pb facs="tcp:97119:5"/>
they trifle instead of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
their Method is confused,
and when they should urge any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
point, they run from one thing
to another; and their discourse is
as lax and undigested, as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of that Author we are treating
of.</p>
            <p>Neither, Sir, can I imagine,
that you would have the Nobility
and Gentry of any Country, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Education of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Philosophers, and not to
Priests; and by the former have
moral Virtues preached up to
them, such as Fortitude, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and Contempt of
Death: their Instructors using
pious Cheats, as</hi> Elysian <hi>Fields,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and by those Methods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
deceiving their Hearers into
Greatness; these Philosophers
thus excelling the Managers of
<pb facs="tcp:97119:5"/>
our Modern Education.</hi> For I
suppose, Sir, you are sensible of the
great Benefits that Youth receive,
by being bred up under grave and
religious Clergy-men; for though
<hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi> be a very good
Book, yet the <hi>Bible,</hi> in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is a better. Besides Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which Youth ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in, they are likewise to be
taught how to be good Christians,
and there is to my Knowledge a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
eminent School in this Nation,
where the Youth are not trained up,
<hi>not only to the understanding of
Words and Languages,</hi> (though
at the same time those are taught
there with the greatest Accuracy)
where they are kept in a sence of
Duty and Obedience to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
by a certainty of future Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
to them that transgress,
and everlasting Happiness to such
<pb facs="tcp:97119:6"/>
as do well; where they are constantly
call'd upon to give a sensible and
rational Account of their Faith, I
mean that contained in the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,
Homilies,</hi> and <hi>Thirty nine
Articles of the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;
where there is no day
passes without their Reading a
considerable portion of the Holy
Scriptures in the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages:
And a better Foundation
is laid for a Greatness of Mind,
and Contempt of Death from the
Example of our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi>
than can be framed from any pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
amongst the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Heroes. However it comes to
pass, the Author, among all the
<hi>Roman Heroes,</hi> has unfortunately
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ch'd upon <hi>Brutus, as the true
Pattern and Model of exact Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi>
And yet in relation to the
Death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> all circumstances
<pb facs="tcp:97119:6"/>
consider'd, a Youth that is bred up
to a sense of Gratitude, Honour,
or Common Justice, will look upon
him as ungrateful, and a base As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate;
and will necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
him, when he sees him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
that Virtue which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to admire; and in a sullen
despair exclaiming against it, as an
empty Name. A very fine Model
indeed for a Man of Quality, and
which must affect him much more
when he shall <hi>find the Practices
of Persons of the like stamp in
this particular founded upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Justice and Truth, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
approved of by most
of the succeeding Wise men which
the World has produced.</hi> I
should be glad to see a List of
those Wise men, who were of his
Opinion, that I may be satisfied,
whether our Author has done Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb facs="tcp:97119:7"/>
to <hi>Ravailliac,</hi> and some other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Heroes of this latter Age; and
that our Authors own Name (if his
Courage be equal to his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
may be added to it upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Sir, there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Observations and political
Maxims throughout the whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avor very much of a
Commonwealth, and would not well
become any Person that has had the
Honour to serve Their <hi>Majesties,</hi>
or that heartily consult their Real
Interest, or the Glory of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Nation. For in the first place
he says, if we look backwards, <hi>It
is a true Reflection, that our late
Kings half undid us, and bred
us up narrow-spirited so long,
till the World had almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
us, and we seldom were
permitted to cast an Eye farther
<pb facs="tcp:97119:7"/>
than</hi> France <hi>or</hi> Holland. If Peace,
Ease and Plenty could be said to
undo us, we were indeed undone;
and then as for our Ignorance of
the Affairs of other Nations, we
must necessarily be in a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
one, when we had our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
at <hi>Cologne,</hi> and afterwards
at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> when the <hi>King of
England</hi>'s Mediation was accep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
by all the Princes then in War, and
the Pretentions of the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
States in <hi>Europe</hi> left to
his Majesties Arbitration. But it
seems at present we are in a better
condition, and the Preface, to our
comfort, tells us, <hi>that we make a
greater figure in the World than
formerly, and have a right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in the Affairs of</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
And here a true <hi>Englishman</hi>
may think, that something has
been said to the Honour of his
<pb facs="tcp:97119:8"/>
Country: When alas, if he reads
but the next Page (for the Author
cannot write consistently two Pages
together) he will find, <hi>that we
do not live up to our Post, and
maintain our Character, that
we are insulted on our own
Coast, our Trade endanger'd,
and in Apprehension every Year
of an Invasion and a</hi> French <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi>
Not in such dismal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
neither, Sir! for as
our <hi>ancient Yeomantry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
could draw the Long
Bow, and handle the Brown

suffer'd under the Tyranny of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
even Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
however unintelligible to this
Author, as stated by Reverend and
Learned Divines, though it should
still be maintained by them under
their present Majesties, would be
more suitable to Soveraign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb facs="tcp:97119:9"/>
and the Welfare of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
than any Doctrins since
coined: For the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi>
established by the Laws of this
Realm, are so far from <hi>having an
Interest separate from, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Publick,</hi> as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would insinuate, that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have defended the true Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the <hi>English</hi> Government,
with greater Temper and Hazards.
Now the Constitution of <hi>England,</hi>
as set forth by them is, that the
<hi>King's</hi> Prerogative be kept sacred;
the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
have their Authority and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
supported; that the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
as well as Properties of
the <hi>Commons,</hi> be inviolably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd:
When any of these have
been encroached upon by the other,
the <hi>English</hi> Clergy have in all
Ages made a vigorous stand, and
<pb facs="tcp:97119:9"/>
the publick Liberty has been so
dear to them, that many of them
have sacrific'd their own Freedom
to it.</p>
            <p>Sir, I shall not trouble you much
longer, only tell you, that a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Reason why we should not
take this Book to be yours, is a
Remark which may be found in
Authors that treat concerning Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
<hi>(viz.)</hi> that he ought <hi>to
be no Detractor or Speaker ill
of any King or State, but more
especially of him or them with
whom he remains.</hi> The Reasons
are plain, because Detraction is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Honour of the Prince
whose Character he sustains; and
then such actions would make Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
from such a Prince, be
treated for the future, rather as
Spies and Enemies, than as men
whose Persons are to be held sacred.
<pb facs="tcp:97119:10"/>
We are of Opinion, that nothing
could make you swerve from this
Rule; and that no Provocation
could force you to it. However,
there are two things that happen'd
in <hi>Danmark,</hi> which to another
man might give some small occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and are as follow. It seems
an <hi>Envoy</hi> there, who had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three Years in the <hi>Danish
Court,</hi> where at first he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
welcome, became at last to be
very disagreeable, by boldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to some Privileges, that by
the Custom of the Country are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to every body. There is
throughout all <hi>Sealand</hi> a double
Road, one is common to all People,
the other called the <hi>King's Road,</hi>
is reserved to his Majesty of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>endants; this is shut
up with several Gates, and has
great Ditches on both sides of it:
<pb facs="tcp:97119:10"/>
The <hi>Envoy</hi> travelling one day to
<hi>Helsingor,</hi> was resolved to pass
this way in his Chariot, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did so, after he had
broke down the Gates; which
Action as it would have been a
great Misdemeanor in any <hi>Dane,</hi>
so it was resented by the Court as
a Rudeness in a <hi>Foreigner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time this same <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
went to the Isle of <hi>Amack</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
near <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> where abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Hares are kept for the
King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s Game, and
that with so much care, that any
man is severely punishable who
presumes to kill one of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in the King's Company; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this Gentleman was resolved
to have a <hi>Course;</hi> but in his
way thither was accosted by one of
the King's Huntsmen, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him to send his Dogs back,
<pb facs="tcp:97119:11"/>
otherwise he was in Duty oblige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to shoot them. Instead of any
Reply to this, one of the <hi>Envoy</hi>'s
Footmen cut the Keeper over th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Head with his Sword: The Man
all bloody as he was, went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to Count <hi>Revenklaw,</hi> great
Mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r of the Game, and made
his Complaint to him. These
Actions being represented to the
King, his Majesty was extreamly
offended at them, and showed it
by the cold Reception the <hi>Envoy</hi>
afterwards met with at Court;
who was likewise given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that he was not very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
there. Upon this pretending
business into <hi>Flanders,</hi> he retired
thither without any Audience of
Leave, and from thence went
home, where his Master would
have had him return, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that Ceremony; but he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:97119:11"/>
chose to lose the Presents given
upon those occasions, than visit a
Court again that had been so justly
offended with him: And yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be angry, because he had
not this usual Present for <hi>Envoys,</hi>
which his own Rudeness and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
deprived him of.</p>
            <p>Even these things could scarce
ever sowr a Gentlemans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
so far as to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatter
a whole Country, as the
Author of the <hi>Account of</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
has done; to conceal several
things that would have been for
the Credit of that Nation; to set
Truth in such a Light, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
quite different from it self in
the Relation, and to advance a
great many particulars in which
he may be plainly contradicted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97119:12"/>I would not, Sir, believe any
thing like this of you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall proceed with the more
freedom in examining the Book it
self.</p>

and though <hi>Portugal</hi> has a good <hi>East-India
Trade,</hi> yet the Commodities of

               </p>
               <p>Besides, the Kingdom of <hi>Danmark</hi>
with all its Provinces is very large,
insomuch that the first words of this
Authors Book are, p. 1. <hi>that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the extent of the King of</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark's
<hi>Dominions, he may with justice
be reckon'd amongst the greatest Princes
of</hi> Europe. For though <hi>Schone, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Blegind,</hi> by Treaty remain
to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> yet I cannot allow
this Author what he says <hi>pag.</hi> 3. that
they were the best Provinces belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Danmark.</hi> Nor do I really
think that he has a sufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which Provinces are the most
considerable; for he seems only to
have been in <hi>Copenhagen</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts;
the reason is, because what
he speaks as to the nature and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of <hi>Danmark,</hi> in relation to the
fertility of the Country, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
life of the People, can in no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

be applied to any other part,
but to <hi>Sealand</hi> only, where <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
stands, and is not above a fourth
part of <hi>Danmark.</hi> Now this Island
lying under the disadvantages of a
particular Law, is not in so good a
condition as the other Provinces,
though that, and a great deal of
<hi>Jutland,</hi> is still better than either
<hi>Halland</hi> or <hi>Blegind;</hi> though <hi>Schone</hi> be
a fine Province, yet does no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel

<hi>Danmark.</hi> However this Author says. <hi>p.</hi> 3.
that these three Provinces <hi>are still looked
upon by the</hi> Danes <hi>with a very envious
Eye; and for this reason 'tis reported,
that the Windows of</hi> Croneborg <hi>Castle,
whose Prospect lay towards</hi> Schone, <hi>were
walled up, that so hateful an Object
might not cause continual Heart-burnings.</hi>
Very well, Sir, <hi>Pray did your own
Knowledge, or Experience confirm this
to be a truth?</hi> (p. 2.) or did some of
your <hi>sensible grave Persons, p.</hi> 2. impose
this silly story upon you? For when
you was at <hi>Croneborg,</hi> you might have
found, that some Windows were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
walled up for the Advantage of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97119:15"/>
the Fortress, but not to hinder the
sight of <hi>Schone;</hi> the Situation of <hi>Crone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borg</hi>
being such, that now th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se
Windows are close, yet <hi>Schone</hi> must
be seen from the Apartments of both
the other sides; so that to make his
suggestion true, all the Rooms must
be quite darkned; and then, Sir, it
would be a fit place in which you
might employ your fancy and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in framing more such stories.
Nay, this Fable is so ridiculous, that
if the King of <hi>Danmark</hi> should avoid
the pretended <hi>Heart burnings, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by seeing</hi> Schone, <hi>p.</hi> 3. he must not

leave <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and that side of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
opposite to <hi>Schone,</hi> and must also
chuse his Residence in <hi>Jutland,</hi> or
some other remote place, where he
could be free from that hateful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Though indeed, were <hi>Danmark</hi> as
he represents it, <hi>p.</hi> 4. (comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all its Islands) <hi>no bigger than two
thirds of</hi> Ireland; the loss of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
or two would be of a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
concern to it. But, Sir, where
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97119:16"/>
People have any Knowledge of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
and understand how to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
a Map, they will find that <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
as it now remains, has much
more ground than there is in all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
It is indeed a needless trouble
that I have given my self to confute
this Remark in the Authors fourth
Page, because his first hath already
contradicted it <hi>to my hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Norway</hi> falls next under his
Censure, <hi>p.</hi> 4. as having a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and unhospitable Shore; we must
look for nothing there but Wrecks;
for when the Night, or a Storm, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
poor Mariners, the <hi>deep Sea</hi>
and <hi>high R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cks,</hi> never fail to accomplish
their Ruine. And this dismal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be very true, for any thing
this Author knows to the contrary.
The Coast of <hi>Norway</hi> is indeed high
and rocky, but all along the same
there are Ports very near to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so that with a very little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that Sea, you may every
where find a Harbour behind the
Rocks, and Shelter from the greatest
Storms: And any Sea-man, who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97119:16"/>
with that Voyage will tell
you, that he would ten times rather
venture amongst the Rocks of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
in a Storm, than the Sands of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
The reason is, because he may
there find shelter in every place, but
here are not so many entrances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Sands. What he says, <hi>that
there is no Anchorage for Ships,</hi> p. 4. is
another proof of his exact informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for in several places there is
Anchorage half a League and more
into the Sea: And where there is no
such before the Land, there is, (as
has been mention'd) a safe entrance
between the Rocks to anchor there.</p>
               <p>However the Author may have
streightned the King of <hi>Danmark</hi> as to
his Dominions in <hi>Europe,</hi> yet he has
given him a prodigious Fort in the
<hi>East Indies,</hi> which he calls <hi>Tranquebar;</hi>
p. 6. and this is another instance of his
extraordinary Accuracy; for if it be a
Fort, 'tis of a great many Miles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
The Coast indeed upon which
the <hi>Danes</hi> have built, is by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
called <hi>Tranquebar,</hi> but the Fort it
self has never had any other name
than <hi>Daneborg.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97119:17"/>But to come to a general character
of the King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s Dominions,

lye under this great inconveniency, that they
are mightily disjoyned from each other, and
that to this principally the Conquests which
the</hi> Swedes <hi>have gain'd upon them may be
ascribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Danish</hi> Provinces are not so
mightily separated, as this Gentleman
would persuade us; since a <hi>Sound</hi> of 4,
5, or 7 Leagues is the greatest distance
between any of them; only <hi>Norway</hi>
indeed is further off, but then it can
maintain and desend it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This pretended incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
is a real advantage, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
against the Incursions of any
foreign Enemy: And this truth was
demonstrated in the famous War with

before, nor happen'd since,
the <hi>Swedes</hi> could not have besieged
the Capital City of that Kingdom;
for the Streams which divide the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Danmark,</hi> afford them this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97119:17"/>
security, that so long as the Royal
Navy is safe, <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> which is
the main strength of that Country,
can fear nothing.</p>

               <p>BUT to what end have we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
hitherto, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Chapter? Let the Country be
never so large, if at the same time

I hitherto thought that when

being more acceptable to the <hi>Danish</hi>
Nation, and agreeing better with
their health and constitution, the
Farmer hoped to make a better Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket

than he should do of Wheat, to

               <p>And indeed, we shall find as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reason, for his being disgusted at
the air of the Country, which he
says <hi>is but indifferent,</hi> p. 8. <hi>especially in
and near</hi> Copenhagen, <hi>occasion'd by
frequent Fogs, and its low Scituation.</hi>
Any body who has been in <hi>Sealand,</hi>
must allow the air to be very good;
<hi>Copenhagen</hi> has only the inconvenience
which all populous Citi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s are subject
to, in not having it quite so clear as in
the Country; though the wholesomness
of it appears by the healthiness of the
Inhabitants: And as to <hi>Fogs</hi> (which
they are seldom troubled with) no
man ought to complain of them,
who may very probably have lived
in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is just to the Country for six
Lines, in telling us <hi>the face of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97119:18"/>
Land is pleasant,</hi> &amp;c. p. 9. and <hi>that
there is a most excellent Port belonging to</hi>
Copenhagen; but he presently comes
to himself and says, <hi>they have no other
Ports in the Kingdom; nor indeed much
occasion in</hi> Sealand, <hi>since they have no
Commodities to ship from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this Gentleman's
Intelligence, there are very good Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
throughout all <hi>Danmark,</hi> of
which I shall mention the following
only, each of them capable of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Vessels of 200 Tun or more;

from <hi>Sealand</hi> there is a considerable
quantity of Corn sent every year to

<hi>viz.</hi> 1692, abundance likewise was
carried to <hi>Holland;</hi> the reason why
there may not be so much exported at

contrary to what he affirms,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97119:19"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>That the number of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> are twice as many
as they were 20 years ago.</p>
               <p>Corn indeed would be much
scarcer, if the Kings Game were so
arbitrary as he pretends, <hi>p.</hi> 9. to make
them; and those <hi>sacred things might
range the Fields, and no man dare to
touch them.</hi> The Countrymen I'll assure
you, Sir, are not obliged to you for
the Law you have newly made them;

                  </gap> him with an ill
Dinner, which was a wonder; for
their way of Eating and Drinking is
so far above Meanness, that it rather
inclines to Luxury; three or four
Dishes of several Meats, is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Dinner for the middle People,
and generally their Supper equals it.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97119:19"/>
Nay, the very Boors throughout all
<hi>Danmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> will not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
if they have not their three
Meals a day, and those commonly of
warm Meat; so that when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
in <hi>England</hi> is contented with
his Bread and Cheese to Supper, the
<hi>Danish</hi> and <hi>Norsh</hi> Peasants must have
their Pot on the fire, or else they
will go to their <hi>Feather-beds</hi> (than
which, our Author says, no man can
have <hi>better,</hi> p. 88.) with great uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
'Tis true Meat and Fish when salted
is more acceptable to the <hi>Danes,</hi> as well
as other Northern People, and agrees
better with their constitution; and it
would be a hardship instead of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
to them, to have so much fresh
Meat as is customary in <hi>England.</hi> But
was the Diet of the Burghers even
as hard as he describes it, yet, I am
credibly informed, that the Servants
of a Publick Minister there (<hi>who shall
be nameless</hi>) would have been very
glad to partake of it, since their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
house-keeping was so far from
abounding, that they found too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
occasions to complain openly.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97119:20"/>
And whereas the Author of the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
says, p.</hi> 10, 11. that <hi>if the Inspectors
of the</hi> English <hi>Markets should come to those
of</hi> Copenhagen, <hi>they would find the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
had enough to be sent only to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>
those poor Servants would have
been infinitely obliged, should they
in pity have commanded an Officer to
stop, and set his Basket down now
and then at his Excellency's.</p>
               <p>Their Peasants live as plentifully
as in other Countries, they have
good Flesh and salt Fish, white
Meats, Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
all this (according to our Author,
<hi>p.</hi> 11.) since necessary <hi>fresh Fish is
wanting?</hi> I could heartily condole
their condition, if my Tenants in
<hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Leicestershire</hi> would
not take exception; for if they found
me once so indulgent to the Peasants
of another Nation, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
expect a double barrel of
<hi>Colchester</hi> Oysters by the next Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and without a <hi>Cods-head, Smelts</hi>
or <hi>Turbet,</hi> I might e'ne go to plow
my self for <hi>Hodge</hi> and <hi>Sawney.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97119:20"/>But what is most admirable to
me is, that there can be any thing
fit to eat throughout all <hi>Danmark,</hi> since
according to this Author's descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>p.</hi> 11. it seems to be exempted
from part of the common promise
which God made to <hi>Noah,</hi> and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<hi>that while the Earth remaineth,
Seed-time and Harvest, and Cold and
Heat, and Summer and Winter, and

<hi>and in all</hi> Denmark <hi>they never
have Spring, and seldom Autumn.</hi> This
assertion could proceed only from
such a one, as in his preface he calls
<hi>a very Traveller, or at least an ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
and unthinking Person,</hi> since so
many People are able to confute him,
as have ever lived there but a twelve-month.
Then for those three months
of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> which he
calls Summer, he has provided suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Plagues for them; first <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of thick vapours,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 11.
which upon examination, will be
found to be only Clouds in his own
understanding. Secondly, his plague
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97119:21"/>
of Flies, of which he has <hi>seen whole
Bushels swept together in one Room, p</hi> 12.
A BushelSir! (if of <hi>Winchester</hi> measure)
will hold a great many Flies: and
what makes this seem more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is, that <hi>Domitian</hi> the <hi>Imperial Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killer,</hi>
though in <hi>Italy,</hi> (a very hot
Country) when he had taken his
half peck, thought he had had very
plentiful game.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> does not
more abound in Flies, than it is on
the contrary wanting in Fish; for the
Author, p. 12. <hi>never knew a Sea Town of
that consequence worse served with it;</hi>
the <hi>Baltick</hi> indeed is not so well sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Fish, as some other Seas;
but yet in <hi>Copenhagen</hi> there is Sea Fish,
asCod, Flounders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, and sold there very cheap;
the reason why it is not still cheaper, by
being brought thither as it might be in
greater plenty, is because their fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
fish is in vast quantities, and as he
says, p. 92. <hi>makes</hi> full <hi>amends, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best Carp, Tench, Perch and Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish,</hi>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97119:21"/>He now leads us to a Description
of the City of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> p. 12. <hi>for</hi> (it

have little more to say of any other in the
King of</hi> Danmark's <hi>Dominions, there
being no other belonging to him, much
better than our Town of</hi> St. Albans. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Gentleman did not Travel
much in the Country, and so speaks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as to his own Knowledge; but other
People who have seen more, are of
Opinion, and think that <hi>Ribe, Aar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huus,
Aalborg, Odense,</hi> &amp;c. besides
several Cities in <hi>Norway,</hi> and other of
the Kings Dominions, as <hi>Bergen, Trund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiem,
Christiania, Gluckstadt, Flensborg,
Hadersleben,</hi> &amp;c. if they were allotted an
Impartial Surveyor, would appear to be
much better than our Town of <hi>St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi>
which at present stands so fair in
this Authors good graces.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Copenhagen</hi> is the best
place belonging to the King as <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
Yet it is no Antient City, nor a

<hi>and increases in buildings daily.</hi> p. 12.
<hi>Copenhagen</hi> was founded in the twelfth
Century, <hi>Anno 1168.</hi> and as to its
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97119:22"/>
largeness it may most properly be
compared with <hi>Dublin,</hi> which is the
second City in the King of <hi>England</hi>'s
Dominions. He is just to the Port of
<hi>Copenhagen,</hi> in about a Page and an
half, <hi>p.</hi> 13, 14. but it is, that he may find
the greater faults with the other things
that belong to it. The <hi>Air</hi> (he says) <hi>is
bad, by reason of the stink of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
which are cut through the City.</hi> p. 14. In
the 8th Page he attributes the badness
of the Air <hi>to the Fogs and low Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but here to the Channels, which
are indeed rather an Ornament and
Convenience to it, than otherwise:
Heretofore there might some small
offence proceed from them, when they
were in the nature of <hi>Fleet-ditch,</hi> in
<hi>London:</hi> But now, by the Order of
his present Majesty, they are cut quite
through the City, the Sea going in on
one side, and out at the other; and
are so very large, that a stout Man of
War may ride cross the City and round
the Castle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Works of the Town,</hi> he says, <hi>are
only of Earth and Sods,</hi> p. 14. So much the
better; Stone Walls, we know, are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97119:22"/>
of no great strength against Cannons:
And when he tells us, <hi>ib. These Works are
in tolerable good repair;</hi> he should in
common justice have said something of
the extraordinary good order they
are kept in. <hi>The Buildings</hi> (as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
them) ib. <hi>are generally mean, being
Cage-work;</hi> not considering, that Cage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
is more in esteem there than Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
as being more convenient and
durable, and contrived generally so
as to appear very handsome; not but
that there are abundance of very good
Brick Houses, that are built by the
Citizens, as well as others more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
belonging to the Nobility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the publick Buildings, King</hi>
Christian <hi>the 4th did more than all the
succeeding Princes,</hi> (says our Author.)
It is very strange, that King <hi>Christian</hi>
should do more <hi>than all his Successors
put together; p.</hi> 15. which <hi>all</hi> (after this
bluster)if added together, will amount
to but <hi>two only,</hi> the Father and Son;
of which the Son has augmented the
Beauty of the City very considerably.
The great Objection against them all
is, that they have <hi>forgot, or delayed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97119:23"/>
the building of a Pallace, the Kings
House of Residence being the worst in the
world,</hi> p. 15. As for new Buildings, the
present King is content with the Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
of <hi>Rosenborgh,</hi> and with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Castle of <hi>Friderickborg,</hi> till his
Affairs will permit him to finish a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
that has been long designed to
be built by the Sea side, near the Kings
New Market. In the mean time the
old Castle is acceptable enough to their
Majesties, by reason of that affection
which is naturally born to things that
have been possest, and are left by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ancestors; this Castle being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
for its Antiquity, part of it
having been the first House that was
built in <hi>Copenhagen.</hi> Certainly this Pallace
ought to be preserved, at least, to show
the Citizens how much they are at
present advanced, and to what height
his Majesty has raised them; since Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
now are not satisfied with such
Buildings and Apartments, as have
been, and are thought sufficient for the
Royal Family and their Predecessors.
This signal instance should have been
brought by our Author, to prove the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97119:23"/>
Pride of absolute Monarchs, and the
Misery of the <hi>Danish</hi> Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> in
his own words <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>That several of the
Noblemen, as his high Excellency</hi> Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlew,
<hi>the Great Admiral Juel, with
others, are infinitely better lodged than
the whole Royal Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the Author been resolved to
do <hi>Danmark</hi> the least favor or justice,
he might as well have spoken a little
of the Curiosities that were in <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen,</hi>
as without reason, have spent
his time in blaming its Air, Buildings
and Fortifications. For certainly in
<hi>Copenhagen</hi> a Traveller may find many
things worth his observation; the
<hi>Change</hi> is none of the worst; the <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
one of the best in <hi>Europe;</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>
very fine; the <hi>Round Steeple</hi> of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
Church, built according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>Christian Longomontan,</hi> the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> and Professor of
Mathematicks in <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> is without
question a most noble piece of Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the like is not to be found else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
for a Coach and Horses may
ascend to the top, and yet the height
of it comes very near that of the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97119:24"/>
of <hi>London.</hi> This Steeple consists of
Arches, and over the Church, which is all
of Brick without any Timber, is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
of the University as large as the
Church. But as for the University of <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen</hi>
he never so much as takes any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it here. Politics and Satyr took up
his time so much, that he had no leisure
for <hi>the Belles</hi> Letters, <hi>or gentiler Learning,</hi>
p. 255. so he gives us no Account of the
Kings Library, nor of several others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the University; which as they
are very considerable for other things, so
particularly for the preservation of the
Antiquities of those Northern Nations:
Nor of the admirable <hi>Musaeum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the King of <hi>Danmark,</hi>
which is in the same Pallace with the
Royal Library, full of all the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Raritics of Art and Nature;
and which, after the learned <hi>Olaus
Wormius's</hi> death, was so considerably
augmented with his famous Closet,
one of the best in the world, for the
many curious Antiquities it contained,
which he bequeathed to the King,
and of which the Learned World has
a printed account in a large Folio.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97119:24"/>He speaks nothing of the Beauty,
Largeness and Magnificence of the
Churches both within and without;
nor of the extraordinary height of
the two Steeples belonging to the
Churches of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and
<hi>St. Nicholas;</hi> nor of the fine Organs,
especially that of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Church,
lately made by a <hi>Danish</hi> Master; which
for its prodigious largeness is fearcely to
be parallell'd any where amongst the
Protestants. Neither doth this curious
Gentleman mention the Kings New Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
a very fine and large place, in
the middle of which stands the Kings
Statue on Horseback, very artificially
cast in Lead; and is surrounded with
the finest Palaces of the Town, as
Count <hi>Guldenlew</hi>'s, Admiral <hi>Juel</hi>'s,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But most of all this Authors neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
is to be admired, that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
to speak a word of the great
new work on <hi>Christians-haven;</hi> which
is a new City by it self, lying on the
Island of <hi>Amack,</hi> but joyn'd to <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen.</hi>
This new Work is a vast Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
opposite to the Cittadel of <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen,</hi>
which is situated near the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-house,
and Entrance of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97119:25"/>
so that on both sides these two
Fortresses command both the Port and
almost all the City round about, and
render the Fortifications of the City it
self so much the stronger, and in a
manner impregnable. And in this new
work of <hi>Christians-haven,</hi> two things
are very considerable. First, that all
the Ground contained in the Fort is,
by incredible labour and industry,
made out of the midst of the Water;
and then, that this Ground is of so
considerable an extent, that a Town
may be built upon it: And it is said,
that his <hi>Danish</hi> Majesty hath appointed
this to be the Dwelling-place of the
<hi>Jews of Copenhagen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these instances, (which yet are not
all that are worth a mans curiosity in
<hi>Copenhagen)</hi> the impartial Reader may
guess, how unjust the Author has been
in his description of this antient and
Royal City, and how far he may rely
upon the rest of his Relations of these
two Northern Kingdoms and annexed
Provinces: Seeing when he pretends
to describe <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> he mentions
nothing of <hi>Christians-haven;</hi> just as if
he should speak of <hi>London,</hi> and forget
<hi>Southwark.</hi>

               <p>The King of <hi>Danmark</hi> claims
a Toll of all Ships that pass through
it, except the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who are
exempted from it by Treaty; yet
this writer, according to the freedom
which Men of his principle generally
use with Crowned heads, pretends to
question the King of <hi>Danmarks</hi> title,
p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. and says it is <hi>slightly grounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall not enter upon matters of
State, nor pretend to give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
account of the Original Records
that contain the Immemorial conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
and Succession of Claims which
the Kings of <hi>Danmark</hi> have made to
this Sea, and right of Toll in it. The
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97119:26"/>
King, who pretends to, and enjoys
this Toll, is able enough to give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for it, and to maintain his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions.
However I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that there are several passages
in this Chapter, which I cannot well
Imagine to have fallen from the Pen
of an <hi>English</hi> man: As where he says,
<hi>The Title to the Toll is precarious,</hi> p. 23. <hi>as
founded upon a breach of Trust, it being
at first only, to provide Lights for Securing
the passage of Merchants through the</hi> Sound.
<hi>That it is a kind of servile acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kings Sovereignty of those
Seas:</hi> p. 22. <hi>That the Title is not so firm as
the</hi> Danes <hi>could wish for; not being masters
of the Land on both sides, they may have
the right, but not the Power to assert it.</hi>
p. 17. For an English-man knows that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur King is bound to protect
all strangers that pass through his
narrow Seas yet his Sovereignty does
not arise from thence, but because of
his Sovereignty, he is therefore bound
to protect them: so the King of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
being Lord of the passage of the
<hi>Sound,</hi> ought to provide for the safety
of such as should Sail thorough it. His
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97119:26"/>
Dominion, not being founded on that,
but that being a necessary Consequence
of his Dominion. In the second place,
acknowledgment has always been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
by English men to become due,
in Recompence of such Protection and
Conveniences afforded; and therefore,
our Kings demanded Contribution for
the Ships that defended the Fishing of
Foreigners. And where is the servility
any more in paying a Toll to the King
of <hi>Danmark,</hi> for passing his <hi>Sound,</hi> than
in that acknowledgment which all Ships,
according to the Law made by King
<hi>John</hi> to maintain it, must make to
those of the King of <hi>England</hi> by strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Flag, when they sail through his
narrow Seas, or in the paying Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
or for the Lights to the <hi>Trinity</hi>
house?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as to the Case between
<hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Danmark,</hi> (though <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
has no reason to imagine there
will be such a Pretension from thence,
or to fear it if there should,) it is the
same with <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>English.</hi> For
King <hi>Edgar</hi> and King <hi>Knute,</hi> who was as
great a defender of the sovereignty, as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97119:27"/>
any of our Princes, had their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
many Ages before any of their
Successors laid claim to <hi>France.</hi> And
the <hi>French,</hi> notwithstanding all their
Power, have not pretended to the
Soveraignty of the narrow Seas, because
they live upon one of the Coasts of
them.</p>
               <p>The Author would Insinuate further,
<hi>that the English pay this Toll, through the
Connivance of King</hi> James <hi>the</hi> Ist. <hi>in
prejudice of his own Subjects, who favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the</hi> Danes <hi>upon Account of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to a Daughter of that Crown,</hi> p. 22. If
King <hi>James</hi> favoured them upon his
alliance to that Crown, our Author
should, on the same account, if he had
any manners, have done so too; but
setting aside this Reflection on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of King <hi>James,</hi> it is certain, the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> have successively paid
this Toll in the <hi>Sound,</hi> and have been
so Wise and Just, not to encroach so
far upon a soveraign head, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
him Laws what to do in such
Seas, as are his unquestionable Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:97119:27"/>In the other particulars, of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which he gives us concerning the
<hi>Sound,</hi> he seems not to know what
kind of passage it is, He says, <hi>p.</hi> 22. It
<hi>is very well known, that the passage of the</hi>
Sound <hi>is not the only one to the</hi> Baltick
<hi>Sea, there being two others called the
greater and lesser</hi> Belts; <hi>and that of the
greater</hi> Belt <hi>so commodious and large, that
during the late Wars, the whole</hi> Dutch
<hi>Fleet chose to pass through it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in it for four or five months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi>
Whereas in truth the <hi>Sound</hi>
is the only convenient one; the lesser
<hi>Belt</hi> is unpassable for large Ships, and
the greater is so full of Rocks and Sands,
that nothing can be more dangerous.
To be sure had the <hi>Dutch</hi> found it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to use this passage, which is so
large that it cannot possibly be stopt
with a fortress, they had done it long
ago. It is very true the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet
did continue there for four or five
months together, but it was much
against their will, for coming into it
they were so endangered by Rocks,
and Storms, that they were forced to
make so very flow a motion, in order
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97119:28"/>
to their escape with greater safety;
neither does the Author tell us what
loss and damage they received, which
indeed was very considerable.</p>
               <p>In the same page we are likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<hi>that the breadth of the</hi> Sound <hi>in
the narrowest part is four</hi> English <hi>Miles
over, and every where of a sufficient depth,
so that the King of</hi> Danmark's <hi>Castles
could not command the Channel, when he
was master of both sides; much less now
he has but one.</hi> This Gentleman is resolved
never to measure right; for if he had,
he would have learnt that the <hi>Sound</hi> is
but three <hi>English</hi> Miles broad, when
it is truly measured; besides had he
asked any Skipper that usually passes
that way, he would have found, that it
is so far from being every where of a
sufficient depth, that on the side of
<hi>Sweden</hi> the water is so shallow, that it
is impossible for a Ship to pass, unless
it be within the reach of the Castle of
<hi>Croneborg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he delivers in the next place,
<hi>p.</hi> 23. that <hi>the</hi> Spaniards <hi>may with as
much right lay claim to the Streights of</hi>
Gibraltar; or, <hi>that the</hi> Swede <hi>who is now
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97119:28"/>
Masier of one of the Coasts of the</hi> Sound,
<hi>demand another Toll of Ships,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ridiculous. The solemn Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Roschild</hi> and <hi>Lund,</hi> contain
formal protestations against any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to a Double Toll; and by
them to King of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath been
obliged to demolish the Castle and
Fortifications of <hi>Helsingborg:</hi> Besides,
it would be impossible for the <hi>Swede</hi>
effectually to demand it at <hi>Helsinborg,</hi>
since that Town is so scituated that no
Ship is able to come within half a League
of it. Neither is it easie for any one to
imagin, how he will make out his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
between the <hi>Sound</hi> and the
streights of <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> since the former
being commanded by a strong Castle is
very narrow, and passable only within
the reach of Cannon-shot; whereas
the latter is so broad, that several Ships
may pass in the middle of it, without
fear of Cannon from either side, and
not commanded by any Castles belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either to the <hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He concludes in a great huff, <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>that
all other petty Princes and States pay
this Toll without murmer, whilst we and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97119:29"/>
the</hi> Hollanders <hi>do it, but the</hi> Danes
<hi>must have a care left we grow Angry.</hi> So
it seems <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> whose Ships
pass this <hi>Sound,</hi> are petty Princes and
States, and the Author may think he
has Authority enough, to make a
Crown'd Head stand in awe of him;
but to show him the contrary, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with my former freedom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
his next Chapter, <hi>though he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
should chance to grow Angry.</hi>

               <p>IT would be tedious to the Reader
to account all the contradictions that
are to be met with, in the description
of these Countries. I shall begin with
<hi>Sealand,</hi> where he says, <hi>there are few
Meadows,</hi> and yet <hi>no want of good Hay;
p.</hi> 8. that <hi>the air is but indifferent,</hi> and yet
<hi>there are no colds:</hi> p. 8, 9. That <hi>the Cattle is
lean</hi> p. 10. <hi>because their feeding, when in the

house, is partly Hay, and partly Brewers
Grains and Roots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 10. So having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
an Account of the miserable state of
<hi>Sealand,</hi> he proceeds to set forth that
of the other Islands in this manner.</p>
               <p>Funen <hi>has plenty of Corn, Hogs, Woods,
&amp;c.</hi> p. 27. and yet has nothing <hi>for the
Merchants to export but a few Horses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is certain and notorious, that
abundance of Corn, Bacon, and other
Commodities are sent from thence to
<hi>Holland, Norway,</hi> and other places, so it is
as certain like wise that these things must
go to <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Norway</hi> from this Island
by Land-carriage, unless the Author will
give them leave to be exported. What
does he think of the Apples, which year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are the sole Lading of several Ships.</p>
               <p>Their Cyder, and their Mead,
(which is the best in the World) is
likewise carry'd abroad; and more
especially a sort of Wheat, call'd in
<hi>Danish, Boghuede,</hi> in <hi>Latin, Fagopyrus,</hi>
(of which the <hi>Danes</hi> make their so
much talkt of Grout, that resembles
the <hi>English</hi> Hasty-Pudding) which is
in very great plenty throughout the

into my head, that the people who

have Corn, Bacon, Apples, Cyder, Mead,

p. 27. It is not so flourishing now as when
the <hi>King</hi> resided there, but it is in a
very good condition still. He takes no
notice of several other good Towns
that are in the Island, as <hi>Nyborg, Assens,
Middlefart, &amp;c.</hi> which are all bigger
than <hi>St. Albans;</hi> I suppose that he might
make his Reader imagine that nothing

               <p>This Island is oblig'd to him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the true name of its <hi>Stifts-Ampt,</hi>
or chief Governour, which
is Mr. <hi>Winterfelt:</hi> whereas in <hi>Laaland</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Laaland</hi> has met with better quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

for which it is famous. I hope it is

it too. So <hi>London</hi> is at present sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
from the <hi>North,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
from <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> He is
mistaken in the Governours name,
which is Mr. <hi>Gior;</hi> and this small er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
is the more to be taken notice of,
because he says he resided a long time
in <hi>England,</hi> in a publick Character,
and so probably his name might be
the better known there.</p>
               <p>Nor is he less mistaken in the name
of another person, which if he were any
ways inquisitive he might have known;
for he places Monsieur <hi>Edmund Scheel</hi>
among the <hi>Stifts Ampts</hi> of <hi>Jutland:</hi> this
I suppose he does only to let his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
men see, that they need not go so
far as <hi>Danmark</hi> to find out his errors:
For Monsieur <hi>Scheel,</hi> a Person consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for his Parts, Learning, and the
Characters he has sustain'd at home, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97119:31"/>
in Foreign Courts besides that of <hi>England,</hi>
where he lately rended at Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary;
in that very Memorial he
gave in to the King of <hi>England</hi> about
this Authors account, has wrote his
Christian name <hi>Magnus,</hi> as he doth
without any abbreviation upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.
After having named three
<hi>Stifts Ampts</hi> in <hi>Jutland,</hi> an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> comes in
for the fourth. Which the Author upon
the least inquiry, might have found to
be Mr. <hi>Mejercrone,</hi> now the King of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s
Envoy at the <hi>French</hi> Court. The
four principal Governments which he
has not mentioned, are called <hi>Ribe,
Aarhus, Wiborg,</hi> and <hi>Aalborg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It contradicts it felt that <hi>Jutland
wants good Sea-ports towards the Ocean,</hi>
p. 30. <hi>and yet the</hi> Hollanders <hi>transport a
great quantity of Cows and Oxen from
thence;</hi> which makes it unnecessary to
repeat the Sea-towns mentioned else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
besides which there are several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

<hi>Tonder,</hi> where the <hi>Hollander</hi>'s Smacks and
Oxen-Ships (as they call them) enter
without difficulty, and so export those
Commodities; which though the writer
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97119:31"/>
calls <hi>Lean Cow's and Oxen,</hi> p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. yet they
are not so in themselves, but only in
regard of that extraordinary bigness
they grow to, when they come into
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soil. Otherwise the Cattle of
<hi>Jutland,</hi> as of most part of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
is not of the smallest, though it be left
in its own Country, Nor need the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this plentiful Province
desire any fatter Beef, than what they
can have when they please at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jutland</hi> also <hi>affords Corn, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
quantity for the use of its own
people,</hi> p. 30. but in such a superabundance
that all the want of <hi>Norway</hi> in this case
is yearly supply'd, in the greatest
measure from this Province; neither
can this chuse but be a vast quantity,
considering the many Populous Sea.
Towns lying all along upon the shores
of that Country, Nay, in the very Year
1692. in which this Author pretends to
describe this Country, there was such a
crop reaped there, that it was upon fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
desires allowed to the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
by the King of <hi>Danmark,</hi> to export no
less then 30 thousand barrels of Corn,
(each <hi>Danish</hi> barrel containing four
Bushels) besides what privately under
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97119:32"/>
this permission was stolen out, and all
besides the necessary provisions for
<hi>Norway.</hi> Let now the Reader judge,
if no more can be said of <hi>Jutland</hi>'s
fertility, than that it affords <hi>Corn in suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quantity for the use of its own People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what's the reason of this plenty,
and fertility? does it proceed from the
goodness of the Soil, and the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the Inhabitants? or from any
Natural, Moral, or else some Political
Account? why indeed the Reason that
they have so many Oxen to sell, <hi>is
because the King keeps his Court far from
thence: Procul a Jove Procul a Fulmine,</hi> p.
30. says our Author. Corn, grows in any
Country, where the Farmer is careful,
and the Soil agreeable: and where
the meadows produce good grass,
there will be good cattle, and this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will do whither it be in <hi>Monarchys</hi>
or <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have reserved the Island of <hi>Amack,</hi> or
<hi>Amager</hi> in <hi>Danish</hi> to conclude with,
because it is the Authors darling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Island,</hi> as he says, p. 28, 29. <hi>is very
plentiful, and therefore commonly called
the Kitchen Garden of</hi> Copenhagen, <hi>but

so that <hi>their not mixing with that

arises a great consternation in our

bleeds, upon the contemplation of
these poor <hi>North-Hollanders,</hi> for they
seem perfectly to have been trapan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d,
or as one may say, kidnapt into <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi>
I warrant they had Letter upon
Letter, Invitation upon Invitation,
before they could leave their own
Country, and especially considering
what they were, persons of fashion
and credit; Gardners and Dairy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maids.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis very hard, that a free
people bred in a Commonwealth, as
<hi>North Holland</hi> is, where they lye under
no Impositions, have no Excises,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97119:33"/>
should be betrayed into a Country,

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the rest of the King of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s
Countries.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Author, to keep up an old
custom, begins this Chapter
with a contradiction; for in <hi>Sleswick</hi>
the <hi>Commodities for exportation are in
no great quantity, and yet it affords Corn,
Cattle, Horses, and Wood, to its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
over and above a sufficient store of
each for its own Inhabitants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When it is his business to describe
<hi>Danmark,</hi> he runs out into an Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97119:33"/>
description of the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein's</hi>
Residence, and sets forth <hi>the
Romantick situation of his Castle,</hi> p. 32.</p>
               <p>It is easie to guess at the Authors
Reasons for this digression. <hi>Gottorp</hi> is a
very pleasant and magnificent seat, yet
in most things it is not to be compared
with the King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s Pallace, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericksborg.</hi>
The Pallace may have run
to some decay, by the late troubles in
<hi>Holstein; but those who told the Author
that the Improvements were pull'd down
and destroyed, by order,</hi> p. 33. <hi>were so far
from being sensible Informers,</hi> that they
were false and malicious. Neither does it
stand with common sense, that so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
a Prince as the King of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
would give so ungenteel an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or revenge himself upon the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
and Gardens, for any injury which
the Master of them might have done
him. And after all, the Author <hi>found a
Library,</hi> p. 33. at <hi>Gottorp,</hi> which was more
than he was pleased to do at <hi>Copenhagen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Holsteiners</hi> are so much this
Gentlemans Friends, that he strains a
point in their favour, <hi>p.</hi> 36. viz. <hi>The</hi>
Danes <hi>when they Travel abroad, chuse
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97119:34"/>
to call themselves</hi> Holsteiners, <hi>thinking
it more honourable to be born in the
consines of the Empire than otherwise.</hi> Which
in a rational mans opinion, is more
honorable? to be born in a little Dutchy;
(as <hi>Holstein</hi> is) and a Feif holden of the
Empire or to be a native of one of
the most Antient Kingdoms in <hi>Europe?</hi>
I cannot tell what they may do in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries, but when they travel
in <hi>England</hi> and converse among us,
they never dissemble their Country,
nor desire to be called any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than <hi>Danes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be noted, (according to this
Account, p. 37.) <hi>as a great natural defect,
that the King of</hi> Danmark <hi>has not in all
his Dominions one Navigable River, for
Vessels of considerable Burden.</hi> This can
be no great defect in such Islands as
<hi>Danmark</hi> consists of, where there is
no need of great Rivers, (as the
<hi>Thames, Humber,</hi> &amp;c.) the Sea being
on all sides so near at hand. Yet these
Islands have some Rivers proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough to their bigness, as that
in <hi>Sealand,</hi> which goes up to a Town
called <hi>Nested,</hi> and has formerly been
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97119:34"/>
capable of carrying brave Ships. As
for the Continent, <hi>Jutland</hi> has some
pretty good Rivers, but the defect
which it may have in them, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
recompenced by nature, with
many <hi>Friths</hi> which the Sea forms, and
run far into the Country, as that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Limesiord</hi> by <hi>Aalborg;</hi> which passes
almost into the middle of <hi>Jutland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he says, <hi>p.</hi> 37. concerning the
design of the <hi>Danes</hi> during this war,
to establish the Toll at <hi>Gluckstadt,</hi> is
rather one of his own suppositions,
than any of their real Intentions,</p>
               <p>He complains, <hi>p.</hi> 38. of the <hi>Horses of
Oldenburg,</hi> as not <hi>able to last long or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
hard labour,</hi> whereas those that
have skill in Horses, account them the
strongest of any, and they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
generally sought after, to recuit
the Cavalry in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the Kingdom of
<hi>Norway, of which</hi> (if we may believe
this Author, <hi>p.</hi> 38.) <hi>little can be said:</hi> Or
rather in truth he should have turn'd
it thus. <hi>of Norway I can say but little.</hi>
For certainly it is more his Ignorance
of the Country, than any want of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97119:35"/>
curiosities in it: Else those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who have written whole Volumes
concerning the description of it, have
made a great bustle about nothing.</p>
               <p>The History of it has been set forth
by several eminent Authors, as <hi>Albertus
Crantzius,</hi> and <hi>Snorre Sturleson;</hi> [whose
great History of the succession and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Norway</hi> Kings written first in
<hi>Islandish,</hi> and then Translated into <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
and <hi>Swedish,</hi> in a large Quarto or
Folio, is as valuable a piece of History
as any where is to be found.] <hi>Saxo
Grammaticus,</hi> in his <hi>Danish Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle</hi>
has a great deal about <hi>Norway,</hi>
as likewise <hi>Jonas Arngrim,</hi> in his
<hi>Crymogaea Islandica,</hi> and lately one
<hi>Jonas Ramus</hi> a Clergyman in <hi>Norway,</hi> has
put forth an Ingenious Tract called <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wega
Antiqua, &amp; Ethnica: Peter Clauston</hi>
(another of the same Nation and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has writ a great Book of their Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of that Country in the <hi>Danish</hi>
Tongue, who is followed by several
others, that have discours'd of that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in general, or some of its Provinces
in particular; and most of the <hi>Danish</hi>
and <hi>Suedish</hi> Historians fill up half their
Books with the Transactions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97119:35"/>
of <hi>Norway. Olaus Wormius</hi> in his
<hi>Fasti Danici, Literatura Runica &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numenta
Danica,</hi> has given us as many
Rarities and Antiquities of <hi>Norway,</hi> as
he has done of <hi>Danmark.</hi> This may
show the Reader, that contrary to
what this Author affirms, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be said of this vast Kingdom.
Now to show you in that <hi>little he has
said of</hi> Norway, how much a man may
be mistaken: this Author has an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
faculty at crowding a great
many errors in a little room; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>It is subdivided into four</hi> Stifts
Ampts, <hi>p.</hi> 38, 39. <hi>or principal Governments,</hi>
viz. Dronthem, Bergen, Christiania <hi>and</hi>
Larwick. <hi>The Governors are young</hi> Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlew,
<hi>Mr.</hi> Stockfleet, &amp;c. So it seems,
that <hi>Norway</hi> has of late lost a <hi>Stifts
Ampt,</hi> or chief Government; for the
<hi>North</hi> themselves hitherto reckon'd
that they had five. The names of
them are <hi>Christiania</hi> or <hi>Aggershus, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiansand,
Bergen, Trundhiem</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohus.</hi>
As for <hi>Larwick,</hi> which this
Author would advance to be a <hi>Stifts
Ampt,</hi> it is but a County, belonging
separately to his high Excellency Count
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97119:36"/>
                  <hi>Guldenlew,</hi> as <hi>Tousborg</hi> is another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Count <hi>Wedel.</hi> Truly, Sir,
had we taken your Account, <hi>Zarwick</hi>
had been but a small equivalent, for
<hi>Wardohus;</hi> and <hi>Christiansand,</hi> though a
principal Government, had been quite
embezel'd. <hi>Little</hi> indeed may come <hi>to
be said</hi> of a Country, when a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
will omit such principal parts of it.
When he comes to tell us who are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
he names <hi>Guldenlew</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Stockfleet,</hi> and passes the rest over
with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir, I should be glad to
know from you a little more of this
matter, and whether this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be put
here for brevity sake, and to spare your
Readers trouble, or else to palliate
your own ignorance? Had you nam'd
us four Governours we should have been
content, and not have been so hard as
to put you upon assigning a <hi>Stifts Ampt</hi>
to the fifth Province of <hi>Norway,</hi> which
never came to your knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a very barren Country,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 36.
<hi>Norway</hi> hath never pretended to be so
fertile in Corn as <hi>Danmark.</hi> However
it is observable, that where the Ground
is fit to be till'd, it yields a greater
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97119:36"/>
Crop than the Soil of the richest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
If <hi>Norway</hi> had not so many Sea
Towns very populous, and full of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
the Corn growing there would be
sufficient, without any Importation, to
feed its own Inhabitants. There are
some districts up in <hi>Norway,</hi> as <hi>Hede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en,
Todten, Gulbrandsdalen,</hi> &amp;c.
which in Fertility and good Corn, do
not yield to any part of <hi>Danmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not be improper here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
two things, which the Author
formerly advanced, in which <hi>Norway</hi>
clearly convinces him to the contrary.</p>
               <p>First, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. <hi>There is no other Town or
City belonging to the King of</hi> Danmark
<hi>much better than</hi> St. Albans; whereas
<hi>Norway</hi> is full of large Sea Towns, such
as <hi>Bergen, Christiania, Christiansand,
Trundhiem, Frideriksstadt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he says, <hi>p. 34. That the
King of</hi> Danmark <hi>has not in all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
one Navigable River for Vessels:</hi>
But in <hi>Norway</hi> are abundance of great
Rivers and Friths, running far into the
Country, as <hi>Sarp</hi> near <hi>Frederickstadt,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ramen, Lomen, Aggers-Elf</hi> near <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiania,
Nideren</hi> near <hi>Trundhiem,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97119:37"/>
One might have expected likewise, that
one who treated of <hi>Norway</hi> should have
spoken something of the great fresh
Lakes, which are every where in that
Country: One of which call'd <hi>Mios</hi> is
a league broad, and near twenty
leagues long. And I should the rather
have suppos'd, that he would have
mentioned these Lakes, because he
seems so mightily taken with the places
<hi>where</hi> the <hi>Countrymen</hi> have good store
of <hi>fresh Fish;</hi> for in these Lakes there
is such abundance and variety of Fish,
that the Peasants thereabouts have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
not only to salt, dry, and carry
down to the Seaside, but likewise to eat
fresh as often as they have a mind to
it.</p>
               <p>He acknowledges there are Silver
Mines in <hi>Norway,</hi> but <hi>he questions whether
they turn to account,</hi> p. 39. He needed not
to have questioned it, for he might have
been informed, that they have of late
years yielded more than they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
or could reasonably be expected
from them. There is indeed, (<hi>p. 36.</hi>)
an Account of the Commodities from
thence exported, but he forgets the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97119:37"/>
many Furs and Skins of <hi>Mart, Zabel,</hi>
Beavers, &amp;c. which are sent from thence
yearly: As also Copper, and small Nuts,
of which quantities are shipt out, and
come towards the end of Winter to
<hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The beginning of the Character he
gives the <hi>Norsh</hi> is very well, <hi>viz. p. 39.)
that they are a hardy, laborious and honest
sort of People, and that they are esteem'd
by others;</hi> yet for all this, alas! they
must have their share of Scandal too,
and the vice of self conceitedness is
laid to their Charge. <hi>Vincit Amor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi>
it seems, may be their Motto,
as well as our Authors; for he says, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
they esteem themselves much superior to
the</hi> Danes; <hi>whom they call upbraidingly</hi>
Jutes. Were such a thing true, as that
the <hi>Norsh</hi> thought themselves superior
to the <hi>Danes,</hi> it might be apt to breed
some discord between them. On the
contrary, no two Sister Nations can
love one another better. Any one who

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97119:38"/>
to see two Nations not conquer'd
one by the other, but joyn'd by the
Marriage of Princes, agree so very
well together. As for the name of
<hi>Jutes,</hi> it was given the <hi>Danes,</hi> as
a spightful nick-name by the <hi>Swedes</hi>
in the late Wars, but the <hi>Norsh,</hi> no

the <hi>Danes</hi> when they Travel call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

Misery consists not always in want of
Corn; since they may have that from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, Fish and Cattle they enjoy
in great abundance. We see <hi>Holland,</hi>
which is a most happy place in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
opinion, fetches all three of them
from <hi>Danmark</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi> The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of these <hi>Islands,</hi> are great player
at Chess, and our Author says, p. 40.
<hi>would be worth some curious mans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
how such a Studious and Difficult
game should get thus far</hi> Northward, <hi>and
become so generally used.</hi> So we see
that notwithstanding their misery, they
have leisure for their Sports, and have
Parts able to surmount that game, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97119:38"/>
being difficult must require Study.
This curious man need not make very
far inquiry about their playing at
Chess, it is easily known from reading
any of the <hi>Northern</hi> Antiquities (which
the <hi>Islandish</hi> writers abound with, and
have the most plain, simple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted)
that <hi>Chess</hi> has been the
proper game of the three <hi>Northern</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Now the <hi>Islanders</hi> having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the old Tongue and Manners
of the <hi>Goths,</hi> old <hi>Danes, Norsh</hi> and
<hi>Swedes,</hi> it is no wonder they have
also kept this <hi>Gothick</hi> game, and their
Ease and Plenty, together with the
great Colds in the Winter, inclining
them to sedentary lives, make them
follow it, and from thence arrive to
its Perfection.</p>

                  <hi>As to the Kings Factories in both</hi>
Guinea <hi>and the</hi> Indies, <hi>they are esteem'd
of little consideration,</hi> p. 40. <hi>yet he has seen
several</hi> East India <hi>Ships return home well
laden, but whether the lading were
the lawful product of Trade, or acquired
by other means, will in time be worth
the enquiry of those Kingdoms and States,
whose Interest it is to preserve in the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97119:39"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> Persians, <hi>a good opinion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
and fair dealing of the</hi> Europeans. I
shall always think that such Factories
as send home ships well laden, are
both of good worth and consideration,
and I am the more confirm'd in these
thoughts, <hi>because,</hi> p. 40. <hi>most of the men
of Quality are the Adventurers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The looking into the fairness of their
Traffick and Merchandise may be let
alone at present; for I suppose no <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Prince, will concern himself with the
affairs of <hi>Asia,</hi> so far as to engage in a War
with the King of <hi>Danmark</hi> for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
At least, <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> will
very probably remain quiet, till the
world has in some measure, forgot the
proceedings with the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and
the King of <hi>Bantam.</hi>

               <p>At last, the Author comes to sum
up what he has been saying, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s Dominions,
and from what he himself has deliver'd,

                  <p>Of their Form of Government.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE come now to his darling
Topick, which is that about
Government: In the very beginning
of which Chapter, he shows himself
very ungrateful, in Reflecting upon
the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, <hi>to whose Antient
Inhabitants</hi> (he says, <hi>p.</hi> 42.) <hi>we are
so much indebted, as to owe the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Parliaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The constitution of a Government
by a Parliament is a signal Blessing,
but for the most part, those who make
the greatest bluster with it, are Men
who would leave out the Principal
part of it, and commit the greatest
errors about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97119:41"/>The word Parliament is very
equivocal, and consequently there
must be several differences as to the
original of it, in diverse Countries. It
is very probable, that the original of
Parliaments in general, is not so much
owing to any particular Nation, as
to Nature it self. And for the due
and firm constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I take that to be by King,
Lords, and Commons; I look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Body natural, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
that of man, the most Divine part
of the Creation; and there I find
the head dignified with exceeding
Power, Command, and Honour; there
are other members, which being most
useful to the principal part, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to a particular preferency, and
a third sort, inferior and less useful,
which through their weakness <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
seem liable to contempt and neglect,
and consequently to grievances; so it
is but meet for them to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to their Superiors, to set
forth their wants, and likewise to
declare their willingness, so far as in
them lies, to contribute towards
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97119:42"/>
the Support of the whole; and it
seems not unreasonable that it should
be thus in the State, since we find St.
<hi>Paul to the Corinthians,</hi> most admirably
describing it to be so in the Church;
where having first made Christ the
Head, and secondly constituted Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Prophets, and Teachers, he yet
further in the third place, makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Christian come in for a
share as a member, <hi>That there should be
no Schism in the body, but the members
should have the same care one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and whether one member suffer, all
the members suffer with it, or one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
be honoured, all the members rejoyce
with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To take the word Parliament in
this sense, it may agree to several
Nations, but else (as was before said)
it is very equivocal, and differs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several Countries it is
found in; so that when the Author
joyns the Parliaments of <hi>Poland</hi> and
<hi>Great Britain</hi> together, the Reader
must not imagin, that there is any
likeness or resemblance between them;
for there the King has so little Power,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97119:42"/>
the Cities scarce any, and that of the
Nobility is so exorbitant, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Councils upon the most pressing
necessities for their safety against the
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> end in nothing, if
one Deputy shall think fit to make
his Protestation against it: This

than the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate. And yet
he tells us with great pomp, p. 43. <hi>that
Poland alone has preserved its Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
whereas every one must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege,
it would be a happy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
if it had the oppertunity to lose it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for all other Countries whatsoever,

they have lost their Parliaments within
this last age;</hi> This cannot be true, for
though <hi>Danmark</hi> has lost its Diet,
yet <hi>Sweden</hi> retains it still, and such
a one was summoned but the last
year. <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> have the
same sort of Government, they have
had this several hundred years; how
can he then say, <hi>that all Kingdoms,
in this last age have lost their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
Besides, as for <hi>Bohemia, Hungary,</hi>

he thinks the <hi>Germans</hi> send their

his thoughts may be, our Parliament
was properly lost for several years
together; from before the Death of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, till the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Son; for 'tis impossible in
nature to have that assembly in its
true perfection, without a King in his
full Prerogative and Splendor</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Danmark</hi> has some years since, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
very important considerations,
laid aside the Assembly of the <hi>States,</hi>
and given their King a greater extent
of Power in that particular, than
his Predecessors formerly enjoyed:
Not but that the King did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97119:43"/>
enjoy very signal prerogatives;
and throughout all the Northern Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
it is easy to show, that strict
Obedience, and an entire Submission
to their Prince, hath been reigning
there from immemorial times; nor
hath it ever so much as been known
what a Republick was: There has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a controversy been started by
Historians, whether in remote ages the
Kingdom of <hi>Danmark</hi> has been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
or elective; there are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Reasons for the Inheritance, at
least if custom and prescription be such,
seeing Successors of the Royal Family,
have come always to the Crown: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that if we look back as far as
<hi>Saxo</hi>'s fabulous times, we shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
find the Son succeeding his Father,
or if the Son has been wanting, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the same race has been made
King. Upon the Death of a Prince,
the Estates constantly met together,
but it was with their Voices to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the next Heir, and not to elect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of any other Family whatsoever;
for there cannot be one Instance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
through all the <hi>Danish</hi> History,
where the Royal Family was excluded,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97119:44"/>
and a private man, though endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with never so many excellent
qualities, exalted to the Throne; the
example of <hi>Hiarne,</hi> recorded by <hi>Saxo,</hi>
does not argue, for those times being
fabulous, the story cannot be much
relyed on; and it is likewise to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that it was even then sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that the Prince and Heir was
killed in <hi>Russia.</hi> Besides it is more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
because they say he was made King
for his Poetry; Poets being persons that
seldom arrive at such Riches and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
It is not to be denied, but that the
<hi>Danes</hi> sometimes may have renounced
their Allegiance to their King, or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against him, but those instances are
extreamly few, in comparison of such
as may be found in the <hi>English</hi> or other
Histories. When these Facts have been
committed, they have been so far from
being justified afterwards, that the
<hi>Danes</hi> have ever looked upon them
as their greatest misfortunes. And
nothing can more evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to an <hi>English-man,</hi> that Faith
which the <hi>Danes</hi> naturally bear to
their Prince, than the Hatred they
have expressed against the villanous Act
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97119:44"/>
of the Regicides, who commited the
horrid Murther of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
first. The book called <hi>Englands Black
Tribunal,</hi> being translated into their
Tongue, has by several editions, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them such a sufficient account of
it, as makes them universally detest
it. In the alliance between the two
Crowns, <hi>February</hi> 13, 1660. It was
agreed in the 5th Article, that if any
of those Regicides, were found either
in <hi>Danmark</hi> or <hi>Norway,</hi> they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
be delivered up to the King of

               </p>
               <p>But to come yet nigher to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thot,
let us consider what rebellious
sort of People he would make the
<hi>Danes;</hi> and in order to this, let us
wait upon one of our <hi>Danish</hi> Kings,
from his Election to the Scaffold. It
seems when a former Prince was
murthered, <hi>a King was presently cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97119:45"/>
by the People of all sorts, even the
Boors had their voices, p.</hi> 43. <hi>They were
to elect such a Person, as to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
personable, valiant, affable,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>and adorn'd with all other virtues.</hi> A
very peculiar method! The <hi>Boors</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
were made Judges of his
Civility and Breeding, and the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
Wives were brought in to consider
his Person: as to his inward qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it was impossible for the Mob to
look into them on the sudden, and
if the former were admitted, these
were thrown into the bargain: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
was generally had to the family of
the preceeding Kings, and sometimes
they pleased to choose the Eldest Son,
because the greatness of his Paternal Estate
might enable him, in some degree to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his Office.</hi> So that if the Father
dyed in debt, the Son was sure to be
disinherited, but if we had kept his
Estate together, then the young man
might possibly get into the Throne,
and having a tolerable fortune of his
own, with that, together with some
few perquisites of the Crown, he
might pay his Tradesmen, and as this

A very moderate computation!
And here how few Kings are left to
end their days in Peace? One would
think a succession would not be much

of Kin, sometimes the Valiant man that
had exposed himself so far, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Expulsion, or the Killing of the
Tyrant; at other times a private Person
of good Reputation, who possibly least
dream't of such an advancement.</hi> I
suppose the next of Kin were seldom
so desperate as to venture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97119:46"/>
they oftener threw their voices
away upon some private Person, who
according to this Authors description,
might possibly be some honest drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
sleepy fellow, that had a Crown
dropt into his mouth as he lay yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But generally the Murtherer
was likewise the Thief, and the
Villain, who had dispatched his Prince
succeeded him; hence there arose a
well ordered Government, and all
men became ambitious of Imitating
their new King; the meanest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
duly weighing the faults of their
Superiors in their own breasts (the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

his <hi>cruel</hi> Master; the Tenant shoots

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97119:47"/>
years ago, at one Instant the face of
affairs was changed, so that the Kings
have ever since been absolute and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
not the least Remnant of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
remaining to the Subject; the first
and principal Article in the <hi>Danish</hi> law
being, that the King has the Priviledge
reserved to himself to explain the Law,
nay to alter and change it as he shall
find good. The consequences of this are,
excessive Taxes in times of peace, little
regard being had to the occasion of
them; Poverty in the Gentry, Misery

                  </gap>livers, it is declaratory of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97119:47"/>
Kings Authority; and since it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that a legislative Power should
be lodged somewhere, shows that it is
placed in him. Pursuant to this, the
present King has compiled a Book of
Laws, the Character of which is given
by our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 232, 233. <hi>That for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Brevity, and Perspicuity, they exceed
all in the world. That they are grounded
upon Equity, and are all contain'd in one</hi>
Quarto <hi>Volume, written in the Language
of the Country with so much plainness,
that no man who can write and read, is so
ignorant, but he may presently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his own Case, and plead it too if he
pleases without the assistance of Councilor
Attorney.</hi> Being thus constituted, they
are so agreeable and adapted to the
<hi>Danish</hi> Nation, that they continue
still the same, the King having never yet
changed nor altered, much less explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any part to the Prejudice of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Person whatsoever; the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is with great equality and more
eminently in the High Court of Justice
in <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> where the King himself
is President, and sits frequently; where,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97119:48"/>
Causes are often decided in favour of
the meanest Peasant, against the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Favorites, who for wrongs done,
have been condemned to vast Mulcts
and Penalties, as might be shown by
several instances, if it were needful, or
proper to insert them.</p>
               <p>By this Law, every man possesses
his own Real, or Personal Estate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>croachment from the
King; 'tis true that the Subject pays
Taxes, but they are such only as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
requires; for <hi>Danmark</hi> being
surrounded with many potent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who are all in Arms, it must, for
its own preservation, support a Fleet
and Army, unless it could perswade
them to disband their Forces.</p>
               <p>The Taxes being for the common
good, are laid equally upon all: and the
Kings Moderation in his Expences, both
as to himself and the Royal Family, being
so conspicuous, the Subject has the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
satisfaction to see what he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
laid out only for his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
Notwithstanding these
Taxes the People live in Plenty,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97119:48"/>
wanting nothing either for Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
or Pleasure.</p>
               <p>All this they enjoy, although the
Government is indeed absolute; and
they with all willingness and due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
submit themselves to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
because they are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied, that this absolute Power
was not given to his Majesty of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
till the necessity for it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable.
The Nobility was that
part of the <hi>Danish</hi> Constitution, which
first broke in upon the Symmetry of
the whole; in several Ages, and by
insensible degrees, they encroached
upon the Kings Prerogative, but all
along made larger progresses towards
the enslaving of the Commonalty;
insomuch that all burthens and
publick Taxes, were imposed upon
them alone. After the War with <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
the Commons found themselves
unable longer to live under such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
they had bravely defended
their Country, with the hazard of
their Lives, and would have done so
with their Fortunes, if they had had
any remaining; but these were wholly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97119:49"/>
swallowed up by the Nobility, who
yet would contribute nothing toward
the maintaining of a just War against
foreign Enemy and Invader. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
being upon the brink of Ruine,
the Commons in these circumstances,
as the weaker and more oppres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
part, fly to their Head for succour.
Neither the King alone, nor the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
alone, nor both King and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
joyntly, could controul the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
so far, as to make them pay
Taxes; therefore it was necessary that
all three should consent to a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
so the Commons proposed
it to the Lords, and both Lords and
Commons offer the King to make him
absolute; which offer, if he had not
accepted of, neither himself nor the
Commons could have supported the
State: Supplies were of necessity to
be raised, the Commonalty could not
raise them without assistance, and
there was no other way but this, to
make the Nobility in some equal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
bear their proportion.</p>
               <p>After this alteration in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the present Author would make
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97119:49"/>
us believe that strange Miseries hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and as a very astonishing one,
says, p. 47. <hi>That the value of Estates, in most
parts of the Kingdom is fallen three fourths</hi>
'Tis true, the value of Estates did fall,
but nothing near the proportion he
speaks of, the true reason was the
want of Money in the Commonalty,
which had been exhausted by the
War; for the Commons if they had
had wherewithal, would have been
glad to buy Estates, which they were
not permitted to do before this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Then it must be considered, that
before this the price of Estates was
extravagant, and far beyond the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
value; for then none but
a Nobleman could purchase Lands,
and if by a Mortgage, or any other
occasion, Lands happened to fall into
the hands of other People, they were
obliged to proffer them to sale to the
Nobility, who still purchased in Envy
and Emulation of one another. Trade
and Commerce being little at that
time, the Money was chiefly laid out
in buying of Estates; but since the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97119:50"/>
Nobles have not the former eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for buying up the Land as
before; and Shipping is so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
of late, every one rather
chuses to employ his Money that way,
than to purchase Lands at such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
rate as formerly. And yet
it is to be observed, according to the
Relation of a Gentleman, lately arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of <hi>Danmark,</hi> the value of
Land is now raised considerably; so
that in a little time, it will come to be
very near equal to what it has been
heretofore. For it is to be considered,
that <hi>Danmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> being since
the alteration, become Masters of a
very great Trade, their Money must
encrease likewise. In other Reigns it
was a rarity to see some few Ships from
<hi>Copenhagen.</hi> and the most considerable
Cities, go to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Now
<hi>Copenhagen</hi> alone has above 50 large
Ships that trade to <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> and
other parts have 'em proportionably,
besides those bound for <hi>Spain,</hi> the
<hi>Streights, Guinea,</hi> and the <hi>East</hi> and
<hi>West-Indies,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>Norway</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Sea Towns that formerly had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97119:50"/>
one, or two, or no Ships at all,
but sold their Timber to the <hi>English</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> that came thither (the <hi>Dutch</hi>
especially, being as it were their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
carrying out their Goods, and
supplying them with all sorts of <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Spanish</hi> Wares, which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
never fetched themselves.) These
very Towns, which are not one, or two,
but most Sea-towns in <hi>Norway,</hi> being
in abundance all along the Sea-coasts,
now send yearly to <hi>England, France</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> 10, 20, 30, or 40 large
Fly-boats, and Ships of other Building,
as can be testified by the Merchants
who trade to those parts. With this
encrease of Trade, the reputation of
<hi>Danmark,</hi> in respect of its interest with
other Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> is of late
years so far advanced, as that Crown
never yet made so great a figure in
<hi>Christendom,</hi> as it does at present, not
even in the time of <hi>Canutus;</hi> when we
may suppose it in its greatest prosperity.</p>
               <p>So that, although an absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
with the additional term
of arbitrary Power, sounds harsher in
the Ears of an <hi>Englishman,</hi> than most
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97119:51"/>
other Nations: His present Majesty of
<hi>Danmark</hi> shows us, that even in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Monarchy, which in its own
nature may be under several inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
in respect of the People, and
temptations of encroachment as to the
Prince; yet a wise and good King may
so order his conduct, as to make his
Subjects easy, and himself glorious.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I take this Chapter to
be our Authors Masterpiece, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
his character of an old <hi>Danish</hi> King;
it gives us the very image of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers
own thoughts and inclinations,
and shows us what sort of King, a
Commonwealths man may perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to make, and then how many
particular ways and means, he can find
out to dispatch him.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>IT is astonishing to consider</hi> (says our
Author, p. 48.) <hi>how a free and rich
people, (for so the</hi> Danes <hi>were formerly)
should be perswaded intirely to part with
their Liberties.</hi> It is more astonishing
to me, to see a man write without
considering: For in what did <hi>these
former Riches consist?</hi> In a <hi>Country
exhausted</hi> by the Taxes (p. 50.) or
in the <hi>want of Money to discharge the

which had in a <hi>manner ruined the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi>
In the next place, where was
their Freedom? when the Senator <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Craeg</hi> tells the Commons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 52. <hi>they
were no other than Slaves:</hi> and these
very words made them deliberate
how to get rid of such an odious
Name and Character? Lastly, how
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97119:52"/>
were they perswaded <hi>intirely to part
with their Liberty?</hi> when they gave this
power to the King, on express purpose
to gain it. <hi>For the King upon the first News
of the Resolution of the Commons, did often
openly promise that he would in gratitude
and recompence, declare them all</hi> free <hi>assoon
as it lay in his power, by the Gift they were
about to make him,</hi> p. 58. Which promise
he perform'd accordingly, and put
the Commons of <hi>Danmark</hi> into the
State they are at present, which is
far from Slavery.</p>
               <p>It will be necessary here to show
how all sorts of people stood in <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
before the alteration, which will
easily make the true grounds of it
appear, and how it came to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a consent so general and with
so little trouble. The King had his
power curb'd by the Nobility to a great
measure, <hi>p.</hi> 54. and as the Kings found
these encroachments, they did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to prevent them: to secure their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
therefore (in the latter ages)
they often made their Sons be elected
and sworn (whence they were in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
called <hi>Hylded:</hi>) during their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97119:52"/>
life time, and have Homage done them
both in <hi>Danmark</hi> and <hi>Norway. Frederick</hi>
the third, who was King at this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
had done so by Prince <hi>Christian</hi>
the present King; he was then admir'd
by his Subjects for his conduct and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
p. 54. <hi>they had seen him with an
admirable Patience and Constancy bear
all his Calamities: he had often exposed
his person for the sake of his Subject;
and they therefore thought they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do enough to show their gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nobility were very numerous
and diffusive: all the lands were in
their sole possession; their estates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
our Mannors, of which they
were Lords, and took their <hi>Titles</hi> from
thence, and as they increased in Wealth,
and consequently in Lands, they had
additional titles from thence, and these
accrued either by Purchase, (which as
has been said before, none could make
but themselves) or else by Marriages,
which they always contracted among
one another; for when a Nobleman
died, his pedigree was declared to the
eighth Generation upwards, both by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97119:53"/>
Fathers and Mothers side to have been
noble. To them alone belong'd (and
does belong) the honour of a Coat of
Arm's; others may make use of <hi>Cyphers</hi>
and <hi>Rebus</hi>'s for distinction, but they
do not deliver them down to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
nor have they any farther mark
of honour in them. Among these Nobles
there were twenty four persons of the
chiefest Families, who composed a
standing Council, call'd <hi>Rigens Raad,</hi>
or the Council of the Kingdom; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the death of one of these Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
his Successor had a Patent from
the King to constitute him so, but
he was always approved, if not
first chosen by the Nobility. This
Council had by degrees so enlarged
their Authority, as to interpose in
most of the great Affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
The entire body of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
though standing possest of the
Lands, look'd upon it (<hi>p.</hi> 50.) as their
<hi>Ancient Prerogative, to pay nothing by
way of Taxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rest of the people of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
consisted of the Clergy, the
Burghers, or Citizens, and the Peasants,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97119:53"/>
who were either in the nature of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-Farmers,
or else the <hi>Vornede,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sembled
the Villains in our Law, who
were so called <hi>quasi Villae adscripti,</hi> and
so were these.</p>
               <p>When a <hi>Diet</hi> was to meet (which
it did not do of course, or at certain
periods, but upon great occasions (as
doing Homage, or to raise Taxes) the
Nobility assembled together in the
Palace, and sate by themselves, the
King seldom coming among them; all
were summon'd, and as many appear'd
as could with their convenience: The
Clergy and Burghers, who were sent
in proportion by their several Districts,
sate in the <hi>Brewers Hall;</hi> and the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,
who had their Representatives
likewise, sate in some other Hall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to some of the Companies.
When the Nobility had deliberated
concerning a Tax, the Clergy, Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Peasants were sent for to
their House, to hear what was to be
laid upon them, and not to debate
the matter, or to pretend to controul+'em.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:97119:54"/>This was the condition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the <hi>Danish</hi> Parliament,
when the War with <hi>Sweden</hi> was ended:
And it was this <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that made the other States so
willing to devolve a Power upon the
King, by which he could make the
Nobility pay their proportion, and
either Clergyman or Citizen be able
to purchase; and so the Peasant,
who before could be a Farmer only,
if he could get Money, might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to become <hi>a Free-holder:</hi> And
the Soldier was, no doubt, likewise
desirous of it, because he had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
then, that his <hi>Arrears</hi> should be
paid him. There being so many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
likely to accrue to the King,
whom they acknowledged by his Valor
and Conduct to deserve them; to the
whole Royal Family, and indeed to
all the rest of the <hi>Danes;</hi> and no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
toany, except that which the
Nobles received in contributing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the defence of the Lands,
which they possest. It is not so very
strange, that an alteration should be
perfected in so few days, all things not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97119:54"/>
only being ripe for, but necessity itself
requiring it.</p>
               <p>The Speech of <hi>Otto Craeg</hi> made the
Commons eager to obtain this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
especially being headed by their
President <hi>Nauson,</hi> who was a man of
Vigor. The Superintendent <hi>Swan</hi> was
at the Head of the Clergy, who were
no less desirous of it. <hi>Sestede</hi> was
Prime Minister, and concurred to their
intention; and several of the Nobles
themselves, who were in Court, were
not displeased at it; and the Queen,
being a Woman of Spirit, thought
her self bound to her Posterity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it. It was night when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
parted from the Nobles, and
that gave them time the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert
their resolutions. The next day
they come again, and declare their fixt
design, concerning the Power which
they intended to place in his Majesty's
Hands. The Nobility desired farther
time to deliberate concerning it, and
to do it with greater caution and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.
Finding a delay in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and that they would not come
up to equal resolutions with them, the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97119:55"/>
Commons go the same morning to the
Palace, where being introduc'd to the
King, they tender him an Hereditary
and Soveraign Dominion. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
in answer tells them of the necessity
there was for the concurrence of the
Nobility, before he should be willing
to accept the Power they design'd
him, assuring them of his Protection,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ase of Grievances; dismissing
them with advice to continue their
Sessions, till matters might be brought
to greater perfection. The same day
Monsieur <hi>Scheel,</hi> a Senator, was to be
buried with much magnificence, and
all the Nobility invited to a great
Entertainment, as is usual there upon
such occasions: In the mean time the
Gates of the City were shut and
whereas two or three of the Nobility
had gone out the night before, there
was no opportunity left for the rest to
do so. Now being altogether upon
the forementioned occasion, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to deliberate more seriously upon
the assair, and to send news to the
Court of their compliance with the
Commons, and their unanimous agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97119:55"/>
with them; three days were
thought requisite for an intermediate
space, before the Consummation of
this Ceremony, which was perform'd
before the Castle, the King and Royal
Family being plac'd there in Chairs of
State, and receiving the Homage of
all the Senators, Nobility, Clergy and
Commons; so an affair of this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
was dispatched in four days,
without any farther trouble than what
has been related.</p>
               <p>We must allow our Author in his
Description of these proceedings to
use some of his own Ornaments, and
particularly that instance of his subtle
Genius to dive into the hearts of men,
which he gives us when he speaks
(<hi>p.</hi> 56.) about the Kings seeming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy,
through <hi>doubt of the event,
or sense of the dishonesty, and crime of
the action.</hi> Whereas the King was all
along willing to receive the profer of
the Commons, but declared that he
thought, <hi>the concurrence of the Nobility
necessary,</hi> that the consent might be
universal. He is very particular, as to
the Summs of Money that were given,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97119:56"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 74. <hi>Hannibal Sestled</hi> had <hi>two hundred
thousand Crowns: Swan</hi> the Bishop had
30000, and <hi>was made Archbishop:</hi> The
President <hi>Nauson</hi> had 20000. One
might think he spoke with the person
that paid the Bills. This is a piece of
secret history, which may perhaps be
revealed to Foreigners, but the <hi>Danes</hi>
know nothing of it; and it seems to
carry the less probability, because <hi>Swan</hi>
has an Archbishoprick, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns more than <hi>Nauson,</hi> who
appears all along to have done equal
service.</p>
               <p>Besides these three persons, the
<hi>Clergy who always make sure bargains,
were the only gainers in this point,</hi> p. 74.
What are their Revenues enlarged?
Do they pay no Taxes? Or what
have they gained more than the
Burghers? Why e'en just nothing.
There are no Taxes rais'd upon the
Burghers, to which the Clergy must
not pay their Quota: And whereas
before the alteration, the Clergyman
paid, as it were, no Taxes, through
the connivance of the Nobility, now
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bears an equal share with any man
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97119:56"/>
of any other Profession in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>The Commons have since experienced,
that the little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inger of an absolute Prince,
can be heavier than the loins of many
Nobles. All the Citizens of <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
have by it obtained the insignificant
Priviledge of wearing Swords; so that at
this day, not a Cobler or Barber stirs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
without a Tilter by his side, let his
Purse be never so empty.</p>
               <p>The Priviledge of wearing Swords
was granted to the Citizens before the
change, to encourage them to a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
defence of <hi>Copenhagen, when the
Clergy not only adher'd to the interest of
their Country, but the Burghers likewise
valiantly defended it,</hi> (p. 51.) Before
that time none might wear them but
the Nobility, unless they were Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and among them a Commoner,
very seldom rose higher than a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
In the publick calamity of their
Country, all appeared zealous for the
defence of it. The Works of the Town
were as good as none, but they were
raised in a little time by an incredible
industry: Not only the Students of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97119:57"/>
the University appeared in Arms, and
the Citizens of condition did the same,
but the meanest of the People got
Scythes, and such other instruments,
to perform what was in their power,
upon an occasion so absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Indeed all sorts of People shewed,
that they were worthy to wear their
Swords, since they knew so well how
to use them. After the alteration,
the Priviledges granted them were far
from insignificant. Several for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are fixt by a large
Charter, besides the liberty to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
any Lands and Lordships what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
They are to be burthened
with no impositions, but such as the
Nobles bear; and they have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
(which before they had not) to
see their Children admitted to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and publick offices, to employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
civil and military according as
they can deserve them) equally as well
as the Sons of the greatest Noblemen.</p>
               <p>Barbers indeed in <hi>Copenhagen</hi> wear
Swords, as being principal Citizens; for
they are at the same time very skilful
and able Surgeons, and much respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97119:57"/>
but <hi>Coblers</hi> stalking about with
Tilters by their sides, are as rare a
sight there as roasted <hi>Green Geese.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he told me (<hi>p.</hi> 74.) the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had <hi>the Glory of forging their own
Chains.</hi> I took the <hi>Danes</hi> to be like
his Savage <hi>Indians,</hi> and that they wore
Fetters and Manacles instead of other
Ornaments, and that all their cold
Iron was rather employ'd that way,
than for Tilters: For by the by, a
<hi>Sword</hi> is the foolishest instrument in the
world, for a Prince to put into the
hands of such Subjects, as he designs to
make absolute Slaves of.</p>

                  <p>The Conditions, Customs, and Temper of
the People.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Authors Book would be very
plausible, if People would oblige
themselves in the reading of one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not to remember what may have
been said in another. His eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97119:58"/>
is long enough of it self to require
the same dispensation; for the Reader
will be at a loss if he makes use of his
memory, or if he hopes, that the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
should be agreeable to the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
or the <hi>end</hi> not be contradictory
to them both. As he has hitherto been
partial, in representing the nature and
change of the <hi>Danish</hi> Government,
so it is no wonder, if he be mistaken
in the consequences he draws from
thence: <hi>The condition, customs and
temper of the People,</hi> he says, <hi>are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
by the change of Government.</hi>
Whatever alteration that may have
undergone, and whatever new Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may by chance, or humour be
brought in, as to Cloaths; yet still the
customs of the People are the same
they were before: And more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
they continue their free and
merry way of living, their Hospitaliay,
and their Liberality, all which the
<hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norsh</hi> have always look'd
upon as their native qualities; these
make <hi>the condition of People of all
ranks</hi> to be very far from <hi>deplorable.</hi>
(p. 75.) For they know, that what he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97119:58"/>
calls <hi>habitual slavery,</hi> (ibid.) in them is
nothing but a due obedience to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
powers, not interrupted by
any Mutiny or Rebellion: His <hi>Laziness
(ibid.)</hi> is in them a contented mind, his
setting <hi>them beyond hopes and fears;</hi> is
their desiring not to intrench upon
the power lodg'd in their Prince; nor
creating needless Jealousies and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusts,
lest he should misuse it. For it
seems, <hi>ib.</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> have <hi>mortified am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
emulation, and other troublesome
qualities,</hi> which freedom begets, and
which ill men may indeed admire,
but common morality has set forth to
them as vices. From hence they are
so far from finding themselves in a
<hi>sickly constitution,</hi> that on the contrary,
they have evident and sensible proofs,
that their obedience makes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the <hi>Danish.</hi> Government
strong and vigorous; so as to be able
to fling off any ill humours that may be
bred within, and to repulse any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from without. Nay they see it
not only healthy, but gay and florid,
proceeding on from strength to
strength in greater degrees, than it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97119:59"/>
has done heretofore, either within
their own Memories, or the Records
of their Ancestors.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Government is so
much the stronger, because the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
now assist to the support of it.
It is easily imagined, that the Nobles
were in some greater power before
the alteration; and that they were
richer, when they contributed nothing
toward the publick necessities of their
Country, than they are now. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are not <hi>diminisht, or grown
so low (p.</hi> 75.) as this Author would
insinuate; that proportion which they
pay to the publick Taxes for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Country, being only
deducted, they are in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which they were before, and
live very great and nobly on their seats
in the Country, some of which, tho
ancient, are very decent, others built
after the modern Architecture: and
they delighting much in Gardens, have
them in very good perfection. This
is the utmost difference, that whereas
formerly only the ancient Families
call'd <hi>Adelen,</hi> or the Nobility lived so;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97119:59"/>
(because then no others could purchase
Lands) now any one of the Burgher
state that can afford it, may keep his
Country Seat as well as the Nobility.
What the Nobles pay in Taxes is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
repaid to several of them by
the profitable Imployments, which
they have in Civil Affairs; and as
they help towards the maintaining of
an Army, so they reap the benefit, by
being general Officers in it.</p>
               <p>These Employments our Author
complains of, as <hi>grievous, p.</hi> 78. to the
Nobility; whereas it seems much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than living at home uselessly, and
'tis no more than what they do in all
other Courts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Nor are the
<hi>Civil Employments</hi> so <hi>few,</hi> or of so <hi>small
value,</hi> as he would make them, <hi>p</hi> 78.
For though the Long Robe has not
places of such vast profit as elsewhere;
yet every Government having its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
and several Officers subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
there must be abundance of
Employments, whose names cannot
be so properly exprest in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:97119:60"/>Our Author has given us a very odd
account of the Nobility, and begins
with affirming, that <hi>Antient Riches
and Valour were the only Titles to Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
formerly in this Country:</hi> whereas
not he that was Rich and Valiant,
therefore consequently became a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman:
but the Nobility having got
all the Lands to themselves, might
easily engross the Reputation of being
brave and valiant. <hi>None,</hi> it seems, <hi>then
took their Degree or Patents of Honour
from the King.</hi> First, If this were true,
it could not be for the good of any
Nation, where for an encouragement
to glorious Actions, there ought to
be some fountain of Honour, and the
King certainly is the most proper one:
but in the second place, 'tis evident
that as well before as after the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the King of <hi>Danmark</hi> made No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
and gave Patents of Honour
to them that deserved well, as can
be proved by several instances, in the
Reign of <hi>Christian</hi> the IV. and <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
the III. (before he was made ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute)
as also in the Reigns of their
Predecessors. <hi>Of late years,</hi> he says,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97119:60"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 79. <hi>some few Titles of Baron and Count
and nothing higher, have been given to
Favorites, who enjoy not the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
by those Titles, which our Lords
in</hi> England <hi>do, but content themselves
with a few airy insignificant ones.</hi>
There is no necessity that the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of another Country, should in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing correspond with that of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
suppose the Counts and Barons
in <hi>Danmark</hi> not to be just the same,
are therefore their Titles airy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant?
On the quite contrary,
there's no Country in <hi>Europe,</hi> where
Counts and Barons have such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence,
as in <hi>Danmark.</hi> When the
King there gives <hi>Sheild</hi> and <hi>Helm</hi> (as
they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll it) that is a Noblemans Coat
of Arms with a Patent of Nobility to
him; then such a man is distinguished
from the common people: (and such
as these only were made before the
Alteration, except some few Counts
created by foreign Monarchs and
Princes. But when the King will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
a person to a degree higher,
which he never does, unless he has so
great an Estate as is requisite to sustain
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97119:61"/>
his Honour and Character, then he
gives the Titles of Baron or Count
(for Dukes there are none in <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
that Title of old time, properly
belonging to the Royal Family) this
Honour is far greater, and has several
Priviledges above the rest of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as may be seen in the <hi>Danish</hi>
Law. And yet it may more easily be
imagin'd, that that honour must be so
much the greater, by reason of the
rarity of such Titles, there not being
twenty in the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The following paragraph, that <hi>'tis
only this kind of Nobility with Titles,
that have liberty to make a Will, and
thereby to dispose of any Estate, otherwise
than as the Law has determined, unless
such Will, in the Life of the Testator, be
approved of, and signed by the King;</hi>
has more than one mistake in it, for not
only this kind, but all the Nobility,
have Titles from the Lands they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
and are Lords of; these indeed
have the highest Titles of Count and
Baron, and then not only they, but all
the Nobility, nay any one among the
Clergy and Citizens can make a Will;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97119:61"/>
only it is to be observed, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to every such Testament from
whomsoever it comes, that it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
and sign'd by the King, to
render it of force and valid, that the
Estate may go otherwise than the Law
hath determined. Neither is it true,
<hi>that the King</hi> (p. 81.) <hi>assumes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the power of disposing all Heirs and
Heiresses of any consideration.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the King may interpose his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
for the Marriage of some of
the chief Nobility, but it is far from
being his usual custom, much less does
he assume any power to constrain them,
or cause them, who do not hearken to
his Recommendation, <hi>to lye under the
pain of his displeasure,</hi> p. 81. <hi>which is
too weighty to be born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nobility being forc'd to endure
the forementioned hardships, <hi>It is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
p. 81. <hi>most of the present Possessors would
quit the Country, the first opportunity, if there
were not such a severe Law against aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
That if any one would transport
himself, the third part of his Purchase
Money shall accrue to the King.</hi> This
Law is not more hard, than it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97119:62"/>
for there being <hi>no buying
and selling of Land in</hi> Danmark, (p.
80.) the Kings third part of Purchase
Money will amount to but little; and
where <hi>Estates are a charge,</hi> (ibid.) and
the Proprietors can scarce obtain the
favour of the King to be so <hi>gracious as
to take their Estates from them,</hi> (p. 77.)
one would fancy, that all landed men
would lay the Key under the door,
and be scampering: now to mend their
condition, and to get free from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
and Taxes: I would advise
them to hasten to a neighbouring
Commonwealth, the Seat of Liberty,
where the chief Minister of their <hi>State</hi>
has not above 5001. salary, and where
their Excise and Taxes laid on their
Estates, amount often to above their
<hi>yearly</hi> income. After all, the Law, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it is reasonable to prevent the Subject

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
does require but a sixth part to the
King, and a tenth part of the rest to
the Magistrate of the place, both
which, according to my Arithmetick
will not amount to a third part, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is reported by our Author with his
Geometrical <hi>Exactness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Land being worth nothing, how
must the Counts and Barons do to live?
Why <hi>they are obliged by all manner of
ways to keep in with the Court, as indeed
all are, who have a mind to live, and eat
bread,</hi> p. 79. What then will become
of the rest of the <hi>Adelen,</hi> or native
Gentry? Why <hi>military employments are
mightily covered by them,</hi> p. 81. <hi>almost as
much as the civil, and for the same reason,
that the Priest's Office was among the</hi> Jews,
viz. <hi>That they may eat a piece of Bread.</hi>
Bread! Bread! is the universal Cry,
and our Author seems to have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
his Images not from the <hi>Jews,</hi>
but rather from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> calling
upon <hi>Pharoah</hi> towards the latter end
of the seven years of Famine.</p>
               <p>Want of Bread is not the only mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
for it comes attended with
other miseries; for he says, that <hi>the
King of</hi> Danmark (p. 81.) <hi>imitates
the</hi> French <hi>practice in this particular, to
make the Gentry poor, and render Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
unprofitable and dishonourable: Men
of birth must live, and one half of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97119:63"/>
Nation, by giving themselves up to Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
will contribute their assistance after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to put Chains upon the other: Yet
in</hi> Danmark <hi>Natives are considered less
than Strangers, and all sorts of places
civil and military are fill'd more by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
than Gentlemen of the Country,</hi>
&amp;c. Were all these things true, they
would be very great evidences of a
corrupt Government: But I shall beg
leave to set the Reader right as to these
particulars, and the condition of the
people. The Plenty of the whole
Country has been sufficiently described,
and in the midst of this, the chief
Nobility enjoy the Governments of
the several Provinces, and the chief
Offices of the Kingdom; the rest of
the <hi>Adelen,</hi> or Nobility, have subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Governments and Offices, some
at Court, and others in the Countries
where they have their Seats of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
some <hi>Germans</hi> are in the Court,
but the native Subjects are in greater
number, as the Counts <hi>Guldenlew, Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zow,
Reventlaw, Ahlefelt, Frits;</hi> Baron
<hi>Juel,</hi> Messieurs <hi>Hogh, Moth, Harboe,
Scholier, Luxdorf,</hi> and a great many
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97119:63"/>
more, too numerous to be here insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And Natives likewise are in all the
Governments throughout the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
<hi>Men of Birth</hi> breed up their
Sons to several Employments, some to
civil Affairs, some to Studies, and
some to Trade and Traffick, which is
as profitable and honourable there as
Merchants can desire; it has all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
from the King, and many
of the highest rank interest themselves
in it continually. Some Gentlemen
apply themselves to Arms, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that way to be serviceable to
their Country; there are abundance
of these in Commission: Foreigners
there are indeed in some number, but
it must be considered, that they came
thither in the late War, and took pay
in <hi>Danmark,</hi> either of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
or hired out by their Princes:
These are by birth <hi>Germans, French,
Scotch, Poles, Prussians,</hi> &amp;c. Yet these
very men are naturalized, married,
and settled in <hi>Danmark,</hi> and so are now
to be accounted <hi>Danes.</hi> The <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
do not pay the Souldiers, nor are
constantly plagu'd with insolent Inmates,

his <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> to maintain an Army
at home, does it after the manner that
may be most easy to the People, which
is this: Souldiers are scattered univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
all round about the Countries.
The Officers there often take Houses,
and live with their Families, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
quartering round about them.
The Souldiers are quartered upon the
Inhabitants, who are to find them Bed,
Salt, and <hi>Sour,</hi> or Vinegar. If the
Landlord finds his Souldiers disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
he may hire them a Lodging
elsewhere for a small matter: But the
Souldier is generally desirous to oblige
his Landlord which he does by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
offices and labours that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
for him, and is rewarded with
his Diet, which otherwise he must find
for himself, so that by that means he
may have the Kings Pay clear for his
Pocket. And hence it proceeds, that
a Souldier comes to be as desirous in a
Family as a Servant; their Arrears are
small, the Pay being as constant, and
the Discipline as exact and severe, as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97119:64"/>
any where can be, both for Officers
and Souldiers. Strangers find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so well entertain'd in <hi>Danmark</hi>
and <hi>Norway,</hi> that it is no wonder they
flock thither: Great Civility, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
and Hospitality are shown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

have to be a fault, is certainly one
upon the best natur'd side. A man

the difficulty of procuring a comfortable

fall to decay, when Trade encreases
will scarce gain belief. As for <hi>Kioge,</hi>
that Town lying within four Leagues
of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> 'tis no wonder if the
Trade is in some measure decreased,
since the flourishing of that City: We
have this Authors word for it, that

                  <hi>Kioge</hi> raised so much money <hi>in four
and twenty hours time.</hi> Two hundred
thousand Rixdollars (and those (as
was said before) equivalent to <hi>English</hi>
pounds) is a good round summ for a
little Town to lend in a days time;
they lent so much then, that it is no
great wonder they have no great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

sight in <hi>England</hi> (even in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s
time) to see a sturdy fray, between a
Collector of Chimney-money, and an
Old Woman in behalf of her Porridge
Pot, and batter'd Pewter Dish, the only
Ornament of her Cupboard. And
yet I suppose, the Author does not
take us to have been undone then,
though such an instance (which he

to prove all the <hi>Danes</hi> to be ruin'd.</p>

to provide dainties for their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,

this paragraph, because they cannot so
easily be rectified without the <hi>Danish</hi>
Law, which I suppose he never consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It must be known that from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
time in <hi>Sealand,</hi> there has been a
Law about <hi>Vornede,</hi> as they are called
in <hi>Danmark,</hi> that is Vassals; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
whereof is, that a Boor born upon a
Landlord's Land, is obliged to stay
there, and not to leave his Service, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he is freed by his Landlord. But
first, what he says, <hi>that neither they,
nor their Posterity to all Generations, can
leave the Land to which they belong,</hi> p. 86.
is far from being true: for the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
may make them free when he
pleases, which is often practised: Or
they may obtain their freedom for a
small summ of money, which is done
commonly. Or if it happens, that a
Vassal comes away, and stays ten years
in a City, or twenty in the Country any
where, without his Landlords ground,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97119:68"/>
he is free from his claim. Secondly,
That <hi>Gentlemen count their Riches by their
stocks of Boors, as here with us byour stocks
of Cattle,</hi> p. 86. is of the same stamp:
As we say, such a Gentleman has so
many Tenants, by which we mean so
many Farms; so throughout all <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
they say, he has so many Boors,
not that he has many head of Boors,
as we would say of Cattle. Thirdly,
<hi>That in case of Purchase, they are sold as
belonging to the Freehold, just as Timber
Trees.</hi> In <hi>England,</hi> when a Mannor
is sold, all the services due to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
are sold with it; and it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in <hi>Danmark.</hi> Further the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
cannot go, for the Law says, the
Landlord may make his Vassal free,
but he must by no means sell him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if the Vassal be sold, then he's
free, both from him that sold and
bought him. Neither, fourthly, <hi>Do
the Boors with all that belongs to them,
appertain to the Proprietor of the Land.</hi>
For such a Vassal owes nothing more
to his Landlord, than that he shall
stay on his Land, till his Ground, and pay
him his Rent; which when it is done,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97119:69"/>
reasonably the Landlord can require
nothing more of him; so that this
Law of Vassals in <hi>Sealand,</hi> was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
introduc'd, that the Landlords
might not want Tenants. These Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
may be transplanted from one
Farm to another. The <hi>Vornede</hi> are
only in <hi>Sealand,</hi> and the King would
have given them freedom there, since
the Alteration, but that he was shewed
there would have been several inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
attending it. As to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Country People throughout
the rest of <hi>Danmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> it is just
like that of the Farmers in <hi>England,</hi>
paying their Rent and Due to the
Landlord, or leaving his Farm when
they cannot agree together. They do
indeed <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>arter Souldiers,</hi> but it is in the
manner before described. <hi>And they
are bound to furnish Horses and Waggons
for the Kings Baggage and Retinue when
he travels.</hi> These are provided by an
Officer in the nature of our Constable,
who takes care, that there shall be an
equal share for every Peasant through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Sealand</hi> and other Provinces,
where the King of <hi>Danmark</hi> travels;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97119:69"/>
so that it does not come to the same
Boors turn above once a year; for
not only they that live near the Road,
but those likewise who lye farther off,
must attend in their order. <hi>This seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our Author to be the greatest hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
imposed on these poor Peasants. He
has seen 'em so beaten and abus'd by
Lacqueys, that it has often mov'd his
pity and indignation to see it,</hi> p. 90. Tender
hearted Gentleman! There was no
Provocation on the Boors side I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

bred than to give ill language! If you
were so touched with this, how would
your Pity, Sir, have been mov'd, had

great reason is attributed to the
Plague, called the <hi>Black Death,</hi> that
ravaged all the <hi>Northern</hi> Kingdoms, in
the year 1348. when so many died,
that scarce the tenth man was left to

               <p>Our Author gives another reason,
why they are not so numerous as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,

well furnished with Dishes, yet he
cannot commend their cheer,</hi> p 92. Other
<hi>English-men</hi> have mightily commended
their <hi>Cheer,</hi> and never complained of
<hi>the Leanness of their Meat:</hi> The truth
is, the <hi>Danes</hi> like it the better for not
being very fat; the greatest fault
which they and other strangers find
with the <hi>English</hi> Meat is, that it is too
fat, which disagrees with most of 'em.
This may be one reason, and perhaps
a better than that of <hi>Properly not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And yet Fat Capons were in
<hi>Danmark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> long before any
<hi>English-man</hi> brought in the <hi>Cramming
Manufacture,</hi> p. 92. <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Veal,</hi> p. 42. he
allows them: <hi>Wether Mutton is scarce,
and seldom good;</hi> not so scarce or bad,
though not in such plenty, or so fat as
in <hi>England;</hi> Wild Ducks taste as well
as in <hi>England; Plovers</hi> they have, but

According to him here <hi>are no

Fallow Deer, Red Deer being the Kings
game, not to be bought for mony.</hi> What
game is permitted by Law to be sold
in our <hi>English</hi> Markets? <hi>Wild Pheasants</hi>
are not there as yet, but the <hi>Prince
Royal</hi> having a Nursery of tame ones
near <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and they increasing
prodigiously, it is thought they will
soon grow wild and common. Their
Woodcocks call'd <hi>Agerhons</hi> are most
delicious in <hi>Danmark.</hi> They have all
sorts of Venison in plenty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
nor is it kept so strictly for

have spoke before. <hi>Their Butter is
very good, and they have Melons, Grapes,

of Cookery would hardly be pleasing to an</hi>

might contrive a Good Dinner, and a

Twenty years last past that Humor

               <p>
                  <hi>Their Marriages are usually preceeded by
Contracts,</hi> p 94. and there is some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
between that and the Wedding,
according to the conditions of the
Persons: What he says concerning
<hi>three, four, or more years, before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to a Publick Wedding by the Minister,</hi>
p. 94. is to introduce his following
Scandal upon the young People: <hi>That
often the young Couple grow better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
before such formalities are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched.</hi>
There are no such long Intervals,
or very seldom at least: Besides there
is such a strictness in <hi>Danmark,</hi> about
marrying, that no Minister dare mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
any that is not of his own Parish,
which prevents several Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And there can be no greater
shame than it is in <hi>Danmark</hi> for a New

               <p>If we will believe him <hi>the Gentry
give Portions with their Daughters,</hi> p. 94.
I must confess, I had rather believe the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97119:73"/>
                  <hi>Danes</hi> themselves, who assure me that
no body in <hi>Danmark,</hi> gives any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Money with his Daughter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Wedding Dinner, Cloaths,
and Houshold-Stuff. But in requital
for this the Daughters have a share of
the Estate, when their Parents die.
For it is to be remarkt that every
Brother hath an equal share of the
Patrimony, the youngest as well as the
eldest, and each Sister has half as much
as any Brother. When a Parent would
dispose of his Estate otherwise by
Will, it must (as has been said before)
be signed by the King in his Life time,
which, in truth is no other, than that
he must have a new Law to disinherit
any of his Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sumptuous Burials and Monuments,</hi>
(he says) <hi>are much in request with the
Nobility,</hi> p. 94. The King has some years
since by a particular Law, retrenched
much of the former Luxury and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of the great Peoples Burials;
so that they now are moderate, and
yet very proper and decent. The
common People are <hi>mean spirited,</hi> p. 94.
yet in the foregoing page, they were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97119:74"/>
                  <hi>proud and vain;</hi> which two sorts of
qualities seldom meet together. If
they have any fault it is a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one, which is that of being too
much inclined to sight upon the least
word, and too slight provocations:
Besides, they must always be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be desirous, rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
than receive obligations, which a
<hi>mean Spirit</hi> never does. The <hi>Swedes,</hi>
who are as brave a Nation, as any in
the world, have sufficiently try'd their
courage: and in all their Engagements,
that they have had in the present King
and Queens of <hi>England</hi>'s Service, they
have behav'd themselves like men. The
defence, which the common People
made for their Country, and <hi>Amack</hi>
in particular, deserves not only to be
encouraged with Privileges, but to
have so excellent a Poem, as that of
<hi>Amagria vindicata,</hi> written by <hi>Borri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi>
to continue the memory of their
valour down to posterity.</p>
               <p>What Tradesmen he may have met
with, it is impossible to know; and
what notion he may have of being
cheated: But whereas he says, <hi>p.</hi> 95.

the common people are <hi>inclin'd to
gross Cheating;</hi> they have the general
reputation with other men of being
fair Dealers. First, <hi>An Old supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
woman would not sell him any Green
Geese.</hi> This silly story (as he relates
it, p. 95, 96.) <hi>gives him a more lively
Idea of the temper of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than any description he could make;</hi>
and in mine it raises a much brighter
Image of the Author: Especially when
he proceeds to tell me, <hi>that in their
Markets they will ask the same Price for
stinking meat as for fresh; for lean as
for fat, if it be of a Kind,</hi> p, 97. We'll
suppose the Butchers so mad as to do
so: But how came he to know this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity?
did he cheapen lean meat,
and stinking meat? Some frugal peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
go towards the latter end of a
Market to buy the refuse cheap, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
our Author did so too, and
makes his Complaint in Print, because
he was disappointed of a penny worth.</p>
               <p>Where he lays it down, <hi>as a sure
way not to obtain, to seem to value, and
to ask importunately, p,</hi> 90. It is that way
which I would advise no man to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97119:75"/>
for certainly the <hi>Danes</hi> are not such
Fools as to keep their Wares, when
they find the Buyer so forward as to
overvalue them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Lodgings in</hi> Copenhagen <hi>for stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
In Taverns one must be content to
Eat and Drink in a publick Room,</hi> p. 97. It
is so in all <hi>Germany;</hi> but in <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
persons may have Tables or Rooms
to themselves when bespoke, and no
stranger need, or does want conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Lodgings, both in publick and

               <p>
                  <hi>Their Seasons of Jollity are very scarce,</hi>
p. 97. Persons of Fashion have their
Diversions at seasonable Times, as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Comedies, Retreats into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in Summer, as well as their Sleds
in the Winter. Whereas <hi>he says, they
content themselves with running at the
Goose on</hi> Shrove tuesday, p. 97. One
would think that Men of Quality ran
at this Goose, but it is only a pastime
of his beloved Boors of <hi>Amack,</hi> and
performed by them: only sometimes,
because of the odd frolicks of these
Peasants, persons of better Character
condescend to be their Spectators.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:97119:75"/>Perhaps it may be thought too nice
for him to remark, <hi>That no body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
to go in a Sled till the King and
Court has begun, that the King passes
over a new Bridge the first; and that the
Clocks of</hi> Copenhagen <hi>strike the hours
after the Court Clock,</hi> p. 97. If these
Remarks were but as True, as they
are Nice, they would be admirable;
but as soon as the Snow comes every
one <hi>Presumes</hi> to use his Sled, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of it indeed is become more
fashionable, when the King and Court
have done it one night through <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen.</hi>
As for new Bridges, some
of them might drop down again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Passage over them, if no one
were to go till the King had done
it: In the mean time our Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if some traiterous Clocks should chance
to go to fast, they might make an
exception to a rule so universal. I

matters most extreamly, because ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

advice among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> I find
something like it at the <hi>Savage</hi> Court
of <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> where the Emperor
having Dined, Commands a Trumpet
to be sounded, to give notice to the
rest of the Princes of the World, that
they may go to Dinner.</p>
               <p>The Language he says, <hi>is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
and like the</hi> Irish <hi>in its whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
complaining tone,</hi> p. 98. He may
be as free with the <hi>Irish</hi> as he pleases;
But the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norsh</hi> speak more
like the <hi>English</hi> in their accent than
any other People, and therefore these
two Nations most easily learn, to read,
speak and understand one anothers
Languages upon occasion. There is a
great <hi>agreement between their Monosylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
(p. 98.) which being generally the
particles, and strength, or sinews of a
Language, show that the <hi>English</hi> has
not only incorporated the old <hi>Saxon</hi>
but the <hi>Danish</hi> likewise, to bring it
to its present perfection. At Court
<hi>High Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> are much used,
and also <hi>Italian:</hi> Though Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
often passes in these, yet if <hi>any

<hi>p.</hi> 98. he would render himself ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:
and an <hi>Englishman</hi> might think
him not worthy to eat <hi>Danish</hi> Bread:
and indeed with reason, for among
the living Tongues, there is none that
for its abundance, the propriety of
the Expression, the fitness and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
to Poetry and Numbers, can
pretend to surpass it.</p>
               <p>I shall finish the Remarks upon this
Chapter with a recapitulation of what
the Author has delivered in it. Was
ever any man so Planet-struck as this
Writer, to pronounce a People the
<hi>most miserable</hi> in one Page, and to
sill the next <hi>with the Grandeur and
Equipage</hi> (p. 83.) <hi>of the Gentry, the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Tables</hi> (p. 92.) Their retreats
for pleasure <hi>in fruitful and delightsom
Gardens,</hi> (p. 92.) at the same time
declaring <hi>that the Burghers, Servants,
and even Peasants have change of Lining
and are neat and cleanly</hi> (93.) What
Country can boast of more than Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Neatness?</p>
               <p>He begins with telling us, that <hi>in
former times when the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97119:77"/>
were the same thing</hi> (p. 76.) That
is, during the times that the Nobles
had <hi>an excess of Power</hi> (p. 76.) in their
hands, they <hi>liv'd in great Affluence and
Prosperity, ibid.</hi> which he takes much
pains to describe, and every body
will easily be induced to believe.
<hi>Then the Commons were willing in a great
measure to be directed by them.</hi> (ibid.)
that is, <hi>because they depended on them</hi>
(ibid.) were forced like <hi>Slaves</hi> (p. 52.)
to truckle to them whither they would
or no. <hi>But in process of time the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the whole Country were lost,</hi>
p. 76. By which alteration the Nobles
were reduced to some bounds, and
the Commons delivered from a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
<hi>Aristocracy,</hi> p. 73. This change
forsooth <hi>creates in them all a kind of
laziness and idle d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them beyond hopes and fears; insomuch
that even the Nobility are now desirous</hi>
(p. 78.) <hi>to procure Employments Civil,</hi>
(Strange!) and <hi>Military</hi> (Wonderful!)
Civil, I suppose, without <hi>hopes,</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
without <hi>fears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Under these Circumstances</hi> 'tis easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagin'd the present condition of such
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97119:77"/>
a People in all ranks is most deplorable,
<hi>(p. 75.)</hi> Their Nobility and Gentry sunk
very low, and diminishing daily both in
number and credit, <hi>(p. 76.)</hi> they are
forced to live meanly and obscurely in
some corner of their ruinous Palaces;
and patiently endure their Poverty at
home; their Spirits (for there was not
so much as a Song or Tune made in three
years, <hi>p. 96.</hi>) as well as Estates, grown
so mean, that you would scarce believe
'em to be Gentlemen by their Discourse
and Garb.</p>
               <p>The truth of all which foregoing
Assertions, is seen in nothing more
plainly than in what he fully delivers

the Peace of <hi>Danmark</hi> cannot be so

               <p>From this account of Taxes, the
Author brings us to a Catalogue of
other Miseries, <hi>The number of trading
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97119:82"/>
Ships is decreased, and does not come up
to what it did within these 30 years,</hi> p.

whereas in truth, the Trade never
was greater than it is now, and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> can so little be supplied with
their Wooden Commodities from
<hi>Sweden,</hi> that they are glad to refix
their Commerce with <hi>Norway</hi> again.</p>
               <p>He gives us, <hi>p.</hi> 117. his computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ships that Trade thither,
and that pass the <hi>Sound</hi> yearly, but I
never lik'd his computations, because
I have before found him wrong in his
Arithmetick; and at present there is
a difference that I cannot easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile:
In his Chapter of the <hi>Sound</hi>
(p. 23, 24, 25.) he recites <hi>a Letter
from a very Understanding Person,</hi>
March 31st, 1691. which gives him to
understand, <hi>that since the Peace with</hi>
Sweden, <hi>the</hi> Sound <hi>has not yeilded
above</hi> 80000 <hi>Rixdollars</hi> per annum,
<hi>and the last Year past, it did not reach to

                     <desc>•</desc>

believed his understanding Friend,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97119:82"/>
what a mistake I might have run into:
For when the Author himself comes
to give us his opinion of it, <hi>p.</hi> 115.
he says, that <hi>in the years</hi> 1690 <hi>and</hi>
1691, <hi>it amounted not to much more
than 65000 Rixdollars, at which rate
we may judge it likely to continue.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this disagreement between him
and his <hi>understanding Friend,</hi> what
credit can we Strangers give to the
Letter of Advice, when there are at
Least 4000 Rixdollars in the account
between'em; which he will not take
his Friends word for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is another branch of the Kings
Revenue,</hi> p 117. <hi>which is least consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and arises from the Rents of
the Crown Lands, and confiseated
Estates. The latter are in the Kings
hands, either upon account of Forfeiture
for Treason and other crimes, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Debt, and Non-payment of
Taxes; but notwithstanding this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Lands, the King is so far from
being the richer, that he is the poorer
for it.</hi> And were the thing true,
<hi>that Estates fell into the Crown rather
than pay Taxes,</hi> it would be great pity
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97119:83"/>
that the King should receive no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by them; but such Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are as imaginary, as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscations
for Treason and other
crimes: For <hi>Danmark</hi> is that happy
Country, where, according to his
own words, p. 139. <hi>You never hear of
any Person guilty of the crime of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against the King; there are no Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Coyners, no Robbers upon the
High-way, nor House-breakers.</hi> So
that if he, being an exact Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,
will put together the Rents
of Estates given to the King, rather
than pay Taxes; the Rents of Estates
confiscated for Treason, Rents of
Estates forfeited for Coyning, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
and House breaking, to the Money
arising to his Majesty, from <hi>the Tax
which might have been,</hi> p. 113. the
<hi>Summ total</hi> will probably be just <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But farther, as for this sort of
Land, <hi>it generally turns to Forest, and
contributes to his Diversion, though little
to his Purse,</hi> p. 113. It is a sign his Purse
needs no supply, when he can afford
so much ground for his Diversion. <hi>And
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97119:83"/>
then the Royal Palaces run to decay,</hi> ib.
And so they do in all Countries, when
the Prince is better pleased with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scituation. As for several of the
King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s Palaces, they are
old uncouth Buildings, used by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Kings, disused now, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not kept in so good order as
<hi>Fredericksborg, Jagersborg,</hi> and others,
where the King passes some part of
the Year</p>
               <p>The Author it seems has met with
another <hi>understanding Person,</hi> p. 119.
who has informed him in several
things, as first, <hi>that it is very difficult
to make any rational computation of the
running Cash of these Kingdoms,</hi> ib. or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of any Kingdom besides these;
and so his Labour might have been
superseded; <hi>certainly it is but very
l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttle, and not near the hundredth part
of that of</hi> England, <hi>ib.</hi> When he is able
to give a Rational Computation of
the Running Cash of <hi>England,</hi> then
it will be time enough to guess what
proportion that of <hi>Danmark</hi> may
bear to it; but till I find that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Persons agree in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97119:84"/>
of that of my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
I shall despair of finding them
exact, as to that of another. If <hi>they
have no Cash by them, and are indebted
over head and ears to their Creditors at</hi>
Amsterdam <hi>and</hi> Hamborough, <hi>ib.</hi> how
comes it to pass, that the <hi>Danish</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
have so good Credit in both
those Cities, and how come they to
have it in <hi>London? But the Officers of
the Army transport their Money to other
Countries:</hi> This may be true in some
very few instances; but for the most
part these Officers are <hi>Danes,</hi> or
married and settled in <hi>Danmark</hi> as has
before been intimated. <hi>That few, or
none of the Ministers of State purchase
any Lands,</hi> p. 118. is as true as other
of his Remarks, for there is no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Minister, be he <hi>Dane,</hi> or not,
that has not one, two, or more Seats,
with Lands appertaining to them in
the Country. <hi>That these Kingdoms
consume more of Foreign Commodities,
than their own Product can countervail,</hi>
ib. cannot certainly be said of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
nor of several Provinces of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
as <hi>Jutland, Laaland,</hi> &amp;c. and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97119:84"/>
any person who has the least know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their Traffick, will easily
confute this Aslertion. As for <hi>the
running of Brass Money amongst the
common People,</hi> it is as Farthings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us: Their Silver Coin is very
good, in respect of several other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
although not equal to <hi>Sterling;</hi>
but whether the goodness of Coin be
a way to preserve Running Cash in a
Kingdom, may perhaps hereafter
come to be considered by the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under these circumstances, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think this <hi>understanding Person</hi>
a competent Judge of the Running
Cash of <hi>Danmark,</hi> any more than I
take the Author to be of the King of
<hi>Danmark</hi>'s Revenue, though he is
so very particular as to make it, <hi>Two
Millions, two hundred twenty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Rixdollars,</hi> p. 122. and I am the
more confirmed in this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Taxes not being every year
the same, the Revenue received by
several Officers, and no account given
but to the King himself, the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Revenue can hardly be
made by those, who are most em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97119:85"/>
in these Affairs at the Court,
much less by a Foreigner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude with</hi> Norway, <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the Southern part amounts to
between five and six hundred thousand
Rixdollars, and of the Northern to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two and three hundred thousand,
and so the Total may be</hi> communibus
annis 800000 <hi>Rixdollars,</hi> so says the
Author, <hi>p.</hi> 117. But when he comes

                  <p>Of the Army, Fleet and Fortresses.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Author begins this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with bewailing the Misery
of <hi>Danmark,</hi> that the Revenue is
expended upon a standing Army, and
upon the maintaining of a Fleet and
Fortresses: And if <hi>Danmark</hi> had not
sufficient reasons for the maintenance
of all these, they would have just
cause to complain.</p>
               <p>But it seems it is the <hi>King of</hi> France,
<hi>that Great Master of the Art of Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that has <hi>instructed the Court of</hi>
Danmark, <hi>p.</hi> 123. <hi>and the King is his
Pupil,</hi> p. 124. and in pursuance to
such a character he has taught him,
the <hi>pernicious secret of making one part
of the People both the Bridle and Scourge
to the other.</hi> This is not so great a
secret, but that it has been known
and practised in all Ages and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
that when one part of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is factious and mutinous, the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97119:86"/>
more honest and sober part should
<hi>bridle</hi> them, and if part of a Nation
rebel, the other that is for quietness
should endeavour to <hi>scourge</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them. But God be thanked,
<hi>Danmark</hi> has no occasion for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
upon these accounts, nor neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of going to <hi>France</hi> for such a
Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im. In the next place, <hi>France</hi>
has <hi>taught him to raise more Men than
his Country can maintain,</hi> p. 124. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well! And then his own Prudence
teaches him to disband such as he
thinks unnecessary or burthensome to
him, as he has done several times. But
the great thing that he has taught
him is, <hi>that Souldiers are the only true
Riches,</hi> p. 125, 126, 127. The thing
that the Author would here reflect
upon is, that the <hi>German</hi> Princes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
receive Money, before they will
send their Troops into a Foreign Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and hence he would infer, <hi>that
at present Souldiers are grown as saleable
Ware, as Sheep and Oxen,</hi> p. 125. What
a strange Country this must be, <hi>where
the Souldiers are Sheep and Oxen! and
the Peasants Timber Trees,</hi> p. 86. But the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97119:86"/>
King of <hi>Danmark</hi> esteems his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to be his Wealth, only as he
can make them serviceable to his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
or as they preserve his Subjects
from any foreign attempts, and so are
the causes of Quiet, and consequently
of <hi>true Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, whatever the matter is, it
happens, <hi>p.</hi> 127. that the Pupil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
but ill upon the example which
the <hi>French</hi> King has set him. <hi>The
Toad may emulate the Ox and swell, but
he shall sooner burst than equal him,</hi>
p. 127. Truly a very decent simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for a couple of Crown'd Heads:
I find the Author mightily taken with
these kind of Animals, for, <hi>p.</hi> 232.
speaking with reference to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of the Laws of <hi>Danmark,
p.</hi> 232. he says, <hi>there is no Plant or Insect
how venemous or mean soever, but is good
for something;</hi> upon which a Friend
of mine observed, that there may be
a creature in the world, that has as

as are at present in <hi>Europe.</hi> But his
own words (p. 126.) <hi>That none of
the Kings or Princes, though endowed
with a more peaceable spirit and better
judgment than the rest, dares lead the

Neighbours:</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King of <hi>Danmark,</hi> but those other
Kings, whom he obliquely would
blame upon this occasion.</p>
               <p>To give a List of the <hi>Danish</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
would be too nice, and is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
variable; however the King of
<hi>Danmark</hi> may be said to have above
twenty thousand men in pay, besides
those that are in the Emperor and
the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Service. I have
before given an account of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery,
only I must add this farther,
that when he says, the <hi>Troopers are
maintained by their Peasants,</hi> p. 135. The
Reader must know, that there are
particular Peasants living on Lands
in the Country, that are appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to this use; so that such a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

is reported by this Author because he
confesses, <hi>they are generally Natives,</hi>
ibid. Yet King <hi>William</hi> has judged
far better of the three Regiments of
Horse that he had from <hi>Danmark,</hi> the
half part of which behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so well in the Battle of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(for the other half was with the Duke
of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>) that his Majesty was
pleased to compliment their Colonels
particularly, upon the Bravery and
Valour of their Troops.</p>
               <p>The Author gives us a reason
(<hi>p.</hi> 135.) why there are not more
Natives in the Army; <hi>because the
Landlords, whose Slaves they are, can
hinder them from entring into the Kings
Service, and remand them if any should
offer so to do.</hi> This is true only of
the <hi>Vornede,</hi> whose condition has
heretofore been described: But it is
an apparent proof, that the King of
<hi>Danmark</hi> is not so arbitrary as he
would make him, and that the
<hi>Danes</hi> have not entirely lost their
Property; since they have such an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97119:88"/>
Authority, as to be able to deny
their King the taking men from their
Farms, though they are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Service of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>French</hi> Officers, which
he says are in the Army, the most
part of them are such as have been
forc'd to leave their Country for the
sake of Religion; and <hi>Danmark</hi> thinks
it a Duty and Honour to be able to
grant them Protection.</p>
               <p>In his Account of the Fortifications,
<hi>p.</hi> 143. instead of saying that <hi>Naxkew</hi>
is of no defence, he might have said,
that <hi>Nakskow</hi> is a good Fortress,
which it shewed in the War with
<hi>Sweden,</hi> when it longer resisted the
Enemy than most of the other Towns:
He speaks as slightly of the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> in this place, <hi>p.</hi> 144.
as he did before; although that, and
not <hi>Rensburg,</hi> p. 144. is the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
place for strength, that the
King of <hi>Danmark</hi> has. Neither is
<hi>Nyborg</hi> so much out of repair; nor
<hi>Fridericks-hall,</hi> which is the strongest
place in <hi>Norway</hi> by natural scituation,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97119:88"/>
so much commanded by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Hill as he would insinuate.</p>
               <p>In the Account of the Fleet, which
he makes to consist of but two and
thirty Ships, <hi>p.</hi> 141. he has omitted
several; and as to what he says, <hi>that
it was never set to Sea thus equipt,</hi>
(p. 142.) The late Wars with <hi>Sweden</hi>
may sufficiently confute him, and yet
the King of <hi>Danmark</hi> had much fewer
Ships then, than he has at present.
The <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norsh</hi> are very good
Seamen: The <hi>Dutch</hi> are mightily desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of them, and consequently have
several in their Service; yet not so
but that they would return upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
and indeed all the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eamen
are so ready to be employed in the
Kings Service, that there is no need
of pressing to man the Fleet: To
make this the more easy, the Sea Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are kept in pay during a Peace,
as well as in time of War; and so are
the Seamen, who have a Salary, and
are employed in the <hi>Bremer Holm,</hi> in
working upon all Materials necessary
for the Naval Service. As for the Sea
Provision of the <hi>Danes,</hi> which he says
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97119:89"/>
is very bad; the contrary will easily
be evinc'd, by any that have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of it. The <hi>Mutiny of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
p. 38. and the besieging the
King in his Palace, <hi>p.</hi> 139. is a meer
story, for in Danmark <hi>are no Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers,</hi>
p. 246. But it may have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that the Seamens Wives may
have had Complaints to the Lords of
the Admiralty; now the Admiralty
being opposite to the Castle, their
flocking thither, perhaps to this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious

with several <hi>active qualities which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Court.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO give Characters of living
Princes, and publick Ministers
of State, must be a thing very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult:
It is not easy for the man, who
would make 'em to set aside passion
or partiality, and mens tempers, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
inclinations and interests dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nay hourly varying, it is hard to
fix a lasting character upon a man, till
we see the whole Thred and Tenor
of his Life and Actions: This is one
reason why I don't defer so much to
the characters which the Author
gives in this Chapter; besides when I
have found him mistaken in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and Description of things, which
are sensible and permanent, I shall be
much more cautious how I trust him
as to his notions of men, who are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and various especially when he
would make his search into the recesses
of their mind, and there discover their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97119:90"/>
very thoughts and <hi>sincerity,</hi> p. 168.
For if the Authors Conversation be
like his Writing, a man might be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
free and open in his temper, and
yet appear reserv'd to him; for it is
the opinion taken of the Man which
makes one disclose himself to him:
And I am the more confirm'd in not
relying upon these characters, because
in the same Chapter, when he is to
give us an account of so considerable
a Court, he tells us things so very
ridiculous: As that I must go for an
Idea of the <hi>Danish</hi> Court <hi>to some</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<hi>Nobleman,</hi> p. 159. methinks the
<hi>Horse and Foot Guards, and Trabands,
the Kettle Drums the Trumpets, which
are in perfection, and being rang'd in a
large place before the Palace, proclaim
aloud the very minute when he sits down
to Table,</hi> declare to me that there is
some difference. <hi>That few or no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
that have no Employments come
to Court,</hi> p. 159. I can't imagine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men should go, or where they
should sooner pay their attendance,
for the obtaining Preferment, if they
have any hopes, or merits to deserve
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97119:90"/>
it. <hi>That the Kings Children, Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
and Foreign Ministers, Officers of
the Army and Houshold, who appear in
the Anti-chamber and Bed-chamber,
seldom amount to above the number of
twenty or thirty,</hi> p. 159. I cannot
think the number seldom to exceed
thirty, when the Royal Family is so
numerous as to make seven of them;
and methinks Courtesy, Duty or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
at least, might bring four and
twenty more to make above thirty.
<hi>That there is a plentiful Table, but the
Meat is drest after their own manner,</hi>
p. 158. Ridiculous! Is not the King
of <hi>Spain</hi>'s drest after his own manner?
There are abundance more of the
like particulars, which I shall omit,
only this one, where he says, <hi>That
King</hi> Frederick <hi>had once the thoughts
of making the present Count</hi> Guldenlew,
<hi>King of</hi> Norway, <hi>which has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
to his Prejudice,</hi> p. 155. For
it is what was never heard of in <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark;</hi>
nor could that thought have
been consistent with such a Kings
great Wisdom. I must for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
beg the Authors pardon, if I do
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97119:91"/>
not give an entire belief to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;
and the Readers, for my
not giving any of the same persons
my self: But with a very short de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Court conclude this
Chapter.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s great and
royal Qualities make him be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
belov'd by his People; and the
Queen by her goodness, obliges them
to the same affection, and makes her
difference in opinion from them scarce
discernable. <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Prince
Royal, in his late Travels, where-ever
he came appeared accomplished and
very gracious; and at home he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
for having such a temper as
will follow his Father's example, and
pursue his designs for the Ease and
Prosperity of his Subjects. Prince
<hi>Christian</hi> has all the Vigor and Gayety
of Youth; and the two younger
Princes <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> give
great hopes, agreeable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Ages: And the Princess <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
Hederig,</hi> has all that Beauty and
Sweetness, which will one day ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some young Prince happy. The
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97119:91"/>
Ministers of State who compose the
Council, as <hi>Guldenlew, Reventlaw, &amp;c.</hi>
are Persons of Honour and Fidelity
to their Master, by whose advice
affairs are so manag'd, that he has
Love at home, and Honour abroad.
Though the Court has not all that
Luxury, which may be in some more
Southern Climates, yet there is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and a sufficient Grandeur:
Nor is it strange, that a warlike
Prince and Nation should express
their Magnificence by things suitable,
as the Attendance of Horse and Foot
Guards, Kettle-drums and Trumpets;
and consequently that the Kings Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
should be the reviewing of
his Troops, or Hunting in its proper
season, as an exercise becoming a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.
These occasion frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals
of the Court; which can go
no where to a finer place than <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricksborg,</hi>
which, tho it be not built
after the modern Architecture, yet
may be esteemed one of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest
Pallaces in <hi>Europe.</hi> The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
likewise have their Diversions,
not only in the Hunting of Deer and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97119:92"/>
Swans, but the nicer ones of their
Sleds, Musick, Masquerades and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
To encrease the Grandeur
of the Court, the King has two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Knighthood: The first being
that of the Elephant, is given only to
Foreign Princes, or Subjects of the
highest Deserts and Qualities. The
other, which is the Order of <hi>Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
was instituted long ago, <hi>but not
as our Author says, by one King</hi> Dan,
<hi>who saw a White Cross with Red Edges
descend from Heaven, and thereupon
instituted the Order,</hi> p. 178. For King
<hi>Waldemar</hi> II. fighting against the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers</hi>
in the Year 1219, saw, or
pretended to see, this Banner descend
from Heaven, which was followed
by a great Victory; and in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of this, the Order of <hi>Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borg</hi>
was instituted. This was laid
aside a great while, but revived by his
present Majesty. The Knights are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to those of the Elephant; yet
they are both fewer in number, <hi>p.</hi> 179.
and greater in Honour by far than the
Baronets in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:97119:92"/>As to the Rank and Precedency of
all great Officers and other persons,
the Author has given us an Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in <hi>French</hi> concerning it, which
was published in 1680. It is true that
his Account is to represent <hi>Danmark,</hi>
as it stood in 1692. However it is
strange, that so curious and exact a
man should have no correspondence
there from 92 till 94, when his Book
was published; for then he might
have known, that by a new Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
dated 11th of <hi>February,</hi> 1693.
this old Ordonnance of our Authors
is altered in abundance of particulars,
so that he has nine whole Pages of
his Book, that, by his negligence, are
entirely good for nothing.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THis Chapter seems to labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same difficulties with
the former, for as we see the Interests
of Princes are changeable, so are
their <hi>Inclinations;</hi> upon which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I shall leave him to dive into the
Hearts of Men, and the Cabinets of
Princes, and only see whither his
Matter of Fact be absolutely true:
For that being the Foundation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as that appears, we shall be
able to give our opinion of his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure.</p>
               <p>First, As this Author is a mighty
Lover of Seditions within a Kingdom,
so he is of Animosities and Quarrels
without: Therefore his Presage is
very common and often repeated,
That there will be a fresh War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Danmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden:</hi> But on
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97119:93"/>
the contrary, they rather grow great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Friends every day than other, nor
has there been a stricter Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those Crowns than is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
which has been lately renewed
by solemn Treaties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Whenever</hi> (says he) <hi>we
please to caress the one at the expence of
the other, this seeming Knot will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the weakness of the contexture, and
probably dissolve of it self,</hi> p. 192. These
two Princes are not to be suppos'd to
break solemn Oaths and Treaties for
a little interest, that may be proffered
them by <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> And
we saw this last year, when the <hi>Danes</hi>
stopt the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships in the <hi>Sound</hi> the
<hi>Swede,</hi> although never so much ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
could not be prevail'd with to
go off from the King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
or take any other party, but
contributed what he could, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a satisfaction for his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Alliance by the
King of</hi> Sweden's <hi>having married
the others Sister, is not of any moment
towards a good Corresp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97119:94"/>
is not altogether so certain, for this
Queen whilst she lived, was the
greatest Tye between these two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
She was the delight of them both,
and that not without reason, for she
had all the Accomplishments of Piety,
Wisdom, Goodness, and all other
Virtues: So that <hi>Sweden</hi> loves <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
for nothing more than the
having received from thence a
Queen, for whom they had so great

               <p>Fourthly, He wrongs the King of

he showed coldness and indifference
enough t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prince,</hi> ibid. and she <hi>an accomplished
Princess,</hi> ibid. and yet <hi>coldness and
indifference!</hi> What is this but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction?
But the matter of fact is
this, that never a greater Love and
Esteem could be had for a Queen,
than this King had for his; which was
manifest y enough shewn by the deep
Afiliation her Death threw him into,
so that he would scarce admit of
Consolation; and <hi>Sweden</hi> never
heard of such a Sumptuousness and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97119:94"/>
Magnificence, as that wherewith her
Burial was accompanied.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whatever he ominates
concerning the Swedes <hi>avoiding a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Matrimonial Tye with</hi> Danmark,
<hi>p.</hi> 193. Yet it is true, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
report of the World is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a double Marriage between
the Prince Royal of <hi>Danmark,</hi> and
the Princess of <hi>Sweden;</hi> as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Prince Royal of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
and the Princess of <hi>Danmark:</hi> If so,
where is this Gentlemans assurance of
the impossibility of a further Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Tye; or the certainty of
the Prince of <hi>Holstein</hi>'s being contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Princess of <hi>Sweden,</hi> whom
he falsly cal's, <hi>p.</hi> 193. <hi>the only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> this King
having two Princesses living, by the
lately deceased Queen.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, As the Author is pretty
near in guessing, that the King of
<hi>Danmark would not sit down with the
Duke of</hi> Zell's <hi>thrusting himself into
the Dutchy of</hi> Saxe Lawenburg; so
he is out of the way, when he says,
that <hi>the King of</hi> Sweden <hi>would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

the</hi> Lunenburg <hi>Family, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly:</hi>

the King of <hi>Danmark, issue a very

has no more issue than this only Son;

that no body in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
or Provinces, under the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of Life and Goods, should do

<hi>Lutheran;</hi> but every one should so

same time seriously commanding, that
the People should be well informed
in the Doctrine of the Gospel, that
the <hi>Romish</hi> Abuses might be the
sooner extirpated. This he repeated
in the Diet of <hi>Odensee, A. D.</hi> 1527. and
more was not done by this King till
his death, which happen'd, <hi>A.D.</hi> 1533.
saving that he himself adhered to the
Protestant Religion, and favoured
both that and its Preachers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he could in his whole Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But Popery was tolerated
however, nay as yet carried the
Sway, by the great Oppositions and
Power of the Bishops. This appeared
in the Diet which was called upon
the Death of <hi>Frederick,</hi> in which
Diet one of the chief <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Preachers, Mr. <hi>John Tousson,</hi> had
been oppressed by the Power of the
Bishops, if the Citizens of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi>
who adhered firmly to the Protestant
Religion, had not rescued him with

finding great opposition from the
<hi>Popish</hi> Party, with much trouble, and
not without effusion of blood, having
besieged <hi>Copenhagen</hi> a whole year, and
at last forced it to surrender by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
began to <hi>establish</hi> the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
with vigor; for the seven
<hi>Popish</hi> Bishops were suddenly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
and imprisoned by the King,
and after having been publickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Diet</hi> of the Kingdom, accused
and convicted of many enormous
crimes, were all deposed, and seven
other Superintendants, or Protestant
Bishops, afterwards consecrated in
their places The King was crowned
by Dr. <hi>John Bugenhagen,</hi> who had
been a Fellow-Labourer with <hi>Luther</hi>
in the work of the Reformation;
and in the year 1539. in the Diet of
<hi>Odensee,</hi> the last hand was set to the
Reformation, and it was wholly and
universally introduced and settled in
<hi>Danmark,</hi> as it is at this day.</p>
               <p>Now I leave the Reader to judge
of the great Accuracy of our Author,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97119:100"/>
when he says, that Frederick <hi>the First
established</hi> Luther's <hi>Doctrine about</hi> 150
<hi>years ago,</hi> (p. 235.) First, 150 years
ago, <hi>Frederick</hi> the First had been
dead for above nine years, and next
it was his Son <hi>Christian</hi> the Third,
who established the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in the year 1539.</p>
               <p>There is a Union and Harmony of
Religion throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and this our Author says, <hi>p.</hi> 251.
<hi>Cuts off occasion of Rebellion and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny.</hi>
'Tis very reasonable it should!
and a sign that the Clergy do their
duty in preaching such due obedience
as the Gospel enjoyns; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
show their sence of Religion in
being directed by them: not that
<hi>the Priests depend entirely upon the
Crown,</hi> as this Author intimates, <hi>p.</hi> 251.
any more than the rest of the King of
<hi>Danmark</hi>'s Subjects; nor the People <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
governed by the Priests,</hi> ibid. with
a blind obedience, any further than
Scripture and Reason obliges them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Clergy have full Scope given
them to be as bigotted as they please,</hi> ib.
I know not what he means by their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97119:101"/>
being bigotted, unless it is, that they
are zealous in teaching their People
the Doctrines of Salvation, and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vice and Scandal in their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Churches, as they ought to be;
perhaps this Author would not have
them trouble their heads much about
Religion, nor be zealous for any one
in particular; but content themselves
with an <hi>idle Despondency,</hi> and scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
concerning all.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the Clergy have no common
Charity for any that differ from them in
opinion, except the Church of</hi> England,
(<hi>p.</hi> 251.) is a proposition very boldly
advanced, against a body of men, in
whom Charity ought always to be
conspicuous; and for a Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Charge, they appeal to
those numerous <hi>French</hi> Protestants
who have fled to them for Relief,
to whom at present they allow a
Church for their publick Worship,
though there has been no example
before, since the Reformation, and
the Law is directly against it. They
confess that they cannot joyn in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them, because they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97119:101"/>
as to the real Presence in the
Sacrament, and in the point of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Predestination, which they
take to be essential; for 'tis the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Reprobation, which has
been the greatest stumbling block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> but
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> seeing the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
both in that particular, and in the
other of the Real Presence, they have
always had a great veneration for it,
and could be very desirous, that
their Doctrines, especially that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Sacrament, were but
rightly understood, so as to come to
a Union with it; for 'tis a general
mistake in <hi>England,</hi> to call the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Protestants
concerning the Sacrament, <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
p. 252. for no such word
is used amongst them; their notion
amounts to this, that they believe
stedfastly a real and true Presence of
the Body and Blood of Christ in the
Sacrament, in a manner ineffable,
which our Saviour himself is best able
both to know and do; whereas
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97119:102"/>
                  <hi>Consubst antiation</hi> would imply some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more natural and material.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did Princes think it worth their
while to promote this Union,</hi> our Author
<hi>is confident,</hi> p. 252. <hi>that the business
of</hi> Consubstantiation <hi>would make no
difference.</hi> It would be of wonderful
consequence, if Princes should really
promote this Union between Churches
so considerable; and no better work
could be performed in this turbulent
and divided State of the Church of
Christ: For who knows but this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might draw another of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
after it, between all the rest
who call themselves <hi>Protestants,</hi> and
those more strictly so, <hi>viz.</hi> of the
Confession of <hi>Ansburg,</hi> who first gave
us that name, which we so much glory
in; and what a fatal blow this would
be to <hi>Popery,</hi> any rational man will
easily imagine.</p>
               <p>For the Church of <hi>Danmark</hi> is far

and has a resisting Principle.</hi> They will
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97119:102"/>
confess they do not like his <hi>resisting
Principle,</hi> and this makes a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between them. However, they
think it not agreeable to common
Charity, to <hi>hate</hi> either <hi>Calvinist</hi> or
<hi>Papist:</hi> As to their Errors, they think
the <hi>Papists</hi> to have several that are
fundamental, and more in number
than the <hi>Calvinist</hi> whom they have a
respect for, as having jointly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against the Antichrist of
<hi>Rome.</hi> The Church of <hi>Danmark</hi>
think themselves likewise wrong'd,
when he says, <hi>p. 253. That they keep
the Mob in awe by Confession, which
they retain of the Romish Church, as
well as Crucifixes and other Ceremonies.</hi>
For their Confession is far from the
<hi>Auricular Confession,</hi> and Enumeration
of all sins made by the <hi>Papists:</hi> For
they retain only that Confession us'd
in the Primitive Church, and which
other Protestants wish for: For by
that, the Minister can excite and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
the Communicants to a right Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence;
and there, as our Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Communion tells us of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> The Penitent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97119:103"/>
                  <hi>may open his grief to a discreet and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Minister of God's word, that he
may receive the benefit of Absolution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Ghostly Councel and advice,
to the quieting of his Conscience, and
avoiding of all scruple and doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
In like manner the <hi>Danes</hi> have
<hi>Crucifixes,</hi> and other Historical Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
out of the Bible in their
Churches, but they are far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any idol <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ous or superstitious
use of them. They use them as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
and Remembrances only; nor
do they think, because a Papist adores
a Crucifix, that a <hi>Lutheran</hi> must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
be so afraid of one as not to
endure to look upon it. So likewise
is it to be understood of the other
Ceremonies, which they have kept,
not <hi>from the Romish Church,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Ceremonies which the <hi>Romish</hi>
Church have abused, they have made
a right use of, and are here in the
same case with the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He says, <hi>that the Splendor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>are
the principal Virtues they admire in us,</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:97119:103"/>
p. 252. The Church of <hi>England</hi> has
lost so much of its Revenues, as
that it is not at present to be envied
for them. Besides, I never found
<hi>Splendor</hi> or <hi>Revenues</hi> recounted as
Virtues in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Ethicks. But I
have found <hi>Prudence, Fortitude,</hi> &amp;c.
among the Virtues, and for these the
<hi>Danish</hi> Church may admire it; but
more especially for its purity in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and its well ordered Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Discipline.</p>
               <p>It is true that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has better Revenues than that
of <hi>Danmark,</hi> for at the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the King and States laid almost
all the Ecclesiastical Revenues to the
Crown, which at that very time <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
complain'd of to King <hi>Christian</hi>
the Third. However, the Ecclesiasticks
in <hi>Danmark</hi> are in no low condition,
for they live very well, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
as any Gentleman can define.
Every Minister lives in his Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish, and
has one, two, three or more neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Churches under his Care,
which if he cannot take care of alone,
he does it by one, or more Assistants,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97119:104"/>
call'd Chaplains, which resemble our
<hi>English</hi> Deacons. He tells us, <hi>p. 251.
That the Clergy are entirely dependant
upon the Crown,</hi> as if their Salary was
wholly given them by the King. But
afterwards it seems, <hi>p.</hi> 252 and 253.
<hi>The best subsistance of the Priests, is
the voluntary Benevolence of the Mob.</hi>
So that their <hi>flattery of the Court,</hi> p.
252. ought, if this were true, to be
turned into a <hi>Flattery</hi> of the <hi>Mob,</hi>
whose <hi>Vices</hi> notwithstanding, <hi>as well
as those of Persons of the highest Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
they reprehend with great freedom;</hi>
Ibid. And yet their <hi>Churches are much
frequented,</hi> p. 91. As to the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Ministers in <hi>Danmark,</hi>
it is partly certain, as Tithes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as in <hi>England,</hi> partly uncertain, as
Offerings at the three great Festivals
in the Year; Marriages, Burials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and they are very liberally provided
for, without <hi>cultivating the Mobs good
Opinion,</hi> p. 253.</p>
               <p>As the Inferior Clergy are thus
provided for, so are the Superior,
such as the Bishops, Professors of
Divinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a greater degree.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97119:104"/>
Concerning these he tells us, <hi>p 153.
That there are Six Superintendants in</hi>
Danmark, <hi>who take it very kindly to
be call'd Bishops, and my Lord,</hi> viz.
<hi>One in</hi> Sealand, <hi>One in</hi> Funen, <hi>Four
in</hi> Jutland, <hi>and Four in</hi> Norway.
<hi>These have no Temporalities, keep no
Ecclesiastical Courts, have no Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals
with Prebends,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but are only</hi>
Primi inter pares; <hi>having the rank
above the inferior Clergy of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
1. When he enumerated the
Bishops, he might have mentioned
those two more who were in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>nd.</hi>
2. That the <hi>Danish</hi> Bishops should
take it kindly to be called <hi>My Lord,</hi>
is a very curious remark, they have
not so often occasion to converse
with <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and the <hi>Danish</hi>
Tongue has no word that properly
answers to the <hi>English</hi> words, <hi>My
Lord.</hi> Then they have no reason to
refuse being called <hi>Bishops,</hi> since the
King calls them so in the <hi>Danish</hi> Law,
and they have all Episcopal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
It is true that in <hi>Danmark</hi> at
the Reformation, none of the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pish</hi>
Bishops (as many in <hi>Sweden</hi> did)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97119:105"/>
would embrace it; but all, because
of their errors, were deposed, and
then the new Superintendents, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Luthers</hi> institution in
<hi>Germany,</hi> were ordained by Dr. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genhagen,</hi>
from <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> And they
did, as their Successors at present do,
use and exercise in ecclesiastical things
the same Power and Jurisdiction,
that any Bishop does in <hi>England</hi> or
<hi>Sweden.</hi> 3. If by <hi>Temporalities</hi> he
means <hi>Baronies,</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> Bishops have
none of them. But that they have <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Courts</hi> is certain, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
has before been given of them.
4. Though Canons, Prebends and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,
are not as in <hi>England,</hi> yet in each
Cathedral Church (for such there is in
every Diocese) the Bishop has four, five,
or more of the chief Clergy for his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
in the Chapter, and they are
called <hi>Canonici,</hi> or <hi>Capitulares.</hi> 5. In
Honour the Bishops may be only <hi>Primi
inter pares,</hi> but in Jurisdiction there
is a very great Subordination, so far
as to suspend and depose, which
sets them far beyond an Equality.
6. That <hi>most of these understand</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
<hi>and draw the very best of their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97119:105"/>
Divinity out of</hi> English <hi>Books; and
those who have studied in</hi> Oxford <hi>are
more valued than others,</hi> p. 254. are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
that savour a little of vanity.
They do indeed esteem our Divines,
and especially their Sermons; but the
way to be respected more by them, is
not to value our selves too much.</p>
               <p>As to their <hi>Learning</hi> he says, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it <hi>is there at a very low ebb.</hi> But to
show the contrary, I shall name some
of those great men in all Sciences,
which have been eminent for their
Learning, and name some of those
who preserve the succession. In Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
who in the learned world does
not know <hi>Hemmingius, Resenius</hi> both
Father and Son, <hi>Brochmand, Winstrup,
Swaningius, Wandalinus</hi> the Elder, <hi>Bage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
Noldius, Bircherodius,</hi> &amp;c. In Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
who are more famous than <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Bartholinus, Joh. Rhodius</hi> so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
in <hi>Italy, Nic. Stenonius</hi> the
great Anatomist, <hi>Simon Paulli</hi> no less
an Herbalist, <hi>Olaus</hi> and <hi>Wilhelmus Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>
and <hi>Borrichius,</hi> who was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for his Chymistry. In the Law, there
have been eminent men, as <hi>Petrus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius,
Cosmus Bornemand, Claudius Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97119:106"/>
&amp;c.</hi> As to the Mathematicks, <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
Brahe</hi> was followed very success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
by his Scholar <hi>Longomontanus</hi> and
<hi>Geo. Hilarius, &amp;c.</hi> In Philosophy and
Philology, few have excell'd the great
<hi>Borrichius,</hi> and besides him <hi>Bartholus
Bartholinus, Arnoldus Rhumannus</hi> and
others; nor does <hi>Danmark</hi> want Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
as <hi>Wormius, Petrus Resenius, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Beringius, Claudius, Lyscander,</hi> and
the lately deceased young Gentleman
<hi>Thomas Bartholinus.</hi> As for Poetry, it
began in the <hi>Danish</hi> Language with the
Proverbial Rhimes of <hi>Lollius,</hi> and the
Satyrs of <hi>Scanus,</hi> and the Eclogues of
<hi>Virgil,</hi> turn'd into the <hi>Danish</hi> Language
by <hi>Petrus Parous Ripensis,</hi> and by the
Translation of the Psalms of <hi>Du Bartas</hi>
by <hi>Christianus Arreboe;</hi> but its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
encreased with the Rules given
by <hi>Corvinus</hi> in his <hi>Heptachordum,</hi> and
his <hi>Rythmologia Danica;</hi> by <hi>Severinus
Pauli Gothlandus</hi> in his <hi>Prosodia Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacula,</hi>
and several other Authors. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verinus
Torchillius</hi> with the beauty and
sweetness of his stile, advanced this
improvement; whereas <hi>Bording</hi> did
the same by his strength and majesty,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97119:106"/>
and <hi>Johannes Wilhelmus</hi> as much with his
<hi>Hexameron,</hi> in which there appeared
a decent and becoming gravity: These
were followed by <hi>Kingo, Sehested,
Matthias Wormius, Andreas Claudianus,
Lundius, Gernerus</hi> and others, whose
works may promise them Fame and
Immortality. The Ladies come in
likewise for their share in this glory,
<hi>Tycho Brahe</hi>'s Sister, and especially <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothea
Engelbrechtia,</hi> may contend with
the famous Poetresses of the Ancients.
The Lady <hi>Brigitta Tot</hi> has translated
<hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher into the <hi>Danish</hi>
Tongue, with all the Elegancy any
Language is capable of; to show, that
the ruggidest Philosophy of the Stoicks
must submit, when the Fair Sex is
pleased to conquer. It would be too
tedious to enumerate all the <hi>Danish</hi>
Poets, who have writ from <hi>Hiarne</hi> and
<hi>Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> down to this time.
<hi>Borrichius</hi> has done it, and given their
Characters in a very pretty dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and <hi>Fredericus Rostgaard,</hi> an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
young Gentleman, has made a
Collection of six of them, printed in
2 <hi>Duodecimo</hi> Volumes in <hi>Leyden,</hi> in 1693.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97119:107"/>
                  <hi>Albertius Hopnerus,</hi> and <hi>Aagardus,</hi> have
their beauties, but <hi>Vitus Beringius</hi> has
a peculiar easiness, and his Masque of
the Rape of the <hi>Sabins,</hi> writ in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sorts of <hi>Latin</hi> Verse, has much vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and must have given great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the representation of it. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi>
at writing Epigrams has a great
Quickness of Wit; and the <hi>English,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom he liv'd some years, are
particularly oblig'd to him for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Verses, made in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Language. As for <hi>Borri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>
it is enough to say, that his
Poetry equals his other performances.</p>
               <p>There are still living and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Danmark Wandalinus</hi> the Son,
<hi>Masius, Caspar Bartholinus, Oligerus</hi>
and <hi>Janus Jacobaeus, Olaus Romerus,
Paul Vindingius, John Brunsmannus,</hi>
and many others, who deserve no
less praise than the deceased if their
Modesty would permit it to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them.</p>
               <p>Their Learning is preserved and
cultivated among them, by their
Publick Examinations, Disputations
and Lectures in all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97119:107"/>
And their want of Printed
Translations, shows their very great
improvement, for the <hi>Danes</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
understanding <hi>Latin, English,
French, Italian,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
have no occasion for them,
and yet in the publick Library there
are abundance of Translations of all
sorts, of both Antient and Modern
Authors. Printing is indeed much
dearer than in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi>
which is the reason why the <hi>Atlas Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
of <hi>Petrus Resenius</hi> lies fairly
written in the Library; the Nobility
and Gentry have likewise their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baries
in very good order, and there
is nothing that I can find wanting, but
<hi>Satyrical Pamphlets,</hi> and <hi>Seditious Libels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author says, <hi>there is no invention
here, or tolerable imitation of what is
brought in to them by Strangers,</hi> p. 255.
But I cannot believe it, when I hear
that <hi>Thom. Bartholinus</hi> has found the
<hi>Vasa Lymphatica,</hi> as his Son <hi>Caspar</hi> still
living, has done one <hi>Ductus Salivalis,</hi>
and <hi>Borrichius,</hi> found several new
ways in Chymistry: That the round
Steeple of <hi>Longomontanus,</hi> is a great
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97119:108"/>
piece of Ingenuity and Architecture,
as likewise the <hi>Bremer Holm,</hi> and the
great work on <hi>Christians-haven.</hi> We
have several Ornaments of the City
of <hi>London,</hi> carv'd by a <hi>Danish</hi> Master.
And whosoever will not believe their
skill in Musick, may be convinc'd of the
contrary by the Harp of <hi>Signior Arnoldo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what need I speak far ther
of the <hi>Danes,</hi> the very <hi>Islanders,</hi>
whose Country was the <hi>Thule</hi> of the
Ancients, are not without their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Their <hi>Law-Book</hi> in their own
Language, has several things conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the great wisdom of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Laws, as <hi>Angrimus</hi> tells us, <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nung:
Sagurne</hi> contains their History.
<hi>Edda</hi> and <hi>Scalda</hi> gives an account of
their antient Philosophy and Poetry,
shows the Art and Fable of the one,
and the Misery of the other. They
have likewise Chronology from 740
to 1295. Nor are they wanting in
the more refin'd Arts of Poetry and
Comedy, as may appear by the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Eroticam,</hi> and the Verses made in
the <hi>Islandish</hi> Tongue, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Century, upon <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97119:108"/>
Friis</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>Danmark.
Runolphus Jonas</hi> having studied the
<hi>Islandish</hi> Language, found it so full,
proper, and expressive of the <hi>Latin,</hi>
especially the Thoughts and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> that he
thought himself bound in justice to
compose a Grammar for the more
easy attaining of it, which he print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and has been since reprinted at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> with Dr <hi>Hicks's Saxon</hi> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.
But to go yet farther, even
<hi>Greenland</hi> has its Annals; and the
parts which are farthest North are
not without some pretensions to the
<hi>Belles Lettres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he comes to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> he compares it,
p. 253. with these of <hi>England,</hi> which
may exceed it; however in respect of
other foreign Universities it yields to
few, either for its Buildings, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
or Students. The Auditories, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and other Edifices belonging
to this University, are as good and
substantial as any Houses, except the
Palaces in <hi>Copenhagen;</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
have fine and convenient
Houses allotted for their Residence.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97119:109"/>
The Revenues likewise are considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
both for the maintaining of Scholars
that study at home, or travel abroad.
There are several Colleges as that call'd
<hi>Collegium Regium</hi> built by King <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
IV. where a hundred Students have
their Lodgings, to which belongs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
house call'd <hi>Communitas Regia,</hi>
where as many have their diet, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their meals have frequent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.</p>
               <p>There is also <hi>Collegium Walkendorp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum</hi>
founded by a <hi>Danish</hi> Nobleman,
and <hi>Collegium Medicaeum</hi> founded by
Dr. <hi>Borrichius,</hi> splendidly endowed
for sixteen Fellows in each of them.
There are several Exhibitions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for Scholars, some to reside and
some to travel, which they call <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendia,</hi>
as <hi>Stipendium Frisianum, Scheeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum,
Winstrupianum, Hopnerianum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>With these Assistances the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
flourishes, and it receives encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
from his Majesty, who was
particularly pleased to be present at an
Act performed upon his Birth day, in
the year, (91) when the <hi>Rector,</hi> Dr <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerus
Jacobaeus,</hi> made him a Speech to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97119:109"/>
thank him; for some favours conferr'd
upon the University. For since <hi>Pliny</hi>
and <hi>Pacatus</hi> his time Panegyricks have
been thought due to good Princes, and
if a King will do great things, he must
pardon his Subjects when gratitude
makes them eloquent in the relation
of them.</p>
               <p>There was formerly another Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
at <hi>Sora;</hi> but, p. 256. <hi>The King had
occasion for its Revenues, and in its stead
there is only a small Grammar School
erected.</hi> It was ruined by the <hi>Swedes</hi> in
the late Wars, and pillaged of its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries,
and all things else that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to it; so that the King of
<hi>Danmark</hi> has thought fit to let it be a
School only, and in its room has erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Academy in <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> where
young Gentlemen and Persons of
Quality learn Riding and several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
as well as other Sciences. This
has its Professors, and was solemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated
upon the Kings Birth day,
in 1692.</p>
               <p>The Provisions for the poor are
regular and considerable. Hospitals
there are in every City very good and
sufficient; nor shall he show many
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97119:110"/>
examples of such as have been divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to other <hi>Uses,</hi> p. 257. and especially
<hi>not publick ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author concludes this Chapter
with a very great Encomium of the
<hi>Danish</hi> People, <hi>p. 257 where every one
keeps the ordinary beaten road of sence,
and you see no Madmen, natural Fools,
fanciful Folks or Enthusiasts;</hi> for these
are the People that generally create
uneasiness and disturbances; and I will
assure the Author, that ever since I first
read his Book, when I have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with a <hi>fanciful Fool,</hi> that I could
not in good manners get rid of, I have
often wish'd my self in <hi>Danmark.</hi>

               <p>Popery has this to say for it self,
<hi>That it is not the only Religion that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

Slavery; for he is perswaded

                  </gap>. Besides Popery has a farther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97119:110"/>
Plea, <hi>That King</hi> James's <hi>attempt to bring
it into</hi> England <hi>was the principal thing,
which rescued our Liberties from being
swallowed up,</hi> p. 259. But the third thing
excellent in it is, <hi>because the dependance
which the</hi> Romish <hi>Clergy have on the Church
of</hi> Rome <hi>causes often a clashing of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
and derogates from the entire Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the Subject owes to the Prince,</hi> p. 260.
So that whereas he says, <hi>p. 136. Popery
has been the Darling of many Monarchs,
upon the account of introducing Slavery:</hi>
It is this Authors Darling because it
raises <hi>Wars and Tumults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> is put next into the Scale with
<hi>Danmark,</hi> and made to outweigh it,
because <hi>that Kings Subjects are better
treated, and there is a</hi> Name of <hi>a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
at</hi> Paris, <hi>and a formal demand of
a Benevolence, which they have not the
power to deny,</hi> p. 261. But the true reason
is, <hi>because the King of</hi> France, <hi>having quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
with the Court of</hi> Rome, his <hi>Clergy
(if he were reduced to a lower Ebb) might
produce divisions and disturbances,</hi> ib. So
in this Authors opinion, <hi>France</hi> is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
than <hi>Danmark,</hi> because there is
greater probability that it may lie
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97119:111"/>
under the misfortunes of a Civil War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then comes</hi> Turky, <hi>which has suffer'd
by some Writers, but he says, will
scarce seem to deserve it, if compared
with</hi> Danmark; for the <hi>Turks</hi> have
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

name of a Proprietor without a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
subsistance, he leaves the Reader to
judge, <hi>p. 262. The</hi> Alcoran <hi>or</hi> Turkish
<hi>Law declares the barbarous right
which our Author mentions in these
words:</hi> When you meet with Infidels
cut off their heads, kill them, take them
Prisoners, bind them, till either you think
fit to give them Liberty, or they pay their
Ransom. <hi>Sir</hi> Paul Rycaut <hi>is an</hi> Author <hi>of
credit, who</hi> describes to us that sort of
toleration <hi>which the</hi> Turks <hi>give the</hi>
Christian <hi>Religion:</hi> They know they
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97119:111"/>
cannot force Mens Wills and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
nor captivate their Minds as well
as Bodies: But what means may be
used to render them contemptible, to
make 'em poor, their Lives uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and the Interest of their Religion
weak and despicable, are practised with
divers Arts and Tyranny; their tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christianity is rather to afflict
and persecute it, than any grant of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and dispensation. <hi>The Grand
Seignior may take their Estates from
them if he pleases whilst they live;
and all People know, there is no
such thing, as Inheritance of Land in</hi>
Turky, <hi>at their Death. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reader judge, what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
would not rather live in</hi> Turky,
<hi>than enjoy the free use of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion, and have his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

and Heirs, as he may do in</hi> Danmark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Children are indeed in</hi> Turky <hi>forced
away from their poor Christian Parents,</hi>
but says the Author, <hi>it is for their
worldly profit, and so bating the point
of Religion, it is a far less mischief, to
deprive Parents of their Children,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97119:112"/>
than to leave a charge upon their
hands, after having taken away the
possibility of nourishing and educating
them,</hi> p. 263. I profess upon reading
this Paragraph, I enquired how many
Children were starved every week in
<hi>Copenhagen;</hi> and whither there were
not greater quantities that died for
want throughout all <hi>Sealand;</hi> I ask'd
whither there were not abundance of
famish'd Infants, that their Parents
would be glad to part with for Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons,
upon reasonable terms: But
being resolv'd, that there was Pap
and Milk-porridge, and the like, in
those places; and that the Children
when they cried, had as much Bread
and Butter as is usual in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
I resolv'd with my self, that
my Children should rather go to
<hi>Danmark,</hi> with all its inconveniencies,
than be circumcised or made Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs,
upon the hopes of coming one
day to be Caimacan, or Grand Visier.
I wonder most, how our Author ever
came to like <hi>Turky,</hi> since I do not
find, that he has any hopes or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
from the <hi>Mufti,</hi> that any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97119:112"/>
shall be raised there spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the grand Query,
<hi>Whither matters are like to last at the
same rate they are now at, in</hi> Danmark?
<hi>p.</hi> 264. Our Author would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have it resolv'd in the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
and gives important reasons
why it should be so: And more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
why it should not be so.
Let us see his self-encounter at <hi>pro</hi>
and <hi>con,</hi> and the mighty tumults and
bustles raised in our Authors <hi>fallacious
Judgment,</hi> p. 264.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That natural Love of Liberty,
eminent in the antient</hi> Goths <hi>and</hi> Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
<hi>perswade, him to think of a change,</hi> ib.
But alas the Love of Liberty [which
was that of Knight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rrantry, and
Rambling to seek their Fortunes in
foreign Countries] being now quite
extinct in the North, they find suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
conveniencies at home, where
Obedience to their Prince secures
their Ease, and is preferr'd by them,
before <hi>those brisk Traverses</hi> (as he
calls them) which <hi>commotions would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,</hi>
p. 267. So Love of Liberty might
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97119:113"/>
do something, but that Duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.
Well, but again, <hi>may not the
freshness and newness of this alteration
of their condition, produce an alteration
in the Government?</hi> p. 265. Why,
truly no, because he finds it to have
little or no influence upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are wonderfully well pleas'd
both with one and t'other. So that
if the Father should propose any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of change to his Son, <hi>he would
not be heard by him with patience,</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 268.
Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> however to try again: <hi>What
should hinder the</hi> Swedes, <hi>who have
their Eye upon</hi> Danmark <hi>from introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Liberty?</hi> p. 266. Why truly they
<hi>use their own Subjects so ill, and there is
such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t hatred betwixt these two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that the</hi> Danes <hi>are resolv'd to
keep them out as long as they are able,</hi>
p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8. The last hope then <hi>is in the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merousness
of the Royal Family, for there
being four Princes it will be rare if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
be maintained among them all,</hi> p. 266.
And thence something in favour of
Liberty might arise. 'Tis a thousand
pities that matters should not be
brought to this pass: But such is the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97119:113"/>
Wickedness of this cursed Soil, <hi>that
those Jealousies, which use to reign in the
Families of Princes, are not so common
nor fatal in these parts, as elsewhere,</hi> p.
270. Besides there is a terrible thing,
<hi>call'd Unity of Religion,</hi> p. 268.
which spoils all manner of hopes,
<hi>and cuts away the very root of Sedition.</hi>
So then the sum of the grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
amounts to this, That the
Government of <hi>Danmark</hi> might be
shaken, were it not supported by a
firm security from foreign attempts,
by a mutual concord in the Royal
Family; by the Ease, Content, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and Religion of the Subject; in
a word, by all the Blessings and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which make Governments <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi>
and consequently will render this
of <hi>Danmark fixt and durable.</hi> Since
nothing hitherto will do the work,
what if this Author could get his
<hi>Account</hi> translated into the <hi>Danish</hi>
Tongue, might not that, when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht,
<hi>have so blessed an effect,</hi> as to
occasion a change, not only in <hi>their
Condition, but also in their Masters?</hi> Why
truly whatever his aim may have been
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97119:114"/>
nearer home, and though it has
been printed in <hi>English,</hi> yet he has not
perswaded his Countrymen to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
an alteration in either of
theirs. So that if the present State of
both Kingdoms be <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>durable,</hi>
then his Book (poor Gentleman!) has
lost its design, and he his labour.</p>
