            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PAſſing the ſtreet in a melancholy muſe,
my thoughts were ſuddenly diſturbed
with the obſtreperous clamours of a

curious to know what the import of this ſtrange
title was, concluding the Author of it to be ſome
Sexſtone or City Dog-whipper, I called after the
poor Itinerant bookſeller, who very joyfully came,
but yet very ſadly complaining that ſhe had ſold
never a book that day; I partly out of charity to
the poor book Pedler, partly to ſatisfie my own cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
gave her four farthings for her four ſmart
ſcourges, concluding, that though they were good

writing a Letter to the ingenious Gentleman

I muſt needs be acquainted with the ſmart ſcourger

in your Pamphlet. And firſt I cannot but obſerve
your envy at the Dr. being new vamped with a
Coat of Arms, to wit, the three Boars heads: well
Goodman Cobler, ſince you have ſuch good skill
in vamping, by my conſent we will have you
vamped, or at leaſt under lined with a Coat of
Arms too, and if you will be adviſed by me, inſtead
of the three Bores-heads take the three Aſſes-heads,
for upon my Soul they will be pretty Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks
of that bleſſed noddle of yours; but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth

bought, begged, or ſtolen; well Gaffer Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
hadſt thou been as little concerned in the
Skinners 975 <hi>l.</hi> the man perhaps had never dyed of
a cheat, but of that—In the beginning of your
Epiſtolary Diſcourſe, you accuſe the Dr. of being
a Tailer, and of ſtitching up of many Diſeaſes all
curable by his trifle; if this had been true, I have
heard of greater Metamorphoſes than this; did
you never hear of a man that dedicated a book to
<hi>Titchburn,</hi> and afterwards becauſe he called him
Fool for his pains, or perhaps would not give
him a crown for his dedication, became an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſuter to the two Royal Dukes, beſeeching
them to hang him out of the way with the reſt

but at the laſt after much thruſt and ſhuffling you

but in ſpite of the Muſes you will profeſs your ſell
a Scholar; in good faith Sir I think your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is Heterodox, and that your enemies are ſo far
from giving you that honour, that the beſt of
your friends cannot but pity your ignorance; as for
the falſe Latin you reproach the Author withall,
ſome concluding your ſelf to be the corrector of
the Preſs, have ſhrewdly ſuſpected it to be a ſlip
of your own pen, and that ſo like an Ape view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the ſole cauſe of all thoſe Errataes, and yet the

Well <hi>George</hi> on Horſe-back thou mayſt ſit

you never took notice how often you your ſelf
doe wrack and torter the diſſylable Botcher, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you lay ſuch an Emphaſis. Could you find no
ſynonimon nor Paraphraſis for botcher that you

once more let me put thee in mind of an <hi>adage, turpe

you mean by re-ſeething of Coleworts in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
I confeſs I know not, unleſs all things you
meet withall by your hungry ſtomack be miſtaken
for a Pottage-pot, and if ſo, I marvail why you are
ſo angry with our Author for ſeething Coleworts
in his Epiſtle, alas good man he doth it out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to ſave you the charges of buying Butter and
Cheeſe; but you quarrel at him Sir for the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Epiſtle; and think he would have made
a longer prayer if he had been upon the Gallows;
it may be ſo, and yet I can aſſure you he is no Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſee,

the Analogy good for all that, ſaying, a Venereal
fire being kindled, though it fixt his
Teſticles,<note place="margin">Of French faggots.</note> yet it volatized the ſinuous
parts, and then by Sublimation carried
them to his Head, from whence ſprung his Ears,
which have ſerved this learned Aſs as Feſcues for

vexing the Drs. patience, tis very pretty, (I ſee a
Fools bolt is ſoon ſhot) I never ſaw yet a wiſe

            <p>SInce the writing of this diſcourſe, I met with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
acquaintance of the Doctors, and now his very
near neighbour, of whom I deſired an impartial account
of the Doctors life, paſt, and preſent; who anſwered,
that his acquaintance with him, had not been above 28.
or 29. years, and that then he was a Merchant in
Hoſe, and other commodities, maintaining the beſt part
of a 1000. people in imployment, and beyond Sea four
Factors, and that he married the widow of Mr. <hi>Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
by whom he had the beſt part of two thouſand pound.
I then inquired whether he was taught Chemiſtry by
<hi>Moulton</hi> in <hi>Hog-lane,</hi> he ſaid no, but the Dr. was
acquainted with him in Germany, and gave him three
Secrets for the receipt of one; for the Dr. had ſpent in
Chemiſtry many pounds before he was acquainted with
him; yet the Dr. he ſayd had taught ſome of the greateſt
perſons in the world both for Nobilite and Learning, who
counted it no diſhonour to learn of ſo Induſtrious and
Ingenious a Spagyrick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I then inquired whether he had
not lately been reduc'd to poverty, he ſaid no, for he had
lived in that Pariſh the beſt part of twenty years, and
that ever ſince he had given thirty two ſhillings a moneth
where he ſaw need; having within this three or four
years ſold thirty pounds a year, not regarding worldly
treaſure; but the more he hath ſlighted it, the more God
hath bleſt him, and given him a ſufficiency to purchaſe
an earthly inheritance, but he ſaid he was ſtrangely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to all earthly purchaſes, minding much more to do
the errant for which he was ſent, having an eye at the
recompence of reward, which is to have a dwelling in
that City whoſe builder and maker is God. The reaſon
of this diſcourſe being added here, is to let the world
know that <hi>George</hi> is not only given over to believe lyes,
but alſo to write them.</p>
