         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I first design'd
to Print these Papers,
I was prompted to dedicate
them to you upon two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
Considerations; First,
a desire I ever had of giving
you a publick Assurance of
the Love and Respect I have
for you, and your noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
and Secondly, the
<pb facs="tcp:97015:3"/>
ageeableness of the Subject
of this Book to the main
end of your Education. It
signifies little for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to learn <hi>French</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
unless, at the same time,
he furnish his Memory with
some more profitable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for <hi>Languages,</hi> if not
accompanied with <hi>things,</hi>
serve generally to no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
purpose, than to multiply
natural Nonsense, and expose
Ignorance in many different
shapes. As for Knowledge
that, is undoubtedly most
useful and necessary wherein
<pb facs="tcp:97015:3"/>
all Mankind is agreed: I
mean, the searching of our
own selves toward the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of our Manners, and
the forming of an Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and virtuous Life. And
therefore I thought I could
not do better, than to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to your care and study,
the following Characters of
<hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices;</hi> the first, as
a Pattern, which you ought
to propose to your Imitation;
and the others, as Sea-marks
which may serve to teach
you to avoid those Rocks and
Sands, against which so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:97015:4"/>
suffer daily Shipwrack
both in their Fortunes and
Reputation.</p>
            <p>And now if I design'd to
follow the common drift of
Dedications, I had a fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to expatiate in a
Panegyrical Field: But I shall
wave so nice a Subject; for if
I should say all that I am
conscious you deserve, either
upon the score of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Virtues, or the early
progress you have made in
your Studies, I fear it would
be interpreted Flattery or
Presumption, instead of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<pb facs="tcp:97015:4"/>
yet I cannot forbear tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World, that I am the
more encourag'd to make
this Address, because I see
that what I would advise, is,
in a great measure, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd,
since it is most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
begun: For I find in
you an admirable goodness
and tenderness of Nature, and
the Seeds of all generous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
which being fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and kept up by the
good Examples hereditary in
your Family, will ripen in
due time into glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Habits, to qualifie
you for the Service and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
<pb facs="tcp:97015:5"/>
of your Country
and the Honour and comfort
of your Noble Parents and
Relations: which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and sincere Wish of,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER</head>
            <p>THis Preface is merely to comply
with that imperious Mistres,
<hi>Custom:</hi> For, to speak the truth, I
have but little to say upon the common
Theme of <hi>general Dedications,</hi> I
mean the Commendation or Vindication
of this Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not but that I could
stuff five or six Pages with the Pageant
of a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> upon these <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and rifle both Art and <hi>Nature</hi>
to adorn the matter with all the gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Smiles of Pearls, Diamonds, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
Cordials, Varieties of Dishes and
<pb facs="tcp:97015:6"/>
I know not what; but all this would
be no more in the conclusion, than to
enlarge upon trivial and impertinent
<hi>Formalities,</hi> as troublesom to me, as
unprofitable to the <hi>Reader.</hi> He may
rest contented to know that he is here
presented with an <hi>Abstract</hi> of the most
exquisite <hi>Thoughts</hi> upon <hi>Men</hi> and
<hi>Manners,</hi> of those modern <hi>Wits</hi> both
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> whose bare Name
(as you have it in the Title Page)
is sufficient to recommend them to any
Man, that is not altogether a Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the Commonwealth of Learning,
and whose Authority is able to protect
them against the severest Criticks.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it will not be amiss here
to speak something of that part of this
Composition which I may call my own,
that is, the Translation of the <hi>French</hi>
Thoughts, and the Method I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd
in the <hi>Whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97015:6"/>
As for the first, it is superfluous to
acquaint the Publick, with all the
difficulties I have labour'd under in
my Vndertaking. The Authors, whose
Thoughts I have proposed to my self
to translate, are so sublime and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
and their Language every
where so close and comprehensive, and
yet so polite and unaffected, that it
was no easy matter to make them speak
<hi>English.</hi> All that I can say for my
self in this Particular, is, that as I
made this Collection principally for the
<hi>Gentleman</hi> to whom it is dedicated,
and my own use, so I have spar'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Time nor Pains to render the
meaning of my Originals, if not so
gracefully as it is in <hi>French,</hi> yet so as
to be understood.</p>
            <p>As for the Disposition of so many
different Reflections, I have observ'd
that, which is undoubtedly the most
<pb facs="tcp:97015:7"/>
helpful to one's Memory, that is, I
have gathered into one Chapter all
those I have found belonging to the
same subject; I have distributed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Chapters according to the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betick
Order; And to distinguish the
Thoughts of our <hi>English</hi> Authors from
those of the <hi>French,</hi> I have mark'd the
former with an <hi>Asterism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this <hi>Essay</hi> can have the
good luck to be relish'd and approved
by the <hi>Understanding Few,</hi> it will be
an Encouragement to me to go on with
my Design, which is, to collect all the
most refined Thoughts of the <hi>Modern</hi>
Moralists and set them in Ballance
against the <hi>Characters,</hi> of <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi>
and the <hi>Apophthems</hi> of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;</hi>
than to let skilful and impartial
Iudges pronounce which of the two out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude by obviating a
<pb facs="tcp:97015:7"/>
Quarrel, which some malicious, snarling
People, (who are acquainted with my
Circumstances) might pick with some
of these Thoughts, for being purposely
written to gratify <hi>Private Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
I therefore, not so much in
satisfaction to any particular Person, as
to vindicate the Truth, do here solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
protest, that this Collection was made
before any <hi>Injuries</hi> were offered; and
besides, that the principal Authors of
them are too Trifling and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deserve this <hi>Noble</hi> way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
But if after this publick <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi>
any Person shall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
touch'd in the Moral of these
Reflections upon the score of <hi>Malice,
Detraction, Pride, &amp;c.</hi> Let them
keep their own Councel, and learn to
be wiser hereafter, which is all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
I desire from a <hi>Christian
Enemy.</hi>

            <head>CHARACTERS
OF THE
Virtues &amp; Vices
of the AGE.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Advice, Counsel.</head>
               <p>I. MEN give nothing so liberally as
Counsel.</p>
               <p>II. Nothing in the World is
so unsincere, as the asking and
receiving of <hi>Advice.</hi> He that asks it, seems to
yield a respectful deference to the Opinion of
his <hi>Friend,</hi> and all the while only designs to have
his own approv'd, and shelter his own <hi>Actions</hi>
under the <hi>Authority</hi> of another: On the other
side, he that gives it, returns, as one would
think, the Confidence of others with an ardent
and impartial <hi>Zeal,</hi> and yet has generally no
other aim, but his own <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97015:10"/>
III. There goes as much Wisdom and Ability
in the improving of a Friend's <hi>Advice,</hi> as in the
advising and conducting one's self.</p>
               <p>IV. 'Tis no difficult matter to give good <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
but 'tis a hard one to make a Man improve
it.</p>
               <p>V. It is harder to keep ones self from being
managed, than to manage and govern others.</p>
               <p>VI. There is need of as much <hi>Discretion</hi> to
give <hi>Advice,</hi> as <hi>Compliance</hi> to follow it. Nothing
is so dreadful as a Friend that takes the advantage
of his own Experience; that proposes all his
Counsels as Laws, and with the Air of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
that takes from us the privilege of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what he says, and would force the Mind
by <hi>Authority,</hi> rather than win it by <hi>Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Yet a great <hi>Weakness</hi> in receiving <hi>Advice,</hi>
is no less blameable, than a great <hi>Roughness</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it: It is our Interest to surmount the one,
and to sweeten the other.</p>
               <p>VIII. It is not proper always to reject evil
<hi>Counsels,</hi> for fear of disheartning those that are
capable of administring good ones.</p>
               <p>* IX. Some People are not to be dealt
withal, but by a Train of Mystery and Circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>locution;
a <hi>downright Admonition</hi> looks liker
the <hi>Reproach</hi> of an <hi>Enemy,</hi> than the <hi>Advice</hi> of a
<hi>Friend,</hi> or at best it is but the good Office of a
Man that has an ill Opinion of us; and we do
not naturally love to be told of our Faults, by
the Witnesses of our Failings.</p>
               <p>* X. 'Tis easie to give <hi>Counsel</hi> to another,
which in the same Circumstances we are far
from practising our selves; then we can be full
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97015:10"/>
of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and grave <hi>Morals;</hi> but when it comes
home, all our <hi>Philosophy</hi> vanishes; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
nothing to be seen, but a meer <hi>sensitive</hi>
Animal, without <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Admiration.</head>
               <p>I. WE love all those that <hi>Admire</hi> us, but
very few of those we <hi>Admire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>Admiration</hi> betrays a narrow <hi>Wit;</hi> and your
great <hi>Admirers</hi> are for the most part very silly
People.</p>
               <p>* III. Excessive <hi>Commendations</hi> of any Art or
Science whatsoever, as also of the Learning of
any particular Men or Nations, only prove that
the Persons who give such Characters, never
heard of any Thing or Person, that was more
excellent in that way; and therefore <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
may be as well supposed to proceed from
their own Ignorance, as from the real Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Persons or Things, unless their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Abilities are otherwise known.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Ambition.</head>
               <p>I. WHen great Men suffer themselves to be
cast down by the weight of their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
it plainly discovers it was not the
Greatness of their <hi>Soul,</hi> but of their <hi>Ambition,</hi>
that kept up their Spirits so long; and that <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Pride</hi> excepted, an Hero is much like
another Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97015:11"/>
II. An <hi>Ambitious</hi> Man does not appear to be
so in the least, when he meets with an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of gaining his Ends.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Generosity</hi> is very often a disguis'd <hi>Ambition,</hi>
that slights mean <hi>Interests,</hi> only to pursue greater.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Moderation</hi> can never have the honour of
contending with <hi>Ambition,</hi> and subduing it;
because they never meet together: <hi>Moderation</hi>
is the Weakness and Sloath of the Soul, whereas
<hi>Ambition</hi> is the Ardour and Activity of it.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Ambitious</hi> Men abuse themselves, when
they pretend to limit their <hi>Ambition;</hi> for their
very Ends when they are gain'd, are but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into means, subservient to farther Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.</p>
               <p>VI. It seldom happens that a Man may say, <hi>I
have been Ambitious;</hi> for he that is once so, is
so always.</p>
               <p>VII. The Pursuits of <hi>Ambition,</hi> though not so
general, yet are as endless as those of Riches, and
as extravagant too, since none ever yet thought
he had power or empire enough: For what
<hi>Prince</hi> soever seems to be so great, as to live
and reign without any further Desires or Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
falls into the Life of a <hi>private</hi> Man, and enjoys
but those Pleasures and Entertainments, which
a great many several degrees of private For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
will allow, and as much indeed as <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature</hi> is capable of enjoying.</p>
               <p>VIII. <hi>Ambitious</hi> Men and <hi>Misers,</hi> seem to
acquire their mighty stock of <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi>
for no other end, than to make themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sensible of the torment of being neither
able to quit nor to keep them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97015:11"/>
IX. All <hi>Passions</hi> tyrannize over us; yet <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi>
suspends all the other Passions, and gives
us for a while the appearances of all the Virtues.
This Man who has all manner of <hi>Vices,</hi> I took
him to be Sober, Chast, Humble, Liberal and
even Devout; nay, undoubtedly he would be so
still if he had not made his Fortune.</p>
               <p>* X. The <hi>Ambitious</hi> are content to pay so
great a price as their own slavery, to get the
Dominion over others.</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Slaves</hi> have but one <hi>Master;</hi> but the
<hi>Ambitious</hi> have as many as there are Men that
can be instrumental to their Fortune.</p>
               <p>* XII. <hi>Ambition</hi> is like <hi>Choler,</hi> which is an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that makes Men Active, Earnest, full of
Alacrity and Stirring, if it be not stopp'd; but
if it cannot have its way, it becomes adult, and
thereby malign and venomous: So <hi>Ambitious</hi>
Men, if they find their way open to their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and still get forward, they are rather
busie than dangerous; but if they be checkt in
their Desires, they become secretly discontent,
and look upon Men and Masters with an evil
Eye, and are best pleas'd when Things go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which is the worst Property in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of a Prince or State. Therefore it is good
for Princes, if they be obliged to make use of
<hi>Ambitious</hi> Men, to handle 'em so, as they be
still Progressive, and not Retrogade.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97015:12"/>
               <head>Afflictions.</head>
               <p>I. UNder what disguise soever we conceal
our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> they seldom proceed, but
either from <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. There are in our <hi>Afflictions</hi> several kinds of
<hi>Hypocrisy.</hi> Sometimes we weep for our selves
under colour of Weeping for our Friends, we
lament the loss of the good Opinion they had
of us; We bewail the diminution of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
Pleasures and Credit. Thus the <hi>Dead</hi>
have the honour of those <hi>Tears,</hi> which indeed
are shed for the <hi>Living.</hi> I call this a sort of
<hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> because in these <hi>Afflictions</hi> People im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon themselves. There is another kind
not so harmless as this, because it imposes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the World; I mean, the <hi>Affliction</hi> of
those who have the vanity of valuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon a deep and desperate Sorrow: When
<hi>Time,</hi> the great <hi>Physician</hi> of Sorrows, has worn
off their real grief, they do not leave off being
obstinate, in Crying, Sobbing, Groaning and
Lamenting; and with a mourn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Countenance endeavour to make the
World believe, that nothing but <hi>Death</hi> will end
their <hi>Affliction.</hi> This dismal and troublesome
<hi>Vanity</hi> is most prevailing with Ambitious <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
for their Sex rendring them unable to
advance themselves by eminent Virtues, they
strive to signalize their Reputation by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry
of an inconsolable Sorrow. There is
still another sort of Tears, which flowing from
shallow Springs, will run and dry up very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97015:12"/>
Men weep sometimes to gain the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Good-Nature and Tenderness, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be pity'd and lamented by others, and
sometimes to avoid the shame of being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
insensible.</p>
               <p>III. Some Men are more miss'd than lamented;
and others again are very much lamented, and
very little miss'd.</p>
               <p>IV. Our <hi>Affliction</hi> for a Dead Friend is great
or small, not according to his <hi>Merit,</hi> but the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
we think he had of our deserts.</p>
               <p>V. A pretty House, a fine Horse, a Dog, a
Watch, any thing that comes to our share, is
enough sometimes to soften a great <hi>Grief,</hi> and
lessen the sense of a great Loss.</p>
               <p>VI. The Duties of <hi>Interment</hi> are called the last
Duties; for beyond the Funeral, all that is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to the <hi>Dead</hi> is taken away from the <hi>Living-Lamentations</hi>
that are too long, not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<hi>Nature,</hi> but <hi>Society</hi> likewise; they render
us incapable of the Duties of a Civil Life; and
one may say, that out of Complaisance to
those Friends we have lost, they make us want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those we still enjoy.</p>
               <p>VII. A skilful <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>orter</hi> must begin by the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of Evils, to obtain a free admittance
to the Mind of the Afflicted, and to surprise
their Belief.</p>
               <p>* VIII. To Mourn without measure is <hi>Folly;</hi>
nor to Mourn at all <hi>Insensibility:</hi> The best Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is betwixt Piety and Reason; to be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but neither to be transported nor cast down.</p>
               <p>* IX. Most People shew in their <hi>Afflictions</hi>
more <hi>Ambition</hi> than <hi>Piety;</hi> for when any body is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97015:13"/>
within hearing, what Groans and Outcries do
they make? but when they are alone and in
private all is hush and quiet: So soon as any
body comes in, they are at it again, but their
Sorrow goes off with the Company.</p>
               <p>* X. The most desperate <hi>Mourners</hi> are they
who care least for their Friends; for they
think to redeem their Credit for want of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the <hi>Living,</hi> by extravagant Ravings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XI. To weep excessively for the <hi>Dead,</hi>
is a kind of an Affront to the <hi>Living.</hi>

               <head>Ages of Life.</head>
               <p>I. OUr Life being nothing else but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Change and Revolution, we
come altogether fresh and raw into the several
Periods of it, and want often Experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Gray-Hairs.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Young</hi> People change their <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi>
by the Mettle and heat of Blood; and
<hi>Old</hi> ones keep to theirs by the Sullenness of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
and Custom.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Youth</hi> is a perpetual Debauchery, and the
very Fever of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. The <hi>Lukewarmness</hi> of <hi>Old-Age</hi> is as great
a Foil to a Man's <hi>Salvation,</hi> as the <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of <hi>Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. <hi>Young Men</hi> that come first upon the Stage
of the <hi>World,</hi> ought to be either very Modest or
very Brisk; for a sober, grave and composed
Temper commonly turns to <hi>Impertinence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97015:13"/>
VI. <hi>Old People</hi> love mightily to give good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to comfort themselves of their Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of setting ill Examples.</p>
               <p>VII. Both <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> grow still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
with <hi>Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. Most Men shew upon the turning of
their <hi>Age,</hi> where their <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> will begin
to decay.</p>
               <p>IX. Nothing is more ridiculous in <hi>Old People</hi>
that have been Handsom formerly, than to
forget that they are so no more.</p>
               <p>X. 'Tis a hard Lesson to learn how to be <hi>Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Old Age</hi> is a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> that forbids us all
the Pleasures of <hi>Youth,</hi> upon the severest Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>XII. There is no part of our Life wherein we
ought to study our own <hi>Humour</hi> with more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
than in <hi>Old-Age,</hi> for it is never so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be discover'd as then. An impetuous
<hi>Young Fellow</hi> has a hundred returns when he is
dissatisfied with his Extravagances; but <hi>Old
People</hi> devote themselves to their <hi>Humour,</hi> as if
it were a <hi>Virtue,</hi> and take pleasure in their own
<hi>Defects,</hi> because they carry a false Resemblance
of <hi>Commendable Qualities:</hi> They are perpetually
crying up the <hi>Time-past,</hi> and enviously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the <hi>Present:</hi> They rail at <hi>Pleasures</hi>
when they are past them, or censure <hi>Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
whose only Fault is their own <hi>Incapacity:</hi>
A <hi>serious Air</hi> passes with them for <hi>Iudgment,
Phlegm</hi> for <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and hence proceeds that
imperious Authority they allow themselves to
censure every thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97015:14"/>
XIII. We see nothing more ordinary for <hi>Old
Men,</hi> than to desire a <hi>Retirement;</hi> and nothing
so rare with them, as not to repent of it when
they are once retired: Their <hi>Souls</hi> that are in
too great a Subjection to their <hi>Humours,</hi> are
disgusted with the World for being tiresome;
But scarce can they quit this false Object of
their Misfortune, but they are as angry with
<hi>Solitude,</hi> as they were with the <hi>World,</hi> disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves where nothing but themselves
can give them any disquiet.</p>
               <p>XIV. Scarce do we begin to grow <hi>Old,</hi> but
we begin to be displeased with some distaste,
which we secretly frame in our selves. Then
our Soul free from <hi>Self love,</hi> is easily fill'd with
that which is suggested to us, and what would
have pleas'd us before but indifferently, charms
us at present, and enslaves us to our own <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
By this, <hi>Mistresses</hi> dispose of their old
<hi>Lovers</hi> to their own fancy, and <hi>Wives</hi> of their
old <hi>Husbands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XV. 'Tis with our Lives as with our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
a good Husband makes a little go a great
way: Whereas let the Revenue of a Prince fall
into the Hands of a Prodigal, 'tis vanisht in a
Moment. So that the Time allotted us, if it
were well employ'd, were abundantly enough,
to answer all the Ends and Purposes of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>XVI. A neglected Dress in <hi>Old People,</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies
their Wrinkles, and exposes their Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:
An affected Curiosity of Apparel has
the same Effect.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97015:14"/>
               <head>Avarice, Riches.</head>
               <p>I. WHat a Man squanders away, he takes
away from his Heir; what he lays up
by sordid <hi>Avarice,</hi> he takes away from himself.
The <hi>Medium</hi> is to do one's self Justice, and others.</p>
               <p>II. Children would, perhaps, be dearer to
their Fathers, and again Fathers to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but for the name of <hi>Heir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. All Men by their several Places, Titles
and Successions, look upon themselves as <hi>Heirs</hi>
one of another, and by that Interest entertain
all along a secret desire of their Neighbour's
death. The most fortunate Man in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Condition, is he that has most to lose,
and leave to his Successor.</p>
               <p>* IV. It is not for acquiring Wealth, but for
misemploying it when he has acquir'd it, that
Man ought to be blamed.</p>
               <p>* V. I cannot call <hi>Riches</hi> better than the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of Virtue; for as the Baggage is to an
Army, so is Riches to Virtue.</p>
               <p>* VI. Of great <hi>Riches</hi> there is no real Use,
except it be in the Distribution; the rest is but
Conceit.</p>
               <p>* VII. Covetousness is enough to make the
Master of the World, as Poor as he that has
just nothing; for a Man may be brought to a
Morsel of Bread, by Griping as well as by
Profuseness. 'Tis a madness for a Man that
has enough already, to hazard all for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of more, and then upon the Miscarriage
to leave himself nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97015:15"/>
VIII. <hi>Avarice</hi> is in many Cases more opposite
to a Man's Interest, than <hi>Liberality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. Some Men despise Mony, but not one of
a Thousand knows how to part with it.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>Avarice</hi> is often the Cause of contrary
Effects: There are a World of People, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
all their present Possessions to remote and
uncertain Hopes; and others again slight great
Advantages to come, for some mean Interest
in present.</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Riches</hi> do by no means teach us to be
less fond of <hi>Riches:</hi> The possessing of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
is very far from giving us the quiet that
there is in not desiring them.</p>
               <p>XII. Nothing is so hard to perswade Men to,
as the contempt of <hi>Riches,</hi> except ones Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be drawn from the Stores of <hi>Christian
Religion;</hi> and therefore the Wise Men among
the Ancients were in truth very foolish, who
without any light of Faith, or Expectation of
a better State, despised <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Pleasures:</hi>
They endeavour'd to distinguish themselves by
uncommon and unnatural Notions, and so to
triumph over the rest of Mankind, by an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Elevation of <hi>Soul.</hi> Those that were
the Wisest among them were satisfied with
talking of these things in Publick, but beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themselves after another rate in Private.</p>
               <p>XIII. 'Tis the Infatuation of <hi>Misers</hi> to take
Gold and Silver for things really good, whereas
they are only some of the means by which
good Things are procured.</p>
               <p>XIV. A <hi>Covetous Man</hi> renders himself the
most miserable of Men, wrongs many, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
none but when he dyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97015:15"/>
XV. The Condition of a <hi>Miser</hi> is so wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the greatest Curses a Man can give
him, is, <hi>That he may Live long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. That Man is <hi>Rich</hi> who receives more
than he lays <hi>out;</hi> and on the contrary, that Man
is to be accounted <hi>Poor</hi> whose Expence exceeds
his Revenue.</p>
               <p>XVII. Nothing maintains it self so long as a
moderate <hi>Fortune;</hi> and nothing so soon dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
away as a great one.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Great <hi>Riches</hi> are generally the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
occasion of <hi>Poverty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. A <hi>Covetous Man</hi> lays up for Old Age
when Young; and for Death when Old. A
<hi>Prodigal Heir</hi> makes him a fine <hi>Funeral,</hi> and
devours the rest of his <hi>Wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XX. The <hi>Covetous Man</hi> spends more in one
Day when <hi>Dead,</hi> than he did in Ten Years
when <hi>Alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXI. There are two sorts of <hi>Avarice,</hi> a <hi>True</hi>
and a <hi>Bastard.</hi>—True <hi>Covetousness</hi> is a restless and
insatiable desire of <hi>Riches,</hi> not for any further
end or use, but only to hoard and preserve,
and perpetually increase them. This is the
greatest Evidence of a base ungenerous Mind,
and at the same time the highest Injustice in
the World. For what can be more unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than for a Man to ingross to himself all
that which is for the Common Support and
Conveniency of Mankind; and to propagate
his Crime by locking up his beloved Treasures,
and thereby robbing continually the Publick,
of what he has once gotten from private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.—The
Bastard kind of <hi>Avarice</hi> is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97015:16"/>
the rapacious Appetite of Gain, not for the
Mony's own sake, but for the pleasure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funding
it immediately through all the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
of Pride and Luxury. That Man who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
by his Prosuseness he makes a kind of Restituti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>* XXII. 'Tis said of a Virtuous and Wise
Man, that having nothing, he had all; when
a Miser having all things, yet has nothing.</p>
               <p>* XXIII. There is not a greater Argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mony; nothing more reasonable than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
it when we have it not, and nothing more
honourable than to employ it generously, and
do good with it when we have it.</p>
               <p>* XXIV. The Patriarchs before the <hi>Flood</hi>
who lived Nine Hundred Years, scarcely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for a few Days; and we, who live but a
few days, provide at least for Nine Hundred
Years.</p>
               <p>* XXV. As <hi>Riches</hi> at first make a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
so the want of them degrades him.</p>
               <p>* XXVI. As <hi>Riches</hi> go off from a Man, they
expose to the <hi>World</hi> his Weakness, that lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered
before.</p>
               <p>* XXVII. There is one kind of <hi>Affliction</hi>
which never leaves us, and that is, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the loss of our <hi>Fortunes.</hi> Time, which

               <head>Beauty, Homeliness.</head>
               <p>I. IF we consider <hi>Agreeableness</hi> distinct from
<hi>Beauty,</hi> we may call it a sort of <hi>Symmetry</hi>
or <hi>Proportion,</hi> the Rules of which no body can
positively define; or a secret Relation and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
of the <hi>Features</hi> one to another, and of all
these together to the <hi>Complexion, Looks</hi> and <hi>Air</hi>
of the Person.</p>
               <p>II. Few <hi>Women</hi>'s Worth out lives their <hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. <hi>Gracefulness</hi> is to the <hi>Body,</hi> what good
<hi>Sense</hi> is to the <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. There is nothing so natural to Persons of
the <hi>Fair-Sex,</hi> as to take a pleasure in their own
<hi>Beauty.</hi> They please themselves as much as 'tis
possible for others to please them, and are the
first that discover their own <hi>Charms,</hi> and fall in
Love with them.</p>
               <p>V. A <hi>Beautiful Woman</hi> is more concern'd to
preserve her <hi>Beauty</hi> than her <hi>Lover,</hi> and shews less
Tenderness for a Heart already vanquish'd,
than she expresses Vanity and Ostentation in
extending her Conquests: Not but that she
may very well be sensible for her Gallant,
but in all probability she will sooner resolve
to suffer the loss of what she loves, than to lose
what, causes her to be belov'd.</p>
               <p>VI. As long as a Woman is in full Possession of
her <hi>Beauty,</hi> no Misfortune can befall her, which
she cannot in some measure alleviate: But
when once that Blessing has left her, all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97015:17"/>
other advantages of <hi>Fortune</hi> will never be able
to give her any tolerable Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>VII. The last <hi>Tears</hi> that Beautiful <hi>Eyes</hi> reserve,
are spent in bewailing themselves after they are
defac'd out of all Hearts. The only Person
that still laments a lost <hi>Beauty</hi> is the miserable
Possessor.</p>
               <p>VIII. 'Tis a great wonder to see how <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
that are so mightily fond of their <hi>Beauty,</hi>
can use so much Art to anticipate its ruin.</p>
               <p>* IX. <hi>Beauty</hi> is so necessary to the <hi>Young,</hi> that
those who are without it, seem to be to no
other purpose, than to wait on the <hi>Triumph</hi> of
the <hi>Fair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* X. Some Women set up for <hi>Beauty,</hi> as much
in spite of <hi>Nature,</hi> as some Men do for <hi>Wit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XI. <hi>Ill favour'd Women</hi> are never so nauseous,
as when they would be <hi>Beauties;</hi> adding to
their <hi>Natural Deformity,</hi> the <hi>Artificial Ugliness</hi>
of <hi>Affectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XII. <hi>Homely Women</hi> are as malicious to the
<hi>Fair,</hi> as <hi>Blockheads</hi> are to <hi>Witty Men;</hi> for they
look upon other Womens <hi>Accomplishments</hi> as the
upbraiding of their <hi>Deformities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. The Contempt of <hi>Beauty</hi> in the <hi>Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour'd,</hi>
is as false as the Contempt of <hi>Riches</hi>
in some Philosophers.</p>
               <p>XIV. <hi>Agreeableness</hi> is arbitrary, but <hi>Beauty</hi>
is something more real and independent upon
the Palate and Opinion.</p>
               <p>* XV. Whosoever has any thing contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in his Person, has also a perpetual Spur upon
him to rescue and deliver himself from Scorn.
Therefore all <hi>Deformed Persons</hi> are extream bold,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97015:17"/>
First, In their own defence, as being expos'd
to Scorn; but in process of Time, by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Habit. Besides, it stirreth them up to Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
to watch and observe the Weakness of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they may have somewhat to repay.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Benefits, Gratitude, Ingratitude.</head>
               <p>I. SOme Men are not only apt to forget both
kind Turns, and Injuries that have been
done them, but even to hate their very <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi>
and to lay aside their Resentments against
their <hi>Perrfecutors.</hi> The Application of acquitting
<hi>Obligations</hi> aud revenging of <hi>Wrongs,</hi> appears to
them a kind of slavery, which they are loath to
undergo.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Gratitude</hi> in most Men is nothing else but
a secret desire to hook in greater Benefits.</p>
               <p>III. The generality of Men take a delight to
acquit small <hi>Obligations;</hi> a great many pay their
Acknowledgments for moderate ones; but
there is scarce any Body but is unthankful for
such as are Extraordinary.</p>
               <p>IV. It is with <hi>Gratitude</hi> among <hi>Friends,</hi> as with
<hi>Honesty</hi> among <hi>Traders,</hi> it keeps up Business and
Commerce: Most Men don't quit Scores be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is just to pay <hi>Debts,</hi> but to secure their
<hi>Credit,</hi> and so be trusted again the easier.</p>
               <p>V. The common Mistake in the <hi>Computations</hi>
of Men, when they expect <hi>Returns</hi> for <hi>Favours,</hi>
proceeds from the <hi>Pride,</hi> both of the <hi>Giver</hi> and
<hi>Receiver,</hi> which cannot agree upon the Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of the <hi>Benefit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97015:18"/>
VI. To be uneasie, and make too much haste
to return an <hi>Obligation,</hi> is one sort of <hi>Ingratitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. There is a sort of free and generous <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi>
whereby a Man not only acquits a past
<hi>Obligation,</hi> but lays a new one still upon his <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. The Error of the <hi>Giver</hi> does oftentimes
excuse the <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of the <hi>Receiver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. The <hi>good</hi> Turns that we have receiv'd
from a Man, ought to make us Reverence his
<hi>Malice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. We meet with little or no <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> as
long as we are able to oblige.</p>
               <p>XI. We should not regard how much <hi>Good</hi> a
<hi>Friend</hi> has done us, so much, as how much he
desired and endeavour'd to do us.</p>
               <p>XII. Men are often more desirous to seem
forward and busie to serve others, than to be
successful in it; and had rather have it in their
power to upbraid their <hi>Friends</hi> with an <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
than really to oblige them.</p>
               <p>XIII. In the matter of <hi>Benefits Pride</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to own the <hi>Obligation,</hi> and <hi>Self-Love</hi> to
acquit it.</p>
               <p>XIV. 'Tis as great an <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to publish
the <hi>Favours</hi> of a <hi>Mistress,</hi> as to conceal those of
a <hi>Friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. 'Tis a kind of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> for a Man to
be too inquis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itive into the <hi>Motives</hi> of a <hi>Benefit</hi> he
receives.</p>
               <p>XVI. The great Cautions of some People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Ingratitude,</hi> denote less of Hatred for that,
than Aversion for <hi>Generosity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:97015:18"/>
XVII. There are not so many <hi>Ungrateful Men,</hi>
as there are thought to be; because there are
not so many <hi>Generous Men</hi> as we imagine. He
that in silence suppresses a <hi>Favour</hi> receiv'd, is
an unthankful Fellow, that deserv'd it not: But
he that publishes one that he has done, turns it
to an Injury, shewing, to your disgrace, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
you had of him.</p>
               <p>XVIII. <hi>Court-Acknowledgements</hi> have not so
much respect to the <hi>Past,</hi> as design upon the
<hi>Future.</hi> They acknowledge <hi>Obligations</hi> to all
that are in any Post to oblige, and by an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<hi>Gratitude</hi> for <hi>Favours</hi> never done, insinuate
themselves into those in whose power it is to
do 'em.</p>
               <p>XIX. The <hi>great Ones</hi> in requital have a Trick
as artificial to excuse themselves from doing
Kindnesses, as the <hi>Courtiers</hi> have to engage 'em
to it. They reproach Men with Services never
done, and complain of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> though they
have hardly oblig'd any one to draw from hence
a specious Pretence to oblige no body.</p>
               <p>XX. 'Tis much better to expose one's self to
<hi>Ingratitude,</hi> than be wanting to the relief of the
Needy.</p>
               <p>XXI. There is not any thing where <hi>Excess</hi>
may be more commendable than in <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXII. There's no living in this World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an exchange of Civil Offices, and the need
we have one of another, goes a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the making of us love one another: Now
this Amity and Communication is to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by the Commerce of Giving and Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and without good Nature and Gratitude
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97015:19"/>
Men had as good live in a Wilderness, as in a
Civil Society.</p>
               <p>* XXIII. <hi>Ingratitude</hi> is of all Crimes that
which we account the most venial in our selves,
and the most unpardonable in others.</p>
               <p>* XXIV. <hi>Good Offices</hi> depend much upon
Construction; some take themselves to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
when they are not, others will not believe
it when they are; and some again take <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Injuries</hi> the one for the other.</p>
               <p>* XXV. It is a <hi>Court Humour</hi> to keep People
upon the Tenters; their <hi>Injuries</hi> are quick and
sudden, but their <hi>Benefits</hi> are flow. Great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
love to wrack Men with attendance; and
account it an Oftentation of their Power to
hold their Suitors in hand, and to have many
Witnesses of their Interst.</p>
               <p>* XXVI. He that gives to be seen, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
relieve a Man in the dark.</p>
               <p>* XXVII. 'Tis a kind of incumbrance upon
the freedom of a generous Mind, to be in debt
to an ill Man, even upon any score whatsoever,
that does but carry the face of Good-Will, or
Respect; for 'tis a Debt that a Man's both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
and weary of till 'tis paid off. And there's
something mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e in't yet too, which is, that
when all common Scores are made even, the
Morality of the Obligation still remains; for
there's no cancelling the Bonds of Honour and
Justice. Kindnesses are to be paid in <hi>Specie</hi> as
well as <hi>Mony,</hi> that is to say, there must be Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the return as well as Justice. Now as
there can be no true Friendship betwixt a Good
Man and a Wicked, there should be no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97015:19"/>
betwixt them that looks like Friendship,
and therefore the less Commerce the better.</p>
               <p>* XXVIII. We have the Common Saying
ready at our Tongues end, That <hi>'tis the Man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we consider, and not the Estate:</hi> This is a
handsom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lourish; but where is the Man yet that
does not more willingly bestow his time and his
pains upon the Service of a powerful and wealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Person, than in the Support and Protection
of the best Poor Man that ever was born? For
we are naturally inclin'd to lay out our <hi>Services,</hi>
where we may reasonably hope for the speediest
and the most certain return.</p>
               <p>* XXIX. It is customary for great Men to
over-value the <hi>Services</hi> they do their <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Country;</hi> and for <hi>Princes,</hi> when they cannot du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reward an eminent Performance, to turn their
<hi>Gratitude</hi> into <hi>Hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXX. Those you have obliged most, will
certainly avoid you when you can oblige them
no longer; and they take your visits like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Duns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXI. <hi>Mistresses,</hi> as well as <hi>Friends,</hi> are
sometimes avoided for <hi>Obligations</hi> past.</p>
               <p>* XXXII. When ill Men take up a fit of
Kindness all on a sudden, and appear to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
natur'd than usual, 'tis good Discretion to
suspect Fraud, and to lay their Words and their
Practices together; for there are no Snares so
dangerous as those that are laid for us under the
name of Good Offices.</p>
               <p>* XXXIII. Most People seek out their own
Interest under colour of obliging others, and
are kind to their Neighbours for their own sakes.</p>

               <head>Cheats.</head>
               <p>I. OUR own <hi>Distrust</hi> justifies the <hi>Cheating</hi>
of other People.</p>
               <p>II. It is as easie a matter to deceive a Man's
self, and not be sensible of it, as it is hard to
impose upon others, and yet for them not to be
sensible of it.</p>
               <p>III. An honest <hi>Intention</hi> of imposing upon no
body, lays us open to the Cheating of other
People.</p>
               <p>IV. The most effectual way to be <hi>bubbled,</hi> is
to fancy one's self wiser than one's Neighbours.</p>
               <p>V. The being a <hi>Blockhead</hi> is sometimes the
best security against being impos'd upon by a
Man of <hi>Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. He that fancies such a sufficiency in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he can live without all the World, is
mightily mistaken; but he that imagines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so necessary, that other People cannot
live without him, is so a great deal more.</p>
               <p>VII. Affected Simplicity and Plainness, is
but a nicer and more laboured <hi>Cheat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. Men would never live so long together
in <hi>Society</hi> and good <hi>Correspondence,</hi> if they did
not mutually make Fools of one another.</p>
               <p>IX. The common way of some to do their
Business, and rise in the World, is to use all
possible means of perswading People that their
Business is done already.</p>
               <p>X. We are so used to dissemble with others,
that in time we come to deceive and dissemble
with our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97015:20"/>
XI. It is sometimes of great Use for a Man to
pretend he is deceiv'd; for when we let a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Fellow see that we are sensible of his Tricks,
it gives him occasion to be more refin'd.</p>
               <p>XII. It is a hard task upon Knaves to be per
petually employ'd in concealing their own want
of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and making amends for the Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of their Promise.</p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Plain dealing</hi> puts Knaves
out of their Byaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s; it breaks all their Measures
by which they hop'd to compass their Ends:
for <hi>Knaves</hi> commonly think that nothing can be
done but by <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Artifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XIV. All Frauds are covered and gilded
over with specious Pretences and Men are every
jot as easily impos'd upon, as Birds, Beasts or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes;
while the eagerness of our Appetites suspends
the Exercise of our Reason. A Treat, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or a Bottle, is the same thing to us, that a
Worm, a Gudgeon, a grain of Corn, or a piece
of Flesh is to those Animals: We snap at the
Bait without ever dreaming of the Hook, the
Trap, or the Snare, that goes along with it.</p>
               <p>XV. Men never can bear to be over-reach'd
by their <hi>Enemies,</hi> or betray'd by their <hi>Friends;</hi>
and yet, they are often contented to be both
cheated and betray'd by their own selves.</p>
               <p>XVI. He is an unhappy Man that lives in the
World without being deceiv'd.</p>
               <p>XVII. The Pleasure of <hi>Deceit</hi> goes sometimes
so far, that the greatest of your <hi>Enemies</hi> makes
himself agreeable when he imposes upon you;
and the best of your <hi>Friends</hi> seldom undeceives
you, but you are offended at it.</p>

               <p>I. THE <hi>Clemency</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> is very often lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

the Affection of their <hi>Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. That <hi>Clemency</hi> which is so mightily cry'd
up in the World for a Virtue, is often practis'd
out of <hi>Pride;</hi> sometimes out of <hi>Sloth</hi> and
<hi>Neglect,</hi> sometimes out of <hi>Fear,</hi> and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of a Mixture of all these Motives to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the force of a Temptation to offend again.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Confidence, Secrets.</head>
               <p>I. THE <hi>Confidence</hi> we have in our selves
creates a great part of that Trust which
we have in others</p>
               <p>II. The greatest part of our <hi>Confidences</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

III. <hi>Confidence</hi> goes farther in Company than
<hi>Wit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. We often dare not disclose our Hearts to
our <hi>Friends,</hi> not so much out of any distrust we
have of'em, as that we have of our selves.</p>
               <p>V. There is seldom any thing but a Noble
Birth, or good Education, that can make a
Man capable of being Secret.</p>
               <p>VI. All manner of <hi>Confidence,</hi> which is not
absolute and intire, is dangerous: There are
few occasions, but where a Man ought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
say all, or conceal all; and how little so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you have reveal'd your Secret to a <hi>Friend,</hi>
you have already said too much, if you think it
not safe to make him privy to all the Particulars.</p>
               <p>* VII. 'Tis ill trusting a Reconcil'd Enemy:
but 'tis worse yet, to proceed at one step from
Clemency and Tenderness, to Confidence;
Especially where there are so many Memorials
in sight, for Hatred and Revenge to work upon.</p>
               <p>* VIII. A Supine, Credulous Facility, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
a Man to be both a Prey and a Laughing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock
at once; and the Imposture can hardly
miscarry, where there is a full Confidence on

II. We are generally weary of those Men
most, whom we ought never to be weary of at
all.</p>
               <p>III. We can bear sometimes to be plagued
with <hi>Impertinents,</hi> but we cannot endure to be
accounted so by others.</p>
               <p>IV. One Reason why we find so very few
Men of <hi>Sense</hi> and agreeable <hi>Conversation,</hi> is, that
almost every Bodies Mind is more intent upon
what he himself has a mind to say, than upon
making Pertinent <hi>Replies</hi> to what the rest of
the <hi>Company</hi> say to him. The more <hi>Ingenious</hi>
and <hi>Complaisant</hi> sort go no farther than pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to harken attentively, when at the same
time a Man may plainly see that both their
Eyes and their Mind are roving from what is
said to them, and posting back again to what
they long to be at themselves; not considering
that to seek one's own <hi>Pleasure</hi> so very passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
can never be the way either to please or
perswade others; and that diligent <hi>Attention,</hi> and

                     </gap>ctions,</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
a Man for Company.</p>
               <p>V. In <hi>Conversation,</hi> he seldom pleases who is
over-confident of Pleasing.</p>
               <p>VI. The Art of Pleasing in <hi>Company,</hi> is, not
to explain things to Particulars; to express on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one half and leave your Hearers to make
out the rest: This argues you have a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the Persons you converse with; for
nothing is more agreeable to Mens <hi>love</hi> of
themselves.</p>
               <p>VII. It is very hard to hit a certain Temper
and Mediocrity of <hi>Freedom</hi> with Persons above
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97015:22"/>
us, so to be easie and plain with them, as to
become an <hi>Instrument</hi> of their Diversion and
Entertainment, without being any way offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
or breaking in upon the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
due to their Quality.</p>
               <p>VIII. We often brag of never being weary of
any Body's <hi>Company,</hi> and are so vain as not to
own, that we can ever meet with any bad.</p>
               <p>IX. A Man is generally troublesom when he
thinks most he cannot be so.</p>
               <p>X. To fly from <hi>Company,</hi> is to act against the
Intention of <hi>Nature;</hi> to live always in <hi>Solitude,</hi>
one must be something more than <hi>Man,</hi> or less
than a <hi>Brute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. Formal <hi>Civilities</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are a
kind of Tyranny, which render Men unsocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
even in Society it self.</p>
               <p>XII. It is with Men's <hi>Wit,</hi> as it is with <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;</hi>
for as the most fruitful of these are not
always the pleasantest to walk in, so the most
fertile Wits are not always the most agreeable
to converse with.</p>
               <p>XIII. 'Tis the part of a <hi>Blockhead</hi> to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom;
a Man of Wit and Sense is sensible
whether his Company is agreeable or no; and
disappears a Moment before the time, that his
Visit might be accounted tedious.</p>
               <p>XIV. The greatest Skill and Perfection
in <hi>Conversation</hi> is not so much to shew a
Man's own <hi>Wit,</hi> as to give other People the
Opportunity of exerting theirs: He that parts
from you pleased and satisfied with himself, is
perfectly so with you. Men do not live to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire;
they have a mind to please, and seek less
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97015:23"/>
to be instructed or diverted, than relish'd and
applauded.</p>
               <p>XV. 'Tis a great Misfortune for a Man either
to want <hi>Wit</hi> to speak well, or <hi>Discretion</hi> to hold
his Tongue. This is the Spring of all <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. The Pleasure of <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Conversation</hi>
betwixt Friends, is entertain'd by a Similitude
of Manners, and a little difference of Opinions
in the <hi>Sciences</hi> By this it is that a Man either
confirms and pleases himself in his own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
or exercises and instructs himself by
the Dispute.</p>
               <p>* XVII. We meet with many dangerous <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
in the World, wherein 'tis a hard matter for
a Man to save both his Skin and his Credit.
'Tis a difficult Point to hit the true <hi>Medium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Trusting too much and too little, for
fear of incurring a Danger on the one hand, or
giving a Scandal on the other. <hi>Complements</hi> are
only words of Course; and though one external
Civility may be current Payment for another,
yet a Man would be loath to venture his <hi>All</hi>
upon a Figure of Speech, where the meaning is
so nicely divided betwixt Jest and Earnest. 'Tis
a base thing to suspect a Friend, or an Honest
Man: Nay, 'tis a base thing to suspect any man
that looks like one, so as to wound him; that is,
either in Word or in Thought. But then 'tis
Death perhaps to be impos'd upon by an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
under that Masque: So that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Wise Man lies at stake upon matter
of Judgment one way, and of a Good-natur'd
Man the other. The middle Course is to hide
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97015:23"/>
our Distrust where we are doubtful, and to be
free and open where we may be secure. There
is no living without trusting some body or
other, in some Cases, or at some time or
other; but then if People be not Cautious
whom, when or wherein they Trust, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
may be Mortal; for there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of a Trust to make way for a Treachery,
since no Man can be betray'd, that does not
either believe, or seem to believe.</p>

               <head>Court-Favourites.</head>
               <p>I. THE Contempt of <hi>Favourites</hi> is nothing
else but the love of <hi>Favour:</hi> The vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we resent for our being excluded, is in
some measure softned and allay'd, by underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
those that are in Possession. And we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to pay them our Respects, not being able to
take that away from them, which makes them
respected by all the World besides.</p>
               <p>II. The Court is the <hi>Imperial</hi> Seat of <hi>Ambition;</hi>
all other <hi>Passions,</hi> even <hi>Love</hi> it self, and all Laws
truckle under her; and there are no sorts of
Unions, but she can both knit together or sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>III. There are few <hi>Courtiers,</hi> but what suffer
a Change in their Reputation twice a Year, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the sickleness and instability of other
Men's Opinions, or the diversity of their own
Conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:97015:24"/>
IV. A <hi>Favourite</hi> will sooner find an <hi>Adorer,</hi>
than a true <hi>Friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. There are few <hi>Favourites,</hi> that keep in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to the last; either because <hi>Princes</hi> grow
weary of their <hi>Favourites</hi> when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to bestow on them: Or that <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
themselves grow weary of the <hi>Court</hi> when
they expect nothing more from it.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>Courts</hi> would soon be turned into <hi>Desarts,</hi>
and <hi>Kings</hi> left by themselves, if Men were once
rid of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Interest;</hi> but most People are
contented to be Slaves at <hi>Court,</hi> so they may
domineer elsewhere.</p>
               <p>VII. There is no other study, but how to
please in the Court of Princes, because there a
Man makes his Fortune by rendring himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.
Hence it comes that <hi>Courtiers</hi> are so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht:
On the contrary, in Towns and Republics,
where Men manage their Affairs by Labour, the
last of their Cares is to please, and 'tis that which
renders them so Clownish.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Wheels, the Springs, the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all is hidden in a <hi>Watch,</hi> and nothing
to be seen except the Needle, which insensibly
goes round. This is the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Courtier,</hi>
and so much the truer, that after many fair
steps; he often returns to the same point from
whence he first set out.</p>
               <p>VIII. If <hi>Favour</hi> places a Man above his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
his Fall places him below them.</p>
               <p>IX. That Man that has seen the <hi>Court,</hi> has
seen the fairest and beautifullest part of the
World; and if he can despise the <hi>Court</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97015:24"/>
he has seen it, he can as well despise all the
World.</p>
               <p>X. The Town makes a Man nauseate the
<hi>Country;</hi> the Court creates a disgust for the
Town. The <hi>Court</hi> it self puts a Wise Man out of
conceit with it, and gives him a hankering after
Privacy and Retirement.</p>
               <p>XI. A <hi>Favourite</hi> has no <hi>Retinue;</hi> he is without
Engagements, without Ties: He may be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a crowd of Relations and <hi>Creatures,</hi>
but he is contiguous to nothing, he stands by
himself.</p>
               <p>XII. An old <hi>Courtier</hi> of good Sense and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
is a Treasure of an inestimable value. He
is full of Transactions and Maxims; in him we
find the History of the Times adorned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
curious Circumstances, not to be found any
where else; and of him we may learn Rules for
the Conduct of our Affairs and Manners, which
are so much the surer, as they are grounded on
Experience.</p>
               <p>XIII. It is as hard to define the <hi>Court,</hi> as to
give a true Name to changeable Colours.</p>
               <p>XIV. The <hi>Country</hi> is the Place from whence
the <hi>Court,</hi> as in its true distance, appears a thing
full of Charms, and worth our Admiration. But
if a Man come near it, its Perfections decrease,
just as those of a fine <hi>Landskip,</hi> when you behold
it at a close view.</p>
               <p>XV. The <hi>Court</hi> does neither make a Man
happy, nor suffer him to be so elsewhere.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97015:25"/>
XVI. As it is good for a Gentleman to <hi>Travel,</hi>
so it is to see the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urt.</hi> When he first comes to
it, he discovers there, as it were, a new World,
where <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Politeness</hi> have an equal sway, and
where a Man advantageously improves both
good and bad <hi>Qualities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVII. The <hi>Court</hi> is like a stately Edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ice of
Marble, I mean, because those that compose it
are very hard, but very well polisht.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Nothing so deforms certain <hi>Courtiers,</hi>
as the Presence of the Prince; it so alters their
Air, and debases their Looks, that a Man can
scarce know them by their Faces. Proud info<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Men are the most disfigur'd, for they lose
most of their own; but a modest Man keeps his
natural Countenance; he has nothing to reform.</p>
               <p>XIX. It is oftentimes as dangerous to make
the first steps at <hi>Court,</hi> as it is not to make them.</p>
               <p>XX. You are a <hi>Good Man,</hi> you neither Court
the Favour nor the Resentments of <hi>Favourites:</hi>
You mind your own Business, and wholly apply
your self to your <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi>—Mark my
Prophecy, <hi>You are Undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXI. As difficult as it is to get a considerable
Place at <hi>Court,</hi> it is much harder yet to make
one's self worthy of it.</p>
               <p>XXII. It is hard to determine which of the
two is the greater shame, either to be deny'd a
Place we deserve, or granted one we deserve
not.</p>
               <p>* XXIII. Courtiers generally pay Services
with Smoak and fair Words, and use a world
of unprofitable Ceremony to morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Courage, Valour, Cowardise.</head>
               <p>I. THE Love of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> the Fear
of <hi>Shame,</hi> the design of promoting an
<hi>Interest,</hi> the desire of making Life easie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
and the longing of pulling down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
are oftentimes the causes of that <hi>Valour,</hi> so
much extoll'd in the World.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Valour</hi> in private <hi>Soldiers</hi> is a hazardous
Trade, to which they have bound themselves to
get a Livelihood.</p>
               <p>III. Perfect <hi>Valour</hi> and absolute <hi>Cowardise</hi> are
Extreams that few Men fall into. The vast mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle space
contains all the other kinds and degrees
of <hi>Courage,</hi> which differ no less from one another
than Mens Faces or their Humours. Some Men
are Valiant even to <hi>Temerity,</hi> in the beginning
of the <hi>Action,</hi> that are easily disheartned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
if it continue: Some satisfie themselves
with having done what was necessary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> and will hardly
be prevail'd upon to do any thing besides: Some
have the command of their <hi>Fears,</hi> and Master
them only by intervals: Others are sometimes
carry'd away by general <hi>Terrors:</hi> Others throw
themselves into the <hi>Action,</hi> not daring to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their own Post: The <hi>Courage</hi> of some has
been inur'd and harden'd against great <hi>Dangers,</hi> by
their habit and familiarity with small ones: Some
are Valiant with a <hi>Sword,</hi> that fear a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

and others are unconcern'd at the discharge of
a <hi>Musket,</hi> and frighted at the sight of a naked
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97015:26"/>
                  <hi>Sword.</hi> All these different sorts of <hi>Courage</hi> agree
in this, that Night, as it encreases the <hi>Fear,</hi> so it
conceals both brave and base <hi>Actions,</hi> and gives
every body opportunity of saving himself. There
is still another more general Tenderness of a
Man's self, for you meet with no body, that does
as much as he would be capable to do, if he was
but sure to come off safe: So that it is very
plain, that let a Man be never so <hi>Stout,</hi> yet the
fear of <hi>Death</hi> does certainly give some damp to
his <hi>Courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. True <hi>Valour</hi> consists in doing without
Witnesses, what a Man is capable to do before
all the World.</p>

<hi>Heroes</hi> remain undisturbed, and preserve the free
use of their Reason, amidst the most amazing
and terrible Accidents.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>Intrepidity</hi> is requisite to buoy up the Mind
in <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies;</hi> but <hi>Valour</hi> is alone suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to give a Man Constancy of Mind in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Actions, and the hazards of War.</p>
               <p>VII. Most Men expose themselves enough in
an Engagement to secure their <hi>Honour;</hi> but very
few are willing to expose themselves so far, as the
Design they go upon requires, to render it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful.</p>
               <p>VIII. Men are as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>XI. <hi>Valour</hi> was assign'd to Men, and <hi>Chastity</hi>
to Women, as their principal Virtues, because
they are the hardest to practise: When these
Virtues are not sustain'd and kept up, either by

be tempted to call her with the Poets, <hi>The Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  </gap>iginal is not to be
found upon Earth: And indeed it is the effect
of a thousand Actions, which instead of aiming
at it, have no other Prospect than the particular
<hi>Interest</hi> of each Combatant. For all those that
make up an <hi>Army</hi> seeking their own Honour and
Preferment, procure so great and so universal a
<hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>Cowards</hi> can never be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Their easie belief of Dangers sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
their best form'd Designs, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
their Judgments, that imaginary Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
pass with them for real Obstacles.</p>
               <p>XIV. Of all Enemies those of a <hi>Cowardly</hi>
Temper are most to be feared; their want of
<hi>Courage</hi> makes them use private Revenges and
Treacheries, when a Valiant Man attacks you
openly, and gives you warning that you may

XV. <hi>Cowards</hi> are of all Men the most distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

makes them apprehensive of imaginary

Plots and Conspiracies, which have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
no reality, but in there wounded Fancy.</p>
               <p>* XVI. <hi>Courage,</hi> without the Softness of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Courtesie and Candor, is but a savage

are hardly to be made Valiant by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
But they are conscious yet of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of that Weakness, and may make a shift, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
to reason themselves now and then into a
kind of temporary Resolution, which they have
not the power afterwards to go thorough with.</p>

within the compass of one Person.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Constancy</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> is of two sorts: One
proceeds from the discovery of new Perfection
in those we Love; the other from a point of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97015:27"/>
Honour, and a taking a pride in being <hi>Constant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. There is an <hi>Inconstancy</hi> that proceeds from
an unsettled <hi>Iudgment,</hi> a natural Levity and
Weakness that Espouses all Opinions as they
come, and thinks as other People think; and
there is another much more excusable, that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
from a dislike and disapproving of the things
themselves.</p>
               <p>IV. The Violence some Men use upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be <hi>Constant</hi> to what they <hi>Love,</hi> is little
better than <hi>Inconstancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. There is no reason to reproach <hi>Inconstancy,</hi>
as a great Crime; it is no more in the power of
certain Persons to <hi>love,</hi> or not to <hi>love,</hi> than to
be in health or out of order. All that one can

to acknowledge their Levity, and not
to add <hi>Treachery</hi> to <hi>Inconstancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. It is ordinary withsome to exclaim against
<hi>Inconstancy,</hi> and to decry those that desert them;
when at the same time they are glad to have an
Example of Change: For it happens but too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that the best establisht <hi>Friendships,</hi> the most
strict <hi>Confidences</hi> insensibly slacken; then we seek

their secret Resentments and Perturbations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:97015:28"/>
II. We often fancy to be <hi>Constant</hi> and <hi>Patient</hi>
in our Misfortunes, when we are truly dejected
and cast down: We suffer without daring to
hold up our Heads, just as <hi>Cowards</hi> let themselves
be knockt o'th' Head, because they have not
Courage enough to strike again.</p>
               <p>III. No Man can be truly <hi>good</hi> and <hi>sweet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd</hi>
without <hi>Constancy</hi> and <hi>Resolution;</hi> They that
seem to be so, have commonly an <hi>Easiness</hi> that
quickly turns pievish and sowre.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Constancy,</hi> or Resistance in Misfortunes, is
only dwelling longer upon our Miseries; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the most amiable Virtue to those who are
under no Afflictions, but is truly a new load to
such as are.</p>

the World, that would not be able to do half so
much hurt, if they had no Goodness at all.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Nothing more discredits the Violence
of Wicked Men, than the Moderation of the

than by the Wisdom of those whom they
persecute.</p>
               <p>* XIX. Innocence is no Protection against the
Arbitrary Cruelty of a Tyrannical Power; for,
accusing is proving, where Malice and Force are

               <p>IV. The absolute want of such a Sense, so as

               <p>VIII. A Wise Man ought not to be concern'd
at what is said against him; for if what they say of
us be true, it is our business rather to correct our
selves, than for others to contain themselves. If
what is said of us be false, so soon as we shall
shew a concern at it, we make it suspected for
Truth. The contempt of such Discourses dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credits
them, and takes away the Pleasure from
those that make them.</p>
               <p>* IX. There is hardly such another Pest in a
Common-wealth, as a Consort of Parasites, that
feed Governours with false Representations and
Reports of Men and of Things: They first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
their Masters to Dishonour and Ruine, and
then when they find the Vessel sinking, save
themselves in the Long-Boat.</p>
               <p>* X. Busie Bodies and Intermedlers, are a
dangerous sort of People to have to do withal;
for there's no Mischief that may not be wrought
by the craft and manage of a Double Tongue,

hardly a greater Pest to Government, Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Peace of Societies, Relations and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
than officious Tale-bearers, Whisperers,
and busie Intermedlers: These Pick-thanks are
enough to set Mankind together by the Ears;
they live upon Calumny and Slander, and cover
themselves too under the Seal of Secrecy and
Friendship. The Sin of Traducing is Diabolical,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97015:31"/>
according to the very Letter; and if the Office
be artificially manag'd, 'tis enough to put the

that kill a Man as sure as a Gun. This
Practice is the Bane of all Trust, and it is as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in the Intrigues of Courts and States, as in

to break the neck of all Honest Purposes, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

and to stiste all honourable Inclinations in the

them; but for want of fore-sight clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
or a sufficient Courage, Men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with a little, when they might do more,
making either the <hi>Meanness</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the
want of <hi>Greatness</hi> in the <hi>Soul,</hi> pass for Prudence.</p>
               <p>XXI. Whatever we undertake, we must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to our Thoughts some great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
aim, and even such as is above our reach:
For we could hardly be perswaded to begin our
Journey, if we were sure to go no farther than
we really shall.</p>
               <p>* XXII. There is not any thing so small, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there goes Art and Application toward the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of it.</p>
               <p>* XXIII. 'Tis of mighty Use to Men in any
great and daring <hi>Attempt,</hi> to have their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and others think, there is <hi>Destiny</hi> in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;

               <p>* XXIV. Any thing is a good <hi>Reason</hi> for a

               <p>* XXV. <hi>Experience</hi> makes many a Wise Man
of a Fool; and <hi>Security</hi> makes many a Fool of
a Wise Man.</p>
               <p>* XXVI. There's no forcing <hi>Nature</hi> against
her Biass, or inverting the Methods of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Irregular Desires and unreasonable
Undertakings must expect to meet with Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments:
There is a proper Time for all
Things, and nothing succeeds well, but what's
done in Season.</p>
               <p>* XXVII. Hasty Resolutions are seldom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
and it is a piece of necessary Prudence
for a Man, before he resolves any thing, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what may be the Consequences of it.</p>
               <p>* XXVIII. 'Tis matter of Skill and Address,
when a Man cannot honestly compass what he
would be at, to appear easie and indifferent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Repulses and Disappointments. Beside,
it improves all our Disappointments into Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
when we can let fall the vain desire of
any thing, without feeling the loss of it.</p>
               <p>* XXIX. <hi>Improbability</hi> and <hi>Impossibility,</hi> are two
frightful Words to weaker Minds, but by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and wise Men, they are generally found
to be only the Excuses of <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
For the most part, they lie not in the things
themselves, but in Mens false Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; they are raised by <hi>Opinions,</hi> but are
soon abolisht by <hi>Works.</hi> Many things that were
at first improbable to the Minds of Men, are
not so to their Eyes; many that seem'd unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable
to their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> are quite otherwise to
their <hi>Hands:</hi> Many that are too difficult for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97015:34"/>
their naked Hands, may be soon perform'd by
the same Hands if they are strengthen'd by
<hi>Instruments,</hi> and guided by <hi>Methods:</hi> Many that
are unmanageable by a few Hands, and a few
Instruments, are easie to the joint Force of a
Multitude: Many that fail in one <hi>Age,</hi> may

It is not therefore the conceit or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the most unlikely things for impossible; unless

                  </gap>rors of <hi>Young Men</hi> are the
ruine of Business; but the Errors of <hi>Aged Men</hi>
amount but to this, that more might have been
done, or sooner. <hi>Young Men,</hi> in the Conduct

they can hold; stir more than they can quier;

and that which doubles all Errors, will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
or retract them. <hi>Men of Age</hi> object
too much, consult too long, adventure too little,
repent too soon, and seldom drive Business
home to the full period, but content themselves
with a Mediocrity of Success. Therefore it is

               <p>I. THE <hi>Devotion</hi> of some <hi>Ladies,</hi> on the

               </p>
               <p>III. All <hi>Devotion</hi> which is not grounded upon
<hi>Christian Humility,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of one's Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
is no better than Form and Pretence. 'Tis

               </p>
               <p>VI. There is always under the greatest <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
a Proportion of <hi>Self-Love;</hi> great enough to
set Bounds to our <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. To consider purely the Repose of this
Life, it would be well if <hi>Religion</hi> had more or
less influence upon Mankind. It compels, and
does not subject enough; like some Politicks,
that take away the Sweetness of <hi>Liberty,</hi> without
bringing the Advantages of <hi>Subjection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. Nothing can be more fickle than the
Judgment of Men, as to the <hi>Religion</hi> of others;
they treat as impious Persons those who forsake

               </p>

<hi>Preachers,</hi> who offering us the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

               <p>* X. There's no such Masque for the greatest
of Impieties, as a Veil of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XI. Most People, Clergy as well as Laity,
accommodate their <hi>Religion</hi> to their Profit; and
reckon that to be the best Church there's most
to be got by.</p>
               <p>* XII. Men talk as if they believ'd in God;
but they Live as if they thought there were
none: For their very Prayers are often down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Mockeries, and their Vows and Promises
are no more than <hi>Words of Course,</hi> which they

they have once form'd in themselves a <hi>perfect

not with them in some Particulars.</p>
               <p>* XIV. Presumption leads People to Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a Trice; and so by insensible degrees to
Atheism: For when Men have once cast off a
Reverence for Religion, they are come within
one step of laughing at it.</p>
               <p>* XV. There never was an Hypocrite so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd,
but he had some Mark or other yet to
be known by.</p>
               <p>* XVI. A Religious Hypocrite is only a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
dress'd up with a Ray about him, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
into an Angel of Light. Take him in
the very Raptures of his Devotions, and do but
throw a parcel of <hi>Church-Lands</hi> in his way, he
shall leap at the Sacrilege from the very Throne
of his Glory, and Pick your Pocket, as a
<hi>French</hi> Poet says of a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> in the middle of his
<hi>Paternoster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XVII. A Man that reposes and assures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon Divine Protection and Favour, gathers
a Force and Faith, which Humane Nature in it
self could not obtain. Therefore, as <hi>Atheism</hi> is
in all respects hateful, so in this; that it deprives
Humane <hi>Nature</hi> of the means to exalt it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

               </p>
               <p>* XVIII. It were better to have no Opinion

moulded while their Tempers are yet pliant and

Habits, than to Master them; as the choaking
of the Fountain is the surest way to cut off the
Course of the River: It should be consider'd too
that we have the Seeds of Virtue in us, as well as

'tis not out of a moral Incapacity to do better,

               <p>* VI. It is not for every Twatling <hi>Gossip,</hi> or

<hi>Authority,</hi> that seems to lay us out for great
Things; 'tis a value we insensibly set upon our
selves, an imperious Challenger of the Respects
of other People; and a prevailing Quality that
raises us more above them, than either <hi>Birth</hi> or
<hi>Honours,</hi> or even <hi>Desert</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97015:37"/>
II. There is <hi>Worth</hi> sometimes without <hi>Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Preferment;</hi> But very few Men arrive to
<hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> without some <hi>Merit</hi> or
other.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> set off <hi>Merit,</hi> as
good <hi>Dressing</hi> does handsome Persons.</p>
               <p>IV. The generality of Men seem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itter for
those <hi>Employments</hi> they have not, than for those
they stand already possest of.</p>
               <p>V. When a Man leaps into a great Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to which he is neither advanced by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
nor raised before by his own Hopes; it
is scarce possible for him to maintain his Post
with Honour, and make the World think he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
his <hi>Character.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. We may seem <hi>great</hi> in an <hi>Employment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
our <hi>desert;</hi> but we generally look very little
in one <hi>above</hi> it.</p>
               <p>VII. Good Fortune almost always alters the
Proceedings and the Air of a Man, and makes
him quite another thing in all his Behaviour and
Conversation. This is a great Weakness to trick
and set one's self off with what is not our own.
If <hi>Virtue</hi> were esteem'd above all other things, no
<hi>Favour,</hi> no <hi>Advancement,</hi> would be able to change
Men either in their <hi>Temper</hi> or <hi>Countenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. It is a common thing to imagine we love
a Man of great <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> with a very
sincere <hi>Passion;</hi> But this is what we cannot be
sure of till he be stripp'd of all the Advantages
of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Greatness.</hi> Then one quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
what it was that engag'd our Affection; if
<hi>Interest</hi> were at the bottom of it, <hi>Honour</hi> may keep
it up for some time, yet it quickly grows weary,
and lets it fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:97015:38"/>
IX. <hi>False Greatness</hi> is wild and untractable; for
knowing her own weak side, she either hides her
self, or never shews her self more than she thinks
necessary to impose upon the World, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
being taken for what she really is, I mean,
true <hi>Littlenes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. True Greatness,</hi> on the contrary,
is free, courteous, and popular; she is contented
to be seen and handled, and loses nothing by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
examin'd at close view. The more a Man
knows her, the more he admires her: She bends
out of Humanity to her Inferiours, and returns
back to her natural Size without straining her
self; sometimes she neglects her self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>its
some of her Prerogatives, because, she knows,
she can resume them again at pleasure. She
laughs, she plays, but still with Dignity. A Man
approaches her with no less freedom than Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection;
her Character is to be Noble and
E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sy; she inspires Men with Respect and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and makes some <hi>Princes</hi> appear <hi>great,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making us sensible that we are <hi>little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. Of all the Methods of making one's <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
in the <hi>World,</hi> the readi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t and most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
is to make other People find their <hi>Interest</hi> in
doing us good.</p>
               <p>XI. There are but two general Methods
whereby Men raise themselves in the <hi>World,</hi> that
is, either by a Man's own <hi>Industry,</hi> or the <hi>Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity</hi>
of others.</p>
               <p>XII. We make a good Composition with our
<hi>Friends,</hi> if being preferr'd to a considerable Post,
they will count us among their Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>XIII. It is not so difficult to raise one's self to a
Place of great Trust, as to maintain one's self in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:97015:38"/>
XIV. We see oftentimes Men fall from a high
Fortune, by the same defaults that had raised
them to it.</p>
               <p>* XV. To scorn the Pomp and Greatness of
the World before a Man knows them, does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
rather from ill Manners, than Magnanimity.</p>
               <p>* XVI. Might and Right are inseparable in
the Opinion of the World; and he that has the
longer Sword, shall never want either Lawyers or
Divines to defend his Claim.</p>
               <p>* XVII. People should have Care how they
engage themselves in Partnerships with Men,
that are too mighty for them, whether it be in
Mony, Pleasure, or Business; for in unequal
Alliances, the Poor and the Weak lie at the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Rich and the Powerful, and no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but Patience and Resignation. Men in Power
plunge their Clients into the Mud, with a Ring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their Necks; so that let them bring up what
they will, nothing goes down with them that
they shall be ever the better for: And when they
come in conclusion to cast up the Profit and Loss
of the Purchase, or the Project; what betwixt
Force, Interest, and good Manners, the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer
scapes well if he can but get off at last with
his <hi>Labour for his Pains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XVIII. There are some malicious spiteful
People, that take so much Pleasure in the design
of hurting others, as not to feel and understand
that they only hurt themselves. This is the Case of
those that will be trying Masteries with their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
and biting of that which is too hard
for their Teeth; but this is no better than down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Madness, to strike where we have no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97015:39"/>
Power to hurt, and to contend where we are
sure to be worsted.</p>
               <p>* XIX. Men in <hi>great Place</hi> are thrice <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi>
Servants of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> or <hi>State;</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of <hi>Fame;</hi> and Servants of <hi>Business.</hi> So as
they have no Freedom either in their <hi>Persons,</hi> in
their <hi>Actions,</hi> or in their <hi>Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XX. It is a strange desire to seek <hi>Power</hi> and to
lose <hi>Liberty;</hi> or to seek Power over <hi>others,</hi> and
to lose Power over a Man's own self.</p>
               <p>XXI. The Advantages of the <hi>Great Ones</hi> over
other People are in some respects extraordinary.
I can yield them their Choice Dishes, their Rich
Furniture, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine Liveries, their Dogs, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Jesters and Flatterers; but I cannot but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
their Happiness, of having in their Service
those that are equal, nay sometimes Superiour to
them in Wit and noble Inclinations.</p>
               <p>XXII. It costs the <hi>Great Ones</hi> so little to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
in Words; and their <hi>Quality</hi> so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses
with them, for not performing what they
Promise; that I look upon it as a great piece of
<hi>Modesty,</hi> their not being more free of their <hi>Promises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIII. We get a great deal more by forsaking
the great Ones, than by complaining of them.</p>
               <p>XXIV. A Coldness in those that are above
us, a neglect in not returning a Civility, makes
us perfectly hate them; but a Salute or a Smile,
brings 'em back to our Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>XXV. There are a sort of haughty proud Men,
that are humbl'd and <hi>tam'd,</hi> If I may use the
Expression, by the Preferment of their Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors.
This Misfortune sometimes prevails upon
them so far, as to make them return you a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97015:39"/>
But <hi>Time,</hi> the great Waster of all Things,
insensibly softens their Grief, and puts them at
last into their natural byass.</p>
               <p>XXVI. 'Tis mere Hypocrisy for a Man in
an Eminent Station, not to take at first the place
which is due to his Quality, and which no body
disputes with him: It is an easie matter for
him to be Modest; for if he throws himself into
a Crowd, every body presently shrinks back to
make way for him; or if he sits below his Rank,
all the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st of the Company presently forces him
to sit higher. Modesty is of much harder di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
to Men of an inferiour Condition; for
if they chance to be in a Crowd, they run the
hazard of being squeez'd to death; or if they
chuse to sit in an uneasie Place, they are sure
to be left to the free Enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p>XXVII. The <hi>Great Ones</hi> have no reason to
love the First Times; they are not favourable to
them in the least: 'Tis a kind of Mortification
for them to see that we all come from Brothers
and Sisters, and that all Men compose but one
Family, whose several Members only differ as
to the degrees of Kindred.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. If the <hi>Great Ones</hi> have the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of doing us good, they have seldom the good
will to do it; and if they have a mind to do us
harm, they do not always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind the Occasions;
so that a Man may be extreamly mistaken in
the kind and degree of Worship he pays them,
upon the account of the good or ill he expects
from them: We ought to honour and respect
them, because they are <hi>great</hi> and we are <hi>little,</hi> and
because there are others <hi>less</hi> than we that respect
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97015:40"/>
XXIX. We ought to be very much reserv'd
upon the <hi>Great Ones:</hi> There is generally a great
deal of Flattery in the Praises we give them; and
it is as dangerous to speak ill of them when they
are alive, as 'tis base when they are out of the
way.</p>
               <p>* XXX. It is a common thing for Men to
hate the Authors of their Preferments, as the
Witnesses of their mean Original.</p>
               <p>* XXXI. A Man that enters the <hi>World</hi> must
be <hi>Industrious,</hi> but not affected in disclosing his
<hi>Abilities:</hi> The best way is to observe a <hi>Gradati
on,</hi> for the lowest steps to <hi>Greatness</hi> are the most
secure; but swift Rises are often attended with
precipitate Falls; and what is soonest got, is
generally short in the Possession.</p>
               <p>* XXXII. A Man rais'd to <hi>Grandeurs,</hi> that
makes others find their Fortunes in his, joins a
great <hi>Merit</hi> to a great <hi>Happiness:</hi> He is not the
more happy by the Wealth which he enjoys,
than by that which he knows how to give.</p>
               <p>* XXXIII. 'Tis a Consolation for <hi>Inferiour</hi>
Persons to find their Infirmities in those that have
the Authority to govern them; and a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to those that are distinguished by <hi>Power,</hi>
to be made, like others, for <hi>Pleasures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXIV. He that is <hi>asham'd</hi> of a mean <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
would be proud of a Splendid one.</p>
               <p>* XXXV. Great Men had need borrow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mens Opinions, to think themselves happy;
for if they judge by their own Fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, they
cannot find it.</p>
               <p>* XXXVI. In <hi>Place</hi> there is License to do
Good and Evil, whereof the latter is a Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97015:40"/>
for in Evil the best Condition is not to <hi>Will,</hi> the
second not to <hi>Can;</hi> but power to do good is the
true and lawful end of Aspiring; for good
Thoughts, tho God accept them, yet towards
Men are little better than good Dreams, except
they be put in use, and that cannot be without
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXVII. A <hi>Place</hi> shews the Man; some
for the better, and some for the worse.</p>
               <p>* XXXVIII. It is an assured sign of a worthy
and generous Spirit, whom <hi>Honour</hi> mends; for
<hi>Honour</hi> is, or should be, the place of <hi>Virtue:</hi> And
as in Nature things move violently to their <hi>Place,</hi>
and calmly in their <hi>Place:</hi> So Virtue in Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is violent, in Authority settled and calm.</p>
               <p>* XXXIX. <hi>Ostentation</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> upon the
account of <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Preferments,</hi> is much
more offensive, than upon any personal Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
It argues Men do not deserve great
Places, when they can value themselves upon
them; if a Man would be truly valued, the way
to it is to be illustriously <hi>Good.</hi> For even the
greatest Men are more respected for the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of their <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> than for that of
their <hi>Fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XL. Great <hi>Offices</hi> and great <hi>Honours</hi> are most
truly said to be great Burdens; the slavery of
them is but so much the greater, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Service of the <hi>Publick,</hi> who of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
is the hardest to be pleas'd.</p>
               <p>XLI. 'Tis no small Misfortune for Great
Men to have but few things to with or hope for,
and to have thousands to lose.</p>

               <p>I. MEN are often so foolish as to boast and
value themselves upon their <hi>Passions,</hi>
even those that are most vicious. But Envy is so
ungenerous and shameful a Passion, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ever had the Confidence to own it.</p>
               <p>II. There is something to be said for <hi>Iealousie,</hi>
because it only designs the Preservation of some
good, which we either have, or think we have
a right to. But <hi>Envy</hi> is a raging Madness that
cannot be satisfied with the good of any body.</p>
               <p>III. The Applause we give to Men that are
just setting up for Reputation in the <hi>World,</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from a Spirit of <hi>Envy,</hi> and a secret way of
detracting from others, that have established a
good Reputation to themselves already.</p>
               <p>IV. Our <hi>Envy</hi> out lives generally the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of those we <hi>Envy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. There are fewer Men free from <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than void of <hi>Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. If we look nicely into the several Effects
of <hi>Envy,</hi> it will be found to carry a Man farther
from his <hi>Duty,</hi> than <hi>Interest</hi> does.</p>
               <p>VII. The surest sign of a great and noble <hi>Soul,</hi>
is to be free from <hi>Envy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. <hi>Envy</hi> is less capable of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> than
<hi>Hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. That Man that complains of being born
to Misfortunes and Crosses, might in a great
measure become happy by the Prosperity of his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97015:41"/>
Friends and Relations, but <hi>Envy</hi> bereaves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this last Shift.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>Envy</hi> pretends to no other Happiness than
what it derives from the Misery of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and will rather eat nothing it self, than
not starve those that would. There is in this
Malevolence somewhat of the Punishment, as
well as the Spite of the Damn'd: They take
delight in other Peoples Miseries, and at the
same time are their own Tormentors.</p>
               <p>* XI. A Man that has no Vertue in himself,
ever <hi>envies</hi> Virtue in others. For Men's Minds
will either feed upon their own Good, or upon
others Evil; and who wanteth the one, will
prey upon the other; and who is so out of
hope to attain to anothers Virtue, will seek to
come at even hand by depressing anothers For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>* XII. Men of Noble Birth are noted to be
<hi>Envious</hi> towards new Nobility when they rise:
For the distance is alter'd; and it is like a deceit
of the Eye, that when others come on, they
think themselves go back.</p>
               <p>* XIII. They that desire to excel in too

               <p>I. NOthing is of so infectious and pestilent
a Nature as <hi>Example;</hi> and no Man
does any exceeding good, or very ill thing, but
it produces others of the same kind. We imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Good out of <hi>Emulation,</hi> and the bad out
of our natural <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Malignity;</hi> which
being confin'd and kept up close by <hi>Shame,</hi> is

               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>Imitation</hi> always succeeds ill; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is counterfeit and affected, grows nauseous
and disgraceful, with those things, which when
<hi>Natural,</hi> are most graceful and charming.</p>
               <p>III. We are better pleas'd with those that

of his way; and that which is best for every
Man, is fittest for him too: He does it with ease
and success, whereas all <hi>Imitation</hi> is putid and
servile.</p>

               <head>Failings, Defects.</head>
               <p>I. EVery Man generally finds those <hi>Faults</hi>
in others, which others find in him.</p>
               <p>II. If we had no <hi>Failings</hi> of our own, we
should not be half so much delighted, as we are,
at the discovery of those of other People.</p>
               <p>III. Men are not so unacquainted with their
own <hi>Failings,</hi> as we are apt to imagine; for
they are seldom in the wrong, when we hear
them talk of their Conduct. The same <hi>Self-Love</hi>
that blinds them at other times, guides
them on these occasions, with so quick and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
a <hi>Light,</hi> as to make them either sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
or disguise the least matters that are liable
to be condemned.</p>
               <p>IV. Our bad <hi>Qualities</hi> generally take better
in the intercourse of familiar Conversation, than
our good ones.</p>
               <p>V. The <hi>defects</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> like the Wrinkles
and Blemishes of the <hi>Face,</hi> grow still proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
with Age.</p>
               <p>VI. Men make themselves ridiculous, not so
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97015:43"/>
much by the <hi>Qualities</hi> they have, as by the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of those they have not.</p>
               <p>VII. As some Men displease with <hi>Merit,</hi> so
on the other hand, some are pleasant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with <hi>Failings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. We confess our <hi>Faults</hi> by that Sincerity,
to make amends for the injury they have done
us in the Esteem of others.</p>
               <p>IX. 'Tis only for great Men, to have great
<hi>Failings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. The <hi>Defects</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> are like <hi>Wounds</hi> in
the <hi>Body;</hi> which never can be so well heal'd
up, but there remains still a <hi>Scar,</hi> which is in a
continual Danger to break out again.</p>
               <p>XI. We own our small <hi>Failings,</hi> with a design,
to make People believe that we have no great
ones.</p>
               <p>XII. There are some <hi>Failings,</hi> which when
ingeniously manag'd and improv'd, make a
brighter shew than <hi>Virtue</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>XIII. We have not the Confidence to say in
general Terms, that our selves have no ill <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
and that our Enemies have no good ones;
but when we talk of Particulars, we are pretty
near thinking so.</p>
               <p>XIV. The greatest part of our <hi>Faults</hi> are
more excusable, than the Methods we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
use to conceal them.</p>
               <p>XV. We value our selves and take a pride in
the <hi>Faults</hi> most distant from our own; when
we are fickle and irresolute, we brag of being
obstinate and peremptory.</p>
               <p>XVI. We easily forgive our <hi>Friends</hi> those <hi>Faults,</hi>
that are not contrary to our Interests.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:97015:43"/>
XVII. Most Men attempt to vindicate and
take a pride in those <hi>Faults</hi> they have no design
to mend.</p>
               <p>XVIII. A great many Men, as if they had
not <hi>Faults</hi> enough, are still perpetually adding
to the number of them, by the Affectation of
some particular <hi>Qualities,</hi> which they cherish
and cultivate so carefully, that they come at
last to be <hi>natural,</hi> and past their power to mend,
though they would.</p>
               <p>XIX. Most Men are asham'd of their <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit,</hi>
when they come to know their <hi>Failings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XX. <hi>Gravity</hi> is a mysterious Behaviour of the
<hi>Body,</hi> to conceal the <hi>Defects</hi> of the <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXI. Prosperous Persons seldom mend their
<hi>Faults;</hi> they always think themselves in the
right, so long as <hi>Fortune</hi> Countenances their ill
Conduct.</p>
               <p>XXII. The Counterfeit Honest Man disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his <hi>Faults</hi> to others and himself; the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
Honest Man knows his own <hi>Failings</hi>
perfectly, and confesses them ingenuously.</p>
               <p>XXIII. The grace of <hi>Novelty,</hi> and the length
of <hi>Custom,</hi> though never so opposite to each
other, yet do both alike disguise to us the <hi>Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of our <hi>Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. There are no good <hi>Copies,</hi> except such
as expose the <hi>Ridicule</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of the <hi>Original.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXV. Few Men fear to be despis'd, except
those who really deserve to be so.</p>
               <p>XXVI. It argues a great Mind, the free and
sincere confessing both of our <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVII. Did Men but take as much care to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97015:44"/>
mend, as they do to conceal their <hi>Failings;</hi> they
would both spare themselves that trouble which
Dissimulation puts them to; and gain over and
above the Commendations they aspire to by
their seeming Virtues.</p>
               <p>* XXVIII. When a Man has any notable
Defect or Infirmity about him, whether by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or by Chance, 'tis the best of his play, to
try the Humour, if he can turn it into a Fashion.</p>
               <p>XXIX. To deny our <hi>Faults</hi> when others are
acquainted with them, serves but to make us
the more ridiculous, by adding Arrogance to
our first Error.</p>
               <p>XXX. We may learn as much by other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
<hi>Faults,</hi> as by their <hi>Instructions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXI. It is an ordinary <hi>Failing</hi> with most
Men, never to be contented with their <hi>Fortune,</hi>
or dissatisfied with their <hi>Wit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXII. As <hi>Perfumes</hi> affect more strongly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People, than those that carry 'em; so the
<hi>Failings</hi> of others offend us much sooner than our
own. The continual Commerce we have with
our Inclinations, disguises them to us. Nothing
is new in our selves, but every thing appears so
in others. Our Reason contracts a kind of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
and Friendship with our <hi>Defaults,</hi> when
at the same time it weighs, examines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
those of our Neighbours with the utmost
Severities.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. There is ne'er a Man so perfect and
necessary to his <hi>Friends,</hi> but he has some <hi>Defect</hi>
or other, that Counterbalances in some measure
his good Qualities, and renders his loss less sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to those that out-live him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97015:44"/>
XXXIV. Men are not so much asham'd of
their <hi>Crimes,</hi> as they are of their <hi>Weakness</hi> and
<hi>Vanity.</hi> He that is openly Unjust, Violent, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidious
and a Slanderer, conceals his <hi>Love</hi> or his
<hi>Ambition,</hi> with no other design, than to conceal
it only.</p>
               <p>* XXXV. Men labour under many Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
that no body would take notice of, if
themselves were not over-sollicitous to conceal
them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Families, Masters, Servants.</head>
               <p>I. MOst <hi>Masters</hi> cry out upon all <hi>Servants,</hi>
that they are Rogues, and the
Plagues of a <hi>Family;</hi> and if <hi>Servants</hi> ever come
to be <hi>Masters,</hi> they will say just the same thing.
The Reason is, because generally it is not the
Qualities, but the Fortunes of Men, that make
the difference between them.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Families</hi> are often inwardly torn and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by Distrusts, Jealousies and Antipathies;
while a contented, cheerful and smiling <hi>Out side</hi>
imposes upon the World, and makes us imagine,
that there is nothing but Peace and Quietness
<hi>Within:</hi> There are few <hi>Houses</hi> that get any thing
by being too nicely look'd into; and Visits ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
suspend a Domestick Quarrel, which
will begin afresh as soon as the Company goes off.</p>
               <p>* III. No Men are so strict Exacters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
in a Servant, as those that are most prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
of their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97015:45"/>
* IV. Age is well-nigh sufficient to deface
with some Masters every Letter and Action in
the History of a Meritorious Life; and old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
are generally bury'd under the Ruins of an
old Carcass.</p>
               <p>* V. 'Tis a common thing for a <hi>Master</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
a <hi>Servant</hi> to his own Ease and Interest;
but there's no medling with Men of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hospitable
Humour, where the <hi>Domesticks,</hi> how
faithful soever, can never be secure.</p>
               <p>* VI. It is a barbarous Inhumanity in Great
Men to their Servants, to make their small Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to be a Crime, without allowing their past
Services to have been a Virtue; and this is
found with Masters and Mistresses, as well in
Courts as in private Families; where one s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is oftentimes enough to deface the Character
of an honourable Life.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Fidelity, Insidelity.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>SMall Infidelities,</hi> whereby our selves are
Sufferers, lessen the <hi>Committers</hi> of them in
our Esteem, more than great ones committed
against other People.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Fidelity</hi> in most Men, is nothing else but
a <hi>Contrivance</hi> of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> to make our selves
trusted. It is a Trick to raise our selves above
other People, and get the most important Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
deposited in our hands.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:97015:45"/>
               <head>Flattery, Praise.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>FLattery</hi> is a False Coyn, which our own
<hi>Vanity</hi> has made Current.</p>
               <p>II. Men never would enjoy much <hi>Pleasure,</hi> if
they never <hi>flatter'd</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>III. If we did not <hi>flatter</hi> our selves, the <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi>
of others could never hurt us.</p>
               <p>IV. No body loves to be upon the <hi>Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Strain; and indeed we seldom touch upon it
without some By-End. <hi>Praise</hi> is a more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
conceal'd, and nicer kind of a <hi>Flattery,</hi> which
humours and affects severally, both the <hi>Giver</hi>
and <hi>Receiver;</hi> the one accepts it as a Reward
due to his Merit; the other gives it, that he may
be lookt upon as a just and discreet Person.</p>
               <p>V. We extol and value the Excellencies of other
People, rather out of the Esteem of our own
Opinions, than of their Worth; and when we
pretend to commend other Men's Virtues, 'tis
but a Side-wind to put other Men upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
ours.</p>
               <p>VI. We often choose to make use of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,</hi>
that carry a Sting in the Tail; and
by taking Men at the rebound, as it were, lay
open some <hi>Defects</hi> in the Persons so commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which we dare not venture to expose any
other way.</p>
               <p>VII. Few Men are so wife as to prefer useful
<hi>Reproofs</hi> to treacherous <hi>Praise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. As there are commending <hi>Reproofs,</hi>
so there are abusive <hi>Praises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:97015:46"/>
IX. He that declines Praise the first time it is
offer'd, does it from a desire of being prais'd
over again.</p>
               <p>X. The desire of being worthy the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of the World, is a great assistance
and strengthning to our Virtues; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
of Men's <hi>Wit, Courage,</hi> or <hi>Beauty,</hi> goes a
great way towards the encrease of them.</p>
               <p>XI. We generally pull down one Man's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>
to set up anothers; and sometimes Men
would not enlarge so much upon the Praise of
the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and Mareschal <hi>Turenne,</hi> if
it were not out of a design to lessen them both.</p>
               <p>XII. We seldom commend any body in
Goodness, except those as admire us.</p>
               <p>XIII. To commend <hi>Princes</hi> for <hi>Virtues</hi> they
have not, is no better than a safe way to abuse
them.</p>
               <p>XIV. Nothing so much lessens the Merit of
those that have deserv'd great <hi>Praises,</hi> than the
trouble they are eternally at, to make themselves
valued by Trifles.</p>
               <p>XV. When we commend good and noble
<hi>Actions,</hi> we make them in some measure our
own.</p>
               <p>XVI. Nothing ought in Reason to mortifie
our Self-Satisfaction, more than our applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and crying up at one time, what we blame
and run down at another.</p>
               <p>XVII. Former <hi>Times</hi> are sometimes cry'd
up, only to run down the present, and we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
what is now no more, that we may slight
that which is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:97015:46"/>
XVIII. Men fancy sometimes they have an
Aversion to <hi>Flattery,</hi> when it is only to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of being <hi>flatter'd:</hi> And that <hi>Modesty</hi> that
would seem to decline <hi>Praise,</hi> is at the bottom
only a desire of having it better exprest.</p>
               <p>* XIX. There is a kind of Insinuation and
Compliance, that is far from any servile Baseness,
or sordid <hi>Flattery,</hi> and may be term'd <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi>
rather than <hi>Adulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XX. Whosoever is vext at a <hi>Reproach,</hi>
would be Proud if he were commended.</p>
               <p>* XXI. 'Tis difficult to write justly in any
thing, but almost impossible in <hi>Praise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXII. There are some Men greedy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that love <hi>Praise</hi> even from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sort, and are less satisfied to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a few Judicious Persons, than to be
admired by an ignorant Multitude.</p>
               <p>XXIII. To <hi>commend the Great Ones,</hi> is a
nice Phrase in its Original, and signifies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
to <hi>commend one's Self,</hi> by publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the good a Man rais'd in Honours
has done us, or that he ever design'd to do
us.</p>
               <p>XXIV. We generally <hi>commend</hi> the Great
Ones, to acquaint others that we approach
them, and very seldom out of Esteem or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:
Nay, sometimes we commend those
we never saw in our Lives; and which is
yet more strange, there are Occasions where
our <hi>Vanity</hi> prevails against our <hi>Resentments,</hi> and
makes us commend those, of whom we have
reason to complain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:97015:47"/>
XXV. All the Fortune of a <hi>Prince,</hi> is too
little to recompense a base Flatterer, if he
designs to make him amends for what he forfeits
of his own, (I mean, his Honour and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:)
But on the other hand, all the Power
of a <hi>Prince</hi> is not too great to punish him, if
he will make his Revenge proportionable to
the Wrong he suffers by being flatter'd.</p>
               <p>XXVI. A <hi>Flatterer</hi> has neither good Opinion
of himself, nor others.</p>
               <p>XXVII. 'Twould be a kind of Fierceness
and Brutality, for a Man to reject all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Praises:</hi> We may be sensible to those of
the <hi>Good,</hi> because they commend in us nothing
but what really deserves to be commended.</p>
               <p>* XXVIII. There's hardly any Man living,
that may not be wrought upon more or less,
by Flattery: For we do all of us naturally
over-wean in our own Favour; but when it
comes to be apply'd once to a vain Fool, it
makes him forty times an Arranter Sot, than
he was before.</p>
               <p>* XXIX. <hi>Flattery</hi> will never be out of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
so long as there are Knaves to give it, and
Fools to take it.</p>
               <p>* XXX. <hi>Flattery</hi> is never more Pernicious,
than in the Courts of Princes, because a good
deal of it looks like Duty; as in private Cases
it carries a face of Friendship. The way to
rise, is to please, and whatsoever is gotten by it,
comes by Treachery.</p>
               <p>* XXXI. The only benefit or good of <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
is this; that by hearing what we are not,
we may be instructed what we ought to be.</p>

               </p>
               <p>III. Though Men are apt to flatter and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue

of Design and Industry, but generally of

               </p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Fortune</hi> turns and converts every thing to

               </p>
               <p>V. Our <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> depends as
much upon our own <hi>Humour,</hi> as upon <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. Our <hi>Actions</hi> seem to be influenc'd by
lucky and unlucky <hi>Stars,</hi> to which they owe
the greatest part of the <hi>Praise</hi> or <hi>Blame,</hi> which
is given to the <hi>Actions</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>VII. No Man can tell what he will do,

               <p>VIII. <hi>Fortune</hi> mends many <hi>Faults</hi> in us, which

               <p>X. The making of a Great Man depends
upon the improving all <hi>Accidents</hi> to some Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Opportunities</hi> make us known to others,
but much more to our selves.</p>
               <p>XII. Men appear Vicious or Honest, more
or less, according to the Station they are in;
so that <hi>Fortune</hi> is to <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices,</hi> what <hi>Light</hi>
is to the <hi>Objects</hi> of the Sight.</p>
               <p>XIII. No body thinks <hi>Fortune</hi> so blind, as
those she has been cross to.</p>
               <p>XIV. We should manage our selves with our
<hi>Fortune,</hi> as we do with our <hi>Health;</hi> enjoy it
when <hi>Good;</hi> bear it patiently, when <hi>Ill;</hi> and
never use desperate <hi>Remedies,</hi> but upon despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Occasions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. <hi>Fortune</hi> oftentimes makes a Man's <hi>Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
the means of his rise; and there are
some troublesom impertinent Coxcombs, who
deserve to be rewarded so far, as to have
their <hi>Absence</hi> purchased by Preferment at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>XVI. Men's Merit is generally judg'd of by
the <hi>Vogue</hi> of the Fortune they are in.</p>
               <p>XVII. There is an Excess both in <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>ill Fortune,</hi> which is beyond our Sensibility.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Greater <hi>Virtues</hi> are required to bear
a <hi>good,</hi> than <hi>ill Fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. <hi>Fortune</hi> has as great an Influence upon
our <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as upon our <hi>Possessions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:97015:48"/>
XX. The generality of Men are like Plants,
whose <hi>Virtues</hi> and unheeded <hi>Properties</hi> are sound
out by <hi>Chance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXI. <hi>Fortune</hi> gives out the <hi>Parts</hi> Men are
to play upon this <hi>Stage</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> blindly,
and just according to her unaccountable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
this is the reason why there is so much
ill <hi>Acting;</hi> because Men very seldom hit upon
those Characters that are fit for them. Or to
speak in a more <hi>Christian</hi> Style, what we call
<hi>Fortune,</hi> is no other than the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
which permits these disorders, for <hi>Reasons</hi> which
we are not able to dive into.</p>
               <p>XXII. Great <hi>Politicians,</hi> manage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>Fortune,</hi> as great Captains do their <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIII. As much as Men rail at <hi>Fortune</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Account of her <hi>Blindness</hi> and <hi>Whimsies,</hi>
yet it must be confest, that there is no Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
like hers. Her designs are so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,
and carried on with such a Dexterity,
that it is past our fore-sight to prevent them;
and in spite of our own Conduct, she never
fails to bring about her Undertakings.</p>
               <p>XXIV. <hi>Fortune</hi> makes <hi>Crimes</hi> pass for <hi>Frolicks</hi>
in her Favourites; and <hi>Frolicks</hi> for <hi>Crimes</hi> in
those she's averse to.</p>
               <p>XXV. The Caprices of <hi>Fortune</hi> are observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in Men's <hi>Opinions,</hi> as well as in their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.
Some Years ago the <hi>Pope</hi> was Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
at <hi>Paris</hi> no less than at <hi>Rome:</hi> But now
he is accounted liable to Errors in <hi>France,</hi> while
he remains still Infallible in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:97015:49"/>
* XXVI. When things go ill, each Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
sets up for a States-man, and thinks
himself the wisest if he chances to be more
happy than his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>* XXVII. There are certain Moments of
our Lives, wherein <hi>Fate</hi> delights to mock our
Wit and Prudence, to baf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le our strict Caution,
and ridicule all our Conduct, that we may learn
the Lesson of <hi>Resignation,</hi> and not trust too
much to our selves.</p>
               <p>* XXVIII. <hi>Fortune</hi> is like the Market, where
many times, if you can stay a little, the Price
will fall. And again, it is sometimes like <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billa</hi>'s
offer, which at first offers the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
at full, then consumes part and part, and
still holds up the Price.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Friendship.</head>
               <p>I. WHat we call <hi>Friendship</hi> is no more
than an Intercourse of <hi>Society;</hi> 'tis
only a mutual Care and Management of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,</hi>
and an exchange of good Turns and
Services. In a Word, it is only a sort of
<hi>Traffick,</hi> in which <hi>Self-Love</hi> has always Profit
in Prospect.</p>
               <p>II. That which makes Men so unsteady and
fickle in <hi>Friendship,</hi> is both the difficulty of
knowing the Qualities and Dispositions of the
<hi>Soul,</hi> and the Facility of knowing those of the
<hi>Wit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:97015:49"/>
III. It is impossible for Men to love any
thing without some respect to their private
<hi>Interests:</hi> And we only follow our own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Pleasure, when we prefer our
<hi>Friends</hi> before our selves; and yet this Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is the only thing that can render <hi>Friendship</hi>
perfect and sincere.</p>
               <p>IV. The <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of Enemies, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Men's desire to better their Condition;
a Weariness of Acts of Hostility, and a fear
of some ill Accident, which they are willing to
prevent.</p>
               <p>V. 'Tis more disgraceful for a Man to distrust
his <hi>Friends,</hi> than to be cozen'd by them.</p>
               <p>VI. We oftentimes fancy that we love Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in Authority, when it is nothing but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
that makes us fond of them. And all our
Applications and Attendances are not so much
upon the account of any good we desire to do
them, as for what we expect and hope they
may do us.</p>
               <p>VII. It shews that our Affection is but small,
when we are not sensible of our Friends Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Indifference.</p>
               <p>VIII. Most <hi>Friends</hi> create a disgust for <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and most Religious Hypocrites for <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. We often complain of our <hi>Friends</hi> Fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
only to justifie before-hand our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy.</p>
               <p>X. We are but little concern'd for our <hi>Friends</hi>
disgraces when they give as an occasion of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalizing
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enderness for them.</p>
               <p>XI. When we proclaim and aggravate the
Tenderness our <hi>Friends</hi> have for us; 'tis not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97015:50"/>
so much out of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> as from a desire to
possess other People with a good Opinion of
our own Worth.</p>
               <p>XII. 'Tis not an easie matter to love those,
for whom we have not a real Esteem; but 'tis
much harder still to love those, that we think
deserve a great deal more than our selves.</p>
               <p>XIII. No Man can continue long in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he owes to his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Benefactors,</hi>
that allows himself the liberty to talk of their
<hi>Faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIV. We may sooner be brought to love
those that hate us, than those that love us more
than we desire they should.</p>
               <p>XV. The boldest Attempt of <hi>Friendship,</hi> is
not to discover our <hi>Failings</hi> to a <hi>Friend,</hi> but to
shew him his own.</p>
               <p>XVI. The Deceitfulness of our <hi>Friends</hi> may
justifie our Indifference to the Expressions of
their Tenderness; but in no manner, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibility
to their Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>XVII. The Reason why most <hi>Ladies</hi> are so
little affected by <hi>Friendship,</hi> is, because it tastes
very flat and insipid, after the Relishing of
<hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. In <hi>Friendship</hi> as well as <hi>Love, Ignorance</hi>
very often contributes more to our Happiness,
than <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. There is a certain <hi>Relish</hi> in true <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
above the sensibility of those that are <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
born.</p>
               <p>XX. Time strengthens <hi>Friendships,</hi> and weakens
<hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:97015:50"/>
XXI. As long as Love lasts, it subsists by it
self; nay, sometimes by those very things that
seem to be most for its Destruction, as <hi>Caprices,</hi>
Cruelties, Absence and Jealousies. <hi>Friendship,</hi>
on the contrary, must have something to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it, and faints away for want of mutual
Offices, Confidences and Complaisance.</p>
               <p>XXII. <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship</hi> do reciprocally
exclude one another.</p>
               <p>XXIII. <hi>Hatred</hi> is not so far from <hi>Friendship,</hi>
as <hi>Antipathy</hi> is.</p>
               <p>XXIV. To live with our <hi>Friends,</hi> as if they
were to be one day our <hi>Enemies;</hi> and with our
<hi>Enemies</hi> as with those that may become our
<hi>Friends,</hi> is neither according to the Rules of
<hi>Friendship,</hi> nor the Nature of <hi>Hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXV. We ought to take Care not to make
those our <hi>Enemies,</hi> which if better known, we
should be glad to count among our <hi>Friends:</hi>
And on the other side, we ought to chuse <hi>Friends</hi>
so true and so honest, that when they cease to
be so, will scorn to take an Advantage against
us, of our former Confidence.</p>
               <p>XXVI. Men can never go a great way in
<hi>Friendship,</hi> without a Disposition to wink mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
at one anothers small Defects.</p>
               <p>* XXVII. There's more hazard in the Succour
of a new powerful Friend, than in the Hostility
of an old dangerous Enemy.</p>
               <p>* XXVIII. A principal fruit of <hi>Friendship,</hi> is,
the ease and discharge of the fulness and swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Heart, which are caused by Passions
of all kinds. We know Diseases of Stoppings
and Suffocations are the most dangerous in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97015:51"/>
Body, and it is not much otherwise in the
Mind.</p>
               <p>* XXIX. We may observe how high a rate
Princes do set upon this <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendship,</hi> since
they purchase it many times at the hazard of
their own Safety and Greatness. For Princes,
by reason of the distance of their Fortune from
that of their Subjects and Servants, cannot ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this <hi>Fruit</hi> except they raise some Persons
to be as it were Companions, and almost equal
to themselves, which many times proves of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Consequence.</p>
               <p>XXX. As uncommon a thing as <hi>True-Love</hi> is,
it is yet more frequent than <hi>True-friendship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXI. True Friendship destroys <hi>Envy,</hi> as
<hi>True-Love</hi> breaks a <hi>Coquet</hi> Humour.</p>
               <p>XXXII. Though we ought not to love our
<hi>Friends,</hi> only for the good they do us, yet it is a
plain case, they love not us, if they do not do
us good, when they have it in their power.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. Though the generality of <hi>Friendships</hi>
contracted in the World, do by no means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that honourable Name; yet a Man may
very well make his best of them, as he sees oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
as of a Trade, that is not fixed upon
any sure Fund, and where nothing is more usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
than to find our selves cheated.</p>
               <p>XXXIV. There is in all <hi>Sciences</hi> some <hi>Chimera</hi>
or other, which we eternally pursue in vain.
As <hi>Chymistry</hi> has its <hi>Philosophers Stone;</hi> so has <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi>
its <hi>Quadrature</hi> of the <hi>Circle; Astronomy</hi> its
<hi>Longitudes; Mechanicks</hi> their <hi>perpetual Motion:</hi> It
is impossible to find out all these, but it is very
useful to search after them, by reason of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97015:51"/>
Discoveries we make by the way. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
have also their <hi>Chimera,</hi> that is, <hi>Disinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estness,</hi>
or Perfect <hi>Friendship:</hi> No Man will ever
come up to it, yet it is good that all should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it, since by that they attain to many
other <hi>Virtues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXV. A true <hi>Friend</hi> is but a pleasing
<hi>Dream</hi> of the <hi>Love</hi> of our selves, which Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
and Experience dissipate.</p>
               <p>* XXXVI. We speak well of our <hi>Friends</hi> to
get the <hi>Friendship</hi> of others, by a shew of <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXVII. It is as hard to be a good <hi>Friend</hi>
and a Lover of <hi>Women,</hi> as it is to be a good
<hi>Friend</hi> and a Lover of <hi>Mony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXVIII. He will be much out in his
Account, who numbers his <hi>Friends</hi> by the visits
that are made him, and confounds the Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Ceremony and Commerce with the
Offices of United <hi>Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXIX. He will find himself in as great a
Mistake, that either seeks for a <hi>Friend</hi> in a <hi>Court,</hi>
or tries him at a <hi>feast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XL. A false <hi>Friend</hi> is like the Shadow in a
<hi>Dial;</hi> it appears in Clear Weather, but vanishes
assoon as that is Cloudy.</p>
               <p>XLI. There are some Friends, whose only
Prospect is their own Satisfaction; provided
they have nothing to reproach themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
the Misfortune of another does not much
affect them; nay, they would be concern'd,
that it was ended so soon. They continue it
sometimes for the Continuance of their own
Glory. They Rejoice, they Triumph in secret
for a Disgrace, which gives them an occasion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97015:52"/>
of shewing themselves, instead of searching the
most ready means to assist you; they search
the most signal ones to make themselves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and look upon their Friends, as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims
devoted to their Reputation.</p>
               <p>XLII. The Offices of True Friends, have
something of Liveliness, which always precedes
our Wants, and even prevents our very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
But Honour, which disguiseth it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Name of Friendship, is nothing but a
Self Love, that serves it self in the Person it
makes an appearance of serving. The Friend,
who Acts but by this Motive, advances to do
good in Proportion only to the encrease of his
Reputation. He stops short when his Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are gone: 'Tis a false Brave, that turns his
Eyes to see if he is regarded: 'Tis a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
that gives Alms with an unwilling Mind,
and pays this Tribute to God, only to impose
upon Men.</p>

               <p>I. ALL <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Resentments</hi> of the Soul,
have their <hi>Tone</hi> of <hi>Voice,</hi> their <hi>Gestures</hi>
of the <hi>Body,</hi> and their Forms and Air peculiar
to them; and the mutual Relation of them,
either good or bad, makes accordingly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
either pleasant or unpleasant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:97015:52"/>
II. All Men affect an <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Out side,</hi>
suitable to their <hi>Profession,</hi> that may make them
appear what they have a mind to be taken
for. So that we may say, That the <hi>World</hi> is
made up of nothing but formal Countenances
and Shews.</p>
               <p>III. The <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Affectation</hi> of a <hi>Citizen,</hi>
is sometimes lost in an <hi>Army,</hi> but never in a
<hi>Court.</hi>

               <p>I. WHen our <hi>Hatred</hi> is too fierce, it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
us to the Persons we hate.</p>
               <p>II. The exposing of a Man, and making
him Ridiculous, dishonours him more than a
real Dishonour.</p>
               <p>III. The most illustrious <hi>Revenge,</hi> is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
where we might destroy.</p>
               <p>IV. As we love more and more, those we

               <p>V. It is as hard to smother the <hi>Resentment</hi> of

               <p>* VI. Some People, to gratifie their <hi>Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
court their Enemies Persecution, that
they may have deeper grounds for Revenge.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>Hatreds</hi> are generally so obstinate and
sullen, that the greatest sign of <hi>Death</hi> in a sick
Body, is his desire of being reconciled to his

VIII. The most subtile and artificial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
is to make as if one was not offended;
For the grief and smart our Enemy intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us by the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cruelly Torments him with the Sting of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>

               <p>* X. <hi>Revenge</hi> is a kind of wild Justice, which
the more Man's Nature runs to, the more
ought Law to weed it out: For as the first
Wrong, it does but offend the Law; but the
<hi>Revenge</hi> of that Wrong puts the Law out of
Office. Certainly in taking <hi>Revenge,</hi> a Man is
but even with his Enemy; but in passing it
over he is Superiour, for it is only a Princes part

               <p>* XI. The most tolerable sort of <hi>Revenge,</hi> is,
for those Wrongs, which there is no Law to

               <p>I. <hi>HOnour</hi> and <hi>Disgrace</hi> are mistaken and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary

the real <hi>good</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> that attends them.</p>
               <p>II. Nothing can be more Foolish and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical,
than the Passion of those, that through
a World of Hardships and Dangers, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to transmit a famous Name to after Ages.
All this <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> which they
look upon as boundless, is yet confin'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the narrow compass of their Imagination,
which, crowding all Posterity into one Age,
sets before their Eyes, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
together, those future <hi>Honours,</hi> which
they shall never live to enjoy.</p>
               <p>III. It is with <hi>Glory,</hi> as with <hi>Beauty;</hi> for
as a single sine Lineament cannot make a
handsom Face, neither can a single good
<hi>Quality</hi> render a Man Accomplisht; but a
Concurrence of many fine Features and

               <p>IV. Honour is but an imaginary Duty,
which robs us often of real Conveniences.</p>
               <p>* V. Every Man sets up a Court of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>

whimsical and unaccountable, than
those of Fortune.</p>
               <p>II. We are sensible only of great <hi>Transports,</hi>
and extraordinary <hi>Emotions</hi> in our <hi>Humour</hi> and
Constitution; as of <hi>Anger,</hi> when it is violent;
but very few take notice that these <hi>Humours</hi>
have a regular and stated Course, which moves
and winds our Wills to different Actions, by
gentle and insensible Impressions. They go
their Rounds, as it were, and command us
by turns; so that a considerable part of what
we do is theirs, though we are not able to
see how it is so.</p>
               <p>III. All the Gifts of <hi>Fortune</hi> are no more,
than our <hi>Humour</hi> is pleas'd to rate them.</p>
               <p>IV. There are always more <hi>Defects</hi> in the
<hi>Humour,</hi> than in the <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. It is with our <hi>Humours,</hi> as with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Buildings; they have several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings
and Prospects, some of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

through their own <hi>Humour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. The Composedness, or Perturbation
of our <hi>Humour,</hi> does not depend so much
upon the great and most considerable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of our Lives, as upon a suitable or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97015:55"/>
unsuitable Management of little Things, that
befal us every day.</p>
               <p>VIII. Some Men adapt themselves to all
sorts of Characters, with so dextrous a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
that one would swear their Humour
were that of all others; they appear Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
with Men of Honour; subtile with In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>triguing
Persons; without Parts to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid;
and commit voluntary Fopperies to
agree with real Fops.</p>
               <p>IX. As those who concert things the best,
don't always stick to the justice of Rules;
so the most Irregular don't always follow
the Disorders of their Inclinations and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>* X. Some People are always in good <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
because they are never out of Conceit
with themselves.</p>
               <p>XI. When we say of a Man who is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
passionate, inconstant, quarrelsom, morose,
exceptious, whimsical, <hi>&amp;c. That's his Humour;</hi>
we do not so much excuse him, as confess

us, that it Conducts us to our Journey's End,
an easier and more pleasant way.</p>

II. In a miserable Condition, where all
things are despair'd of, a Man is easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
rather to confide in another, than in
himself.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Happiness, Misfortunes.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>HAppiness</hi> lies not in the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but in our own Palate, and
the relish we have of them: We are happy
by the Enjoyment of what we fancy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and not what other People think lovely
and desirable.</p>
               <p>II. One considerable part of <hi>Happiness,</hi> is,
to know how far a Man may be <hi>Unhappy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. We generally make a false Estimate, both
of our <hi>Misfortunes</hi> and <hi>Felicities;</hi> and we are
never so happy or unfortunate, as we think
we are.</p>
               <p>IV. If a Man cannot find Ease within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
'tis preposterous for him to seek it any
where else.</p>
               <p>V. Nothing goes so far in the <hi>Happiness</hi>
of our Lives, as to know things as really
they are; and this Knowledge is to be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by frequent Reflections upon Men, and
the several Affairs of the World, rather than by
the perusal of Books.</p>
               <p>* VI. Nothing goes nearer a Man in his
Misfortunes, than to find himself undone by
his own Folly, or but any way accessory to
his own Ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:97015:56"/>
VII. Pity and Compassion is often a Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our own Miseries, occasion'd by those
of our Neighbours: It is an ingenious Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of the Disgraces we may fall into; we
relieve others, to ingage them to return the
like, when our own Occasions call for it; and
the good Offices we do them, are, in strict
speaking, so many Kindnesses done to our
selves before-hand.</p>
               <p>VIII. It goes a great way toward <hi>Felicity,</hi> the
using of our selves to other Peoples <hi>Follies,</hi> and
not taking offence at every Impertinence, that
passes in our Company.</p>
               <p>IX. It is an ordinary Impertinence, for Men
in <hi>Disgrace,</hi> to infect every thing with their
<hi>Misfortunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. There are some common <hi>Misfortunes,</hi>
which have a Relation to all Men; but every
Man has his particular Sentiments of them, and
so endures in that Sense, the whole weight of
his Affliction singly. But in our private <hi>Disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
that which affects us most, is to see no body
bear a Resemblance to us. We cannot with
Patience behold our selves destin'd to suffer an
Unhappiness alone, which all the World
may be affected with as well as we: And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much augments the Sharpness of our
Afflictions, as the Fierceness and Pride of those
who seem to brave and despise them.</p>
               <p>* XI. The more we struggle with our <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,</hi>
we draw the Knot the harder, as the
more the Bird flaps and flutters in the Snare,
the surer she is caught.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:97015:56"/>
* XII. The <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of the whole
Life of Mortals, are Themes scarce worth a
Passion. Whatever we endure as an <hi>Evil,</hi> or
possess as a <hi>Good,</hi> are both so short, that as the
one need not sink us to an Excess of <hi>Grief,</hi> so
neither does the other deserve an Excess of <hi>Ioy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. There is but one real Misfortune that
can befal a Man, which is to be in Fault, and
to be reproacht with any ill Thing by one's own
Conscience.</p>
               <p>* XIV. No Man is to account any thing a
Loss, if he gets <hi>Wisdom</hi> by the bargain; for as
we say, <hi>Bought Wit is best.</hi> And it is in some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the Business of this World, as it is in
that of the next; in the Cases, I mean, of Losses,
Miscarriages and Disappointments: We are in
both Respects the better for them, for they are
Monitory and Instructive. Affliction makes a
Man both Honest and Wife; for the Smart
brings him to a sense of his Error, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
to the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>* XV. There are no People so <hi>Miserable,</hi> but
that at some time or other, in some thing or
other, they have reason to account themselves
happy. And if they would but duly consider,
how it is with many of their Neighbours, they
would find it their Duty to be thankful, that it
is no worse with themselves; for it is some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to the Unfortunate, to shew them that
there are others yet more Miserable.</p>
               <p>* XVI. It may seem to be a kind of a Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Satisfaction, that one Man derives from the
Misfortunes of another. But the Philosophy of
this Reflexion stands upon another Ground; for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97015:57"/>
our Comfort does not arise from other Peoples
being Miserable, but from this Inference upon
the Ballance, that we suffer only the Lot of
Humane Nature; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d as we are Happy or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
compar'd with others, so other People
are Miserable or Happy compar'd with us: By
which Justice of Providence, we come to be
convinc'd of the Sin, and the mistake of our
Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>* XVII. In all the Cases of our Lives, we
fancy our selves much more Miserable than we
are; for want of taking a true Estimate of Things,
we fly into Transports without Reason, and
judge of the Happiness or Calamity of Humane
Life, by false Lights. A strict Enquiry into
the Truth of Matters will help us in the one, and
Comparison will set us right in the other.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Idleness, Sloth.</head>
               <p>I. MAny People are kept within their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because they have not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
or will not be at the pains of being Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And in such Cases <hi>Virtue</hi> runs away with that
Praise, which is due only to <hi>Timidity</hi> or <hi>Sloth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. When <hi>Idle Men</hi> have indulg'd themselves,
as much as they think fit, no body is then so full
of Haste and Activity as they, because, they
hope, this quickning of others will give them
the Reputation of Diligence.</p>
               <p>III. Of all the <hi>Passions</hi> we are expos'd to,
none is more conceal'd from our knowledge
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97015:57"/>
than <hi>Idleness;</hi> it is the most violent and most
mischievous of any, though its Violence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,
and its Mischievousness unheeded and
secret: If we carefully consider its power, it
will be found upon all occasions to have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Sway over our Sentiments, our Interests,
and our Pleasures. This is a <hi>Remora</hi> that can
stop the largest Ships, and a Calm more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to our Undertakings than any <hi>Rocks</hi> or
<hi>Sands,</hi> or even the most violent <hi>Storms.</hi> The
Ease and Tranquility of <hi>Sloth</hi> is a powerful
<hi>Charm,</hi> that suppresses on the sudden our most
vigorous Pursuits, and shakes our most peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Resolutions: In a Word, (to give a true
Notion of this <hi>Passion) Idleness</hi> is a Blessedness of
the <hi>Soul,</hi> that makes her easie under all her
Losses, and supplies the place of all her Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Advantages.</p>
               <p>IV. 'Tis a mighty Error to suppose, that none
but violent and strong <hi>Passions,</hi> such as <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Ambition,</hi> are able to conquer the rest. Even
<hi>Idleness,</hi> as feeble and languishing as it is, does
often triumph over them all: This <hi>Usurps</hi> the
Throne, and sits Paramount over all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and Actions of our Lives; and insensibly
wasts and destroys both all our <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. Of all our <hi>Failings,</hi> we are apt to confess
<hi>Laziness</hi> the more easily, because we perswade
our selves, that it sticks close to all peaceable
<hi>Virtues;</hi> and as for the rest, that it does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
any of them utterly, but only suspends the
Exercise of them.</p>
               <p>VI. There is more <hi>Laziness</hi> in the <hi>Mind,</hi> than
in the <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:97015:58"/>
VII. <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> fix the Mind to
it what finds easie and agreeable: This Habit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
confines and cramps up our Notions, and
no body was ever at the pains to stretch and
carry his Understanding, as far as it could go.</p>
               <p>VIII. We have very often more Strength than
good Will to use it; but we fancy things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be done, to reconcile our selves to
our own <hi>Idleness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. If we cast an Eye on all the <hi>Tempests,</hi>
which arise within our Breasts, and consider the
Causes and Remedies of all the violent <hi>Desires,</hi>
malicious <hi>Envies,</hi> intemperate <hi>Ioys,</hi> and irregular
<hi>Griefs,</hi> by which the Lives of most Men become
<hi>Miserable,</hi> or <hi>Guilty;</hi> we shall find that they are
generally produc'd by <hi>Idleness,</hi> and may be most
naturally cur'd by <hi>Diversion.</hi> What-ever <hi>Art</hi>
shall be able to busie the <hi>Minds</hi> of Men, with a
constant Course of <hi>Innocent Works,</hi> or to fill them
with as vigorous and pleasant Images, as those
ill <hi>Impressions,</hi> by which they are deluded; it will
certainly have a surer Effect in the composing
and purifying of their Thoughts, than all the
<hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Moralists.</hi>

II. <hi>Iealousie</hi> is always born with <hi>Love,</hi> but it

               <p>III. <hi>Unfaithfulness</hi> ought to quench our <hi>Love</hi>
quite; and we do ill to be jealous when there
is Reason: No body deserves the Jealousie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
who will give any just occasion for it.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Iealousie</hi> is not so much the effect of the
<hi>Love</hi> of another, as the <hi>Love</hi> of our selves.</p>
               <p>V. The reason why the pains we feel from
<hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Iealousie</hi> are so smart and cutting, is,
because <hi>Vanity</hi> cannot assist us to bear them.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>Iealousie</hi> is the greatest of <hi>Evils,</hi> and yet

Neighbours Property and Interests, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
careful not to invade it. This Fear holds
Men in, within the compass of that Estate
which either <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>Fortune</hi> has given them;
and were it not for this, they would continually
be making Incursions upon one another.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Iustice,</hi> in moderate and well-behaved
<hi>Iudges,</hi> is often only the love of their Preferment.</p>
               <p>III. We except against some <hi>Iudges</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of very little concern, when at the same
time we are content to have our Reputation
and Honour depend upon the Judgment of
Men, which are all against us, either by Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
Prejudice, or Ignorance: And we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97015:59"/>
our Ease and our Loves only to bribe
them, to give Sentence in our Favour.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> are like Objects of Sight,
and have also their <hi>Points of Perspective;</hi> some
must be seen at a distance, and others, at close
view, to be exactly judged of.</p>
               <p>V. The <hi>Iudgments</hi> our <hi>Enemies</hi> make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
us, come nearer to the Truth, than
those we pass concerning our selves.</p>
               <p>VI. Every one erects a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Iudicature</hi> for
himself; There he sits supream <hi>Iudge</hi> over his
Neighbour, and proceeds upon him in as Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
and Authoritative a manner, as if he had
some particular Prerogative over him. But, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
we should be more modest and sparing,
in passing Sentence thus upon others, if we did
but consider, that they too will take the same
Freedoms, and use us with the same Severity,
when in their power.</p>
               <p>* VII. Of all <hi>Injustices,</hi> that is the most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
and capital, which imposes upon us
under the colour of Kindness and good Meaning.</p>
               <p>* VIII. It is not only generous, but profitable
too, for a Man in some Cases to remit some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the straitness of his just due.</p>
               <p>IX. The Duty of a <hi>Iudge</hi> is to administer <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
and his <hi>Trade</hi> to delay it: Some know their
Duty, and only follow their Trade.</p>
               <p>X. Those that make ill <hi>Iudgments</hi> of us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being acquainted with us, do not wrong us
in the least; 'tis not us they Condemn, but only
an imaginary <hi>Chimera</hi> of their own making.</p>
               <p>XI. We are revenged upon the ill <hi>Iudgments</hi>
some Men make of our Wit and Manners, by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97015:60"/>
the Unworthiness of those they approve of.</p>
               <p>* XII. The Wickedness of other Men we have
always in our Eye, but we cast our own over
our Shoulders. He that loves his Neighbour's
Wife, and for that very Reason, because she is
anothers, locks up his own: A worse Father
Chastises a better Son, and we quarrel with the
Offender rather than the Offence.</p>
               <p>* XIII. It is very hard to find an equal Judge:
There are no greater exacters of Faith, than the
Persidious, no greater Persecutors of Falshood
than the Perjurious: A Tyrant is offended at
Bloodshed; the Sacrilegious punishes Theft, and
the greater part of the World quarrels with the
Offender, rather than with the Offence.</p>
               <p>* XIV. It is with Justice as with sick Men: In
time past, when we had fewer Doctors, as well
of <hi>Law</hi> as of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hysick,</hi> we had more <hi>Right</hi> and
more <hi>Health:</hi> But we are now destroy'd by
Multitudes and Consultations, which serve to no
other end, than to enflame both the <hi>Distemper</hi>
and the <hi>Reckoning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XV. It may seem somewhat a hard Case
for the greater Thieves to punish the less, and
for Publick Purloiners and Oppressors to sit in
Triumph upon the Lives of the little ones, that
go to the Gallows; for the Tye of Morality is
the same upon both, and they stand both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to the same Master: But Time,
Power and Corruption give a Reputation to the
worst of Practices; and it is no longer Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
when it comes gilded with the name of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Now in the sight of Heaven, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Temptation, the less is the Sin; and yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97015:60"/>
in the Vogue of the World, it passes for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit
of Honour, for Kings and States to run
away with whole Countries, that they have no
Colour or Pretence to; when many a poor
Devil stands condemn'd to a Halter, or a Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Post, for the pilfering of a Silver-Spoon
perhaps, or the robbing of a Hen-Roost.</p>
               <p>* XVI. We cannot judge of Characters of
Things and Persons, given at second hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we knew exactly how capable those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
from whom such Characters were first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
were to pass a right Judgment upon such
Subjects; and also the particular Motives that
byass'd them to pass such Censures.</p>
               <p>* XVII. It is easie for Men to fall into
gross Errors, and to mistake the wrong Causes
for the true, in the Judgment which they make
of others Opinions and Inclinations: When
they behold them addicted to such or such <hi>Vices,</hi>
and to have withal some good Qualities, in which
they themselves do not excel, they presently are
apt to imagine the <hi>bad</hi> to arise from the <hi>good,</hi> and
so condemn both together; whereas, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>haps, it
sprung from some other hidden Cause, of which
they took no notice.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Knowledge, Learning, Ignorance.</head>
               <p>I. IT is requisite in order to know things
throughly well, to be acquainted with the
Particulars of them; but these being Infinite,
and not to be attain'd to in this Life; Our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97015:61"/>
                  <hi>Sciences</hi> are consequently very superficial and
imperfect.</p>
               <p>II. There are two sorts of <hi>Curiosity,</hi> the first
which proceeds from <hi>Interest,</hi> is a desire to learn
things that can be useful and beneficial to us;
the other which springs from <hi>Pride,</hi> is a desire
of knowing more than our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>III. 'Tis much easier to know what Men are
in general, than to know a single Man in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>IV. The love of new <hi>Notions</hi> and greater
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> proceeds not so much from our being
weary of what we had before, or any Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there is in Change, as from the concern for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too little admir'd by those that know us well,
and from the hope of being admir'd more by
them that know us but little.</p>
               <p>V. It is with some good <hi>Qualities,</hi> as with our
<hi>Senses;</hi> those that never had the use of them,
can never have any Notion of them.</p>
               <p>VI. It is so usual with most Men to judge of
things so very slightly and superficially, that the
most ordinary <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> set off with a
good Grace, and some little Knowledge how
Matters go in the World, very often gain a Man
more Reputation than the most profound Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Learning.</p>
               <p>VII. It is not so very difficult for Men to
know themselves, if they did but take the pains
of enquiring into themselves; but they are more
sollicitous to be thought what they should be,
than really careful to be what they should be.</p>
               <p>VIII. <hi>Ignorance</hi> creates Weakness and Fear,
but <hi>Learning</hi> makes Men bold and assured: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97015:61"/>
affects or disturbs a Mind, that has a true
Apprehension of Things, and knows how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them rightly.</p>
               <p>IX. <hi>Study</hi> and the enquiry after <hi>Truth,</hi> have
seldom any other Effect, than to make us expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
convinc'd of our natural <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. This Maxim, <hi>Let a thing be never so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
yet it will be discover'd at one time or other;</hi>
is very uncertain, if not false: For it has no
other ground, than those things that have been
found out; and for ought we know, there may
be as many that neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> did or shall come to our
knowledge.</p>
               <p>XIII. There are some sort of People, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look into a Book, and yet with their own
stock of natural Parts, have a better Sense of
Things that depend upon clear and true <hi>Reason,</hi>
than some great and bookish <hi>Professors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIV. A great many People are fond of Books
as they are of Furniture, to dress and set off their
Rooms, more than to adorn and enrich their
Minds.</p>
               <p>XV. If we set aside those Cases, in which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
is concern'd, a Man ought to measure his
Studies and his Books by the <hi>Standard</hi> of his own
<hi>Reason,</hi> and not enslave his <hi>Reason</hi> to his Books.</p>
               <p>XVI. Studious Men propose to themselves the
filling their Heads with Notions, that they may
talk fluently and nicely, and be taken notice of
in the World; more than their own real Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
and better Information, that they
might be qualified to make a right Judgment of
Things.</p>
               <p>XVII. Such words as <hi>Sympathize, Ie ne s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97015:62"/>
quoy's, Occult Qualities,</hi> and a thousand more of
the same stamp, have no Sense nor Signification
at all. A Man is wonderfully deceived, if he
fancies himself one jot the wiser for them. They
were only found out to supply the want of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and to be used when we would fain say
something, but indeed have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>XVIII. In the study of Humane <hi>Learning,</hi>
our <hi>Mind</hi> ought always to preserve its own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and not to enslave its self to other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
fancies. The liberty of the Judgment should
have its full scope, and not take any thing upon
trust, from the Credit of any Man's Authority.
When different <hi>Opinions</hi> are propos'd to us, we
should consider and chuse, if there are such
odds between them, as to admit of a Choice;
and if there be not, then we should continue in
suspence still.</p>
               <p>XIX. The highest pitch of Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
is to be throughly acquainted with our
own Weakness, Vanity and Misery; and the
less Wit a Man has, the less he knows of these
Matters.</p>
               <p>XX. That sort of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which is but a
Privation or Emptiness of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is much
less despicable than the other kind of <hi>Ignorance,</hi>
which is full and puss'd up with Error and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence,
and which the World oftentimes
mistakes for Learning and Knowledge.</p>
               <p>XXI. Too servile a Submission to the Books
and Opinions of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> has spoil'd many
an ingenious Man, and plagu'd the World with
abundance of <hi>Pesants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXII. The knowing of others well is a fair
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97015:62"/>
step to gain an <hi>Ascendant</hi> and <hi>Mastery</hi> over them;
for the Man that is throughly known, depends
in some measure upon the Person that knows
him.</p>
               <p>XXIII. As there is no Man but may draw
great Supplies and Advantages from <hi>Learning,</hi>
so there are very few who do not find great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
from the Notions they acquire by Studies,
except they use them, as if they were natural to
them.</p>
               <p>XXIV. Men are most esteemed when the
<hi>World</hi> does not know the utmost of their Parts
and Abilities. For things that are understood
but by halves, are always presum'd greater than
really they are.</p>
               <p>XXV. The eager desire Men have of making
their Parts and Abilities known, hinders 'em
generally from acquiring any considerable: For
whilst they are busie to let the World see what
<hi>Knowledge</hi> they have, they lose the opportunity
to learn that which they want.</p>
               <p>XXVI. The best Disposition, when untaught,
is always blind and unsettled. A Man ought to
take all imaginable Care to inform himself, that
his <hi>Ignorance</hi> may make him neither <hi>Childishly</hi>
Bashtul, nor <hi>Ridiculously</hi> Confident.</p>
               <p>XXVII. None but little Souls are disturb'd at
having their <hi>Ignorance</hi> reprov'd; and the reason
is, that being generally very <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>Foolish,</hi>
they never trouble themselves with <hi>Doubts;</hi> and
are fully satisfied they see those things clearly,
which they see only through the thick Mist of
a clouded Understanding</p>
               <p>XXVIII. To know things judiciously, we
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97015:63"/>
ought always to be upon our guard against the
Reputation of him that speaks them; the <hi>Air</hi> of
the Face; the manner of Speaking; the Quality,
the Time, the Place, all imposes.</p>
               <p>XXIX. <hi>Study</hi> makes a greater difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a <hi>Scholar</hi> and an <hi>Ignorant</hi> Man, than there
is between an <hi>Ignorant</hi> Man and a <hi>Brute.</hi> But
the <hi>Air</hi> of the World yet makes a greater Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between a <hi>Polite</hi> and a <hi>Learned</hi> Person.
<hi>Knowledge</hi> begins the <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of the World compleats him.</p>
               <p>XXX. 'Tis the fault of weak Reasoners to
venture upon many things they don't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and to renounce them as soon as they
come to know them.</p>
               <p>XXXI. All <hi>Objects</hi> have different <hi>Faces,</hi> and
the Mind, which is in a continual Motion, looks
upon them as it turns, insomuch that we have
nothing. If I may so speak, but new <hi>Aspects,</hi>
thinking to enjoy new <hi>Discoveries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXII. The great Commerce with the World
hinders all Attention; what we see in others,
keeps us from examining well our selves.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. By a little knowledge of <hi>Nature</hi>
Men become <hi>Atheists;</hi> but a great deal returns
them back again, to a sound and religious Mind.</p>
               <p>* XXXIV. Though it may be an Argument
of great Wit, to give ingenious Reasons for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wonderful Appearances in Nature; yet it is
an Evidence of small Judgment to be positive in
any thing, but the acknowledgment of our own
<hi>Ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXV. Our <hi>Pride</hi> is always greater than
our <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and what we want in <hi>Knowledge</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:97015:63"/>
we supply by <hi>Sufficiency.</hi> When we have look'd
about us as far as we can, we conclude there is
no more to be seen; when we have shot our
best, we are sure none ever did, nor ever can
shoot better, or beyond it. Our own <hi>Reason</hi> is
the certain measure of <hi>Truth;</hi> our own <hi>Knowledge</hi>
of what is possible in <hi>Nature.</hi> Though our <hi>Mind</hi>
and our <hi>Thoughts</hi> change every seven Years, as
well as our Strength and our Features: Nay,
though our Opinions change every Week, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Day, yet we are sure, or at least confident,
that our present <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Conclusions</hi> are just
and true, and cannot be deceiv'd: And among
all the Miseries to which Man is born and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the whole Course of his Life, he has this
one Felicity to comfort and support him, <hi>that
in all Ages, in all things, every Man is always in
the right.</hi> A <hi>Boy</hi> of fifteen is wiser than his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
at forty; the meanest <hi>Subject,</hi> than his <hi>Prince</hi>
or <hi>Governors,</hi> and the <hi>Modern Scholars,</hi> because
they have for a Hundred Years past learnt their
<hi>Lesson</hi> pretty well, are much more knowing
than the <hi>Ancients</hi> Masters.</p>
               <p>* XXXVI. It is undoubtedly true, that scarce
any Man's Mind is so capable of thinking strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the presence of one whom he <hi>Fears</hi> and
<hi>Reverences,</hi> as he is when that Restraint is taken
off. And this is to be found, not only in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Matters, but also in the Arts of <hi>Discourse</hi> and
<hi>Raillery</hi> themselves: For we have often seen Men
of bold Tempers, that have over-aw'd and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
the Wit of most Companies, to have been
disturb'd and dumb, and bashful as Children,
when some other Man has been near, who us'd
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97015:64"/>
to out-talk them. Such a kind of natural So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
there is in some Mens Minds over
others, which must needs be much greater when
it is advanc'd by long use, and the venerable
name of a <hi>Master.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXVII. Those who take their Opinions
from others Rules, are commonly stricter impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
upon their Scholars, than their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
were on them, or than the first Inventors
of things themselves are upon others. Whatever
the Cause of this be, whether the first Men are
made meek and gentle, by their long search, and
by better understanding all the difficulties of
Knowledge; while those that learn afterwards,
only hastily catching things in small <hi>Systems,</hi> are
soon satisfied, before they have broken their
Pride, and so become more imperious; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it arises from hence, that the same mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Soul,</hi> which made them bound their
Thoughts by others Precepts, makes them also
<hi>Insolent</hi> to their Inferiours, as we always find
<hi>Cowards</hi> the most <hi>Cruel:</hi> Or whatever other
Cause may be alledg'd, the Observation is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the <hi>Successors</hi> are usually more positive
and tyrannical, than the <hi>Beginners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* XXXVIII. It is <hi>Liberty</hi> alone which inspires
Men with losty Thoughts, and elevates their
Souls to a higher Pitch, than Rules of Art can
direct. Books of Rhetorick make Men Copious
and Methodical; but they alone can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
that true Enthusiastick Rage which <hi>Liberty</hi>
breaths into their Souls who enjoy it, and which
guided by a sedate Judgment, will carry Men
further than the greatest Industry, and the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Parts can go without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:97015:64"/>
* XXXIX. All Men who make a Mystery of
Matters of <hi>Learning,</hi> and industriously oblige
their Scholars to conceal their Dictates, give the
World great Reason to suspect, that their <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
is all Juggling and Trick.</p>
               <p>* XL. No Pretences to greater measures of
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> grounded upon account of long Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of Learned Men in any Country, ought
to gain belief, when set against the Learning of
other Nations who make no such Pretences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Inventions</hi> and <hi>Discoveries</hi> answerable to those
Advantages, be produced by their Advocates.</p>
               <p>* XLI. The growth of <hi>Learning,</hi> as well as of
Natural Bodies, has some short Periods beyond
which it cannot reach, and after which it must
begin to decay. It falls in one Country or one
Age, and rises again in others, but never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a certain Pitch. One Man, or one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
at a certain time runs a great length in some
certain kinds of Knowledge, but lose as much
ground in others, that were perhaps as useful and
valuable. There is a certain degree of <hi>Capacity</hi>
in the greatest Vessel, and when 'tis full, if you
pour in still, it must run out some way or other,
and the more it runs out on one side, the less
runs out at the other: So the greatest <hi>Memory,</hi>
after a certain degree, as it learns or retains
more of some Things or Words, loses and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
as much of others. The largest and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
reach of Thought, the more it pursues some
certain Subjects, the more it neglects others.</p>
               <p>* XLII. It is natural to all Ranks of Men, to
have some one Darling, upon which their Care
is chiefly fixt. If <hi>Mechanicks</hi> alone were to make
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97015:65"/>
a Philosophy, they would bring it all into
their Shops; and force it wholly to consist of
Springs and Wheels and Weights: If <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,</hi>
they would not depart from their Art;
scarce any thing would be consider'd besides the
<hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Causes, Signs</hi> and <hi>Cures</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases.</hi>
So much is to be found in Men of all
Conditions, of that which is called <hi>Pedantry</hi> in
Scholars, which is nothing else but an obstinate
Addiction to the forms of some private Life, and
not regarding general things enough.</p>
               <p>XLIII. We meet with very few Authors that
are plain and natural; for even the Best are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
contented either with their first <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or
with those <hi>Expressions,</hi> which present themselves
without study. The generality of Men mistake

               <p>XLIV. A <hi>Dogmatical Tone,</hi> is generally the
effect of a great <hi>Ignorance.</hi> He that knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
thinks that he teaches others what he has
learnt himself a Moment before: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he that knows much does hardly think,
that what he says can be unknown to other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and so he speaks with a kind of Indifference.</p>
               <p>* XLV. The Men of <hi>Reading</hi> do very much
busie themselves about such <hi>Conceptions,</hi> which
are no where to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:97015:65"/>
the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the World is quite a different
thing from what they imagine it to be in private:
And therefore it is no wonder, if when they
come abroad into Business, the Sight of Men,
the Tumult and Noise of Cities, and the very
Brightness of Day it self affright them.</p>
               <p>* XLVI. The <hi>studious</hi> Men, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
heaping up in their Memories the Customs
of past Ages, fall insensibly to imitate them,
without any manner of Care <hi>how</hi> suitable they
are to <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Things.</hi> In the Ancient <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
which they turn over, they find Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Virtues</hi> more perfect than indeed they
were: The Governments are represented bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the ways of Life pleasanter than they
deserv'd. Upon this, these <hi>Bookish</hi> Wise Men
strait compare what they read with what they
see; and here beholding nothing so heroically
Transcendent, because they are able to mark
all the <hi>Spots</hi> as well as <hi>Beauties</hi> of every thing, that
is so close to their sight, they presently begin to
despise their own <hi>Times,</hi> to exalt the past, to
contemn the <hi>Virtues,</hi> and aggravate the Vices of
their <hi>Country;</hi> not indeavouting to amend them,
but by such Examples as are now unpracticable,
by reason of the Alteration of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>

               <p>I. A <hi>Prince</hi> makes himself first unhappy
when he makes others so.</p>
               <p>II. There are some fierce Souls, who have

on that of a <hi>Physician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* V. The Publick is but one Body, and the
Prince the Head on't; so that what Member so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
withdraws his Service from the Head, is
no better than a Negative Traitor to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and himself.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>Princes</hi> and their <hi>Ministers</hi> have their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
much like that of <hi>Celestial Bodies;</hi> they have
much Splendor, but no Rest.</p>
               <p>* VII. <hi>Princes</hi> are no farther touch'd with one

<hi>Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* VIII. The Periods of <hi>Empire,</hi> like Natural
Bodies, grow for a certain Time, and to a
certain Size, which they are not to exceed.</p>
               <p>* IX. The Sources of <hi>Conquests,</hi> like those of
great Rivers, are generally obscure, or taken
little notice of, until their Streams increasing by
the Influence of many others, make so mighty
Inundations, as to grow famous in Stories, as
well as Maps of the World.</p>
               <p>* X. <hi>Usurpers</hi> and <hi>Tyrants</hi> do commonly Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon themselves, for the Injuries they have
done to others; their own Consciences doing
the Office of <hi>Tormentors,</hi> and avenging their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97015:66"/>
Publick Crimes, by their Private Sufferings; for
they live in a perpetual Anguish of Thought,
with Fears and Jealousies.</p>
               <p>* XI It is an easie matter for Princes to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>end their unlawful Desires and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
Vows with many outward seeming
fair Pretences; especially seeing there is no Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
or Moderator of Matters concluded upon,
to whom a Reason should be tendred.</p>
               <p>* XII. When Princes that ought to be common
Parents, make themselves as a Party, and lean
to a Side; it is a Boat that is over-thrown by
uneven weight on the one side. For when the
Authority of Princes is made but an Accessary
to a Cause, and that there are other Bands that
tye faster than the Band of Sovereignty; Kings
begin to be almost put out of Possession.</p>
               <p>* XIII. It is a miserable state of Mind to
have few things to desire, and many things to
fear; and yet that commonly is the Case of
Kings, who being at the highest, want matter
of Desire, which makes their Minds more lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,
and have many Representations of
Perils and Shadows, which makes their Minds
the less clear.</p>
               <p>* XIV. <hi>Kings</hi> that have been fortunate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
in their first Years, it being not possible
for them to go forward infinitely, but that they
must have some Check or Arrest in their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
turn generally in their later Years to be
Superstitious and Melancholy.</p>
               <p>* XV. Nothing destroys Authority so much,
as the unequal and untimely interchange of
Power, <hi>press'd</hi> too far, and <hi>relaxed</hi> too much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:97015:67"/>
* XVI. The Honour of a <hi>Prince</hi> is a good
Excuse, when he has no mind to engage in a
deceitful or unjust War; but it is often forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
when the Circumstances are more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>* XVII. There is no way more effectual to
engage all to adhere to the <hi>Crown,</hi> than the
grateful Acknowledgments of past Services.</p>
               <p>* XVIII. In a weak Government an ill digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Insurrection raises the Power of the <hi>Prince,</hi>
and adds as much Spirit to his Friends, as it
depresses the Faction against him; and it also
gives a handle to do some things, for which it
were not easie otherwise to find either Colours
or Instruments.</p>
               <p>* XIX. A <hi>Prince</hi> that does not secure Friends
to himself, while he is in Power and Condition
to oblige them, must never expect to find 'em
when he is Old and Impotent, and no longer
able to do them any Good. If he Governs Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically
in his Youth, he will be sure to be
treated contemptibly in his Old Age; and the
baser his Enemies are, the more insolent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
will be the Affront.</p>
               <p>* XX. There is no Subject so inconsiderable,
but his Prince at one time or other, may have
occasion for him; and it holds through the
whole Scale of the Creation, that the Great and
the Little have need of one another.</p>
               <p>* XXI. There's no medling with <hi>Princes,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Text</hi> or <hi>Argument. Morality</hi> is not the
Povince of a Cabinet-Council; and Ghostly
Fathers signifie no more than Spiritual Bug-bears
in the Case of an unaccountable Privilege.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:97015:67"/>
XXII. <hi>Truth</hi> discovers it self to <hi>Princes</hi> no
longer than while they are Young and under
Age: It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lies a <hi>Crown,</hi> and vanishes out of
sight, as soon as they come to be invested
with Power. If these first Years be not
made use of to give them good Advice
and Instruction, there will be no retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in the following part of their Lives;
For all then goes off in meer juggle and
disguise.</p>
               <p>XXIII. There wants nothing more to make
a Prince compleatly happy, than the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a private Life: If any thing can make
him amends for so great a Loss, it must be
the Charms of <hi>Friendship,</hi> and Fidelity of
true <hi>Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. One of the greatest Misfortunes
that can attend a <hi>Prince,</hi> is, that he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Secrets that lye heavy upon his Soul, and
which it is not safe for him to disclose. His
Happiness is to find a true bosom Friend on
whom he may throw off his Burden.</p>
               <p>XXV. Nothing is so much for a <hi>Princes</hi>
Credit, as the Modesty of his <hi>Favourites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVI. What a happy Condition is that
which gives a Man so frequent Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
to do good to so many Thousands!
What a dangerous Post is that, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
a Man to do hurt to so many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions!</p>
               <p>* XXVIII. All Precepts concerning <hi>Kings,</hi>
are fummarily comprehended in these two;
<hi>Remember that thou art a Man, and that thou
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97015:68"/>
art instead of God:</hi> The one bridles their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the other their Will.</p>

               <p>I. NOthing is more rare, than to see a
Man either <hi>Laugh</hi> or <hi>Weep</hi> to the
purpose.</p>
               <p>II. The Enjoyments, which a Plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
affords, and the Calm and Smoothness of
Prosperity, furnish Princes and Great Men
with so much Mirth, that they can <hi>Laugh</hi> at
a Monkey, a Dwarf, and oftentimes at an
Cold Jest; but Men of Inferiour Fortunes
seldom <hi>Laugh,</hi> but where there is occasion.</p>
               <p>III. All the World is plagu'd with Cold
<hi>Iesters,</hi> we tread every where upon those
<hi>Insects.</hi> A good <hi>Iester</hi> is a thing very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common;
and even those that are born
such, find it a very hard Task to make good
their Character a considerable Time: And
besides, he that makes other People <hi>Laugh,</hi>
seldom makes himself to be Esteem'd.</p>
               <p>IV. To <hi>Laugh</hi> at <hi>Witty Men,</hi> is the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of <hi>Blockheads:</hi> They are in the <hi>World,</hi> what
your <hi>Scurrilous Iesters</hi> are at <hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* V. No Men are more unwilling to bear a
Jest, than those who are forward to break it.</p>
               <p>* VI. The Wounding of a Friend for the
sake of a <hi>jest,</hi> is an Intemperance and Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
not to be endur'd.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:97015:68"/>
* VII. Men ought to find the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Saltness and Bitterness; for he that has a
Satyrical Vein, as he makes others afraid of his
Wit, so he had need be afraid of others Mc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>* VIII. It is commonly the Fate of Apes
and Buffoons, that while they think to make
sport with others, they serve only in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
for a Laughing-stock themselves.</p>
               <p>* IX. The true <hi>Raillery</hi> should be a Defence
for <hi>good</hi> and <hi>virtuous Works,</hi> and should only
design the Derision of extravagant, and the
Disgrace of vile and dishonourable Things. This
kind of <hi>Wit</hi> ought to have the nature of <hi>Salt,</hi>
to which it is usually compar'd; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
and keeps sweet the good and sound Parts
of all Bodies, and only frets, dries up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
those Humours which putrify and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
               <p>* X. There's not one Man of a Thousand,
that understands the just, the safe, warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
decent and precise Limits of that which
we call <hi>Bantering</hi> or <hi>Fooling;</hi> but it is either
too Course, too Rude, too Churlish, too Bitter,
too much on't, too Pedantick, too Fine, out
of Measure, or out of Season. Now the least
Error or Mistake in the Management of this
Humour, lays People open to great Censure
and Reproach. It is not every Man's Talent
to know when and how to cast out a pleasant
Word, with such a regard to Modesty and
Respect, as not to Transgress the true and fair
Allowances of Wit, good Nature and good
Breeding. The Skill and Faculty of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97015:69"/>
this Freedom within the Terms of Sobriety
and Diseretion, goes a great way in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of an agreeable Conversation; for that
which we call <hi>Raillery,</hi> in this Sense, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sawce of Civil Entertainment, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some such Tincture of <hi>Urbanity,</hi> even in
Matters the most serious, the good Humour
flattens for want of Refreshment and Relief.
But there is a Medium yet betwixt <hi>All-Fool</hi>
and <hi>All-Philosopher;</hi> I mean, a proper and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Mixture, that in some sort partakes of
both, and renders Wisdom it self the more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and effectual.</p>
               <p>* XI. 'Tis the Nature and Practice of Jesters
and Buffoons, to be Insolent towards those that
will bear it, and as Slavish to others that are
more than their Match.</p>

               <head>Life, Death.</head>
               <p>I. ONE cannot look either the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Death</hi>
in the Face.</p>
               <p>II. Very few People are acquainted with
<hi>Death;</hi> it is generally submitted to rather out
of Insensibility and Custom, than Resolution;
and all Men yield to <hi>Death,</hi> only because they
cannot help it.</p>
               <p>III. We often see those that are led to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
affect a Constancy and Contempt of
<hi>Death;</hi> which in truth is nothing else, but the
fear of looking it in the Face: So that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97015:69"/>
Bravery and Contempt, may be said
to do their Mind the same good Office, that
the Head-band or Night-cap does their Eyes.</p>
               <p>IV. Nothing can be more counterseit and
deceitful, than the <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Death.</hi> That
<hi>Contempt</hi> of it, I mean, which the <hi>Heathens</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to out of their natural Reason and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
without the Hopes of a better Life.
There is a great deal of difference between
Dying with Bravery and Resolution, and slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Death.</hi> The former is frequent enough, but
I look upon the other to be never real and
sincere; and yet <hi>Philosophers</hi> have us'd all the
Arguments that the <hi>Subject</hi> can bear, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us that <hi>Death is no Evil;</hi> and Men of
very inferiour Characters, as well as Hero's,
have furnisht us with a great many Eminent
Examples in Confirmation of that Opinion.
Nevertheless I do still question whether any
<hi>Thinking Man,</hi> ever gave his assent to it; nay,
the trouble they are at to perswade others and
themselves, plainly shews that this was no such
easie Undertaking. A Man indeed may have
a great many Reasons to be out of conceit with
Life, but he can have none to despise Death:
Even those, who voluntarily lay violent hands
upon themselves, do not look upon it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
matter, but are startled at it, and
decline it as much as others, if it approach them
in any other shape, but that of their own chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
The Unevenness of <hi>Courage,</hi> observable
in a World of Brave Men, has no other Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
than the various Influence of <hi>Death,</hi>
which works more powerfully upon their Fancy,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97015:70"/>
upon some Occasions, and at some Times,
than it does at others. Hence it is, that after
having slighted what they did not know, they
fear it now, when they come to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it. If a Man would perswade
himself, that it is not the greatest of Evils, he
must decline looking it in the Face, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all its <hi>Gastly Circumstances.</hi> The Wisest
and Bravest Men, are they, that take the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most honourable Pretences, to keep
their View from it. But every body that knows
it, as it really is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inds it to be a thing <hi>full of
Horror.</hi> The Constancy of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Necessity of Dying; they
thought when there was no Remedy, but a Man
must go, it was best to go with a good Grace.
And since they were not able to make their
Lives <hi>Eternal,</hi> they would stick at nothing to
make their Names so, and secure all that from
the <hi>Wreck,</hi> which was capable of being secur'd.
Let us put the best Face upon the Matter we
can, content our selves with not speaking all
we think, and hope more from a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
than all the feeble Reasonings, that
gull us with a fancy that we can approach it
without concern. The Glory of Dying gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly,
the Hope of being Lamented when we
are gone, the desire of leaving a good Name
behind us, the Assurance of being set free
from the Miseries of the present Life, and of
depending no longer upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fortune, are Remedies not altogether to
be rejected, though they be far from being So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.
They help no more to put us in Heart,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97015:70"/>
than a poor Hedge in an <hi>Engagement</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to encourage the <hi>Soldiers</hi> that are to march
near, where the Enemy is firing; it appears
a good Shelter at a distance, but proves a very
thin defence at close view. We do vainly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our selves to think that <hi>Death</hi> will be the same
when near, as we fancy it to be when remote;
and that our Reasonings, which in Truth are
Weakness it self, will prove of so harden'd a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
as to hold out proof, and not yield to the
severest of all Tryals: Besides, it shews we are
but little acquainted with <hi>Self-Love,</hi> when we
imagine, that will do us any Service toward
the looking upon that very thing as a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trifle,
which must unavoidably cause its utter Ruin;
and Reason, from which we expect so many Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
is then too weak to perswade us what we
wish to be true: Nay, Reason it self generally
betrays us upon this occasion, and instead of
animating us with a <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> gives
us a more lively Representation of all its Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Gastliness: All it is able to do in our
behalf, is only to advise us to turn our Heads an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way, and divert the Thought by fixing
our Eyes upon some other Objects. <hi>Cato</hi> and
<hi>Brutus</hi> chose noble Ones. A Lackey, not
long ago, satisfied himself with dancing upon
the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> whither he was brought to be broke
upon the Wheel. And thus, though the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
be different, they produce still the same
Effects. So true it is, that after all the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between Great Men and the Vulgar,
People of both sorts do often meet Death, with
the same Face and Disposition: But still with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97015:71"/>
this difference, that in the <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi>
which Great Men express, the desire and love
of Honour is the thing that keeps <hi>Death</hi> from
their sight; and in the Vulgar 'tis Ignorance and
Stupidity that leaves them at liberty to think
upon something else, and keeps them from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatness of the Evil they are to suffer.</p>
               <p>V. Every thing in this Life is Accidental,
even our Birth, that brings us into it: <hi>Death</hi> is
the only thing we can be sure of; and yet we
behave our selves just as if all the rest were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and <hi>Death</hi> alone accidental.</p>
               <p>* VI. We are apt to pick Quarrels with the
World for every little Foolery, or every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
Cross: But our Tongues run quite to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Tune, when we come once to parting
with it in earnest.</p>
               <p>* VII. Nothing but the Conscience of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Life can make Death easie to us: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there's no trusting to a Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
When Men come to that last Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
once by Langor, Pain or Sickness, and to
lye Agonizing betwixt Heaven and Hell, under
the stroke either of a Divine Judgment, or of
Humane Frailty, they are not commonly so
sensible of their Wickedness, or so effectually
touch'd with the remorse of a true Repentance,
as they are distracted with the Terrors of Death,
and the <hi>dark Visionary</hi> Apprehensions of what's
to come. People in that Condition do but
discharge themselves of burdensom Reflections,
as they do of the <hi>Cargo</hi> of a Ship at Sea, that
has sprung a <hi>Leak:</hi> Every thing is done in a
Hurry, and Men only part with their <hi>Sins</hi> in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97015:71"/>
the one Case, as they do with their <hi>Goods</hi> in the
other; to fish them up again so soon as the
Storm is over. <hi>Grace</hi> must be very strong in
these Conflicts, wholly to vanquish the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of distressed Nature. That certainly is
none of the Time to make choice of for the
great Work of reconciling our selves to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
when we are divided and confounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
an Anguish of Body and Mind: And
the Man is worse than Mad, that ventures his
Salvation upon that desperate Issue.</p>
               <p>VIII. There is not any thing that Men are
so prodigal, and at the same time, so fond of,
as their <hi>Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. <hi>Death</hi> happens but once; but the Sense
of it renews in all the Moments of our Lives;
and the fear we have of it, is ten times worse
than the submitting to it.</p>
               <p>X. That part of <hi>Death</hi> which is certain, is
much alleviated by that which is uncertain.</p>
               <p>XI. We hope to grow Old, and yet we fear
Old Age, that is to say, we love <hi>Life,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Nature</hi> generally makes a long Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
intermediate betwixt <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> with
design, it seems, to make <hi>Death</hi> it self a kind
of Release, both to him that Dyes, and those
that survive him.</p>
               <p>XIII. That <hi>Death</hi> which prevents a crazy
<hi>Old Age,</hi> comes in better time, than that which
terminates it.</p>
               <p>XIV. There are but three great Events for
us Men, <hi>Birth, Life</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> We are not
sensible of our Birth; we suffer in Dying, and
forget to live.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:97015:72"/>
XV. Most Men spend the first part of their
Lives in rendring the other miserable.</p>
               <p>* XVI. Men fear <hi>Death,</hi> as Children fear to
go in the Dark; and as that natural Fear is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in Children with Tales, so is the other.
Certainly the <hi>Stoicks</hi> bestowed too much cost
upon <hi>Death,</hi> and by their great Preparations
made it appear more fearful. It is as natural
to die as to be born; and to a little Infant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
the one is as painful as the other.</p>
               <p>* XVII. It is observable, that there is no
Passion in the Mind of Man, but it Masters
the Fear of <hi>Death:</hi> And therefore <hi>Death</hi> is
no such terrible Enemy, when a Man has so
many Friends about him, that can gain him
the Victory. <hi>Revenge</hi> Triumphs over Death;
<hi>Love</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lights it; <hi>Honour</hi> aspires to it; <hi>Grief</hi> flies
to it; <hi>Fear</hi> procures it. Nay, we read, that
<hi>Pity</hi> it self, which is the Tenderest of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
has provok'd many to die out of meer
Compassion. Nay, <hi>Seneca</hi> adds <hi>Niceness</hi> and
<hi>Satiety; A Man</hi> (says he) <hi>would die, though
he were neither Valiant nor Miserable, only upon a
Weariness to do the same thing so oft over and over.</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Liberality, Prodigality.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>LIberality</hi> is oftentimes nothing else but
the Vanity of Giving, of which we
are more fond than the Things we give.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:97015:72"/>
II. There goes a great deal of Art and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
to make a <hi>Denial</hi> go down, and by fair
and civil Expressions, to supply the Kindness
we cannot grant.</p>
               <p>III. There are a sort of Persons that say <hi>No</hi>
so very naturally, that their <hi>No</hi> always ushers in
whatever they are about to say. This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them so disagreeable, that though they be
prevail'd upon with much Importunity to
grant any Request, yet all the Grace and
Commendation of such <hi>Grants</hi> are utterly lost
by so very untoward a beginning.</p>
               <p>IV. All things are not to be granted at all
times, nor all Men to be gratified: And it
is altogether as commendable to refuse, upon
<hi>Occasion,</hi> as to give. This makes some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>No</hi> better received than other Peoples
<hi>Yes.</hi> A <hi>Denial,</hi> accompanied with Sweetness
and Civility, pleases more a Man of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
than a Courtesie granted coldly
and rudely.</p>
               <p>V. We engage others more effectually to
serve us by <hi>Promises,</hi> than by <hi>Presents;</hi> for
while Men are kept upon the Tenters, they
endeavour to deserve those Kindnesses they
expect from us.</p>
               <p>* VI. He that gives to all without Disere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will soon stand in need of every Body.</p>
               <p>* VII. He that defers Charity till Death,
is rather Liberal of another Man's, than of
his own.</p>
               <p>VIII. <hi>Liberality</hi> does not consist so much
in giving largely, as in giving seasonably.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:97015:73"/>
IX. There is something Heroical in great
<hi>Liberality,</hi> as well as in great Valour; and
there is a great Analogy between those two
Virtues; the one raises the Soul above the
Consideration of Wealth, as the other beyond
the Management and Desire of Life. But
with all these Gay and Generous Motives,
the one becomes Ruinous, and the other
Fatal.</p>
               <p>X. There are some Men, jealous of the
Honour of their Motions, who refuse all
things at the Inspirations of others, because
they would not be prevented in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and troubled in the order of the good
they would do. That may proceed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
from a good Principle, and be met with
in very lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty Souls; but for the most part
they are Dishonest, Jealous, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alse Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Honour, which produce a true Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
to the doing of Favours.</p>
               <p>XI. Those whom cross Accidents of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
have undone, are pity'd by all the
World, because it is a Misfortune the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Humanity submits us to: But those
who are reduc'd to Misery by <hi>Vain Profusion,</hi>
raise more Contempt than Commiseration,
because it is the issue of a peculiar Folly,
from which every Man has the good conceit
to think himself exempt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:97015:73"/>
               <head>Love.</head>
               <p>I. IN <hi>Friendship</hi> we take notice of those <hi>Failings</hi>
that may prejudice our <hi>Friends:</hi> In <hi>Love</hi>
we never see in the Party beloved, but those
Defects only by which we are offended.</p>
               <p>II. There is but the first Quarrel in <hi>Love,</hi> as
the first Fault in <hi>Friendship,</hi> which may turn to
good account.</p>
               <p>III. Coldness or Slackness in <hi>Friendship,</hi> has
generally a Cause: In <hi>Love</hi> there is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
no other reason for People loving no
more, than their having lov'd too much.</p>
               <p>IV. Both the Beginning and Decay of <hi>Love,</hi>
shew themselves by the Uneasiness and Trouble
<hi>Lovers</hi> are in, when they are together by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>V. When a Man has a Passion for an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour'd
<hi>Woman,</hi> it must needs be an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
one: For either his <hi>Love</hi> proceeds from
his own Weakness, or is influenc'd by more
secret and irresistible Charms than those of
<hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. When a <hi>Passion</hi> is worn out, we often
visit a <hi>Mistress</hi> out of Custom; and tell one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that we love still, when our Actions testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie
that we love no more.</p>
               <p>VII. Being absent from what we <hi>love,</hi> is a
Good, in comparison of living with that we
<hi>hate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. As disinterested as a Man may be, either
in <hi>Friendship</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> he ought sometimes to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97015:74"/>
put a Constraint upon himself, and be so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as to <hi>receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. <hi>Love</hi> is to the <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Lover,</hi> what the
<hi>Soul</hi> is to the <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. It is very hard to give a just <hi>Definition</hi> of
<hi>Love;</hi> the most we can say of it, is this: That
in the <hi>Soul,</hi> it is a greedy Desire to <hi>Govern;</hi>
in <hi>Spirits,</hi> it is a <hi>Sympathy;</hi> and in the <hi>Body,</hi> it is
only a nice and secret <hi>Longing</hi> to enjoy the thing
<hi>beloved,</hi> after a great deal of Bustle and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality.</p>
               <p>XI. If there be any such thing as <hi>Love</hi> pure,
and untained with the Mixture of any other
Passion, it is that which lurks in the deepest
Recesses of our <hi>Hearts,</hi> unknown to our selves.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Love</hi> has such peculiar distinguishing
<hi>Characters,</hi> that it is as hard to hide it when
<hi>true,</hi> as to dissemble it when <hi>false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. Considering how little the <hi>Beginning</hi>
or the <hi>Ceasing</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> is in our own Power, it
is equally unreasonable for a <hi>Lover</hi> no complain
of his <hi>Mistress</hi>'s Fickleness, as for a <hi>Mistress</hi> of
her <hi>Lover</hi>'s Inconstancy.</p>
               <p>XIV. If we judge of <hi>Love</hi> according to most of
its Effects, we shall find that it more resembles
<hi>Hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed</hi> than <hi>Friendship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. <hi>Love</hi> can no more continue without a
constant motion, than <hi>Fire</hi> can; and it ceases to
be, when it ceases either to <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. It is with true <hi>Love,</hi> as it is with <hi>Ghosts</hi>
and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> a thing that every body talks
of, and scarce any body has seen.</p>
               <p>XVII. We father upon <hi>Love</hi> several Dealings
and Intercourses, in which it is no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97015:74"/>
than the <hi>Doge</hi> is, in what is done at
<hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. When we have loved our selves weary,
the kindest and most welcome thing that can
be, is, the <hi>Infidelity</hi> of others, which may give
us a fair Pretence to disengage our Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
               <p>XIX. The more passionately a Man loves his
<hi>Mistress,</hi> the readier he is to hate <hi>her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XX. When a <hi>Woman</hi> has once given her self
over to entertain <hi>Love, Loving</hi> is then the least
Fault she can be guilty of.</p>
               <p>XXI. Some Persons had never been in <hi>love,</hi>
had they never been entertain'd with any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of it.</p>
               <p>XXII. The greatest Pleasure of <hi>Love,</hi> is <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi>
and a Man is more happy in his own
Passion, than in that he influences in another.</p>
               <p>XXIII. <hi>Absence</hi> cools moderate <hi>Passions,</hi> and
inflames violent ones; just as the <hi>Wind</hi> blows
out Candles, but kindles Fires.</p>
               <p>XXIV. It is much easier to usher in <hi>Love</hi> into
one's Breast, than to drive it out when it is once
admitted.</p>
               <p>XXV. In <hi>Love,</hi> loving but little, proves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the best way to be lov'd again.</p>
               <p>XXVI. The Sincerity which <hi>Lovers</hi> and their
<hi>Mistresses</hi> bargain for, in agreeing to tell one
another when they can love no longer, is not
ask'd so much out of a Desire to know when
their <hi>Love</hi> is at an end, as to be satisfy'd that
<hi>Love</hi> does really continue, so long as they are
told nothing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:97015:75"/>
XXVII. In <hi>Love,</hi> he that's first cur'd, is best
cur'd</p>
               <p>XXVIII. To speak <hi>feelingly</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> is as <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetish</hi>
in a young Woman, as 'tis <hi>ridiculous</hi> in
an old Man.</p>
               <p>XXIX. * <hi>Love</hi> is a kind of penurious <hi>God,</hi>
very niggard of his <hi>Opportunities;</hi> he must be
watch'd like a hard-hearted Treasurer; for he
bolts out of a sudden, and if you take him not in
the nick, he vanishes in a twinkling.</p>
               <p>XXX. * There is no reason in the World to
revenge upon a <hi>Lover</hi> the <hi>Deceits</hi> of his <hi>Love;</hi>
for as in <hi>War,</hi> so in <hi>Love,</hi> Stratagems are always
allow'd.</p>
               <p>XXXI. * A silly <hi>Mistress</hi> is like a <hi>weak Place,</hi>
soon got, soon lost.</p>
               <p>XXXII. * <hi>Mistresses</hi> are like <hi>Books;</hi> if you
pore upon them too much, they doze you, and
make you unfit for Company; but if us'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
you are the sitter for Conversation by
them.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. * Some <hi>Women</hi> pray for <hi>Husbands,</hi>
that they may the better love at random.</p>
               <p>XXXIV. * Many a <hi>Spark</hi> that hunts after
a <hi>Mistress,</hi> often gets a <hi>Wife,</hi> and stands
condemn'd to a Repentance during Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Redemption, except one of the two
dies.</p>
               <p>XXXV. * Some People fall in <hi>love</hi> by <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi>
and meerly by conversing with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. * Men do not <hi>see,</hi> or <hi>taste,</hi> or <hi>find</hi>
the thing they <hi>love;</hi> but they create it: They
fashion an Idol in what Figure or Shape they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97015:75"/>
please; set it up, worship it, dote upon it, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
it, and sometimes run mad for it.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. * The extravagant Transports of
<hi>Love,</hi> and the wonderful Force of <hi>Nature,</hi> are
uncontroulable: The one carries us out of our
selves, and the other brings us back again.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. Two passionate <hi>Lovers</hi> cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of other <hi>Pleasures,</hi> than those which they
receive from their <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXIX. There is no <hi>Passion</hi> that more excites
us to every thing that is Noble and Generous,
than an <hi>honest Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XL. Short absence excites <hi>Passions,</hi> whereas
a long one destroys them.</p>
               <p>XLI. Women who preserve a <hi>Passion</hi> for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are absent, raise but little in those who
see them; and the continuation of their Love
for the Absent, is less an <hi>Honour</hi> to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
than a <hi>Scandal</hi> to their Beauty.</p>
               <p>XLII. The <hi>Love</hi> of young People is only an
irregular <hi>Passion,</hi> and boiling <hi>Desire,</hi> that has
no other Object than <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and which <hi>Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
dissipates.</p>
               <p>XLIII. <hi>Love</hi> comes in by the Ears, as well as
by the Eyes; and therefore it is a great Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in a Man, to make a long Descant upon
his <hi>Mistress</hi>'s Perfections, before his <hi>Friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XLIV. <hi>Love</hi> has, as it were, never well esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
his <hi>Power,</hi> till he has ruin'd that of
<hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XLV. <hi>Love</hi> begins by <hi>Love;</hi> and the greatest
<hi>Friendship</hi> can never influence but a very small
<hi>Passion.</hi>

XLVI. Nothing resembles true <hi>Friendship</hi> so
well, as those Engagements which have a secret
<hi>Love</hi> at the bottom.</p>
               <p>XLVII. We never <hi>love</hi> truly but once, and
that's the first time we love: The following
<hi>Passions</hi> are less involuntary.</p>
               <p>XLVIII. That <hi>Passion</hi> which is rais'd on the
sudden, is the most difficult to be cur'd.</p>
               <p>XLIX. That <hi>Love</hi> which encreases by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
is so much like <hi>Friendship,</hi> that it can never
be a violent Passion.</p>
               <p>L. As nice as we are in <hi>Love,</hi> we still forgive
more Faults in that, than in <hi>Friendship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LI. We tell our Secrets in <hi>Friendship,</hi> but they
<hi>slip</hi> from us in <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LII. There are many <hi>Remedies</hi> to cure <hi>Love;</hi>
but never a one of them is infallible.</p>
               <p>LIII. The greatest <hi>Miracle Love</hi> can work, is
to cure a <hi>Coquet Humour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LIV. <hi>Coquets</hi> make it a Pride to be jealous of
their <hi>Lovers,</hi> only to conceal their <hi>Envy</hi> of other
<hi>Women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LV. The reason why <hi>Lovers</hi> are but seldom

               <p>VII. The Address and Industry of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
moderate <hi>Abilities</hi> to the best Advantage,
steal away, if I may so speak, our Esteem, and
bring a Man oftentimes in to greater Reputation
than real <hi>Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. Real <hi>Merit</hi> gains a Man the Esteem of
<hi>good Men;</hi> but 'tis only <hi>Fate</hi> that gains him
that of the <hi>Multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. The Appearances of <hi>Merit</hi> are oftner
Rewarded than <hi>Merit</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>X. There are a great many Men valu'd in
the World, who have no other <hi>Merit,</hi> than <hi>Vices</hi>
profitable to Commerce and Society.</p>
               <p>XI. A Man's <hi>Merit</hi> has its particular Season,
as well as <hi>Fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. A Man's <hi>Palate</hi> (or discerning Faculty)
lowers proportionably to his <hi>Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. As much as the <hi>World</hi> is inclin'd to think
ill of one another, we see them oftner favourable
to <hi>false Merit,</hi> than injurious to <hi>true.</hi>

XIV. Some Men are like <hi>Ballads,</hi> which are in
vogue but for a while.</p>
               <p>XV. A Noble Birth, or a Great Fortune,
proclaims <hi>Merit,</hi> and makes it the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Nature.</head>
               <p>I. MOst <hi>young People</hi> think often to follow
<hi>Nature,</hi> when they are only unpolish'd
and ill-bred.</p>
               <p>II. Nothing hinders Men so much from being
<hi>plain</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> as the straining themselves to
be thought so.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Nature</hi> was given to exercise the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
like some dark intricate <hi>Riddle;</hi> every one
makes his own Sense the Key, and out of that
contrives his own <hi>System.</hi> He that by his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
explains most Difficulties, may be allow'd
thus far to value himself, That he has hit upon
the most probable Opinion.</p>
               <p>IV. Something of one's Temper always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into the best formed Designs; and <hi>Nature</hi>
is never so much reduc'd, but that the keeps as
much Right over our Actions, as we can take
over her Motions.</p>
               <p>V. * It is a wonderful thing how the very
Force of <hi>Nature</hi> will exert it self, in the meanest
and the weakest of Creatures, in cases of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Necessity and Danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:97015:82"/>
VI. * The different Abilities of Men, which
we call Wisdom, or Prudence, for the Conduct
of publick Affairs, or private Life, grow directly
out of that little Grain of Intellect, or good
Sense, which they bring with them into the
World; and that the Defect of it in Men,
comes from some want in their Conception, or
Birth. And though this may be improv'd, or
impair'd, in some degree, by Accidents of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Study, Conversation, or Business; yet
it cannot go beyond the reach of its Native
Force, no more than Life can, beyond the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to which it was destin'd, by the Strength or
Weakness of the Seminal Virtue.</p>
               <p>VII. 'Tis impossible to renounce <hi>Nature,</hi> and
to raise our selves above the Condition God has
plac'd us in. We shall see a Wise Man not able to
defend himself from <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Folly;</hi> an Hero
feeble, full of Defects, and as much a Man as
they which are below him: For, in truth, there
are no Great Men, if we compare 'em one with
another; but they are in themselves weak, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
and deficient, in some part or other.</p>
               <p>VIII. Nothing is durable, that is not suited
to <hi>Nature.</hi> Too austere a Philosophy, makes
few wise Men; too rigorous a Government,
few good Subjects; too harsh a Religion, few
religious Souls; I mean, that will long continue
so.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:97015:82"/>
               <head>Nobility, Gentility.</head>
               <p>I. THere cannot be a meaner thing, than to
take advantage of one's <hi>Quality</hi> and
<hi>Greatness,</hi> to ridicule and insult over those of
an inferiour Condition.</p>
               <p>II. They that are so ridiculous as to value
themselves meerly upon their <hi>Quality,</hi> do in a
manner slight that very thing that gave them
their <hi>Quality;</hi> since 'tis only the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtue</hi> of their
Ancestors that first ennobled their <hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The great Mistake of most <hi>Noble-men,</hi> is,
That they look upon their <hi>Nobility</hi> as a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
given them by <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. True <hi>Quality,</hi> and that which is the
Gift of <hi>Nature,</hi> is only the Noble Advantages
and Endowments of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. The more ancient that <hi>Nobility</hi> is which
we derive from our <hi>Ancestors,</hi> the more suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and uncertain it is; and therefore the less
valuable. The Son of a <hi>Mareschal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
who by his own Worth has rais'd himself to this
Office, should, in all Reason, be more <hi>Noble,</hi>
than the Posterity that descend from him.
The Spring of <hi>Honour</hi> is yet fresh in the Son's
Veins, and kept up by the Example of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the further it runs from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the weaker and drier it grows.</p>
               <p>VI. We are surpriz'd every Day, to see some
Men, that are come from the Scum of the <hi>People,</hi>
raise themselves to great <hi>Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Honours;</hi>
and we commonly mention this with Scorn and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97015:83"/>
Reproach; as if all the Great <hi>Families</hi> in the
World had not as mean a Beginning, if we
would but take pains to trace them back to
their Originals.</p>
               <p>VII. * A bragging <hi>Fool</hi> that's rais'd out of a
Dunghil, and sets up for a Man of <hi>Quality,</hi> is
asham'd of nothing in the World but his own
Father.</p>
               <p>VIII. It is with the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> as
with <hi>Genealogies</hi> of private <hi>Persons;</hi> these are
purely imaginary; those shew themselves in
Fables. From whence it comes to pass, that
the Ancients held themselves oblig'd to some
Deity or other, either upon the account of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
from it, or else because they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
a particular Care and Protection from
its Tutelary Virtue.</p>
               <p>IX. * It is the Saying of a Great Man, That
if we could trace our Descents, we should find
all Slaves to come from Princes, and all Princes
from Slaves: But <hi>Fortune</hi> has turn'd all Things
topsie-turvy, in a long Story of Revolutions.
But it matters not whence we come, but what
we are; nor is it any more to our Honour, the
Glory of our Predecessors, than it is to their
Shame, the Wickedness of their Posterity.</p>
               <p>X. It is a great Advantage for a Man to be
Nobly descended; but it is still a greater one
for him to be such by his own Merit, that People
never enquire whether he be a Gentleman or
no.</p>
               <p>XI. * <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bility</hi> of Birth, commonly abates In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;
and he that is not industrious, envies
him that is. Beside, Noble Persons cannot go
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97015:83"/>
much higher; and he that stands at a stay,
when others rise, can hardly avoid Motions of
Envy.</p>
               <p>XII. * A <hi>Monarchy,</hi> where there is no <hi>Nobility</hi>
at all, is a pure absolute <hi>Tyranny;</hi> for <hi>Nobility</hi>
attempers <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and draws the Eyes of the
People somewhat aside from the <hi>Royal Line.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. * Those that are first rais'd to <hi>Nobility,</hi>
are commonly more virtuous, but less innocent,
than their Descendants; for there is rarely any
Rising, but by a commixture of good and evil
Arts.</p>

               <head>Obstinacy, Contradiction.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>STubborness</hi> and <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> are the Effects
of a shallow <hi>Wit;</hi> for we can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
what we cannot apprehend.</p>
               <p>II. Men of mean <hi>Capacities,</hi> but especially
your half-witted Fellows and <hi>pedantick</hi> Scholars,
are most apt to be stiff and peremptory. None
but Manly <hi>Souls</hi> can unsay what they have said,
and forsake an Errour, when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on the wrong side.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Contradiction</hi> should awaken our <hi>Attention</hi>
and <hi>Care,</hi> and not our <hi>Passion:</hi> Our Interest
ought to be no other than that of <hi>Truth;</hi> and
therefore we must rather hear those that oppose
it, than avoid them, which is little better than
yielding the Victory.</p>
               <p>IV. There can be no arguing with a Man
<hi>obstinate</hi> in his Opinion; for when he has once
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97015:84"/>
contradicted, his Mind is barr'd up against all
Light and better Information; Arguments,
tho' never so well grounded, do but provoke
him, and make him even afraid to be convinc'd
of the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. The generality of Men do not make it
their Business to be in the right, so much as to
be thought so: This makes them stickle so
stifly for their own Opinions, even when they
know and are satisfied, they are false.</p>
               <p>VII. The <hi>Obstinacy</hi> of some People in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
Opinions generally receiv'd, is the effect
rather of <hi>Pride</hi> than <hi>Ignorance:</hi> Those that are
on the right side, have got the upper hand, and
they scorn to take up with the lower.</p>
               <p>VIII. No Men are so often in the <hi>wrong,</hi> as
those who pretend to be always in the <hi>right.</hi>

and no less frequently a <hi>witty Man</hi>
of a <hi>Fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. It is with our <hi>Passions,</hi> as it is with <hi>Fire</hi>
and <hi>Water;</hi> they are <hi>good Servants,</hi> and <hi>bad
Masters,</hi> and Sub-minister to the best and worst
of Purposes at once.</p>
               <p>III. The continuance of our <hi>Passions,</hi> is no
more in our own Power, than the Term of our
Lives.</p>
               <p>IV. Those great and glittering Actions which
dazzle the Eyes of most Men; and are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97015:84"/>
by Politicians, as the Effects of great
Wisdom and Design, are indeed generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd
by litte <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Passions.</hi> Thus
the War of <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
which is ascrib'd to the violent <hi>Ambition</hi>
each of them had to get the Mastery of the
whole <hi>World,</hi> was occasion'd, perhaps, by a
little rise of <hi>Iealousie</hi> between them.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Passions</hi> are <hi>Nature</hi>'s never-failing <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and the only <hi>Orators</hi> that can master our
<hi>Affections.</hi> The plainest Man inspir'd by a
<hi>Passion,</hi> perswades much better than the most
<hi>eloquent,</hi> who is inspir'd by none.</p>
               <p>VI. There is in all <hi>Passions</hi> a kind of Injustice
and Self-interest, which makes them very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to be follow'd; and we ought not to trust
them, even when they appear most fair and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</p>
               <p>VII. There is in our <hi>Hearts</hi> a constant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Passions;</hi> so that the Destruction of
one, is generally the Production of another.</p>
               <p>VIII. As wary and cautious Men are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their <hi>Passions,</hi> under the specious Dress of
<hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> this Disguise is too thin; and
they seldom fail to break through it at one time
or other.</p>
               <p>IX. The <hi>Passions</hi> often give birth to others
of a Nature quite contrary to their own: <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
sometimes brings forth <hi>Poodigality;</hi> and
<hi>Prodigality, Avarice:</hi> Some are Resolute out of
Weakness, and Bold out of Timorousness and
Fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:97015:85"/>
X. All <hi>Passions</hi> are nothing else but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degrees of Heat and Cold in the
<hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. The Victory we gain sometimes over
our <hi>Passions,</hi> is owing to their <hi>Weakness,</hi> more
than our own <hi>Strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. The <hi>Health</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> is as frail and
uncertain, as that of the <hi>Body:</hi> And tho' a Man
may seem free from all manner of <hi>Passions,</hi> yet
is he in so much danger of falling into them, as
one in a perfect state of Health, is of having a
fit of Sickness.</p>
               <p>XIII. It is one of the greatest Secrets of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
that Men's <hi>Passions</hi> are more capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rais'd to higher degrees in <hi>Companies,</hi> than
in <hi>Solitude;</hi> and that we sooner grieve, fear,
rejoice, love, admire, &amp;c. when we behold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others so mov'd, than when we are alone.</p>
               <p>XIV. No Man can guess in cold <hi>Blood,</hi> what
he may do in a <hi>Passion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. While our <hi>Heart</hi> is ruffled by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of a <hi>Passion,</hi> it is more susceptible of a
new one, than if it was entirely setled.</p>
               <p>XVI. Those that have had great <hi>Passions,</hi>
find themselves perpetually happy and unhappy,
in being cur'd of them.</p>
               <p>XVII. We are to blame not to distinguish
between the several sorts of <hi>Anger;</hi> for there
is a Light, and, as it were, a harmless one,
which results from a warm Complexion; and
another exceeding vicious, which is, in strict
speaking, the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fierceness</hi> of <hi>Pride.</hi>

XVIII. <hi>Nature,</hi> it seems, has treasur'd up,
in the bottom of our Hearts, some secret <hi>Talents</hi>
and <hi>Abilities,</hi> which <hi>Passions</hi> only have the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to improve; and which, upon some Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
gives us a surer prospect of Things,
than ever Art could do.</p>
               <p>XIX. It is is as unseasonable to recompence

               </p>
               <p>XX. * That <hi>Mind</hi> is truly happy, which can
entirely deny some <hi>Passions,</hi> and only unbend it
self to some others.</p>
               <p>XXI. The <hi>Soul</hi> is tir'd to be always in the
same posture, and at a long run, it would lose
all its Vigour, if it were not awaken'd by the
<hi>Passions.</hi>

               <p>III. There is always a part of our <hi>Thought</hi>

               </p>
               <p>II. The Contempt of <hi>Riches</hi> in <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
was only a desire of vindicating their own <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and taking a Revenge upon the Injustice of
<hi>Fortune,</hi> by undervaluitg those Enjoyments
which she had not given them: This was a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to secure them from the Disparagement of

and Esteem, which they could not
compass by <hi>Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> among the

but only improv'd them by the setting up

               </p>
               <p>IV. * There is no Condition that does not sit
well upon a wise Man: For this Reason, I shall
never quarrel with a <hi>Philosopher</hi> for living in a

               <p>II. A Man that knows how to mingle <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
with <hi>Business,</hi> is never possess'd of them;
he quits them, and retakes them at his Will;
and in the habit which he has made of them, he
rather finds an unweariness of Spirits, than a
dangerous Charm that might corrupt him. It
is not so with these austere Persons, who by an
alteration of Temper, come to taste of <hi>Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness,</hi>
they are immediately inchanted with
its Sweetness; and having nothing but an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the Austerity of their past Lives, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
themselves to the first Delights they meet
with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:97015:87"/>
III. * 'Tis not so hard to counterfeit <hi>Ioy</hi> in
the depth of <hi>Affliction,</hi> as to dissemble <hi>Mirth</hi> in
the Company of <hi>Fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. The excess of Delights palls our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
oftner than it pleases.</p>
               <p>V. It is much better to seek every thing that
can please in any Man, than to seek for a Man
that can please in every thing; for a Man in all
respects agreeable, is so great a rarity, that it
is no Wisdom to hunt after that we are hardly
ever like to find.</p>
               <p>VI. We are so fond of every thing that is
fresh and uncommon, that we take a secret
<hi>Pleasure,</hi> and find entertainment even in the
sight of the dismallest and most tragical <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;</hi>
and that partly because they are new, and
partly from a Principle of Ill-nature that is
in us.</p>
               <p>VII. The continual Society, even of the best
Men, becomes at length tiresome, or insensible;
which makes those Persons that have a delicate
Apprehension of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> voluntarily remove
themselves from one another, to avoid the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
that threatens them, and to have a better
Taste of the Charms of Conversation, by a
new Vigour which they bestow upon their
Thoughts.</p>
               <p>VIII. There is no Man but is sometimes at a
loss with himself; the Wisest are weary of
themselves, after they have been weary of
others.</p>
               <p>IX. We never fail to be tiresome to our
selves, by too long and too serious a Commerce
with our own Thoughts. He that intends to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97015:87"/>
live happy, must make but few Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Life; nay, he must often depart, as it were,
from himself; and amidst the <hi>Pleasures</hi> which
exteriour Objects furnish him with, steal from
the Knowledge of his own Miseries.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Pride.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>PRide</hi> always indemnifies it self one way
or other; and loses nothing, no not in
Self-denial.</p>
               <p>II. When <hi>Pride</hi> has appear'd in all its Shapes,
and play'd all the Parts of <hi>Human Life,</hi> as if it
were tir'd with its own Disguises and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
it pulls off the Mask; and shewing
its true Face at last, is known by its <hi>Insolence;</hi>
so that, properly speaking, <hi>Insolence</hi> is the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, and Demonstration of <hi>Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. 'Tis only because we are <hi>proud</hi> our selves,
that we complain of, and cannot bear with the
<hi>Pride</hi> of others.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Pride</hi> is much the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame in all Men, as to
the Degree of it, and differs only by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Methods of exerting it.</p>
               <p>V. The Wisdom of <hi>Nature</hi> is to be admir'd,
not only in sitting the Organs of the <hi>Body,</hi> for
our Happiness and Convenience, but also in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
<hi>Pride</hi> upon Men, to keep their Sight
from the troublesome View of their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:97015:88"/>
VI. There is oftentimes more <hi>Pride</hi> than
<hi>Goodness</hi> in our <hi>Reproofs;</hi> and we chide other
People for their Faults, not so much with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to correct them, as to make them believe
that we our selves have none.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>Blindness</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> are the most perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Effects of <hi>Pride;</hi> for they both cherish and
encrease the <hi>Vice,</hi> by concealing from us those
Remedies, that might conduce to the Cure of
our Miseries, and correct our Excesses and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances.</p>
               <p>VIII. Nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>latters our <hi>Pride</hi> so much, as
the Intimacy and Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idence of Great Persons;
for we are apt to think our selves admitted to
these by our own Desert; and never consider
that it happens much oftner, from a particular
<hi>Vanity</hi> in their Humours, or their not being able
to keep their own Counsel.</p>
               <p>IX. * All <hi>proud</hi> Men, over and above the Stroke
of a Divine Judgment, are miserable, even in
themselves, and no Circumstances in the World
can ever make them otherwise. Their Appetites
are in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atiable, and their Hearts consequently
never at rest; whether it be <hi>Wealth, Power,
Honour, Popular Esteem,</hi> or whatever else they
pretend to: They envy, and are envy'd: 'Tis
impossible for them to be at rest, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
what it is impossible for them to attain;
they live, gaping after more, and in a perpetual
fear of losing what they have already: The
higher they are rais'd, the giddier they are, the
more slippery is their Standing, and the deeper
they Fall. They are never well, so long as any
thing is above them; and their <hi>Ambition</hi> carries
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97015:88"/>
them to the supplanting of their Masters and
Makers; when yet, by a most ridiculous Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
they lie effectually, in the same instant,
at the Mercy of the Men they most despise.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>Humility</hi> is very often the putting on of a
<hi>Submission,</hi> by which Men hope to bring other
People to submit to them. It is a mere artificial
sort of <hi>Pride,</hi> which debases it self with a design
of being exalted: And tho' this <hi>Vice</hi> transform
it self into a thousand several Shapes, yet it is
never more effectually disguis'd, or more capable
of imposing upon the <hi>World,</hi> than when conceal'd
under a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. A readiness to believe <hi>Ill,</hi> without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Examination, proceeds from <hi>Laziness</hi> and
<hi>Pride:</hi> We are pleas'd to find others to blame,
and loth to give our selves the trouble of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
how far, and whether they are so, or
not.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Pride,</hi> that so often inspires Men with
Envy, does sometimes moderate it too.</p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>Pride</hi> generally encreases by the <hi>Parings</hi>
of other <hi>Faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. The same <hi>Pride</hi> that disposes us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the <hi>Faults</hi> we think our selves free
from, inclines us to undervalue the <hi>Good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
we want.</p>
               <p>XIII. The Compassion we express for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Misfortunes, is sometimes more the effect
of <hi>Pride,</hi> than <hi>Good-nature,</hi> and only a Desire to
let them know that we are above them.</p>
               <p>XIV. <hi>Pride,</hi> as well as other <hi>Passions,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
and humoursome. We are asham'd
to own our being <hi>Iealous,</hi> when we are so; and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97015:89"/>
yet we value our selves upon having been so, and
for being capable of being so.</p>
               <p>XV. It is as good and commendable to be
<hi>proud</hi> with one's self, as it is ridiculous with
others.</p>
               <p>XVI. <hi>Magnanimity</hi> is a bold Stroke of <hi>Pride,</hi>
which makes a Man Master of himself, in order
to make him so of every thing else.</p>
               <p>XVII. A Man of <hi>Wit,</hi> that is naturally <hi>proud,</hi>
loses nothing of his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Stiffness,</hi> by being
low in the <hi>World;</hi> but, on the contrary, if any
thing can soften his Humour, and make him
more courteous and sociable, it must be a little

               <head>Raillery, Laughter.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>RAillery</hi> is harder to be born than <hi>Injuries,</hi>
because it is an allowable thing to be
concern'd at <hi>Injuries;</hi> but a ridiculous one to
be angry at a <hi>Iest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>Raillery</hi> is an <hi>Injury</hi> disguis'd full of Malice
and Ill-nature, which is endured with so much
less Patience, as it shews, that they who use it,
would be thought above us.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Princes</hi> and Persons in eminent Stations,
would do well to be exceedingly reserv'd, as to
this part of Conversation: The Resentments of
their <hi>Raillery,</hi> are the more dangerous, because
kept more conceal'd, and that Men are ever
contriving some private ways of Revenge for
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:97015:89"/>
IV. <hi>Raillery</hi> very often betrays want of <hi>Wit;</hi>
Men call it in to their Relief, when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Sense and Argument le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

themselves.</p>
               <p>V. * No Man was ever ridiculous to others,
that laugh'd at himself first.</p>
               <p>VI. There are small <hi>Defects</hi> which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to abandon to the <hi>Censure</hi> and <hi>Raillery</hi> of
others; such <hi>Defects</hi> as those we ought to chuse,
to jeer other People upon.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reason.</head>
               <p>I. WE have not Strength enough to follow
our <hi>Reason,</hi> so far as it would carry us.</p>
               <p>II. That Man has but little <hi>Reason</hi> left him,
who is past hopes of finding <hi>Reason</hi> from others.</p>
               <p>III. He is not to be accounted <hi>Reasonable,</hi>
who stumbles upon <hi>Reason</hi> by chance; but he
that knows, and can judge, and has a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of it.</p>
               <p>IV. Our <hi>Reason</hi> is much better employ'd, in
bearing up, and allaying present <hi>Misfortunes,</hi>
than in fore-casting future ones.</p>
               <p>V. A Man never wishes for any thing very
eagerly, which he wishes for only by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. No Man can be perfectly just and good,
without a great measure of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Right Reason,</hi>
which will always encline him to chuse the juster
Side, in every Action of his Life. And it is a
foolish thing to extol wicked Men and Knaves,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97015:90"/>
as the World commonly does, for Persons of <hi>Wit</hi>
and <hi>Vnderstanding:</hi> Such People have only one
part of that sound <hi>Sense,</hi> which is the reason
why they are successful upon some Occasions,
but imperfect and at a loss upon a thousand
others.</p>
               <p>VII. As nothing betrays greater <hi>Weakness</hi> and
want of <hi>Reason,</hi> than to submit one's Judgment
to another Man's, without any Examination or
Consideration of our own; so nothing argues a
great <hi>Spirit,</hi> and true <hi>Wisdom,</hi> more than the
submitting to Almighty God, with absolute and
implicit Faith, and believing whatever he says
upon the single Anthority of his own Word.</p>
               <p>VIII. We attribute more to <hi>Reason,</hi> than is
her due; she frequently usurps what of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to our Constitution, and would have but
few Advantages, if she had no more than are
strictly her own.</p>
               <p>IX. <hi>Reason</hi> does seldom cure any <hi>Passion,</hi> but
rather strikes in with the strongest; for there
is no <hi>Passion,</hi> but is authoriz'd and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd
by some <hi>Reason</hi> or other:</p>
               <p>X. Good and Right <hi>Reason</hi> is a Light in the
<hi>Mind,</hi> by which it discerns things as they are
in themselves: But in this World, this Light is
encompass'd and darkned by a thousand Mists
and Clouds.</p>
               <p>XI. Good <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> ought to be the
<hi>Vmpire</hi> of all Rules, both Ancient and Modern;
whatever does not agree with this Standard, is
false.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:97015:90"/>
XII. * The same Faculty of <hi>Reason,</hi> which
gives Mankind the great Advantage and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
over the rest of the Creation, seems to
make the greatest Default in Human Nature;
and subjects it to more Troubles, Miseries, or
at least Disquiets of Life, than any of its Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Creatures.
'Tis this furnishes us with such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Passions, and consequently of Wants
and Desires, which no others feel; and these
follow'd by infinite Designs and endless Pursuits,
and improv'd by that Restlesness of Thought,
which is natural to most Men, gives us a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Life, suitable to that of our Birth; so
that as we are born crying, we live complaining,
and die disappointed.</p>
               <p>XIII. * Since we cannot escape the Pursuit of
Passions, and Perplexity of Thoughts which our
<hi>Reason</hi> furnishes us, there is no way left, but to
endeavour all we can, either to subdue, or to
divert them.</p>
               <p>XIV. <hi>Superstition</hi> renders a Man a <hi>Fool,</hi> and
<hi>Scepticism</hi> is enough to make him <hi>mad.</hi> To
believe all things, is above <hi>Reason;</hi> to give
credit to nothing, is below it.</p>
               <p>XV. Most Men rather chuse implicitly, than
to put themselves to the expence of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
without instructing themselves in the
nature of Things, they take those to be the
best, that have the most Examples, and the
greatest Crowd of Admirers: They don't fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Reason,</hi> but only the Resemblance of it;
and stifly retain their Errours, because they
are countenanc'd by those of other Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:97015:91"/>
XVI. It is much better for a Man to fall
naturally into the good Sence of others by his
<hi>Reason,</hi> than to make his Humours receiv'd by
force.</p>
               <p>XVII. * There are times when <hi>Sense</hi> may
be unseasonable, as well as <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. Common Sence is of the Growth of
every Country; and all People who unite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Societies, and form Governments, will, in
time, make prudent Laws of all kinds; since
it is not Strength of Imagination, nor Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Reasoning, but Constancy in making
Observations upon the several Ways of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Human Nature, that first stored the
World with Moral Truths, and put Mankind
upon forming such Rules of Practice, as best
suited with these Observations.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reputation.</head>
               <p>I. WHat an ill <hi>Name</hi> soever a Man has got
in the World, yet it is almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in his own Power to recover his <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. The great <hi>Characters</hi> of being Men of
<hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> are very often grounded
more upon Forms, and a Knack of appearing
to be such, than any true and solid <hi>Worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:97015:91"/>
III. Those that have the Accomplishments es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to the making a <hi>good Man,</hi> supposing
they need no Art, neglect Formalities; act more
according to <hi>Nature,</hi> and consequently live more
obscure and in the dark. For those that judge
of them, have something else to do than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them; and so they pronounce Sentence
only according to outward Appearances.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Reputation</hi> would not be so highly valu'd,
if we did but seriously consider, how very unjust
the generality of Men are, both in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and taking it away. We should content
our selves to deserve it by our Good-behaviour;
and when that Care is taken, not be over-anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
about the Success.</p>
               <p>V. The <hi>Vulgar</hi> value and extol Actions, and
other Things, not only for their Excellence,
but more generally for the Uncommonness of
them: And this gives occasion to all the false
Methods Men take to gain the <hi>Approbation</hi> of the
World.</p>
               <p>VI. A great <hi>Reputation,</hi> is a great Charge,
very hard for a Man to acquit himself well of;
an obscure Life is more natural, and more easie.</p>
               <p>VII. The first Step that a Man makes in
the World, generally determines all the rest,
and is the Foundation of his <hi>Reputation,</hi> and
best Presage of his Fortune; and from the
first Marches that he makes, those that have
had Experience, will tell how far he will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
'Tis then very necessary to make this
first Step with a great deal of Caution, and to
signalize ones Entry by something that is glorious
and great.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:97015:92"/>
VIII. A Great Man ought not to suffer the
Depth of his Capacity to be founded, if he will
be always esteem'd by the Vulgar: He ought, on
the contrary, to behave himself after such a
manner, as never to discover all his Ability, and
that no Man may assign Limits to his Learning.
For let a Man be never so Learned, the Opinion
we have of him, when we know him but by
halves, goes always farther than the <hi>Idea</hi> we
conceive of him, when we are wholly acquainted
with him.</p>
               <p>IX. <hi>Reputation</hi> is a Noise which strikes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Ear, and which cannot make a
sensible Impression upon a Noble Soul; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
less upon our selves than Fortune: But as
it is impossible to acquire a general one; so the
possession of it would be absolutely unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>X. A Man who is sensible of his Force, and
knows the Advantages of his Mind, if he aspires
to Glory, and will raise his <hi>Reputation,</hi> ought to
dread, as a Rock, his being suspected that he is
gov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rn'd by others.</p>
               <p>XI. Some People lose their <hi>Reputation,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too eager in their Endeavours to preserve it.
This foolish Deportment, is ordinary with
those, who being suspected of any ill thing, make
use of long passionate Speeches for their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
for tho' they may be guiltless, yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Words they run into, cannot but make
us think the contrary.</p>
               <p>XII. There is no Passion which makes Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
more unhappy than this, which almost all
Men entertain for a general Esteem and <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:97015:92"/>
for excepting some Persons of truly
Heroical Minds, who act only for the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Conscience, and perhaps too for
the approbation of good Men, all the rest do
that for Noise, which ought to be done for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and suffer themselves to be inchanted with
the Shadow and Appearance of a Thing, whose
real Body does not so much as affect them.</p>
               <p>XIII. Industry holds the Plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the greatest
Merit, and the Art of making himself esteem'd,

               <p>XIV. * No Man can be said to be truly Great,
that depends for his <hi>Reputation</hi> upon the Opinion
of the <hi>Multitude.</hi>

               <head>Self-Love.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>SElf-Love,</hi> is the love of one's self, and of
every thing else for one's self: It makes
Men Idolaters of themselves, and would make
them Tyrants over others, if they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with <hi>Fortune</hi> to get the Power and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.
It never rests out of it self, and never
dwells upon other Subjects, but, as Bees do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Flowers, to suck out what it thinks may be
for its advantage. Nothing is so violent as its
Desires; nothing so secret as its Intrigues; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so quick and ingenious as its Managements.
Its Pliantness is past description; its Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
exceed the Poetical <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> and
its Niceties the refining of Chymistry. One can
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97015:93"/>
neither fathom its depth, nor pierce through
the Darkness of its Abyss. Here it is quite out of
the view of the most penetrating and sagacious
Eyes; here it turns to and fro in a thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
Shapes; here it is oftentimes invisible to
it self; here it hatches and breeds several Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Hatreds unknown to it self; and some
of these are so strange and monstrous, that
when they come to the Birth, either it does not
know them, or is asham'd to own them. From
this gross <hi>Mist,</hi> with which it is over-cast, spring
the ridiculous Opinions it has of it self; hence
procced all its Errours, Mistakes, and Fopperies
concerning it self; hence it is, that it thinks its
Inclinations to be quite dead, when they are
but lull'd asleep; that it fancies to have done
running, when it does but rest; and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
to have lost its Appetite, when it has only
fill'd its Stomach for the present. And yet this
thick and gloomy Darkness, which hinders it
from seeing it self, is no obstruction to its sight
of any thing else; (in which it is like our Eyes,
which perceive all, and yet are blind only with
regard to themselves;) for in its greatest <hi>Concerns,</hi>
where the violence of its Desires summon all its
Attention, it sees, feels, and hears; it imagines,
suspects, penetrates, and guesses every thing,
even to that degree, that a Man is apt to think
that each of its Passions has a kind of <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi>
particular to it. Nothing is so strong and
close as its Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, which it strives in vain to break

nevertheless, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and without Pains, what it could never accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97015:93"/>
with the most powerful and continu'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of many Years. From whence we
may likely conclude, That its Desires are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by its self, rather than by the <hi>Worth</hi> or
<hi>Beauty</hi> of its Objects; and that its own Palate
gives them both the Value that makes them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and the Gloss that sets them off: So that
it follows its own self, when it seems to pursue
any thing else. <hi>Self-love</hi> is all made up of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries;
it is Imperious and Dutiful, High-flown
and Humble, Sincere and Counterfeit, Merciful
and Cruel, Timorous and Bold. It has different
Inclinations, after the diversity of Tempers,
which turn and devote it sometimes to Riches,
sometimes to Glory, sometimes to Pleasure; it
alters them according to the variety of our
Age, Fortune, and Experience: It never mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whether it has many, or but one, because
it divides it self to many, or gathers and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
it self to one, when either its Interest or
Fancy requires it. It is unsteady; and besides
the Alterations it receives from external Things,
there are a thousand that spring from it self.
It is inconstant by Fickleness, by Love, by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
and by Nauseating and Dislike. It is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious
and humoursome: Sometimes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Hardships it snatches at Things, not
only unprofitable, but even hurtful and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
which it hankers after only because it has a
mind to it. It is unaccountable and fantastical;
it often busies it self about the most vain and
frivolous Employments; it delights in the most
insipid Things, and keeps its <hi>Loftiness</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi>
in the vilest <hi>Drudgery.</hi> It is in all states of Life,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97015:94"/>
as in all sorts of Conditions; it lives every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
it lives upon every thing, sometimes
upon nothing. It is contented with the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Things, and the Want of them. It
sides with its Foes, follows their Designs, and,
which is wonderful, it hates it self, hatches its
own Rnin, and pushes on its Overthrow. To
sum up all, All its care is to subsist; provided
it be, it is content to be its own Enemy. We
ought not therefore to think it strange, to see it
associate with the roughest Ansterity and hardest
Mortification, and side with them to destroy it
self; for it is no sooner cast down in one place,
but it rises up again in another. When it seems
to forsake its Pleasure, it does but suspend or
alter it; nay, when it is so conquer'd, that
Men would believe themselves to be rid of it,
it springs up again, and triumphs in its Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
This is the true Picture of <hi>Self-love,</hi> of
which the whole Life is but a strong and long
Agitation. The <hi>Sea</hi> is a sensible and lively Image
of it; for you may find in the continual <hi>Ebbs</hi>
and <hi>Flows</hi> of its Waves, a faithful Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the boisterous and turbulent Succession
of <hi>Self-love</hi>'s everlasting and endless Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Self-love</hi> is the greatest <hi>Flatterer</hi> in the
World.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Self-love</hi> bears less patiently the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of our <hi>Tastes</hi> or (<hi>Inclinations</hi>) than of our
<hi>Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. The <hi>Fondness</hi> or <hi>Indifference</hi> that <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers</hi>
express'd for Life, was but a particular
<hi>Tang</hi> of the <hi>Love</hi> of themselves, for which there
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97015:94"/>
is no more reason to be given, than for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of <hi>Palates,</hi> or the choice of Colours in
some People.</p>
               <p>V. The first motion of Joy that we resent at
the <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Preferment</hi> of our <hi>Friends,</hi> does
seldom proceed either from our <hi>Good-nature,</hi> or
the <hi>Kindness</hi> we have for them, but generally
from <hi>Self-love,</hi> which flatters us that our Turn
of being happy is coming, or that we shall
reap some <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nefit</hi> from their <hi>Prosperity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. As if the Power of transforming it
self were small, <hi>Self-love</hi> does frequently
transform its Objects too, and that after a
most wonderful manner; for it not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises
them so artificially, as to deceive it self,
but it perfectly alters the Nature and Condition
of the Things themselves. Thus when any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
acts in opposition to us, when he crosses and
persecutes us, <hi>Self-love</hi> passes Sentence upon his
Actions, with the utmost strictness and severity
of <hi>Iustice;</hi> it aggravates all his Imperfections
so, as to make them look monstrous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible;
and sets his <hi>Good Qualities</hi> in so ill a
Light, as to make them appear more disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and nauseous than his very <hi>Failings.</hi> And
yet as soon as the same Person ceases to be our
Enemy, or that any of our Interests brings him
to Reconciliation and Favour, the Satisfaction
we receive, presently restores his Merit, and
allows it that <hi>Lustre,</hi> our Aversion so lately
robb'd it of. His <hi>Ill Qualities</hi> vanish out of
sight, and his Perfections appear in a greater
Splendour; nay, we summon all our Indulgence
to excuse and justifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Quarrel he formerly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97015:95"/>
had against us. Tho' this Truth be evidenc'd
by every <hi>Passion,</hi> yet none demonstrates it so
sensibly as <hi>Love:</hi> For we see a <hi>Lover</hi> full of
Rage and Despair, at the Neglect or Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his <hi>Fondling,</hi> contrive and meditate for
his Revenge, whatever his violent Passions sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
him. Nevertheless, no sooner has a <hi>kind
Smile</hi> of his <hi>Darling</hi> calmed his boisterous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
but his Joy and Rapture pronounces
this <hi>Beauty</hi> innocent; he accuses himself alone,
and condemns nothing but his own Condemning
her before; and by this miraculous Power of
<hi>Self-love,</hi> he takes away the Blemish and Odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his <hi>Mistress</hi>'s Proceedings, he clears her
of the Crime, and lays it upon himself.</p>
               <p>VII. The <hi>love of our selves</hi> makes our Friends
appear more or less deserving, in proportion to
the delight we take in them; and the Estimate
we make of their Worth, depends upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their conversing with us.</p>
               <p>VIII. One would think, that <hi>Self-love</hi> were
over-reach'd by <hi>Good-nature</hi> and <hi>Liberality;</hi> and
that a Man forgets himself, when he promotes
the Advantages of others: Nevertheless, this is
the most effectual way to gain our ends; 'tis
lending on Usury, under the pretence of giving
freely. In a word, 'tis a nice and dexterous
Way of winning over the Affections of every
body.</p>
               <p>IX. There is no <hi>Passion</hi> wherein <hi>Self-love</hi> is so
predominant, as in that of <hi>Love:</hi> And Men are
always more disposed to sacrifice all the Ease of
them they love, than to part with their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:97015:95"/>
X. We feel and resent both our <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>ill Fortune,</hi> in proportion to our <hi>Self-love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Self-love</hi> makes more Men <hi>Cruel,</hi> than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Sternness and a rough Temper.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Self-love</hi> is often cheated by its own self;
for when it considers its own <hi>Interests,</hi> it so whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overlooks the <hi>Interests</hi> of others, as thereby to
lose all the Advantage that might be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> made
by the exchange of Kindnesses and good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>XIII. A Man is but little the better for liking
himself, when no body else likes him; for an
immoderate <hi>Love</hi> of one's self, is very often
chastifed by Contempt from others.</p>
               <p>XIV. <hi>Self-love,</hi> according as it is rightly or
otherwise understood and apply'd, is the Cause
of all the Moral <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> in the
World.</p>
               <p>XV. That <hi>Prudence</hi> which is made use of in
the good Management of Men's Affairs, is only
a wise and quick-sighted <hi>Self-love,</hi> whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is Inconsideration and Blindness.</p>
               <p>XVI. Tho' according to that Position, we
may rightly conclude, That Men in all their
Actions, keep still an eye to their own <hi>Interest;</hi>
yet does it not follow, that there is no such thing
left in the World, as <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Honesty.</hi> Men
may govern themselves by commendable and
honest Interests; and 'tis the just Discretion of
a well-regulated <hi>Self-love,</hi> that makes a <hi>Good</hi> or
an <hi>Honest Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. The <hi>Love</hi> of our selves inclines us to
look upon all the <hi>Pleasures</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of Life
as things that we have a right to call ours; and

<hi>Dissimulation,</hi> to insinuate our selves into the

when to turn; and at such times, when they
thought the Case indeed requir'd <hi>Dissimulation,</hi>

the Character of your <hi>Half-witted</hi> Fellows, to
speak much, and say little.</p>

               <p>II. A good <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>Relish</hi> of Things, is
more the effect of <hi>Iudgment</hi> than <hi>Wit.</hi>

               <head>Truth.</head>
               <p>I. MOst Men do not speak <hi>Truth</hi> out of an
Aversion to <hi>Lyes;</hi> but generally out of
a secret Ambition of making what they say
considerable, and their Words respected as
<hi>Oracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. There is a disguis'd <hi>Falsuy,</hi> which is so
lively a Representation of <hi>Truth,</hi> that we should
injure our Judgments, not to submit to the
Cheat.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Errours</hi> sometimes have as long a run as
the greatest <hi>Truths;</hi> because being once receiv'd
for <hi>Truth,</hi> Men admit whatever makes for them,
with an implicit Consent, and reject or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
all that is capable of undeceiving them.</p>
               <p>IV. The Conversation of Men that are Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
and Dogmatical, is the most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
thing in the World. The best Temper
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97015:98"/>
is always to be ready to submit to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and
receive it, let it come which way it will.</p>
               <p>V. * <hi>Truth</hi> is the great Lesson of Reasonable
Nature, both in Philosophy and Religion; but
now-a-days Fallacies of Words, Equivocations,
Mental Reservations, and Double-Meanings, in
a word, the Knack of <hi>Fast</hi> and <hi>Loose,</hi> pass with
a world of foolish People for Turns of Wit:
but they are not aware all this while, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Consequences of an Ill habit; and that
the Practice of Falsifying with Men, will lead
us on insensibly to a Double-dealing with
GOD Himself.</p>
               <p>VI. * <hi>Truth</hi> (as to the Knowledge of our
own Nature) may perhaps come to the Price
of a Pearl, that shews best by Day; but it will
not rise to the Price of a Diamond, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle,
that shews best in varied Lights. A
mixture of a <hi>Lye</hi> does ever add Pleasure. Does
any Man doubt, that if there were taken out of
Men's Minds, vain Opinions, flattering Hopes,
false Valuations, and ill-grounded Conceits,
but it would leave the Minds of most Men
poor shrunken things, full of Melancholy and
Indisposition, and unpleasing to themselves?
But to pass from Philosophical <hi>Truth,</hi> to the
<hi>Truth</hi> of Civil Business, it will be acknowledg'd
even by those that practice it not, that clear and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound Dealing is the Honour of Man's Nature;
and that mixture of <hi>Falshood,</hi> is like Allay in
Coin of Gold and Silver, which may make
the Metal work the better, but it embases it.
There is no Vice that does so cover a Man with
Shame, as to be found false and perfidious:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97015:99"/>
And therefore the Word <hi>Lye,</hi> is such a Disgrace,
and too odious a Charge, because, to say that
a Man Lyes, is as much as to say, that he is
brave toward God, and a Coward toward Men;
for a <hi>Lye</hi> faces God, and shrinks from Man.</p>

with saying but little.</p>
               <p>II. The Pomp and Solemnity of <hi>Funerals,</hi> is
not so much to do Honour to the <hi>Dead,</hi> as to
gratifie the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the <hi>Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. If <hi>Vanity</hi> does not quite over-turn
<hi>Virtue,</hi> yet it gives it terrible Shocks, and keeps
it in a tottering Condition.</p>
               <p>IV. We cannot bear with other People's
<hi>Vanity,</hi> because it is offensive to our own.</p>
               <p>V. The strongest Passions sometimes remit of
their Violence; but <hi>Vanity</hi> tosses and hurries
Men continually.</p>
               <p>VI. The generality of Men speak ill of

               <p>VII. <hi>Vanity</hi> prevails with us to deny our selves,
more than Reason can do.</p>
               <p>VIII. We are all of us desirous to live in the
Opinion of others, by a fantastical sort of <hi>Life.</hi>
If we are Generous, Honest, Temperate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
we presently endeavour to acquaint others with
it, to join those <hi>Virtues</hi> to that external and
imaginary Being of ours; we would sooner part

               <p>IX. We do sometimes, out of <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi>

               <p>X <hi>Vanity</hi> makes a Man find his Pleasure and
Satisfaction, in speaking either well or ill of
himself: A modest Man never speaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>XI. Nothing so much betrays how ridiculous
and shameful a Vice <hi>Vanity</hi> is, as its not daring
to shew its self but under the appearance of its
Contrary.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Vanity,</hi> and the good Opinion we have
of our selves, make us often think that other
People are proud and slight us, when there is
no such thing. A modest Person is never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with those Niceties.</p>

               </p>
               <p>II. What we take for <hi>Virtue,</hi> is frequently
nothing else but the Concurrence of several Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Interests, gather'd and brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
either by <hi>Fortune,</hi> or our own <hi>Industry.</hi> It
is not always from a Principle of Valour that Men

are <hi>Stout,</hi> or from a Principle of Modesty that
Women are <hi>Chast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Some <hi>Vices</hi> are mingled with <hi>Virtue,</hi> just
as poisonous Ingredients are put sometimes into

tempers them together, and makes excellent use
of them against the Misfortunes that attend <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. We generally run <hi>Vice</hi> down, and cry up
<hi>Virtue,</hi> according to our <hi>Interests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. <hi>Nature</hi> seems at each Man's Birth to have
mark'd out the Bounds of his <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. <hi>Vices</hi> may be said to take us one after
another, in the course of our Lives, just as <hi>Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,</hi>
where we lodge upon a Journey, do.
And I question whether the Experience of having
been ill us'd, would prevail with us to change
our House, if we could travel the same Road over
again.</p>
               <p>VII. When <hi>Vices</hi> leave us, we flatter our
selves that we leave them.</p>
               <p>VIII. There are Relapses in the Distempers of
the <hi>Soul,</hi> as well as in the Diseases of the <hi>Body;</hi>
and we often take that for a full Recovery,
which is only a Relaxation, or an Alteration of
the Fit.</p>
               <p>IX. The multiplicity of <hi>Vices,</hi> keep often
a Man from giving himself over entirely to
one.</p>
               <p>X. Some Persons are so extreamly Trifling
and inconsiderable, that they are as far from
real <hi>Faults,</hi> as they are from substantial <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>

XI. <hi>Virtue</hi> would seldom make such Advances,
did not <hi>Vanity</hi> bear it company.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> is a sort of <hi>Homage,</hi> which

               </p>
               <p>XIII. There is no better Proof a Man's being
truly <hi>Good,</hi> than his desiring to be constantly
under the Observation of good Men.</p>
               <p>XIV. Tho' Men be never so <hi>wicked,</hi> yet they
have not the Confidence to profess themselves
Enemies to <hi>Virtue,</hi> and when they persecute it,
they either pretend not to think it real, or forge
some Faults to lay them to its charge.</p>
               <p>XV. Some <hi>Good Qualities</hi> degenerate into
<hi>Vices,</hi> when <hi>natural;</hi> and others again are never
perfect, when acquir'd; as for instance: A
Man should learn <hi>Good-Husbandry</hi> in his <hi>Estate,</hi>
and his <hi>Confidences</hi> from <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Experience;</hi>
and, on the other side, <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Good-Nature</hi>
must be innate with us, or else we can never have
them in any good degree.</p>
               <p>XVI. Our <hi>Qualities</hi> are doubtful and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and apt to be either Good or Evil, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Circumstances.</p>
               <p>XVII. When great Men think to impose upon
the World by the shew of <hi>Virtue,</hi> it is of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to work them out of their Conceit; for
by that means, we take away that pique of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which prompts them to do those good
Actions, that are agreeable to the <hi>Virtues</hi> they
pretend to.</p>

the most troublesome to themselves and others.</p>
               <p>XXI. A Man in much Business, does generally

makes him a Fool.</p>
               <p>XXII. It is with our <hi>Manners,</hi> as with our

               <p>XXVIII. The Bonds of <hi>Virtue</hi> ought to be
closer and nearer, than those of <hi>Blood:</hi> For a
good Man is more of kin to another, by the
Conformity of Manners and Conversation, than
a <hi>Son</hi> is to his <hi>Father</hi> by the Resemblance of

               </p>
               <p>XXIX. There is nothing in the <hi>World</hi> but

Happiness of a discerning <hi>Palate,</hi> to find out
each Thing's particular Excellence: But our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Malice makes us often discover a <hi>Vice,</hi>
among many <hi>Virtues,</hi> that so we may reveal and

this is not so much an Argument of nice Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as of an ill Nature; and that Man has

               <p>XXXI. Men of low Degree are often

<hi>Qualifications,</hi> which they have not the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
and Means to exert.</p>
               <p>XXXII. Considering how much Men are

Set-off, than that of her <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Youth,</hi> and
the native Grace that sparkles in her Face, and
animates all her Motions: Nay, we could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her with less concern, with all the Train of
a modish Dress. It is the same with a <hi>Good
Man;</hi> he challenges Respect and Honour by his
own self independently, upon all the Forms and
Shews of an affected Gravity. A reformed
Countenance, an over-strained Modesty, a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious
Brow, a singular Dress, do not so
much set off, as paint <hi>Virtue,</hi> and make it pass
for Counterfeit.</p>
               <p>XXXIV. <hi>Virtue</hi> loses nothing, no more than
<hi>Nature:</hi> The Seeds of Goodness circulate eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
and pass without intermission from one
subject to another; and the Principles which
contribute to the Production of the Wise, no

a Just and Honourable War is the true <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise;</hi>

               <p>II. * A Peace that puts People out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

a War; and such a State as leaves them
at the Mercy of an Enemy, is worse than War

Christian Religion bids us forgive, but
Christian Prudence bids us have a care too whom

that cannot be mended.</p>
               <p>V. Nothing is more scarce than true <hi>Goodness</hi>
and <hi>Humanity;</hi> and those that value themselves
upon their <hi>Good-nature,</hi> are generally no better
than either <hi>Weak</hi> or <hi>Complaisant.</hi>

as it is easie to be so in another's.</p>
               <p>II. Most Men are <hi>wise</hi> in the <hi>Accessories,</hi> and
<hi>Fools</hi> in the <hi>Main.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The nicest <hi>Folly</hi> proceeds from the nicest
<hi>Wisdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Folly</hi> keeps us company through all the
course of our Lives; and if any Man seem to be
<hi>wise,</hi> it is only because his <hi>Folly</hi> is suited to his
Age and Fortune.</p>
               <p>V. 'Tis a kind of <hi>Folly</hi> to be <hi>wise</hi> by one's
self.</p>
               <p>VI. Some <hi>Follies</hi> are as catching as any <hi>infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Disease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Some Remedies may be found to cure a
Man of his <hi>Folly;</hi> but a perverse irrational Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
can never be reform'd.</p>
               <p>VIII. <hi>Briskness</hi> that encreases with Age, is but
one degree remov'd from <hi>Folly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. There is no Miscarriage so unlucky, but
what may be beneficial, one way or other, to a
<hi>wise</hi> Man; nor any Accident so fortunate, but
what a <hi>Fool</hi> may turn to his own Prejudice.</p>
               <p>X. There are Men cut out for <hi>Fools,</hi> that do
not only make their <hi>Follies</hi> their Choice, but are
forc'd into them by <hi>Fortune,</hi> whether they will
or no.</p>
               <p>XI. There are Mischances from which <hi>Fools</hi>

XII. If the <hi>Folly</hi> of some People did never
appear, 'tis because it was never nicely look'd
into.</p>
               <p>XIII. Old <hi>Fools</hi> are always more ridiculous
than young ones.</p>
               <p>XIV. VVe should make the <hi>Follies</hi> of others,
rather a VVarning and Instruction, than a subject
of <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Mockery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. There is a grave composed sort of <hi>Folly,</hi>
highly satisfied with it self, that carries an Air
of <hi>Wisdom</hi> a thousand times more troublesome
and impertinent, than that humoursome and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<hi>Folly,</hi> which never thinks at all.</p>
               <p>XVI. A Man's greatest <hi>Wisdom</hi> is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his own <hi>Follies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVII. There is no such thing as true <hi>Wisdom</hi>
in this <hi>World,</hi> except that which instructs us in
<hi>Christian Morality;</hi> for this, if we abstract from
all the Supports of <hi>Faith,</hi> and Advantages of
<hi>Religion,</hi> is of it self the most pure and perfect
Rule of Life.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The desire of being thought a <hi>wise</hi>
Man, oftentimes hinders <hi>Man</hi> to become really
such.</p>
               <p>XXIX. There are a sort of silly <hi>Coxcombs,</hi>
who knowing themselves to be such, improve to
their own Advantage their Simplicity and Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
               <p>XXX. The heighth of <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> is to
know the true <hi>Worth</hi> of every thing.</p>
               <p>XXXI. 'Tis a great <hi>Wisdom</hi> to be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,
upon occasion, one's being <hi>wise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXI. 'Tis a degree of <hi>Wisdom</hi> in a mean <hi>Wit,</hi>
to follow the Judgment and Conduct of others.</p>

XXXII. <hi>Wisdom</hi> has its excess as well as other
things, and for the most part a Man makes ill
use of his <hi>Reason</hi> with those who have none.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. The state of <hi>Virtue</hi> is not a state of
<hi>Indolence;</hi> we suffer in it a perpetual Conflict,
betwixt Duty and Inclination: But that of
<hi>Wisdom</hi> is sweet and calm; it reigns peaceably

VI. <hi>Chastity</hi> in most <hi>Women</hi> is but the Love of
their own Quiet, and a Tenderness of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>Vanity, Shame,</hi> and especially a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et Humour</hi> is the very Nature and
Property of <hi>Women.</hi> And if some do not practise
it, 'tis because they are restrained either by Fear
or better Sense.</p>
               <p>IX. There can be no such thing as <hi>Rules</hi> in the
<hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Women,</hi> if their Constitution be
not consenting.</p>
               <p>X. The Affliction of <hi>Women</hi> upon dead Lovers,
proceeds not so much from the Love they had
for them, as from a Desire to get others by a Shew
of Tenderness and Humanity.</p>
               <p>XI. There are but few <hi>Honest Women</hi> but what
are weary of their Trade.</p>
               <p>XII. The Generality of <hi>honest Women</hi> are like
hidden <hi>Treasures,</hi> which are safe only because no
body seeks after them.</p>
               <p>XIII. Most <hi>Women</hi> yield rather out of <hi>Weakness</hi>
than <hi>Love;</hi> and this is the reason, that a bold
daring Fellow sooner gains their Favour than a
fainthearted, though more accomplisht Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor.</p>
               <p>XIV. A <hi>Ladies</hi> first Intrigue is seldom taken
notice of before she has a second.</p>
               <p>XV. There are some <hi>Women</hi> that never had an
Intrigue, but there is scarce any that never had
but one.</p>
               <p>XVI. A <hi>Woman</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> will sooner forgive a

XVII. <hi>Women</hi> are seldom acquainted with all
their <hi>Cocquet Humours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. <hi>Women</hi> are never absolutely reserv'd,
except where they have an Aversion.</p>
               <p>XIX. <hi>Women</hi> can more easily conquer their <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
than their <hi>Cocquet Humour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XX. It is one Kind of <hi>Cocquet Humour</hi> to put
People always upon observing, that we are not
<hi>Cocquetish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXI. <hi>Youth</hi> without <hi>Beauty</hi> in a <hi>Woman</hi> signifies
as little as <hi>Beauty</hi> without <hi>Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXII. <hi>Women</hi> often think to be in <hi>Love</hi> when
there is no such thing. The Diversion of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue,</hi>
the Commotions that an <hi>Amour</hi> raises in
their Breasts, the natural Inclination to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of being courted, and the Trouble of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
makes them fancy that what they feel is
Passion, when in truth it is nothing but a <hi>Cocquet
Humour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIII. A <hi>Womans</hi> Resentment against a Man
that brags of her <hi>Favours,</hi> is not so much an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of her <hi>Virtue,</hi> as her Inclination to be
kind to one that could <hi>keep Counsel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. <hi>Women</hi> are pleas'd with Courtship,
and the most disdainful cannot but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant
to those that tell them they are <hi>handsom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXV. Nothing is so unaccountable as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices
of <hi>Women:</hi> For it frequently happens that
the first Applications of a new Face, gain more
upon them than the long Services of a constant
old one.</p>
               <p>XXVI. There is no <hi>Court</hi> but where <hi>Women</hi>
have Credit and Interests; no <hi>State Intrigues</hi> but
they have a hand in them.</p>

XXVII. <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> do seldom agree upon
the Estimate of the Merit of a <hi>Woman;</hi> their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
are too opposite.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. <hi>Women</hi> displease one another by
the same Agreements that charm Men, and
what excites great Passions in these, raises
amongst them Aversion and Antipathy.</p>
               <p>XXIX. If <hi>Women</hi> expect their <hi>Lovers,</hi> they set
out themselves to receive them, but if they be
surprized with their Visits, they presently forget
at their Arrival the Irregularity of their Dress,
and busie their Fancy about something else. But
with Persons that are indifferent, they have time
enough to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lect on the Disorder of their <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gè,</hi>
and either dress themselves before them,
or disappear for a Moment, and come in again
with all their Attire.</p>
               <p>XXX. <hi>Caprice</hi> in Women is generally conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
to <hi>Beauty,</hi> to be, as it were, its Antidote
to prevent the further mischief it would do the
Men.</p>
               <p>XXXI. <hi>Women</hi> engage themselves to the <hi>Men</hi>
by Favours they grant them; <hi>Men,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
disengage themselves from <hi>Women</hi> by the
Favours they receive.</p>
               <p>XXXII. When <hi>Women</hi> cease to Iove their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
they forget even the Favours they have
granted them.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. A <hi>Woman</hi> that has but one Gallant
thinks herself to be no <hi>Cocquet;</hi> she that has seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
concludes her self no more than a <hi>Cocquet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXIV. Many a <hi>Woman</hi> prevents being
thought a <hi>Cocquet</hi> by her Constancy to one, that
passes for a Fool for her ill Choice.</p>

XXXV. There are very few Intrigues that are
kept secret, and a great many <hi>Ladies</hi> are as well
known by their Gallants as by their Husbands.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. The Difference betwixt an <hi>Amorous
Lady</hi> and a <hi>Cocquet</hi> is, that the first is for being lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the other only for passing for handsome
and lovely. The one has a Mind to ingage us,
and the other only to please us; the intriguing
<hi>Woman</hi> passes from one Ingagement to another
sucessively; the <hi>Cocquet</hi> has several <hi>Amusements</hi>
at once; Passion and Pleasure are predominant in
the first, Vanity and Levity in the last. <hi>Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
is a Weakness of the Heart, or perhaps a Vice
of Constitution: A <hi>Cocquet Humour</hi> is an Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
or Debauchery of the Mind. To conclude,
an <hi>Amorous Woman</hi> makes her self to be feared,
and a <hi>Cocquet</hi> to be hated. From these two Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
we may frame a third, the worst of them
all.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. A <hi>weak Woman</hi> is she whom we
tell of her Faults, who reproaches her self
with them; whose Inclination is in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Conflict with her Reason; who desires to
mend, who shall never mend, at least but very
late.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. A <hi>Woman</hi> is <hi>inconstant</hi> when she ceases
to love; <hi>fickle</hi> when she begins to love; <hi>light</hi>
when she does not know her self whether she loves
or no; <hi>indifferent</hi> when she loves nothing.</p>
               <p>XXXIX. A great many <hi>Ladies</hi> conceal their
<hi>Amours</hi> under a great deal of Reserve and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
that get often no more by their continued Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
than to make other People say at last,
<hi>Lord, I took her for a Saint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:97015:109"/>
XL. There are <hi>Women</hi> that love their <hi>Money</hi>
better than their <hi>Friends;</hi> and their <hi>Lovers</hi> better
than their <hi>Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XLI. 'Tis strange to find in some <hi>Womens</hi> Heart
something more quick and strong than the Love
of Men. I mean <hi>Ambition,</hi> and the Passion of
<hi>Gaming.</hi> Such <hi>Women</hi> make Men chast, they
have nothing of their Sex but the <hi>Petticoat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XLII. <hi>Women</hi> run into Extreams, and are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
either better or worse than <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XLIII. There is no such thing as <hi>Principles</hi>
in <hi>Women;</hi> they conduct themselves by the Heart,
and depend for their Manners, upon those they
love.</p>
               <p>XLIV. <hi>Women</hi> go further in <hi>Love</hi> than <hi>Men,</hi>
but <hi>Men</hi> outstrip them in <hi>Friendship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XLV. 'Tis the <hi>Mens</hi> Fault that <hi>Women</hi> hate
one another.</p>
               <p>XXVI. A <hi>Man</hi> is more reserved and secret in
his Friends Concern than his own; a <hi>Woman</hi> on
the contrary keeps her own Secret better than
anothers.</p>
               <p>XLVII. There is never so strong a <hi>Love</hi> in a
young <hi>Ladie</hi>'s Breast, but what may receive
some Addition either from Ambition or Interest.</p>
               <p>XLVIII. How many Maids are there in the
World that never reaped any other Advantage
from a great <hi>Beauty</hi> than the Hopes of having a
great Match.</p>
               <p>XLVIII. There is a Time where <hi>Maids,</hi> even
those that have the most considerable Fortunes,
ought seriously to think of bestowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
least their Refusal of the first Proffers, be
attended with a long and bitter Repentance.

The Reputation of their <hi>Riches</hi> does generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

make her worthy of their Applications and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
               <p>XLIX. Handsome <hi>Ladies</hi> do generally Justice
upon themselves for the ill Treatments they
have done to some of their <hi>Lovers,</hi> by marrying
either ugly, old, or at least undeserving <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>L. Most <hi>Women</hi> judge of the <hi>Merit</hi> and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
<hi>Accomplishments</hi> of Men, by the Impression
they make upon them, and will scarce allow any
to that Man, whom they can see without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p>LI. When a Man is at a loss to know whether
Age has made any considerable Alteration in
his Person, he may consult the Eyes and
Tone of the Voice of those young <hi>Women</hi> he
accosts; he will soon learn what he is afraid
to know: But this is a hard way of learning.</p>
               <p>LII. A <hi>Woman</hi> that is always casting her Eyes
upon the same Man, or that takes them away
continually from him, gives us an equal Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of what she feels.</p>
               <p>LIII. It is easie for a <hi>Woman</hi> to say what
she does not feel, but it is yet more easie for
a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man to say what he does.</p>
               <p>LIV. It happens sometimes that while the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
dissembles a true Passion, the <hi>Man</hi> dissembles
a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alse one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:97015:110"/>
LV. A <hi>Man</hi> may easily impose upon a <hi>Woman</hi>
by a pretended Passion, provided he have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
one for another.</p>
               <p>LVI. Suppose a Man that is indifferent
for all <hi>Women</hi> have a Mind to pretend a
Passion, the Question is, Whether he will
sooner impose upon that <hi>Woman</hi> that has
a Kindness for him, than her that has none?</p>
               <p>LVII. The greatest Concern of a <hi>Woman</hi>
in Love, is not to perswade her own Passion,
as to be satisfied of that of the Person she loves.</p>
               <p>LVIII. <hi>Women</hi> are cured of their Natural <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness</hi>
either by <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LIX. <hi>Laziness,</hi> on the contrary, in <hi>Women</hi>
naturally brisk and aiery, is the Forerunner of
<hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LX. A Man breaks out into a Passion
against an unfaithful <hi>Mistris,</hi> and then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
her; a <hi>Woman,</hi> on the contrary, makes
but little Noise at the Infidelity of her
<hi>Lover,</hi> but keeps a long while her Resentments.</p>
