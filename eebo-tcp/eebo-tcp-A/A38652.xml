            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE two Houses of Parliament have received Information, that, because the Committee at <hi>Shrewesbury</hi> caused Thirteen <hi>Irish Rebels,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Hostility against the Parliament, to suffer Death, according to an Ordinance of Parliament herewith sent, Therefore by your expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Thirteene <hi>English</hi> Protestants who had Quarter given them by your Officers that took them Prisoners, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing murthered upon coole bloud, and that you have resolved to proceed in the same manner for the future. A Relation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution so strange, that the truth thereof might justly be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were it not verified by letters from that Committe of the <hi>24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>March</hi> last, to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and by a Letter of the 23. of <hi>March,</hi> sent to the same Committee by your direction, and subscribed by one <hi>Ralph Goodwin</hi> your Secretary, (as is informed) which doth own &amp; avow the Fact. And therefore the two Houses of Parliament, being deeply affected with such cruell Massacres committed upon their Protestant Brethren, whose Lives they value as their owne, have commanded me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Highnesse, that it is evident by undoubted Proofe, that the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> (what ever they pretended to some on this side the Sea) did really intend by that odious Rebellion, to wrest that Kingdom for ever, from the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> to the utter disherison of the King &amp; His Posterity; And to extirpate the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Nation and Protestant Religion, and for that purpose have sollicited by their Agents, the bringing over of Powerfull Aydes from Forraigne Parts, to assist them in this their intended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; And have set vp the Spanish Colours publiquely, both at <hi>Wexford,</hi> and <hi>Gallway;</hi> Have caused their Captaines, Officers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98707:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and others, to make Oath before their Titular Clergy, That they shall not suffer any <hi>English,</hi> or Protestant, to live in that Kingdom. That they prosecuted this horrid designe, by murthering, hanging,<note place="margin">*</note> drowning, burning * alive, and starving within few Months, in one Province, one hundred fifty four Thousand of harmles Brittish Protestants, Men, Women, and Children, without distinction of Age or Sexe, without any provocation given, but living securely by them in a full and setled Peace. That the King first by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation attested by His own Royall Signature, and Privy Seale, hath Procl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed them Traytors and Rebels; and since that time, both King and Parliament, by foure severall Acts of Parliament, have declared and stiled them in the same manner; And further His Majesty by Act of Parliament, hath consented, That all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons granted to them or any of them, before Attaindor, shall be voyd. Now that such bloody, barbanous Miscreants, so odious both to God and men, so obnoxious to Law and Iustice, (even by the Judgment of both sides) comming out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (where they neither did give nor receive Quarter) to burne and lay wast this Kingdom, as they have done that, should after all this, be admitted to receive Quarter here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently be made equall in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and Protestants; The Lords and Commons of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> cannot with Religion, Honour, or Justice, in any sort consent unto it. And have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to let your Highnesse, and all other Commanders on that side know, That if hereafter, upon executing the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, in pursuance of that just Ordinance, any unjust Pretext shall be made, to murther in coole blood any Officer, Souldier, or Seaman, in the service of the Parliament; That the two Houses have resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and do hereby declare, that for every Officer, Souldier, and Seaman so causelesly massacred, they shall and must (though with deep sorrow and reluctancy) cause so many of the Prisoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in their Power, to be put to Death in the same manner. And therefore do earnestly desire your Highnesse, and all other your inferiour Commanders, to forbeare by such prodigious Cruelty to embase the value of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, which they are confident will be resented with indignation, even by those <hi>English</hi> Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who are for the present, deceived into Armes against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

Religion, and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> To whom they shall be ready to allow Quarter, and equall exchange as before, and for whom they daily pray, That Almighty God would open their eyes, and reduce them into the right way.

            </opener>
            <p>I Received your Lordships Letter, of the fourth of this Moneth, on the eleventh; and cannot but wonder that it should seem strange to the two Houses, that I should cause those Prisoners, which were taken in Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst His Majesty, to be used in the same manner, and by the same measure, as His Majesties good Subjects, taken Prisoners in the act of their duty, are used by those that take them. Those Souldiers of mine that were barbarously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in cold bloud, after Quarter given to them at <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> were those, who, during the time they were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> served His Majesty stoutly, constantly and faithfully against the Rebels of that Kingdome, and after the Cessation, they were by His Majesties Command transported to serve Him in this, where they honestly performed the duty of Souldiers; and therefore I were unworthy of the Command I hold under His Majesty, if upon so high a provocation, and so unheard of an act of injustice, as the putting those poore honest men to death, I had not let the Authors of that Massacre know, that their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98707:4"/>
owne men must pay the price of such acts of Inhumanity, and be used as they use their Brethren: and therefore I caused the like number (to whom Quarter was no otherwise given, then to the former) to be put to death in the same manner as had been done at <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> How the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and with what circumstances of Bloud and cruelty it hath been carryed on, (the odiousnesse whereof, and of all other Rebellions is apparent, and all good men must abhorre,) is not applicable to this Argument, (I wish the temper of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had been, or yet were such as might be applyed to the composure of that;) your Lordship hath in that Army many Souldiers, who served His Majesty in that Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet to those Souldiers when taken Prisoners, Quarter is given, and observed on this side, the like must be expected from you: And if it should be otherwise, and that Quarter should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to all those who have been proclaimed Traytors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, or who by Act of Parliament are such, this Warre will be much more mercilesse and bloudy then it hath been, or then any good man, or true English-man can desire to see it; I am sure such rigour shall be prevented by all the Interest and Power I have. Neither can that threat &amp; menace in your Lordship's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the resolution to use such Prisoners as shall be taken of His Majesties Army for the future, make any other impression in me, then of griefe and sadnesse of heart, to see so much injustice and inhumanity, a proceeding contrary to the Lawes of Nature and Nations, contrary to the rules and customes of Warre in any part of the Christian World, so deliberately and solemnely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, declared, and published. If there should be an Ordinance made, that there should be no Quarter given to any Souldiers under my Command, and an expectation that those under yours should receive Quarter, would your Lordship expect I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to such an Ordinance? This is the case. I have taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of those, who have taken Armes against His Majesty, of all Nations, <hi>English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Walloones,</hi> of all Religions and opinions that are avowed by Christians, and have alwayes allowed them Quarter, and equall Exchange (how unequall soever the Quarrell and Contention is, and what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98707:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Iudgement soever the Law hath determined upon such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) and shall doe so still, hoping that Almighty God will open the Eyes of those who have been strangely deceived into Armes against, and to the scandall and destruction of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, (in which all men know I have been borne, and for which they have reason enough to believe I will dye,) and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> Assembled by His Majesties Command, and of which His Majesty is the Head, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and reduce those, who out of ambition or malice have made those pathes, in which the other have trod to their Piety towards their Maker, and their Allegiance towards their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: But if the contrary course shall be held, and any Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, under my Command, shall be taken, executed, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in cold bloud, under what senselesse and unjust pretence soever, for every Officer and Souldier so causelessely and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously murthered, I will cause so many of the Prisoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in my Power, to be put to death in the same manner; and I doubt not but the bloud of those miserable men, who shall so suffer by my order, as well as of those who shall be butcher'd by that Ordinance your Lordship mentions, shall be requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And I cannot but expresse a great sense to your Lordship, that since His Majesties gracious Offers and importunity for Peace will not be hearkned unto, by these prodigious resolutions expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in your Lordships Letter, the Warre is like to be so mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that the <hi>English</hi> Nation is in danger of destroying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or (which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
