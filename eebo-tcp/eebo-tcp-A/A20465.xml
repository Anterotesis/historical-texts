         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BRETHREN, hearing what paines
and labour many of your reverend and
learned Paſtors (who ſometimes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
minded) doe lately vndertake in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, by their publick teaching and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by their priuate conference, and all other
meanes poſsible, to perſwade to conformitie; I
am bold (leſt they ſhould reioyce in your fleſh)
to preſent this my poore mite vnto your
godly conſideration, as caſting it into our
Lords Treaſurie, moſt humbly beſeeching
thoſe that are rich in grace, and haue ſiluer,
gold, and precious ſtones conferred vpon
them, to offer them freely and ſeaſonably for
the ſeruice of his Sanctuary, euen to build vp
the decayed places of the gates, barres, and
walles of the moſt holy Citty. Alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
that nothing be done confuſedly, or at
a very venture; vpon the warrant of no ill
<pb facs="tcp:19040:3"/>
meaning, or a ſuppoſed liberty, as if it had
been ſufficient to bring wood and timber,
ſtone and morter, and all other needfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
in all abundance, of any kinde or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,

even as the moſt learned and wiſe of thoſe
times thought meet, and not to haue every
thing fitted and prepared by the Lords owne
direction, ſo as there may need neither axe nor
hammer, nor any toole of Iron to be heard to
reform and amend the ſame;<note place="margin">1. King. 6. 7.</note> but if any thing

in every part and ceremony or geſture thereof,
bee ſo pure and free from all kinde of mixture
of any humane invention, as all things of the
very leaſt moment whatſoever, being directly
ordered according to the patterne ſhewed in the
Mount of Gods holy word, every beleeuing
heart may reioyce at the most comely order
and holy beauty of Gods own Ordinances, and
adiudge it high preſumption to tender any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
by farre-fetcht devices and novelties,
or ſome old Tradition, or worme-eaten Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
full of incertainty, to the direct diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the all-ſufficient truth, and offence of
tender conſciences. In all humilitie therefore
labour to be able to giue good and ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why you dare not conforme to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
geſture and ceremonies, nor to any thing
elſe which is not within the compaſſe of the
moſt vn-erring patterne, the holy word of the
<pb facs="tcp:19040:3"/>
all-commanding God, and bee ſure to build
your refuſall ſafely upon the rocke, and not
upon the ſand; vpon the commandement of
Chriſt, and not upon your owne humours, or
any mens iudgement and practiſe, be they never
ſo learned, zealous and holy: yea, in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you haue not Gods word for your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>(Thus ſaith the Lord, thus did our
Lord, or the Lord never tequired this at
our hands)</hi> therein ſubmit your ſelues loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and peaceably, yea most readily to them
that are over you in the Lord. And in any
caſe nourish not that moſt pestilent humour
of that man of Sinne, a delight in oppoſition
to ſuperioritie, but in all humility, in matters
that are but meerely grounded on opinion, and
not on the Scriptures, thinke better of other
mens iudgements then your owne: for God
giues no ſaving grace but to the humble, to
the humble in deed, not to the humble in
shew. Get this vertue therefore my brethren,
for then the yooke of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Math. 11. 29. 30.</note> which now you
are to draw in, will be moſt eaſie and without
griefe; and his burden, part whereof you are
preſently to beare, light and full of comfort:
yea, though you be made the gazing-ſtockes
of the world, and be hated and ſcorned of all
men, as the very off-ſcouring of the earth, for
bearing witneſſe to this part of the truth, yet
shall you by humility bee inabled with much
cheerefulneſſe and ſpirituall conſolations, to
endure all things, and to ſuffer all things; yea,
conſider I pray you, that the very true and
<pb facs="tcp:19040:4"/>
moſt direct way to reigne with Chriſt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is of neceſsitie to ſuffer for him in this
evill world; and to ſuffer for any part of the
truth in Gods worship, is to ſuffer for
Chriſt. Beleeue it therefore as verily as you
doe any other thing, that God hath purpoſely
predeſtinated you to theſe particular trials,
euen in every circumſtance and inſtrument
thereof. Seeing then you muſt drink of this
Cup, pray heartily that his name may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
and then what matters it though wee
be deſpiſed, diſgraced, ſcorned and derided, ſo
long as our Lord and maſter may haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thereby? Will not every true hearted
ſubiect ſuffer and endure any paines, trauell,
or loſſe of goods and life for his King and
Soueraignes ſake, yea and that moſt cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with a manly and valiant courage? And
shall not we much more doe the like for the
King of Kings, who hath done and ſuffered
a hundred thouſand of millions more for vs?
he loſt not an eye, a hand, or a foot for vs,
but was content to giue his whole body and
ſoule alſo, yea he ſpared not his whole perſon
for vs, and that alſo when we were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5. 10.</note>
he ſuffered diſgrace, not onely before
the Princes, but all manner of contempt by
the vileſt, and of torment by the cruelleſt,
yea and the moſt grievous paines that the
fierce wrath of God in all extremity of his
iuſtice, could poſsibly inflict upon his ſoule
and body. Doe you think he hath forgotten
theſe things? No my deere brethren, in that
<pb facs="tcp:19040:4"/>
hee ſuffered and was tempted,, he is able to
ſuccour them that are tempted; yea aſſure
your ſelues he puts euery one of your teares
into his own bottle, obſerues every hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and cloſe practiſe of your adverſaries,
keepes a Regiſter (not to be corrupted) of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
word, preſentment, information or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
that is made, ſigned, put up, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or uttered againſt you, and ſets downe alſo
every diſgrace and contempt that is caſt vpon
you, and keeps a iuſt reckoning of every pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for fees that is exhauſted from you for
exactions, excommunications, abſolutions,
and of whatſoeuer other open or under-hand
proceedings practiſed againſt you, and will
aſſuredly call to iudgement both you and
all your aduerſaries, and backe or hollow
friends, euery one to giue a particular and
moſt ſtrict account of all theſe things, and
to them that haue done well herein, hee will
giue everlaſting life and glory; but they that
haue done ill and unconſcionably, rather ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the time then the Lord, shall certainly
goe into eternall fire.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 13</note> Gird vp therefore the
loynes of your minde, and feare not them
that haue onely power to impriſon your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and take away your goods or liues, let
neither their perſwaſions nor threatnings
cauſe you to conforme to errour (of which
nature is every thing not warranted by the
word of truth) but feare him, who when hee
hath done as much as they poſsibly can, is
able alſo to caſt body and ſoule into hell fire,
<pb facs="tcp:19040:5"/>
Chriſt ſaith vnto vs all,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Him feare,</hi> even feare
to do any thing in his worship &amp; ſeruice, but
what you haue good warant for, under his
hand and ſeale in the ſacred Scriptures that he
will not be offended at it, but acceptably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it at your hands, and ſo bleſſe the uſe
thereof unto your ſoules. For elſe (at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
best that can bee ſayd for it) is not this
directly to tempt the Lord, and to dare him
to his face, when in his publick worship wee
dare doe ſome things of ſpeciall note, which
hee moſt carefully obſerues, and that before
his face and most aſſured preſence, yet onely
upon the Canons or perſwaſions of ſinfull
men not conſulting with the word whether
God will be pleaſed or offended therewith or
no?<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 19. 20.</note> There is difference (I confeſſe) betwixt
that which the Lord hath expreſly forbidden,
and that which he hath not directly nor by
any good conſequent commanded, but yet it is
onely <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> to conform
to the latter is to do wickedly, but to ſubſcribe
to the other, is to become abhominable.
Therefore in ſuch caſes of extremity, the
chuſing of the leſſe ſinne may very well argue
a most wiſe and carnall diſcretion, but not any
honest heart or ſincere affection. You know
brethren, that in the begining the Lord put
an everlasting enmitie betwixt the ſeed of the
Woman and the ſeed of the Serpent, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
afterwards into the Citty or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, where himſelfe is pleaſed to
dwell as ſupreame Lord and King peramount,
<pb facs="tcp:19040:5"/>
ruling &amp; governing his people eſpecially in his
owne ſervice) by his owne Spirit according to
his owne Lawes in his owne Word; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Synagogue of Sathan, where he alſo
ſits upon a Royall throne (indeed not in his
owne likeneſſe, but moſt exactly trickt vp
and transformed into the ſimilitude of an
Angel of light) teaching by his ſeruants many
things, commendable by the light of nature,
yea and commanding with great authority
(of all poſsible learning, reaſon, diſcretion,
wiſedome and Philoſophicall vnderſtanding,
garnished with the pretious ornaments of
moſt admirable Oratory) many diuine and
excellent truths of the word, but enterlacing
ever and anon ſome doctrines of darkneſſe,
yet very covertly, alwayes in outward shew for
holy ends and godly purpoſes, and never vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
but upon moſt graue and good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
yea very learned, ſound, and divine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
renouncing the Divell (forſooth)
moſt directly and profeſſedly, out upon him
naughty meat, what did ever any body meane
to beſtow the ſealding and plucking of him,
the very ſavour or ſent of him is death irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable;
but retaining the broth wherein he
was ſodden, or the principall brewiſſe, or ſome
ſpeciall part thereof, oh it is very good and
most wholeſome diet indeed, (the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his <hi>benedicite</hi> light upon them that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, for elſe all the fat had been in the fire)
yea I tell you this with good houshold bread
is even Angels food, (full glad would they
<pb facs="tcp:19040:6"/>
be the proudeſt of them to lick their lips af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the leavings of it) though indeed every
common underſtanding cannot diue into the
deepe mystery thereof: Separating from and
quite banishing for euer and a day, the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
doctrines of Popery, the reall preſence,
praying to the Saints departed, the ſupremacy
of the Apoſtolike Sea, and ſuch like, fie for
shame, that any body should ſo much as once
name them, ſeeing without all question they
are most damnable, and came verily from
hell; but yet retaining diuers gestures and
ceremonies thereto appropriated, and thereby
first begotten, oh here be many rare bits and
ſweet morſels, euen admirable and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
uſes of, ſuch as the Holy Ghoſt could
never for his life foreſee or thinke of, and
therefore indeed it never came into the minde
of the Lord to require them, euen becauſe he
did not prouidently enough conſider what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and comelineſſe, what vnity and much
other vndiſcerned goodneſſe their generall
conformity would inſtantly produce. For
ſeeing the Diuels to deceiue the world with
greater eaſe, and to be more free from ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will put upon them the likeneſſe of Gods
holy Angels, why should not theſe againe to
bee revenged on their enemies, transforme
themſelues into the likeneſſe of Diuels,
by conforming to ſome of their ceremonies,
that ſo more powerfully they might draw the
ſeruants of Sathan vnto God? What if the
damned crue were guld a little, and ſome
<pb facs="tcp:19040:6"/>
other fooles made faine a while, yet were not
this an admirable peece of ſeruice, and do they
not deſerue all the packe of them to be hangd
up, yea by the very heeles, that will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to the lawfulneſſe hereof? All which
premiſſes being moſt grauely pondered, and
carefully conſidered, certaine nice and nimble
wits, of a very deepe diuing reach, and most
high ſoaring humour, are lately riſen vp, and
now growen full ripe, who haue vndertaken,
not to diſpatch all the labours of <hi>Hercules</hi> in
one houre, nor by their ſweet melody to make
the wilde beasts, the ſea hideous monſters,
the fell fowles of heaven, and all the huge
mountaines of the earth in one inſtant to bee
ſilent, and at a trice to conforme to their
meaſures of most indifferent mildneſſe; but
with great facilitie (though it be a very
ſtrange wonder I tell you, yet do not thinke

of our faith, and of all the meanes

and is gone up on high, and given gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

in calling, in doctrine, in ceremony, or in

I ſay to prepare a kingdom and an eternall
weight of glory to beſtow upon every one of
his Cittizes, who haue fought the good fight
of faith, ſuch honour shall all his Saints haue
in the very preſence and ſight of all your Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoguish
aduerſaries that now ſo moleſt and
trouble you, who ſtanding neither on the
right hand nor on the left, but aloofe off in
their ayrie Castle, even indifferently diſpoſed
betwixt both, shall finde to their coſt, that
whoſoever is not in the right is verily in the
wrong (be it doctrine or geſture) and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Citty of God, is certainly for the
Synagogue of Sathan (be it for calling or
ceremony) and he that is not directly for the

<pb facs="tcp:19040:8"/>
indifferently for errour and falſehood: yea
and therefore whatſoever they pretend, all
that loue not the Sheepe of Chriſt, but woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his Lambs, and perſecute his ſeruants, shall
haue their full portion with the filthy goats.
And as for my Lord <hi>Indifferent,</hi> who will
not looſe his preſent wages of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
for the moſt aſſured hope of future
glory, vnleſſe his honour very nimbly beſtirre

he triumphes and makes a moſt glorious flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Looke therefore my brethren to the
laſt end of theſe things, and then shall you
never doe amiſſe. Now the God of peace,
who will shortly ſend our Lord Ieſus to make
triall of every mans worke, preſerue and keepe
you, and make you wiſe according unto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
that you may diſcerne things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,

and ſo may haue peace, not with the

therein; but with God, and amongst your
ſelues having your conſciences pure within,
and liues outwardly unſpotted in the world,
for nothing is availeable but a new creature,
godlineſſe is the morter whereby the houſe of
God is builded: all the gifts of Art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without this, do pull downe and not ſet
vp; yea, though they haue both zeale and
<pb facs="tcp:19040:9"/>

well tempered before any ſtone be layd, and
then may we ſafely fall to building, yea then
shall the worke proſper in our hands, let <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah,

of the truth doe what they can. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my brethren, whatſoever in the worship
of God, helpes not by his owne appoyntment
unto holineſſe, cannot poſſibly be of Chriſt.
For is it not the fruit of the Spirit? (if it be

fruit of the flesh, and therefore <hi>luſteth</hi>

Chriſtians with any comfort or aſſurance

the moſt learned &amp; grave Biſhops of this

commit a greevous ſin againſt the Lord
if they do remooue any one of theſe
things in queſtion whatſoever, and their
Reaſon is undeniable, if they can make it

            <p>Now let our adverſaries ſearch all the

Religious uſe Chriſt doth certainly beare
witnes in the word that they are good

            <p>And even as he which denies the divine

which all callings and conditions elſe wil

            <p>And leſt the impudent importunity of

graunt all that I haue ſaid, for <hi>Nadab and

without any da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of loſing their

very vnadviſedly, yea deſperatly ventred
on it: whereas otherwiſe if they had been
graue and diſcreete perſons, the action
not being forbidden by God, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
commaunding it, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they might not haue miniſtred at

both of their places and maintenance? In
ſuch a caſe rather then the daily ſacrifice
ſhould ceaſe and the people be untaught,
it were better a thouſand times to
take any fire, yea and to weare a

            <p>

I muſt needs confeſſe this to be true,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and

And of <hi>Doeg,</hi> that Edomite, his running

that voluntarily makes himſelfe a Foole

that is commanded to doe wickedly, and

vnderſtanding and diſcretion, and all other
moſt excellent parts, and vpon moſt wiſe
conſiderations, good purpoſes and holy

all the world but meere alluring entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
to make the way plain for ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
filthines, and therefore by no means
upon any terms to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formed vnto, but
to be held and adiudged moſt vnlawfull
yea execrable and therefore to ſubmit
our ſelues thereunto eſpecially in theſe
daies of knowldge, muſt nedes at the verie
beſt (though not in euerie one in the ſame
degree) be but <hi>Nadabs and Abihues</hi> caſe.
For if will worſhip or mens Inventions
bee tollerable in theſe, why not vpon
like conſideration in any other? if in new
Ceremonies, why not in new ſacraments?
for if wee acknowledge man to haue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
or prerogatiue <hi>diuino Iure,</hi> in
deviſing ſome Religious actions or geſture
in Gods publicke worſhip, do what they
can, out of this ſeed by degrees, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſitie will the popes ſupremacie
ariſe, ſeing all the other Eight Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
haue a kind of dependancie (for ſo
much as concerns the outward man) upon
the ſecond, as all the duties of the inward
man haue of the firſt, and therefore the
conforming to, and ſo Iuſtifying the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of the ſeed, muſt needs give ſtrong
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19040:27"/>
approbation to the goodnes of the fruit.
Seing then the warrantie, vertue or
power of everie Religious calling, action,
ceremonie or geſture, comes not from
the doer but from the ordainer, and that
all the good Intentions or learned Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
in the whole world can neither
deviſe them nor make them lawfull or
profitable; let us acknowledge that God
onely can take a Ribbe out of <hi>Adam</hi> and
make it a fit helpe for man, and that hee
onely can ordeine callings Ceremonies &amp;
geſtures for his Church &amp; worſhip, yea &amp;
make them profitable helps for his ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
therein, though he take them any where,
and from whence ſoever he pleaſeth, yea
though they had formerly been Idolized

the alluring contentments which alwayes
accompany theſe humane devices, they
ſteale away the heart, and make it goe a-whoring

Let us looke therefore what was in the

neceſſarie either for ſubſtance or

(for a falſe geſture had been ſinne, and

which hee uſed, was and is without all

contradiction the true geſture; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo that which was and is onely and

the bleſſed Sacrament of the moſt

with a table geſture, unleſſe like Divine
authoritie for another geſture (as well as

Gods holy word, and my bleſſed Saviours

            <p>Here of neceſſity wee muſt make a

meant to ſhare the ſpoyle forthwith,
and making ſtrong head againſt them,
as with a valiant crue of Targetteers of
good proofe. VVee referre therefore to
their learned conſideration, firſt, that the
Iewiſh ceremonies here ſpoken of, were
in their firſt original good and holy, being
ordained by God himſelfe, ſo was never
any of theſe things in controverſie, but at
the very firſt unwarrantable, and therfore
wicked and ſinfull; and ſecondly we giue
them to underſtand out of the Engliſh
long bow, that though theſe ceremonies
were indeed to be aboliſhed, yet the time
of their enduring was not fully expired
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19040:29"/>
till that the Goſpell was planted: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the report of a Canon, their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is to be admoniſhed, and themſelues
informed, that the <hi>ceremonies of the Law
were to be buried with honour, and entombed
in princely ſepulchres;</hi> but theſe of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
with all poſſible reproch, contempt,
and diſgrace, ſo that here is no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt the liberty of <hi>Paul,</hi> and that
which they pretend and brag of: unleſſe
therefore they can ſhew that in ſome
place where the Goſpel was planted, <hi>Paul</hi>
did conforme to ſome of the ſaid cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as of religious uſe in Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
worſhip, they may verie well lay
down their weapons; and betake them to
their heeles. VVhat needs that (quoth a
bold Corporall) when a better man then
ever <hi>Paul</hi> was, did abſolutely conforme
in the firſt famous Church that was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>But here fearing a foil,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> they wynd about

determine, that kneeling euen as it
is urged, is abſolutely the true and beſt
geſture, and all the other things in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
both lawfull and moſt convenient
and therefore <hi>all that will do preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and not conforme to theſe things <hi>ex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo</hi>
ought not to be fined in thouſands

that is to take away <hi>Evill from Iſraell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereunto keeping our firſt ground
without any alteration or diſorder in our
Ranks,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> we do ſay, that the Prieſthood is
quite remooved out of the Church, and

in theſe dayes of the cleere light of
the Goſpell, as a title in any reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befitting
the miniſters of the word, yea
ſeing that goverment is abſolutely taken
away, this law, being meerely politicall
is utterly repealed.</p>
            <p>The other 2 quarters or half circles having
by this time well refreſhed themſelves,
thinking they had us now at a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and in a ſtrait, ioyn with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

and therefore by direct conſequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
us to conformity: Here the Corporal

            <p>But to this,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> knowing that there is not

<hi>in matters too hard,</hi>

ſo hard a controverſie, to know which

they preſently pyke quarrells at ſome
thing publickly taught or privatly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,
pretending forſooth that it is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
and moſt dangerous breach of the
peace of holy Church, and then by ſome
ſtratageme (wherein they are admirable)
by one deviſe or other, they put out by

ſeas, or expoſed to a thowſand other
miſeries, as wofull and verie late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
doth manifeſtly teſtifie, therfore
what hope is there of all their faire offers
yet that the world may take notice that
wee deſire peace vpon any outward
terms whatſoeuer though neuer ſo vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
or preiudiciall, ſo that wee may
hold our inward peace with God we do
moſt reuerently &amp; reſpectiuely yeeld them
audience. Now they being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(through their continuall experience)
with our reſolution, and being privie to
their owne conſciences that they are not
able to ſtand before us, if the cauſe come
once to be tried by the Scriptures, yet
beeing very unwilling that the world
ſhould take notice hereof, they make ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
proteſtation, that they are moſt
ready to referre the cenſure of this cauſe
in queſtion unto Chriſt himſelfe. And
therefore having ſubmitted themſelues
unto him according to the Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
they doe moſt diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto every word hee hath ſpoken,
and ſearch everie ſillable, examine euerie
letter, yea and try everie root by the very
originall: and yet cannot finde (as they
offer to ſweare upon all the books in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19040:32"/>
world that he hath forbidden kneeling (no
not as it is urged) in the very act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Lords ſupper in any place of

that we may very lawfully, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commanded ought moſt readily (or

            <p>This had been a verie prettie and wittie
ſhift in a yong ſophiſter,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
of their element tollerable, if not
commendable; but beeing in the holy
matters of the eternall God, ſhifts and
trickes of wit, ſubtill evaſions and nice
diſtinctions, are in matters I ſay of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
uſe) but like the wittie excuſes of the
whooriſh woman in the cloſe carriage
of her moſt filthie practiſes, and therefore
I will even referre it to the Lords owne
cenſure, and for anſwer do ſay, that it is
moſt true, that all that do ſincerely deſire
<hi>to take away evil from Iſrael</hi> (or the Church)
muſt of neceſſitie take away all knowne
<hi>preſumptuous</hi> offenders,<note place="margin">Dut. 17. 12.</note> either in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

               <note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> For if they teach
&amp; urge that which <hi>the Lord never co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 18. 20.</note>
or is not warranted by the Scriptures,
and yet hold that for theſe and thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke
conſiderations, it may upon ſuch
and ſuch tearmes or limitations, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto, <hi>they ſpeake in the name of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19040:32"/>
other Gods,</hi> even that golden God <hi>Pollicie,</hi>
not that there is any intendment in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
conformitie to humane inventions in
Gods worſhip, to draw any from beleeving
in the true &amp; everliving God, but that the
Lord that made mans heart, and therefore
knowes what means are beſt to reforme
it hath ordeyned in the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
and the branches thereof, the
moſt abſolute and effectuall means, which
in his wiſdom hee ſaw to bee beſt for the
holy Ghoſt to work in, and by, and with,
for the effecting of this new creation or
regeneration of the heart unto which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as I may ſay) he hath entailed by his
faithfull covenant the effectuall working
of his ſpirit, for that very end &amp; purpoſe.
As therefore thoſe that maintaine and
teach theſe things purely and unmixed <hi>doe
ſet up the Lord to be their God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut 26. 17.</note> and by their
holy partaking of them they may be aſſured
of his love and favour even to be <hi>ſealed up
againſt the day of redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> ſo they that do
not tye themſelues preciſely hereunto, do
verily ſerve other Gods, and have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of any grace but what the Devill
(whoſe power onely doth work where
the Lords is wanting) can beſtow upon
them, becauſe they do not ſerve the true
God deſcribed in the firſt commandement
for either he is God in every commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or in no commandement, therefore
to teach the doctrine of the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19040:33"/>
never ſo ſoundly and purely,
and to corrupt the doctrine of the ſecond
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement which concernes all things
in the publick worſhip of God needfull
in any reſpect for being or well being of
the Churches of God, (by enioyning any
<hi>Novelty</hi> or <hi>Incerteinty</hi> meere Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and deviſes of men,) is directly to
teach in the <hi>name of other Gods,</hi> and ſeeing
the Lord never made promiſe to bee in
ſuch a worſhip no more then hee hath
done to the devotions of the Turks and
Indians I would faine ſee a ſound reaſon.
How any of good Indgement and ſincere
hearts knowing the unwarrantablenes of
theſe things dare conforme in any reſpect
unto them, but rather to ſubſcribe that
they that will <hi>take evill away from Iſrael</hi>
muſt of abſolute neceſſity take order, that
all ſuch proud Prophets or ambitious
preachers, and all ſuch profane and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
hearers as dare teach and will
coform to mens inventions, be not fined in
thouſands or perpetually impriſoned, but
utterly deprived not only of their livings
and liberty but even of their lives alſo.
And till this &amp; the other lawes of Chriſt
(ordeined in the ſecond commandement)
bee in force; all the good that the moſt
wholeſome lawes of moſt godly princes
and Religious ſtates can effect; is onely to
make <hi>Ambition</hi> a little more wary and
ſubtill, more Cawtelous and diſſembling,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19040:33"/>
or elſe more arrogant, even to deviſe new
and more ſecret practiſes to hinder all
means or purpoſes of reforming any thing
in the worſhip or Church of God, yea by
propoſing one thing or other by one or
other to have ſtill in ſtore ſuch variety of
freſh and moſt urgent occaſions, as there
ſhall not bee the leaſt breathing time ſo
much as to think of Reformation. Much
crying out there is (and that iuſtly) of fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
depopulations, &amp; how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
ſeeing the howſe of God lieth waſte

unto us, ſhew one place where the Lord
forbids theſe things and wee will yeeld
that it is a damnable ſin to conforme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. I am bould (with their good
leave) to Remember them of one other
argument, of the Lords own making, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this very ſubiect of the actions, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
and geſtures in this publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

               <hi>and</hi> an unerring <hi>light to
our paths</hi> in theſe very occaſions, and in
moſt plain evidence of the ſpirit it ſtands
thus: By the light of nature all mankind
knows that there is a God, &amp; therfore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
one wil worſhip him as wel as he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
though it bee not according unto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to <hi>glorifie him as God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 91.</note> for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19040:41"/>
without direction from his ſpirit
according to the ſcriptures) but though
they have excellent wiſdom and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
underſtanding, yet even the learnedeſt
of them when they profeſſe themſelves
greateſt Clarkes, proue themſelues the
verieſt fooles,<note place="margin">verſ. 22. 23.</note> becauſe they <hi>become vain in
their thoughts, &amp; their foolish hearts are full
of darknes; for they turn the glory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
God</hi> (even the glory of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and loue, of his goodnes and power,
of his mercy and truth, in deviſing &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
the ceremonies callings and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
appropriated to his own outward
worſhip, &amp; making the ſame powerful &amp;
effectuall to draw mans heart unto him
by working effectuall faith) into ſuch Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
ſimilitudes, reſemblances and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
as they in their diſcretion thought
fitteſt to ſtir up devotion, to beget reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
or to ſhew humility &amp; thankfulnes;
by which in time by degrees will get a
reverent eſtimation of Gods ordinances,
euen his own attributes and titles, yea
and will preſume to profeſſe that <hi>Iure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,
theſe are thy Gods O Iſrael,</hi> that is, this
is the true outward worſhip of the God
of Iſrael, theſe be true callings, geſtures
and ceremonies which by divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are ordeined to helpe to draw men
to God through faith and ſanctification of
the ſpirit and ſo to be eſteemed.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Lord makes it an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19040:41"/>
for ever, that al his true Churches
and true ſervants muſt onely conforme to
ſuch things in his worſhip and ſervice
as he hath in his word <hi>Required,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 12.</note> but the
Lord never required kneeling as it is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
nor the other things in controverſie,
therfore Gods true Churches and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſervants may not upon any neuer ſo
reaſonable termes conforme thereunto.
And here is either by direct conſequent
a manifeſt prohibition, or elſe the Lord
reaſons moſt abſurdlie, which is fearefull
blaſphemie to thinke or inferre, for elſe
they might, (with the perſwaders to
conformitie of theſe dayes) haue replied,
thou haſt not forbidden it, therefore wee
may doe it, and thou haſt no reaſon to
find fault with it, ſeeing wee doe it to
good intents and holy purpoſes. But grant
that the things which there are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
were forbidden, yet the manner
of Gods reaſoning remaines immutable.
Is there <hi>no commandement</hi> in the word
for it, or (which is all one) doth not
the Lord require it? then doth hee
abſolutly forbid conformitie unto it,
for <hi>the Lord hates</hi> whatſoever in the word
is not required,<note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> as theſe words being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with deteſtation do moſt manifeſtly
declare. Seeing then there is not one
word of God for kneeling in the very act
of receiving the ſacrament, nor any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of any Apoſtolick or Primitive
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19040:42"/>
Church for the practiſe thereof,<note place="margin">Math. 19. 8.</note> 
               <hi>but from
the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> and ſeeing wee
haue Chriſt his own example for a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
geſture, and the examples of all the
bleſſed (and now glorious) Apoſtles who
even after his aſcention <hi>delivered that which
they received of the Lord</hi> (which muſt needs
be granted was a table geſture) and ſeing
wee haue a direct commandement from
the holy Ghoſt to <hi>follow them as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor 11. 23.</note> it being their ſpeciall care ſo to
carrie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves in all actions (of religious

for all Churches and Chriſtians to follow
(for ſo I take this place to be underſtood

onely,<note place="margin">verſ. 1.</note> or to any particular occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.)<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 3. 9.</note>
Yea ſeing this geſture as it is urged,
is not onely the Invention of man, but
in the verie firſt originall eſtabliſhment
of it in the publicke worſhip of God,
the direct commandement of that man
of ſin; I referre it to everie godlie heart
to conſider whether with ſafetie of
conſcience wee may leave a table ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
for the uſe whereof we haue Chriſt
and his diſciples in the Inſtitution for a
patterne, and the Apoſtles during their
time, and all Apoſtolicke Churches after
them for 220. years for example and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to the geſture of kneeling, never
heard of in this kind, till the Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was eſtabliſhed. Is this to walke ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19040:42"/>
as having the Apoſtles of Chriſt <hi>for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 3. 17.</note>
or is there not Iuſt cauſe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation

            </p>
            <p>You do verie ill therfore moſt Reuerent
and learned men, in offering to deale with
vs poore and private Chriſtians, after the
ſcholerlike manner of reaſoning both in
your publicke teaching, preſſing vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with arguments and that with
ſuch vehemencie as if nothing were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to kneeling, and in your private ſpeeches
tendring diſputation, when alas for pittie
all our faithfull paſtors hauing giuen vp
their liues for the name of Chriſt, are
taken from vs, and if any remaine, yet
there is no ſafetie to ſpeake or write
of thoſe things. If therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
procure libertie for ſuch a courſe,
neuer yet obtained whatſoeuer you may
pretend, wherein freely and fully theſe
queſtions may be handled according to
that modeſt offer of diſpute long agoe

bee pleaſed either to confute that (or

written and publiſhed againſt this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
or els to ſet downe with the like
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19040:43"/>
conditions as the learned and godly men
our late paſtors haue offered, your own
arguments and reaſons for this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
which you ſo eagerly preſſe and
purſue; and (freeing the ſame from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable
ſubtilties of that diſſembling
ſophiſtrie and vaine philoſophie, the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
ornaments of that ſo affected kinde
of teaching, that wee of the vulgar may
ſee and conceiue the force of them, and
whence it is drawen, from God or men,
from the holy and inſpired ſcriptures: or
from the writings and Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
or Teſtimonies of Fathers.)</p>
            <p>VVee do ſolemnly pofeſſe (I dare ſpeak
in the name of all) that in whatſoeuer
wee haue no more for our warrant: but
the graue counſell, learned opinion and
holie practiſe of our moſt reuerent paſtors
(which yet being ſealed with their great
and conſtant ſufferings, ought highly to be
regarded of us, for whatſoeuer they be to
others or to your ſelues, they are to vs the
moſt faithfull meſſengers, true and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt, ſince
whoſe deprivations wee neuer heard men
ſpeake like them in that euidence of the

Ghoſt, to draw from ſinne vnto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
O yee men of God, you are in our
very hearts to liue and die with you, your

that we haue might redeeme the libertie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19040:43"/>
of the Goſpel in your miniſterie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
(I ſay) we will freely for peace
ſake conforme unto you. But if we can
evidently produce one word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you, or that you doe not bring his
ſacred warrant with you, let it not ſeeme
ſtrange unto you, that we runne not for
company into the <hi>broad</hi> and <hi>eaſie way</hi> with
you (which none in this poynt Papiſt or
Athieſt will ever unfainedly oppoſe) but
rather expoſe our ſelues by this our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall,
to open contempt, grievous bands,
and perpetuall impriſonment, profeſſing
publickly thereby our willingneſſe, and
moſt ready minde, yea heartie deſire
that that <hi>fire</hi> which our Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
brought with him,<note place="margin">Luc. 12. 49. 10. 54.</note> and with his own
hands, and mouth kindled, might never
bee quenched, ſeeing the unerring and
burning light thereof is our onely
preſervatiue through the effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Holy Ghoſt, againſt that

               <note place="margin">Math. 10. 28. to the end. Philip 1. 28. 29.</note> this grace of God
being given unto us not onely to <hi>beleeue

For thus onely in ſuch times of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

            <p>Thus am I bold to preſent my poore

I ſay, not in regard of the truth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

from any who otherwiſe might

to this end haue I done it (not to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in my perſon, for that were to bee

ſome taſte that <hi>the Lord</hi> hath many <hi>who
haue not bowed the knee</hi> in this kinde as it
is urged, as alſo to publiſh to all that feare
the Lord, and yet do not ſee the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of our warrant for ſo reſolute a refuſall
to conformitie, that it is not faction or
humour, nor the iudgement or practiſe
of good men (no not of our ſo endeered
Paſtors) or of the moſt holy and beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, nor of all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which we wholy reſt or depend
upon, but that our conſciences dare not
conforme to any thing of religious uſe,
eſpecially in the publicke worſhip of
God, but what is ſafely and ſoundly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the word of our God; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to ſtirre up others who haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

to put their helping hands to the

            <p>But mee thinkes I heare ſome black

            <p>I moſt humblie pray and doe hartelie

indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; or if God haue left it indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;
whether any mortall power can poſſibly
make it neceſſarie, was it not the practiſe
of that man of ſin, firſt under pretence of

being withall perſons utterly uncapable

            <p>And as for our adverſaries, I intreat all
that are godlie minded adviſedly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
themſelues, whether that ſubſtance
which God be bleſt, we haue being <hi>holy</hi> (&amp;
for which I confeſſe wee are nor ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie

Ceremonie alſo holie, which in it firſt
originall was impure and unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
yea moſt vile therefore and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19040:45"/>
abominable; can any thing which is
primarilie evill ever poſſiblie bee made
good, but onelie by the primarie good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
himſelfe? To make then that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
action, calling, or ceremonie, or the
ſimilitude and likeneſſe of them good,
which had their beginning, from Antichriſt
and not bringing Gods word for it, and
yet to hold it upon theſe terms neceſſarie
in Gods publick worſhip, even conſcience
to be conformed unto, is directly <hi>to ſet up
another God</hi> who muſt impart this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
unto it. Doth it not plainlie appeare
by this, that their <hi>Divino Iure</hi> did never
diſcend from <hi>Divine Iehovah</hi> but from
ſome black limping <hi>Vulcan</hi> or Olimpian
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> the naturall patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all ſuch durty

filthie and <hi>polluted</hi> (as everie thing

(I ſay) though not for information
of iudgement,<note place="margin">Hagg. 2. 13. 14.</note> yet for ſanctification of life
to the obedience of faith. For if <hi>holy fleſh</hi>
under the Law could non legallie ſanctifie
everie thing (no nor any thing which was
ioyned unto it) by <hi>touching of it;</hi> no more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19040:46"/>
can the doctrines of faith and iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

poſſible meanes make the callings, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,

that ſpends it ſtrength for the iuſtification
of them, though it may perhaps conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ſome meaſure of knowledge in the

all thoſe who freely conforme thereunto,
and wholy depend thereon, ſhall rather
ſcatter then gather any ſaving grace or
ſanctification thereby.</p>
            <p>But to this it is ſaid that theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
callings and geſtures are not thoſe of
<hi>poperie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note> (for <hi>nullum ſimile eſt Idem)</hi> but the
graue and adviſed ordinances of the holy

Antichriſt, at leaſt in all fundamentall
points of doctrine concerning our Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and therefore without all queſtion
ought by everie obedient Childe to bee

            <p>Alas what means then the <hi>lowing of

though perhaps one be but addle,
and the rottenneſſe of the other moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiuely

the better very unholeſome.</p>
            <p>But here our adverſaries will confeſſe,<note place="margin">Object.</note>
that for the forme they are alike indeed,
as one partridge is to another, but in their

cleane contrary.</p>
            <p>But is not this I pray you,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſome ſmall
parcell of the voyce of that beaſt, yea is
it not an apparant branch of his great
blaſphemie, to aſſume authoritie, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
ceremonies and callings for the

appropriate unto them holy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
uſes, and ſpirituall intentions,
which power is onely proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
unto God himſelfe; and yet even
this divine authoritie doe they dare to
aſſume, as their <hi>divino iure</hi> hath publicklie
proclaimed to all the Churches in the
world. But to leaue this to their better
conſideration, and to aſſume that which
which they muſt needes bee willing to
grant, that the things in queſtion are in
their outward forme like unto thoſe of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19040:47"/>
popery, but not in their uſe (at leaſt as
it is preached.) I humbly deſire them to
conſider whether this bee not (without
any turning or winding) a direct and
manifeſt breach of the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
where the Lord forbids all

but as if the Lord had ſaid, I know
it is abſolutelie neceſſarie in my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

that thoſe to whom God hath given a

may not affect oratorie to the eare but

and ſo haue clad their common harlot
my Lady (ſa-reverence) <hi>Superſtition</hi> in
