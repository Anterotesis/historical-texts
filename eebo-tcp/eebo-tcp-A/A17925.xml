         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Noble Lords, may it pleaſe your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes,
to be put in remembrance how the holy
Ghost calleth and entituleth the Princes of the
earth by the name of Gods. By which ſo rare and
admirable a ſtyle, ſo high &amp; ſupereminent a title,
men of your estate, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition &amp; qualitie be taught,
that as your names are, ſo ſhould your perſons be, Gods by name &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
therefore every way ſuch maner of perſons, as the most high God,
the God of Gods, hath commaunded you to be.</p>
            <p>That is to ſay (as Iob ſayeth) Deliverers of the poore and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,<note place="margin">Cap. 29.</note>
when they crie, and there is none to helpe; eyes to the blind, &amp; feete
to the lame; diligent in ſearching out things you know not; breakers of
the chawes of the Lyons, and the pluckers of the pray out of their teeth.
That ſo you being covered with Iustice, as with a Robe, and with a
crowne, the bleſsing of them which are ready to periſh, might come
vpon you, and the distreſſed beeing ſuccoured, might have cauſe to
prayſe you.</p>
            <p>And (most Honorable Lords) by ſo much the more have we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to tender vnto your Lordſhips favorable examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
by how much the more your fame, prayſe and honour may
be ſounded, and reſounded throughout all the Churches, when you ſhall
be well pleaſed to become humble interceſſors vnto our most gracious
and Christian Lord and King, for a more temperate, mild, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
courſe, by the Dioceſans and other ordinaries, hereafter to bee
held against the Ministers; vntill they ſhall defend their late cenſures,
penall proceedings and ſentences, for omiſsion of rites, ceremonies, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes,
<pb facs="tcp:21688:3"/>
&amp;c. to be in every due regard and circumstance anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Kings eccleſiasticall Lawes and Statutes.</p>
            <p>In the meane ſeaſon, that more rigour and ſeveritie of law hath of
late bene vſed in ſome of their Conſiſtories, then was meete, theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
with their reaſons drawen from the lawes, ſtatutes, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
which them ſelves profeſſe and practiſe (if rightly they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to their proceedings) may ſufficiently witnes. For by theſe grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
and reaſons, if inquiſition or information had ben made, or taken, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of grace and abſolution, rather then of diſgrace and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ought (in our iudgement) to have enſued.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould be demanded, what colour of law or reaſon they can
pretend, for their forme and maner of proceedings, we might rather
have cauſe to wonder, then be able to yeeld any reaſonable aunſwere to
ſuch demaund. And therefore as they be old inough, ſo good leave ſhal
they have from vs, to make anſwere for them ſelves.</p>
            <p>Only thus much we might be able, reaſonably to defend, that a good
government being lightſome, can not brooke the darkſomnes of that
which is evill. And on the other ſide, that an evill governement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
darkſome, can not but flie the lightſomnes of that which is good.
If the government then of the Church by Dioceſans, &amp; other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
had bene lightſomnes, and not rather darkſomnes, it could not
have come ſo to paſſe, as it hath done, that the Moone, as it were aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and the Sunne, as it were aſhamed, ſhould flye before the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of most groſſe darknes: That lampes of pure oyle, and candlestickes
of fine golde, ſtanding and burning day &amp; night in the temple, ſhould
be removed and put out: and that in ſteed thereof, both woodden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtickes,
and lights of bulruſhes, ſhould be brought in, and ſet vp.</p>
            <p>Nay, if we had not ſeene it with our eyes, &amp; heard it with our eares,
it would have ſeemed a wonder, altogether vncredible vnto vs, that not
one (ſo farre as we can learne) among 2. or 3. thouſand Ministers (ſome
whereof are notoriouſly knowne, to be ignorant &amp; vnlearned, ſome idle
and non reſident, ſome common bibbers &amp; taverne haunters, ſome dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and gamesters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome fighters and quarellers, ſome wanton &amp; adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,
<pb facs="tcp:21688:3"/>
ſome ſimoniacall and vſurious, ſome pompous and ambitious,
ſome greedy and covetous, ſome ſwearers and ſwaggerers, and ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and voyd of all honestie of life) ſhould ſo much as once in twoo
yeares, for any of theſe groſſe impieties, bee publickly admoniſhed, or
marked with the least note of diſgrace, for not conformitie to the holy
lawes of God: And yet notwithstanding, that a third or fourth part of
three or foure hundred painfull, diſcreet, learned, grave and godly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
within leſſe then ſixe monethes, ſhould be ſuſpended, deprived, or
depoſed ſome from their offices, and ſome from their benefices; not for
commiſsion of the leaſt of the groſſeſt of theſe ſinnes, but only for omiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the least of the commaundements and traditions of men. If wee
ſay we had not both heard and ſeene, and knowne theſe things, wee could
never have beleeved them to be true.</p>
            <p>Nay if we had not heard it, and knowne it, how incredible might it
be, that ſundry learned and godly Ministers, vowing, protesting, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to teſtifie vpon their corporall othes, that they abſtayned from the
vſe of ceremonies, for none other cauſe, but onely for feare of offendinge
God, wounding their owne weake conſciences, &amp; ſcandalizing their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
could not for all this, by the Dioceſans be accepted, but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
away and put to ſilence.</p>
            <p>Now alas (Most noble Lords) if ſuch a courſe of Iustice, and ſuch an
hand of iudgement, by your Lordſhippes, or other the Kings Iustices &amp;
Officers were held in the civil governement of the common weale, what
out-cryes would there be made in all the corners of the land, yea &amp; with
what ſwarmes of diſordered and riotous perſons, would the Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
in ſhort ſpace, be overſflowen and pestered?</p>
            <p>It is true (my Lordes) we confeſſe, that <hi>non relatione criminum,
ſed innocentia rei purgantur.</hi> And therefore to excuſe any Miniſter
wherein he may iustly be blamed, is farre from our minde and purpoſe.
For we graunt that every one must beare his owne burthen, and that
every man ought by his owne innocencie, to purge himſelfe, bee other
mens offences never ſo great, or ſeeme his owne, in his owne eyes, never
ſo ſmall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21688:4"/>
But we have therefore balanced the toleration of ſcandalous and
vnlearned miniſters, with the moleſtation of learned and godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
to the end your Lordſhippes vnderstanding the number of ſinnes
and impieties every where daily abounding, by the multitude of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and the ſcarcitie of godlines in every place to be ſeene, by the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the later, your Lordſhippes by your wiſedomes might foreſee, and
by your authorities prevent that pestilent contagion of ignorance of
Gods revealed will, which by this preposterous ſufferance, of the one, &amp;
violent progreſſe against the other, is ready to infect the whole Church,
and by conſequence, to lay wast the common weale, as a pray to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
faction.</p>
            <p>For is there not by this me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nes a way prepared and made ready for
the greatest part of the people, to revolt from the Goſpell to poperie? and
ſo from their naturall and Chriſtian Lord and King to a forein &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian
Pope? For let the booke of God be once ſealed vp from the
people in Engliſh, as in time of poperie it was ſealed vp, vnto our fathers
in Latine; and let the people by example of the wicked &amp; ſcandalous life
of Miniſters be drawne along in their owne naturall corruption, who
will not be ready to aſsiſt every Ieſuite &amp; Seminarie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhal preach
poperie, the very miſtris and mother of all corruption &amp; rebellion?</p>
            <p>The wearing of a whit Surplice, and the feyned making of an ayrie
croſſe in Baptiſme, how litle the popiſh faction, by the ſame wilbe quieted
and kept in awe, the late outragious ſtarting out in Wales, and their
madd combynings in other places, may be a good caveat for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes
to conſider: whether their driftes bee not rather to enterpriſe a
more publike diſturbance, then to continew them ſelves within the liſtes
of that obedience wherevnto they were conſtreyned in the raigne of our
late Soveraigne of bleſſed memorie, Queene Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhips therefore could not but performe a moſt acceptable
ſervice, firſt vnto God, and his Church: ſecondly vnto the King &amp; his
Realme, if your Lordſhips would be pleaſed to bee petitioners vnto his
Maieſtie, that by his Regale and Supreame power, there might bee an
healing of the former errour, and vncharitablenes of the Dioceſans and
<pb facs="tcp:21688:4"/>
other ordinaries. For it can not be denied but that by their manner of
proceedings, they haue ſinned againſt God; in this, that they have aequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nay rather in ſome things preferred their owne Canons &amp; Decrees,
before the commaundement of God. And therfore it cannot be but that
they have herein, as much as in them lay, provoked the wrath of God
againſt the King and his whole Realme, if by the Kings zeale, this their
ſo groſſe a ſinne be not reformed. My Lordes, we are well adviſed what
we ſpeake herein before your Lordſhips, for we ſpeake nothing but what
we prove thus:

            <p>We could heape argument vpon argument, vnanſwerable to this
purpoſe, but we ſhould then paſſe the boundes of an epistle, and become
over tedious vnto your Lordſhippes. Only therefore we most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
your Lordſhips in the behalfe of the faithful Ministers of Christ,
with patience to heare thus much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. that for their diſſenting in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ceremonie, from the Dioceſans, they ought no more by the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans
<pb facs="tcp:21688:5"/>
to be traduced for factious ſectaries, or ſeditious ſciſmatickes, then
the Dioceſans them ſelves ought to be traduced, for ſuch maner perſons,
by their owne diſſenting from the Cardinals and Popes of Rome.</p>
            <p>For there being as litle difference betweene a ſect, and a ſciſme, as
there is betwene a beſome &amp; a broome, &amp; there being alſo as ſmal oddes
betweene faction and ſedition, as betweene an edifice and a building,
it followeth, the Ministers diſſenting from the Dioceſans of England, or
the ſame Dioceſans diſſenting from the Cardinalls and Popes of Rome,
if neither of them be ſeditious ſciſmatickes, that neither of them can be
factious ſectaries.</p>
            <p>When Paule was accuſed by Tertullus, that he was found a peſtilent
fellow,<note place="margin">Act. 24.</note> and a moover of ſedition among all the Iewes thorough all the
world; the Apostle anſwered that they neither found him in the temple
diſputing with any man, neither making vproare among the people,
neither in the Synagogues nor in the Citie. Art not thou (ſaith the chief

as who boaſting himſelfe, rayſeth, leadeth, or draweth away much

            <p>And indeed (my Lords) from hence is it, that the Dioceſans and
whole Clergie of England (ever ſince they made a ſeparation from the
vnitie of the Church of Rome) have falſlie bene named, and reputed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries
&amp; ſciſmatickes, as though they had without cauſe devided them

ſectarist and ſciſmatick of all the world. And of whoſe ſchiſmes our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſans,

then the Dioceſans can approve them ſelves, touching their vſe of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

prove thoſe ministers which ſtand not in vnitie either of iudgement, or

things, from them, for ſuch diviſion, to be ſectaries or ſciſmatickes? For
it muſt be an vnlawful diſceſsion, by inobedience, from the vnitie of the

            <p>My Lords, I confeſſe that brevitie and perſpicuitie are two commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
graces of the toung and of the penn; &amp; ſuch as in all mens ſpeeches
and writings, are much to be affected. But yet how long or tedious ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
already I have bene, I most humbly beſeech your Honorable Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes,
to licence me to paſſe on one ſteppe further, eſpecially the matter
being of ſuch importance, as the ſame may not well bee paſſed over with
ſilence.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> Knight, his Maixseſties Attornie
Generall, with all candor and charitie, to confirme and ſatisfie by demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative
profes, all ſuch as were not inſtructed in theſe points following;
Firſt, that an eccleſiaſtical Iudge, may puniſh ſuch Parſons, Vicars &amp;c.
as ſhall deprave, or not obſerve the booke of common prayer, by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
excommunication, ſequeſtration, or deprivation, &amp; other cenſures
and proceſſe, in like forme as heretofore hath beene vſed in like caſes by
the Queenes Eccleſiaſticall lawes, though the act of <hi>primo Eliza</hi> had
never inſflicted any puniſhment for depraving, or not obſerving the
ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſeeing the Authoritie of an Eccleſiasticall Iudge, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and to give ſentence in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, according to the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
law, that the Iudges of the common law ought to give faith &amp;
credit to their ſentence, and to allow it to be done according to the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
law, when the iudge eccleſiaſticall hath given ſentence in a caſe
eccleſiaſticall, vpon his proceedings, by force of that law. For (ſaith he)
<hi>cuilibet in ſua arte perito eſt credendum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, as theſe two pointes bee plainly taught and demonſtrated
vnto vs, ſo alſo even by the ſame demonſtrative reaſons, it is cleere, that
there muſt be, firſt, a depraving, or not obſerving of the booke: ſecondly,
that every ſentence given by an Eccleſiaſticall Iudge, in a caſe of depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or not obſerving of that booke, muſt be given, according to the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
<pb facs="tcp:21688:6"/>
law, and vpon his proceedings by force of that lawe in like
forme, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From whence it followeth, that all ſentences touching depravation
or not obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the booke, be either voyd ſentences by reaſon of nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
or no good ſentences by reaſon of iniquitie and iniustice, if by the
Iudges Eccleſiasticall, vpon their proceedings, the ſame ſentences have
not bene given by force and according to the ſame lawes, in like forme
as heretofore hath bene vſed in like caſes by the Kings. Eccleſiasticall
Lawes; or if the factes charged vpon the Ministers, by the iudges eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall,
by the letter &amp; intendement of the law, be no depravations, or
not obſervations of the ſame booke. And therefore to the end all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
touching theſe two poyntes, might hereafter vtterly ceaſe, and bee
quite buried, your Lordſhipps could not performe a more acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the King, the Church, and Realme, then by an humble importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Maiestie, to have it explaned by parliament; both who (by the
letter and true meaning of the Statute) bee depravers or not obſervers
of the booke, and alſo what lawes Eccleſiasticall, may, and of right ought
to be called, indeed and trueth, the Kings Eccleſiastical Lawes. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
aſwell touching theſe pointes, as touching the former pointes of Sir
Edward Cooks, it be throughly decided, what is the binding and aſſured
law, how ſhould the Ministers, or others, content and ſatisfie themſelves
with an vndoubted trueth?</p>
            <p>And that this maner of controverſie about the invaliditie of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
of deprivation, given by eccleſiasticall Iudges, is not a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
now firſt moved, but that the ſame hath bene long ſince handled and
diſcuſſed, is a matter yet remayning (I doubt not) vpon publike record.
For whereas ſentences were given in the tyme of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
ſixt, for the depriving of <hi>Steven Gardener,</hi> from the Biſhoprick of
<hi>Winceſter, Bonner</hi> from the Biſhopricke of <hi>London: Heath</hi> from
the Biſhoprick of <hi>Worceſter: Day</hi> from the Biſhopricke of <hi>Cheſter:

<pb facs="tcp:21688:7"/>
of <hi>Exeter:</hi> wherein many grave and learned commiſsioners were
imployed: as the Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer, Ridlie</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London:
Goodrick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elie;</hi> Sir <hi>William Peeter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas
Smith,</hi> the Kings Secretaries: Sir <hi>Iames Hales,</hi> one of the Iudges of
the Law: Maister <hi>Goſnell,</hi> Maiſter <hi>Goodrick,</hi> Maister <hi>Liſley,</hi>
Maiſter <hi>Stamford,</hi> men notably learned in the common lawes of this
Realme Mai. <hi>Leveſon,</hi> and Mai. <hi>Oliver,</hi> Doctors of the Civill Law,
nevertheles the ſame ſentences, were in the tyme of Queene Mary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
and diſannulled without Perliament, within the ſpace (as myne
Authour ſayth) of three dayes, by vertue of other Commiſsioners, for
faultes found in the proceſſes, viz. that the former Commiſsioners had
proceeded <hi>ex officio,</hi> without authoritie, contrary to the Kings Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiastical
Law: ſometimes <hi>quod iuris ordo non fuerit ſervatus, &amp;c.</hi>
ſometimes that the Interrogatories were ministred to divers perſons
without knowledge of the defendants, &amp;c. ſometimes that ſome of the
witneſſes were examined privately without oath: ſometimes that their
exceptions and appellations, were not admitted, but their perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to priſon, <hi>pendente appellatione, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore (most honorable Lords) it is to be conſidered, if the
like, or greater and more notorious defaultes and enormities, bee to bee
found in any ſentence of deprivation, given <hi>ex officio,</hi> by a Dioceſan
governour at this day, whether the ſame ſentence ought to be maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as good and iust, or rather whether the ſame ought not (as the
Kings law requireth) to bee reverſed and diſannulled, as evill and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous?</p>
            <p>And thus I leave and commend vnto your most honorable care,
circumſpection, and vigilancie, the hearkening and ſpying out, by all the
poſsible wayes and meanes in your highest wiſedomes, you can best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
how the good lawes, ſtatutes &amp; Decrees of the Church &amp; Realme,
being duly executed, a learned, vertuous, paynfull, and godly Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
may be nurſed and ſuffered to grow vp. And how on the other ſide,
<pb facs="tcp:21688:7"/>
an Idle, Ignorant, Scandalous, and godles ministerie may (as worthily
it deſerveth) be cut downe, and troden vnder foote: The one by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Decree and ordinance of God, hath establiſhment from heaven,
and therefore without ſinne &amp; offence to God can not be neglected: the
other ſpringeth from below, and is much like to an evill herbe, or weed,
which if it be not ſpeedily rooted vpp, but ſuffered to ſpread, will ſoone ſo
over-ſpread the gardens of God, with vice and impietie, as there will
ſcarce be any roome left, for vertue and pietie, the one by vſe, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Kings eccleſiasticall lawes, may eaſilie be cheriſhed: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without abuſe and contempt of the ſame law, can not in any ſort bee
tolerated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was ſaid vnto</hi> Shebna, <hi>the Steward of the houſe of King</hi> Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah:
What haſt thou to doe here? and what haſt thou here,
that thou ſhouldeſt hewe thee out a ſepulchre, as he that hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out his ſepulchre, in an high place, or graveth an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for him ſelfe in a rocke?</p>
            <p>But, oh, you most noble Lordes, are not as <hi>Shebna</hi> in the houſe of
Hezekiah,<note place="margin">Iſa. 22. 11.</note> but you are vnto King IAMES, and his houſe, as was
<hi>Eliakim</hi> vnto <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and to the houſe of King David. As the
key of the houſe of King David was layde vpon the ſhoulders of <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi>
ſo is the Key of the houſe of King Iames, laid vpon your ſhoulders.
If you ſhall open, no man ſhall ſhut; if you ſhall ſhut, no man ſhall open.
Would your Lordſhippes then bee fastened as a nayle, in a ſure place, as
<hi>Eliakim</hi> was? And would you deſire to be the throne of the glorie of
your Fatbers houſes, as <hi>Eliakim</hi> was to his? You must then hee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with the garmentes, and ſtrengthened with the girdle of <hi>Eliakim:</hi>
yea and you must be Fathers, to the inhabitantes of Ieruſalem, and of
the Cittie of God. Yea <hi>Shebna,</hi> though he were in mans iudgement ſo
fastened, as though he ſhould never fall, yet must his face bee covered,
and he him ſelfe rouled and turned like a bale in a large lande. Yea hee
must be driven from his ſtation, destroyed out of his dwellinge place,
<pb facs="tcp:21688:8"/>
and bidden to departe. Nay the burden that was vppon him, must bee
cutt off, that the Chariottes of his glorie, may bee the ſhame of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges, most honorable Lordes, if you accompliſh and bring
to effect, you ſhall approove your ſelves vnto the great and mighty
GOD, to be ſuch little Gods vnder him, as you may not bee aſhamed
at his glorious appearance, but may reioyce and be glad, that your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
and divine actes, have beene aunſwerable to your divine and
worthie names. And thus the God of power, and Maiestie, confirme,
ſtrengthen, and ſtabliſh your heartes faithfully and couragiouſlie to doe
the worke of God, and of his King.</p>

One Rule or canon is neceſſary to be conſidered, concerning the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which is required vnto the rules &amp; cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ordeyned by the Prieſts
and Biſhops. For as much as that parte of the iuriſdiction of Prieſtes &amp;
Biſhops which conſiſteth only in outward ceremonies, and ſuch things
as be themſelves but meane and indifferent, ſurely there is no other obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

then is preſcribed by the ſaid lawes, &amp; commandements of the
Prieſts and Biſhops; So that they do it not in contempt or deſpite of the
ſaid power and iuriſdiction. But have ſome good and reaſonable cauſe
ſo to doe, and offend not, nor ſlaunder not their neighbours in their
doing. For in theſe pointes, Chriſtian men muſt ſtudie to preſerve that
libertie wherevnto they bee called and brought by Chriſtes bloud and
his doctrine. That is to ſay: Although men ought to repute and thinke
that the obſervation of holydayes, faſtingdayes and other conſtitutions,
be expedient and neceſſarie for ſuch endes and intentes as they be made
for. And though men ought to repute and thinke that all the ſaid ends
and intentes be very good, expedient &amp; neceſſarie, aſwell for a common
order, &amp;c. yet ſurely men may not eſteeme them but as thinges indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
&amp; of no ſuch neceſſitie, but that men may vpon cauſes reaſonable,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21688:11"/>
well omit &amp; leave the ſame vndone, ſo that it be not in caſe of contempt
and ſclander. This rule and canon men muſt diligently learne.</p>
            <p>Yea: but did Ma.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
               <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſpeake that in the perſon of the Magiſtrate,
or in the perſon of a brother? As for the rule and canon mentioned by
the ſaid Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterburie</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> and other Biſhops and
Prelates, it is to be vnderſtood of ſuch ceremonies &amp; ordinances, as the
Prieſts and Biſhops preſcribe vnto the people, and not of politicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of the Church, given or confirmed by the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Well: but if a Chriſtian Magiſtrate (notwithſtanding the dignitie of
his perſon) be a chriſtian brother,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> would not my Lord of <hi>W:</hi> (if he were
demanded) anſwere, that a Chriſtian Magiſtrates ſword, is committed
vnto him rather for quieting, then for troubling: for healing, then for
wounding of the weake conſciences of his Chriſtian ſubiects?</p>
            <p>For in that, that Princes and ſubiects, meeting in the communion of
Saints, be therein brethren, how ſhould the perſon of a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
(though in excellencie h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rr ſurmount the perſons of all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,)
alter the nature of a Chriſtian trueth, in a Chriſtian communitie?
And if it be a trueth in chriſtian communitie, that Chriſtian brethren,
ought not to trouble the weake mindes of their Chriſtian brethren, in
things indifferent, doeth not a chriſtian Magiſtrate ſinne, if he obey not
this trueth? but to let this paſſe: where you demand, whether M. <hi>Bilſon</hi>
ſpeake in the perſon of a Magiſtrate, or in the perſon of a brother: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it to the iudgment of all men, whether in that place of his booke,
his wordes immediatly going before, and following after, doe not as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
touch the Magiſtrates office, as by any poſſible meanes they may.
For he in that place mainteyning the Magiſtrats authorite, touching his
lawfull requiring of an oth vnto the ſupremacie, both for coacting and
correcting ſuch, as deny the lawfulnes of the ſame: And for this purpoſe
having cited the deſperatenes of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who ſlew themſelves, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they would be forced to forgoe their fancies, in the end ſaith
thus: How beit we grant that he w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> woundeth a weak co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, ſinneth
againſt Chriſt. Whervpon alſo againe follow theſe words, a litle after; we
may not <hi>for things indifferent, trouble the Weake mindes of our brethren.</hi>
A Chriſtian Magiſtrate then, (for of a chriſtian Magiſtrate he ſpeaketh)
ſinneth againſt Chriſt, if he trouble the weake mindes of his Chriſtian
brethren, or wound their weake conſciences for things indifferent. And
ſo this reply might ſuffice alſo, vnto that exception made touching the
rule and canon of the Archbiſhops and Biſhops, before rehearſed, had
not them ſelves in expreſſe termes, more fully cleared this point. For they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21688:11"/>
make no maner difference or diſtinction, betwene the preceptes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Prieſtes and Biſhops, rightfully made by authoritie of their
iuriſdiction, whether they be confirmed, or not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, by the people,
or chriſtian Magiſtrate: But they affirme directly the ſame precepts and
ordinances being once receyved by the common conſent of the people,<note place="margin">Fol. 57.</note>
and authoriſed by the lawes of Chriſtian Princes, that no other obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is required to them, but that men may lawfully omitt, or doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
then as is preſcribed by the ſaid Lawes and commandements,
of the Prieſts and Biſhops, ſo that they doe it not in contempt or deſpite
of the ſaid power and iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Yea moreover (ſay they) although men ought to repute &amp; think, that
all the ſaid ends and intents, be alſo very good, expedient &amp; neceſſary, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
for a common order and tranquilitie, to be had among the people,
as alſo for the better inſtruction &amp; inducement of the people, vnto the
obſervation of theſe things, wherein conſiſteth indeed that ſpirituall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
&amp; that ſpirituall honor and ſervice, which God requireth of vs; yet
ſurely men may not eſteeme them, bus as things indifferent; and of no
ſuch neceſſitie, but that men may vpon cauſes reaſonable, well omit and
leave the ſame vndone, ſo that it be not in caſe of contempt &amp; ſclander.</p>
            <p>And vnto theſe caſes,<note place="margin">7.</note> (eſpecially at this time, above all times) ſpeciall

               </gap>
be moe alterations, then are ſpecified in the ſtatute; The forme of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
is not corrected and altered, and moreover there is ſome detraction
from the very matter of the booke, which detraction ought not to have
bene made, and which is conteyned in this prayer following:</p>
            <q>From the Tyrannie of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all his deteſtable
enormities, <hi>Good Lord deliver vs.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>And as touching the forme of the Letanie of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> booke, whereas
the ſame by the letter of the Act, ſeemeth by the Parliament, to have ben
altered &amp; corrected (for the words ſtand thus, <hi>viz.</hi> altered &amp; corrected,
&amp; not to be altered &amp; corrected) yet now ſo it is, that the ſame forme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
ſtil in the pariſh book vnaltered, &amp; vncorrected. For the whole
forme, order, and diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayers, which is in the Letanie of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
book is the ſame forme, order &amp; diſpoſition of prayers which was in
the Letany of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> book, Except vnhappely we ſhall ſay, that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
and alteration of the prayer of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (by the booke of K.
<hi>Edw.</hi> according to the nature of the letter of that prayer appointed to be
read, laſt of all the prayers in the Letanie) is an alteration and correction
of the forme of the Letanie, when as notwithſtanding the tranſpoſition
and alteration of that prayer by the pariſh booke, appointed not to bee
read laſt, but before ſundrie other prayers, is rather a playne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not a correction, of that parte of the forme of the Letanie: For
this tranſpoſition is as if an huſband-man, ſhould ſet his cart before
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21688:13"/>
his horſe; or as an Orator ſhould place his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion before his proheme.</p>
            <p>Again it can not probably or reaſonably be gathered, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
mentioning an alteration &amp; correction made of the forme of the
Letany, did inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the words (forme of the Letany altered &amp; corrected)
that part of the matter of the Letany was or ſhould be altered &amp; correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For the matter of that prayer was good, and without fault, &amp; needed
no alteration and correction at all, yea and had the Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t detracted
or intended, that that prayer ſhould be detracted out of the Letany, and
that by the detraction thereof, the forme of the Letanie had ben altered
and corrected, then would no doubt the Parliament have ſpoken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and plainly in this caſe, like as the ſame did in the other two caſes,
in this or the like maner, <hi>viz.</hi> one prayer againſt the tyrannie of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome, and all his deteſtable enormities, detracted: In like ſorte,
I ſay, as it enacted, one alteration or addition of certeyne leſſons to bee
vſed on every ſunday in the yeare, and two ſentences only added in the
delivery of the Sacraments to the communicants: wherefore the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the excellencie of their iudgement &amp; ſharpnes of their wiſdom,
by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe wordes (forme altered and corrected) neceſſarily implying, that
the forme of the Letany of King <hi>Edwards</hi> booke, was faulty and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
it can not by any reaſonable conſtruction bee gathered, that the
Parliament by forme of the Letanie, did intend any part of the matter of
the Letanie, which was good and ſincere. For if we ſpeake properly, and
not tropically, plainly, and not obſcurely; iudiciouſly, and not ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly;
(as all Statutes and all wiſe Law-makers ſpeak or ought to ſpeak)
we can not ſay, that any parte of the matter of a thing, is the forme of a
thing. For what a vanitie were it to call the matter of a loafe, the forme
of a loaſe? The matter of an houſe, the forme of an houſe? or the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a man, the forme of a man? much more vainly then needs muſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſpeake, if we call the matter of a maſt of a ſhip, the forme of a ſhip; the
matter of the clapper of a bell, the forme of a bell; or the matter of the
whit of an egge, the forme of an egge. Wherefore it can not otherwiſe
be intended by the Parliament, but that the faulty and corrupt forme,
order, and diſpoſition of prayers conteyned in the Letany of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
booke, was, or at leaſtwiſe, ſhould have bene corrected and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into an holy &amp; ſincere forme, order, and diſpoſition of prayers, and
not to have continued ſtill faulty and corrupted, as the ſame was in the
beginning and firſt originall thereof. Yea and that this indeed was the
true meaninge of the Parliament, is more fully confirmed vnto vs out
of the doctrine of one of the Homilies, commaunded publikely to bee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21688:13"/>
read in the churches: For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer (ſaith the <hi>Homilie</hi>) is rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſaid by the publicke Miniſter,<note place="margin">The ſecond part of the right vſe of the Church.</note> in the name of the people &amp; the
whole multitude preſent, whervnto they giving their ready audience,
ſhould aſſent and ſay Amen. But in the Letany of the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke attayned
and gotten by the Pariſhioners, the forme of prayers is not framed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this maner. For in ſome part of the Letany the Miniſter only repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ſome thing, for the which the people praye, and ſo it commeth to
paſſe, that the people only praye, and not the Miniſter: yea and ſo the
Miniſter ſupplieth the place of the people, and the people the place of
the miniſter. Agayne in ſome other partes of the Letany, the miniſter
prayeth for one thing, and the people following, pray for another; By
meanes whereof, the faultie and corrupt forme, order and diſpoſition
of prayers in the Letany, diſagreeable to the doctrine of the <hi>Homilie,</hi>
remayneth vnaltered and vncorrected, contrarie to the act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and doctrine of the church of England.</p>
            <p>Concerning addition and alteration ſpecified in the act, there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and ſundry other alterations, and ſome additions alſo, in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
booke; differing from the booke of King <hi>Edward,</hi> in wel-nigh l.
materiall poyntes. And for the vſe of which pointes, if the Kings Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Iuſtices ſhould as ſtrictly and rigorouſly proceed, as the Bb.
have done, and yet doe, for the not vſe of the Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>plice &amp; Croſſe, they
might bring all the miniſters of the church within danger of ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes
impriſonment, and of the loſſe of one yeares profite, of all their
ſpirituall promotions to the King. For theſe words of the ſtatute, that
all and ſingular miniſters, in any Cathedrall or Pariſh church, &amp;c. be
bound to ſay and vſe the Mattens, Evenſong, celebration of the Lords
Supper, and adminiſtration of each of the Sacramentes, and all their
common and open prayer, in ſuch order and forme as is mentioned in
the ſaid booke ſo authorized by Parliament in the fifth &amp; ſixth yeeres
of the Raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth with one alteration, &amp;c. and
none other or otherwiſe: Theſe wordes (I ſay) doe as exactly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
bind all Miniſters to vſe the book of King Edw. and none other
or otherwiſe in all poyntes (excepting the excepted) as they binde anie
Miniſters to vſe the rites &amp; ceremonies, mencioned in the ſaid booke:
But how can any Miniſter vſe that order of ſervice, and none other or
otherwiſe, which is appointed in the booke of fift and ſixt Edw. 6. (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the excepted) when as ſome other order of ſervice (exceptinge
the excepted) is concluded within the booke, provided by the Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21688:14"/>
And for the vſe of which booke, rather then for refuſall of the
vſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of which booke, a miniſter is puniſhable by the ſtatute. And to
make the thing which we have in hand to be vndeniable, &amp; without
cavil: namely, that the booke provided by the Pariſhioners, is not that
booke, which is authoriſed by act of Parliament: it is to be noted (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the alterations and additions ſpecified in the ſtatute) that there is
one great and mayne alteration, betweene the two bookes, of ſundrie
chapters, appointed to be read for the firſt leſſons, at Mattens, &amp; Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong,
vpon divers feſtivall dayes. Which alteration alſo, it is evident,
that the ſame was made generally, and for the moſt part from the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to the worſe, namely from the canonicall ſcriptures, to the Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall
writings: from whole chapters, to peeces of chapters, and that
as it ſeemeth not without fraud and colluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Queene &amp; Realm.
The proofe of which alteration is apparantly ſcene by the ſeverall ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenders,
of both bookes. Vnto which kalenders, for the firſt &amp; ſecond
leſſons, (except the ſame be proper leſſons) at morning and evening
prayer the miniſter is referred. For in a Rubrick before <hi>Te Deum,</hi> at
morning prayer, it is ſaid: There ſhal be read two leſſons diſtinctly
with a loude voyce; the firſt of the old teſtament, the ſecond of the
new, like as they be appointed by the kalender, except there be proper
leſſons aſſigned for that day. And in the order for evening prayer it is
thus ſaid: Then a leſſon of the old Teſtament as is appointed likewiſe
in the kalender, except there be proper leſſons appointed for that day.
And after <hi>Magnificat:</hi> then a leſſon of the new Teſtament; Now theſe
firſt and ſecond leſſons, whether they be proper or not proper leſſons,
aſſigned by the pariſh booke, that many of them doe vary from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

firſt and ſecond leſſons, appointed by the booke of 5. and 6. Edw. 6. is
plainly to be ſeene, not only by the kalenders of both bookes, but alſo
by the order appointed for proper leſſons: A paterne whereof at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne

            <q>Vnto theſe alterations there is one maine difference to be added
and fitt in this place to be obſerved, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning certaine dayes,
wherein proper leſſons are to bee read. For by the booke of
King Edw. it is ſaid proper Pſalmes &amp; leſſons for divers feaſts
and dayes, but by the pariſh booke, the title is after an other
maner. <hi>viz.</hi> Leſſons proper for holy dayes. From whence it
followeth that all thoſe dayes wherein proper leſſons are to
be read, are by that title accompted to be holy dayes: which is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21688:15"/>
repugnant to a Rubricke of the ſame booke, entituled: <hi>Theſe
to bee obſerved for holy dayes, and none other.</hi> Out of which
Rubrick (amongſt a number of holy dayes there ſpecified)
ſix dayes be ſecluded from being holy dayes; for the which
ſix dayes notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, proper leſſons are appointed to be
read, as vpon holy dayes: and theſe ſix dayes be the dayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:

Wenſday and Thurſday before Eaſter, Goodfriday, and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
even.</q>
            <p>It ſeemeth therefore not to be ſo ſafe a matter, as men are borne in
hand it is, for miniſters abſolutely to ſubſcribe, that there is nothing
in the whole booke of common prayer, repugnant to the holy worde
of God, ſeeing there is ſo groſſe and palpable a repugnancie in the
booke it ſelfe. <hi>Conſentiet null<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alſo may be added an other repugnancy more abſurd. For
beſides the alterations and additions before ſpecified, and not compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the ſtatute, there is a Rubrick added, which not only repugneth
the booke of K. Edward, but alſo croſſeth the kalender, aſwell of the
pariſh booke it ſelfe, as of the booke of K. Edward. By which Rubrick
alſo there is a detraction from the booke of K. Edward, worſe then the
former of the Letany. Becauſe this Rubrick appointeth onely part of
the firſt chapter of Saint Matthew, and part of the third chapter of
Saint Luke to be read, whenſoever by the kalender or booke, thoſe
chapters come to be read. Whereas the kalender of both bookes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
the whole firſt chapter of Saint Matthew, &amp; the whole third
chapter of Saint Luke to be read vpon divers dayes in the yeare. As for
example, both bookes on the firſt Sunday after the nativitie, appoint
the whole firſt chapter of Saint Matthew to be read for the Goſpell.
Which whole chapter alſo is appointed by the kalenders of both
bookes, to be read for the ſecond leſſon of morning prayer on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
day of lanuary, the third of May, and the 31. of Auguſt. The like
is to be obſerved by the kalenders, for the reading of the whole third
chapter of Saint Luke, for the ſecond leſſon at morning prayer, vpon
the 21. of February, the 19. of Iune, and the 17. of October.</p>
            <p>But theſe chapters are no part of the Booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> and
by the Preface before the ſecond part of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> a Miniſter may
for ſome chapters of the old Teſtament, read ſome chapters of the
New, as to him ſhall ſeeme to tend more to edification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21688:16"/>
By your leave,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> this your exception ſeemeth to be but an homelie, &amp;
frivoulous exception: For though the chapters bee no part of the
booke of common prayer, yet be the chapters part of the matter of
the common ſervice of the church preſcribed by the booke: yea and
the formall and orderly reading of ſuch and ſuch chapters, at ſuch &amp;
ſuch times, is part alſo of the order and forme of ſaying the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Inſomuch as neither Mattens nor Evenſong, in matter &amp; forme
can be ſong or ſaid, without the chapters be read. And as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to the <hi>Homilies,</hi> that by the ſame the miniſter is at libertie to leaue
ſome chapters of the old, for ſome chapters of the new Teſtament, for
firſt or ſecond leſſon, what doeth that helpe the falſification of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
booke, when the ſame, in place of ſix and twentie, or thereabouts,
of Canonical, hath appointed ſo many of Apocriphall chapters, vpon
feaſt dayes to bee read? Or how can the Preface exempt a Miniſter
from being puniſhable before the Kinges Iuſtices, if he ſhall follow
ſome private preface, and breake the Kings publike edict?</p>
            <p>But both bookes agree in many pointes,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> and namely that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in Baptiſme ſhall make a croſſe vpon the childes forehead, &amp; ſhall
ſay: We ſigne thee with the ſigne of the croſſe, &amp;c. And therefore how
ſoever the bookes may differ in ſome moe pointes then are mentioned
in the Statute, yet cleane to diſavow the book of common prayer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

a cavill, and reproveth the whole ſtate of Prelacie and of the Realme,
who have received and vſed the ſame booke, ever ſince the firſt yeare
of our late Queenes Raigne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King Henrie the eight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> writing to the Emperour againſt the Pope,
telleth him, that a free man ignorant of his freedome, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
become a bondman, becauſe ignorantly he ſubmitteth him ſelfe
to ſervitude; No more (ſay we) is the State of the Realme, lyable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,
when having committed the ordering of theſe affayres to the
fidelitie and circumſpection of the Clergie, it hath bene abuſed by the
Clergie. Howſoever the State then of the Realme have received and
vſed the booke, attayned and gotten by the Pariſhioners, it mattereth
not to the point in queſtion. For if the Clergie vnwitting to the State,
have cauſed or ſuffered a booke to bee printed and publiſhed, which
hath but the ſhew of a booke, then (as it ſeemeth) hath the Clergie no
law, but the ſhewe of a law to enforce the vſe of ſuch a booke, as the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21688:16"/>
State hath not authorized. And therefore we may not for clearing the
Clergies iuſt reproofe, confeſſe an vntrueth, and ſtill conceale a kinde
of iniuſtice (vnwitting to the State) executed by the Cleargie, vnder a
colour of Iuſtice, as if their iniuſtice by colour of errour, were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
by the State: For ſo contrarie to all reaſon and good duetie,
(which we owe to the ſtate and to the Church) we ſhould not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlace
the innocencie of the State, with the guiltines of the Cleargie,
but alſo mingle the churches induſtrie, with the Clergies ill huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie.
It is therefore no cavill, to oppoſe a iuſt and true anſwere, to an
vntrue and vnſound plea:</p>
            <p>For albeit the two bookes agree in many pointes, and ſpecially in
mencioning the making of a croſſe, &amp;c. nevertheles the pariſh booke,
can not therefore any more truely be counted, that booke which is
authoriſed by act of Parliament, then can that coyne bee reckoned to
be the Kings coyne, which hath in it, nine partes ſilver, and the tenth
part copper, nether is it any more lawfull for an ordinary, to preſſe the
vſe of a booke, in it ſelfe corrupted, though in many points it agree
with the originall; then it is ſufferable for the Kings Iuſtices, to enforce
the vſe of a coyne in it ſelfe counterfeite, though in forme and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctere,
it be like the Kings Image and ſuperſcription. Wherefore the
mencion made in the pariſh booke of making of a croſſe, &amp;c. not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a matter of power ſufficient to warrant the pariſh booke; but the
booke authoriſed by act of Parliament, being a matter of power to
warrant the making of a croſſe, &amp;c. wee may iuſtly avow the booke of
common prayer, attayned and gotten by the pariſhioners, not to bee
that booke, which the Miniſters in their day he miniſtration of divine
ſervice, be bound to vſe, notwithſtanding the making of a croſſe and
ſigning the child in the forehead with a croſſe, be therein mencioned:
If reply bee made that this plea would but litle eaſe or advantage the
Miniſters in caſe the right booke ſhould be reviewed, corrected and
new printed, we then reioyne and averre. Firſt, that the day is paſt long
ſince, before which time this worke ſhould have bene refined, and that
therefore it is now too late, without a new law, to reviewe and amend
the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that this plea will not only, but litle eaſe and advantage
the nullities, iniquities and iniuſtices of ſentences heretofore paſſed, by
the ordinaries vnder colour of that booke, but alſo much advantage

               <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> king of <hi>Iudah,</hi> or as K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, king of <hi>England</hi> did:
king <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> in, or about the beginning of his raigne (as it ſeemeth) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
appointed the Prieſtes to take all the ſilver of dedicate thinges
brought to the houſe of the Lord, and therwith to repaire the broken
places of the houſe, whereſoever any decay was found, and the Prieſts
vntill the three and twentith yeare of his Raigne, not having mended,
that which was decayed, nor repayred the ruines of the Temple, the
king (I ſay) becauſe of the Prieſts negligence, commanded the Prieſts
to receive no more money, and tooke from them the ordering of the
money, and committed the ſame to his Secretary, and to <hi>Ieho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dealt faithfully.</p>
            <p>If the Prieſtes then of our age, have not only not within three and
twentie, but not within three and fortie yeares publiſhed that booke,
which is mended and corrected by the Queene &amp; her ſtate, in the firſt
yeare of her Raigne; but alſo for the ſpace of eight and fortie yeares,
have ſuffered a corrupted booke, to be intruded into the place of a true
booke, we commend it to the wiſedome of our Soveraigne Lord king
IAMES, (who is as an Angell of God to diſcerne betweene things that
differ) (there being no high Prieſt in our dayes like faithfull as was <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada</hi>
the high Prieſt in the dayes of king <hi>Ioaſh</hi>) whether his Maieſtie

the Clergie.</p>
            <p>Vnto theſe differences and alterations betwene the two bookes, not
mencioned in the ſtatute may be annexed, both an addition of certaine
new prayers, and ſome alteration alſo of the forme of the old prayers
to be ſaid after the end of the Letanie. By addition in the pariſh booke,
there be ſet three ſeverall prayers, not any one of them mencioned in
the Kings booke, <hi>viz.</hi> A prayer for our Biſhops &amp; Curates, beginning
thus: <hi>Almightie and everlasting God, which only workest great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilles,
ſend downe vpon our Biſhops and Curats, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
out of the 2. of Corint. 13. 13. <hi>viz. The grace of our Lord Jeſus
Christ, &amp;c.</hi> And thirdly, a prayer beginning thus: <hi>O God whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and propertie is ever to have mercie, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21688:17"/>
And whereas by the forme of King Edwards booke, the Letanie
ſhould ever end with this collect following: <hi>viz. Almightie God,
which hast given vs grace at this time with one accord, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo this
collect ſhould be after the prayers for rayne, for faire weather, in the
time of dearth, in the time of warre, and in the time of any common
plague, or ſicknes, as the time requireth. This collect (I ſay) by King
Edw. booke appointed to be ſaid after all theſe prayers, is by the pariſh
booke ſet before all theſe. Yea and it is to be ſaid alſo, before the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
beginning: <hi>O God whoſe nature &amp; propertie is ever to have mercy.</hi>
By meanes wherof the very forme and order of ſome prayers, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Kings booke, and by the ſtatute commaunded to be vſed,
and none other, or otherwiſe is ſo tranſpoſed, and inverted, as that
the miniſter obſerving the pariſh booke, can not but breake the order
and forme of common prayer, commanded to be vſed, and ſo can not
but caſt his body, &amp; one whole yeares fruites of his benefice, vpon the
kings Iudges, and Iuſtices mercy.</p>
            <p>Moreover, beſides theſe additions and alterations, in the end of the
Letany of <hi>King Edw.</hi> booke, there is one prayer inſerted, which by the
pariſh booke is wholy left out, namely: <hi>O God mercifull Father, which
in the time of Heliſeus, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, at the latter end of the communion, in the kings book there
is one Rubrick concerning kneeling at the communion, which Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
is not in the pariſh booke, &amp; the ſame beginneth thus: <hi>Although
no order, &amp;c.</hi> There is alſo one Rubrick among thoſe Rubricks which
are in the pariſh booke not to be found in the Kinges booke, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thus: <hi>And in Cathedrall or Collegiat Churches, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore the pariſh booke, in ſo many and materiall poyntes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus groſly corrupted, and no one true original copie provided by
the pariſhioners for the miniſters to vſe, it ſeemeth to be a very lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and wofull caſe; that ſubſcription to a feyned record ſhould bee
thus ſtreightly vrged. And that ſo many learned, peynfull and godly
Miniſters for refuſing to ſubſcribe, or preciſely to vſe an vnauthenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſcedule, ſhould be grieved and moleſted.</p>
            <p>By what guyle, or by whoſe cunning ſo foule a ſtratageme, to the
deluding of the Queene, the Lords, and commons in Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſombled,
was firſt wrought, we know not. Neither have we any reaſon
to charge any of the Clergie now living, with ſo foule and groſſe an
abuſe. Becauſe there is not one of the Clergie, to our knowledge, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21688:18"/>
that in the beginning of our late Queenes raigne, had ought to
medle in Church-government, or ſurvey of printing bookes. But this
we may ſpeake, and not ſpeake (as we thinke) vntruly that ſome one
guilfull prieſt, or other, vnwitting to the Queene and State, yea and it
may be vnwitting to the Clergie too, was ſuffered to ſhoufle, and to
ſet the cardes with the ſleight of a falſe finger. For otherwiſe, it could
not poſſibly have come to paſſe, that ſo many chapters of the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall
writings, ſhould be conveyed into the pariſh booke, in ſteed of
ſo many chapters of the true and authenticall ſcriptures, appointed
by K. Edw. booke; eſpecially the ſame chapters, in the pariſh booke,
(as it were of ſet purpoſe) being ordered to be read, when all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are ſolemnly aſſembled, togither vpon feſtivall dayes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore theſe differences betweene theſe bookes being apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
true, and the ſtatute having decreed, that the miniſter ſhalbe bound
to ſay, and vſe the Mattens, Evenſong, &amp;c. in ſuch order and forme, as
is mencioned in the ſame booke of <hi>King Edward,</hi> with ſuch alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and additions, as be mentioned in the act, &amp; none other, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and the pariſhioners not having atteyned and gotten the ſaide
booke, it is a matter that worthily and neceſſarily requireth the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and reſolution of the Kings learned Iudges and Iuſtices:
<q>Whether a Miniſter by the letter of the ſtatute be bound
exactly and preciſely to vſe a booke atteyned and gotten
by the pariſhioners, the ſame booke not being authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the letter of the ſtatute? And if not, then whether
the Miniſter by the letter of the ſtatute, bee to looſe and
forfeite to the King, one yeares profit of all his ſpirituall
benefices and promotions, and his body to ſuffer impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
by the ſpace of ſix monethes, if he ſhall refuſe
to vſe ſome part of a booke not authoriſed. For it ſemeth
(as yet) to vs abſurd, that a Miniſter ſhould bee vrged to
vſe ſuch a booke, as for the vſe whereof, hee hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or that he ſhould be puniſhed for refuſing the
vſe of ſuch a booke, as for the vſe whereof, hee is by the
law puniſhable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:21688:18"/>
But be it graunted, that the very booke authoriſed, and none other
is atteyned and gotten by the pariſhioners for the Miniſter to vſe; then
is it againe a matter carefully to be weighed, and for the ful contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the mindes of all perſons to be reſolved, by the Iudges, what
maner of fact is to be holden and adiudged by the Letter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
to be a breach of the ſtatute, and for the which fact, a Miniſter,
before the Kings Iuſtices, is puniſhable in maner and forme expeeſſed
in the Act.</p>
            <p>For the better reſolution of which queſtion, it ſhall not be amiſſe to
repeate in this place the firſt clauſe of the body of this Statute. For in
the clauſe of the repeale of the ſtatute of Queene Mary, and reviving
the booke of king Edw. it is ſaid; that the laid booke ſhall ſtande and
be in full force and effect, according to the tenor and effect of this
Statute, the tenor and effect of this ſtatute then, is to bee noted, the
wordes whereof are theſe:</p>
            <p>And further be it enacted by the Queenes Highnes,<note place="margin">Note that the Lordes only, &amp; not Lordes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall, are mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Lordes therefore were not of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For by divers ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes when only Lords are mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lordes are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lords excluded.</note> with the aſſent
of the Lords and Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, and
by authoritie of the ſame, that all and ſingular Ministers in any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
or Pariſh church, &amp;c. ſhall from, and after, &amp;c. be bound to ſay
and vſe the Mattens, Even ſong, Celebration of the Lords ſupper, and
administration of each of the Sacramentes, and all their common and
open prayer, in ſuch order and forme, as is mentioned in the ſaid booke
ſo authoriſed by Parliament, in the ſaid fifth &amp; ſixth yeares of the raign
of King Edward the ſixth, with one alteration or addition of certayne
leſſons to be vſed on every Sunday in the yeare, and the forme of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
altered and corrected, and two ſentences only added, in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the Sacrament to the communicantes, and none other or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Out of which clauſe one ſpecial poynt for the better vnderſtanding
of the whole tenor and effect of the ſtatute is to be obſerved: Namely,
that the Parliament hath wholy in this branch omitted, and not once
mencioned the vſe of any rites, or ceremonies, in ſaying and vſing the
Mattens, Evenſong, celebration of the Lords Supper, and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of each of the Sacramentes. So that vnleſſe ſuch rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as be mentioned in the book of <hi>K.</hi> Edw. the ſixth, be reſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
part of the order &amp; forme of ſaying &amp; vſing Mattens, Euenſong,
celebration of the Lords Supper, and adminiſtration of each of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,
&amp;c. it can not bee denied, but that rites and ceremonies
mencioned in that book, are ſecluded out, and not compriſed within
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21688:19"/>
this branch; and therefore not commanded by this branch to be vſed.</p>
            <p>The 2. branch of the body of this ſtatute followeth in theſe words:</p>
            <p>And that if any maner Parſon, Vicare, or other what ſoever mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that ought or ſhould ſing or ſay common prayer mencioned in the
ſaid booke, or minister the Sacramentes, &amp;c. refuſe to vſe the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
prayers, or to minister the Sacramentes, &amp;c. as hee ſhould vſe to
Minister the ſame, in ſuch order and forme, as they be mencioned and
ſet forth in the ſaid booke, or ſhall wilfully ſtanding in the ſame, vſe any
other rite, ceremonie, order, forme or maner of celebrating of the Lordes
Supper, openly or privily, or Mattens, Evenſong, administration of
the Sacramentes, or other open prayers, then is mentioned and ſet foorth
in the ſaid booke, &amp;c. or ſhall preach, declare, or ſpeake any thing in the
derogation or depraving of the ſaid booke, &amp;c. &amp; ſhalbe therof lawfully
convicted, according to the lawes of this Realme, &amp;c. ſhall looſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite
to the Queenes Highnes, &amp;c. for his first offence, the profite of all
his ſpirituall benefices and promotions, comming and ariſing in one whole
yeare next after his conviction. And alſo, that the Parſon ſo convicted,
ſhall for the ſame offence ſuffer impriſonment for the ſpace of ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes,
without bayle or mainpriſe.</p>
            <p>Now by the letter of this branch, it can not be denied, but that foure
ſeverall kindes of offences mencioned in the ſame, by what ſoever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
they ſhalbe committed, are every of them puniſhable alike, by
one and the ſelf ſame maner of peyne, notwithſtanding the offences
ſeeme to be of divers natures. One conſiſting in the refuſall of the vſe
of common prayer; an other in the refuſall of the adminiſtration of
the Sacramentes, in ſuch order and forme, as they be mencioned and
ſet foorth in the ſaid booke. A third vpon a wilfull and obſtinate ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the ſame, in vſing ſome other rite or ceremonie, then is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned
and ſet foorth in the ſaid booke. And a fourth in ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
or depraving the booke, or any part thereof.</p>
            <p>As for the which ſpeaking againſt, or depraving the booke, the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Statute ſeemeth to bee ſo playne, as that no maner ſcruple
can be moved, what the minde &amp; intendement of the Parliament was,
about the ſpeakers againſt, or depravers thereof.</p>
            <p>But touching the offence of a Miniſters refuſing to vſe the ſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>For ſeeing there is no mention at all made of rites and ceremonies,

for the omiſſion of every part, chapter or ſection of the booke.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe queſtions and their reaſons there bee other reaſons to

and for the reſolution of all doubts concerning the maner how to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21688:21"/>
doe, and execute the things conteyned in the booke, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that the parties that ſo doubt, or diverſly take any thing, ſhalre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
to the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, who by his diſcretion ſhall take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for the quieting and appeaſing of the ſame, ſo that the ſame order
be not contrarie to any thing, contained in the ſaid booke. And in the
two laſt clauſes of the preface, it is ſaid, that all Prieſtes and Deacons
ſhall be bound to ſay daylie the morning &amp; evening prayer, either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
or openly, except they be lett by preaching, ſtudying of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

being at home, and not otherwiſe reaſonably lett, ſhall ſay the
ſame in the pariſh Church or Chappell, where hee miniſtreth. From
which places of the preface, (being part of the booke) it is plainly to
be gathered, that the intent and meaning of the Parliament was not to
have the Miniſters to be puniſhed before the Kings Iuſtices, in maner
and forme before expreſſed, for refuſing to vſe all, and ſinguler the
prayers, rites, ceremonies and ſections, in ſuch order &amp; forme as they
be mencioned in the ſaid booke, if either vpon the Miniſters doubts
ryſing in the vſe and practiſe of theſe things, the Biſhop by his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did not take order for the quieting and appeaſing of the ſame; or
if the Miniſter by preaching the word, ſtudying of Divinitie, or by
ſome other vrgent or reaſonable cauſe, were let ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>And if no Miniſter, in any of the caſes before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned, be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
by the Kings Iuſtices in maner and forme aboue expreſſed, then
it is manifeſt by the proviſoes following, that the Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
have no power and authoritie, by vertue of this act, to inquire
and puniſh the default of any miniſter, in theſe caſes, by admonition,
excommunication, ſequeſtration, or deprivation.</p>
               <p>And this not onely by the letter of the laſt proviſoe, ordeyned for
corroboration of the Archbiſhops, Biſhopps, and other Ordinaries
power and authoritie, but alſo by the proviſoe next and immediately

               <p>Provided alwayes, and be it enasted, &amp;c. That all and ſingular
Archbiſhops and Biſhops, &amp;c. ſhall have full power and authoritie, by

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21688:22"/>
ſequestration, or deprivation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If then a Miniſter ſhall not doe, commit, or perpetrate any of the
things above mencioned, and ſo not be puniſhable by the Kings Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,
it followeth that the ſame miniſter is not puniſhable by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this alſo by the next Proviſoe is more playne, by which it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted:
That</hi> What ſoever perſon offending in the premiſes, ſhall for his
offence first receyne puniſhment of the Orainarie, ſhall not for the
ſame offence eſt ſoones be convicted before the lustices; And likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyving
for the ſaid first offence puniſhment by the Iustices, he ſhall not
for the ſame offence eſt ſoones receyve puniſhment of the Ordinarle: <hi>No</hi>
offence then puniſhable before the Iuſtices, no offence puniſhable by
the Ordinarie.</p>
               <p>From all which premiſes it ſeemeth that the Queene, the Lords and
Commons, never intended to impoſe ſuch an exact and preciſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the booke of common prayer vpon the Miniſters, as that in
no place, nor at any tyme, they ſhould omitt the reading, ſaying, or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of a chapter, a prayer, a ſection, a rite or ceremonie, vpon peyne
of impriſonment, &amp;c. before the Queenes Iuſtices, or vppon peyne of
deprivation before the ordinary.</p>
               <p>And therefore the intent of the Parliament, not beeing ſo much to
binde the Miniſter to ſuch an exact and preciſe obſervation, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all orders and formes of prayers, miniſtration of Sacramentes,
vſe of rites and ceremonies, not mentioned and ſet forth in the ſaide
booke, it ſeemeth very vnreaſonable, and much derogatorie to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of that Parliament, that Archbiſhoppes and Biſhoppes,
<hi>who were all ſecluded from that Parliament,</hi>
ſhould by their extentions, conſtructions, and interpretations (as it
were) invert the playne meaning of the Parliament, and that, <hi>ea qua
ſunt destinata in vnum ſinem,</hi> ſhould by them bee converted to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end.</p>
               <p>But now if the Archbiſhops and Biſhops (at the abandoning of the
Popes power out of the Realme) have (as we confeſſe they had) an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
iuriſdiction by the ſtatutes of the Realme, reſerved to their
Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>epiſcopall and Epiſcopall ſeas, ſhall therevpon thinke, that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
by their ordinary iuriſdiction onely (without regard of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
graunted vnto them by the ſtatute) they may proceed <hi>ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:21688:22"/>
to puniſh theſe defaultes, then we pray their Lordſhips to reſolve
vs, by what law, beſides this ſtatute, they may ſo proceed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this booke before 5. and 6. of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and being once dead by the ſtatute of Queene Mary, was but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to life by the Queenes ſtatute of Reviver. Before this ſtatute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was revived, theſe offences were no offences, for where no lawe was,
there could be no offence.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we have ſome reaſon to conceave thus well of the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that they ſhould be more prudent &amp; diſcreete, then to iuſtifie their
criminall proceſſe <hi>ex officio,</hi> by a plenarie power, or a ſoveraigne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
And to ſay, that <hi>ex officio,</hi> by vertue of the popiſh canon Law they
may lawfully proceed to ſuſpenſion, excommunication, or deprivatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of any Miniſter of the Goſpell, for the not obſervation of the booke of
common prayer, we aſſure our ſelves, that ſo to ſay, were to ſay amiſſe,
yea and more then ever they will be able to proove.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the whole forme &amp; order of common ſervice, adminiſtration
of Sacramentes, vſe of rites and ceremonies, as they be mencioned and
ſet forth in the booke of common prayer, by all the groundes &amp; rules
of that popiſh law, is adiudged to be erroneous, ſciſmaticall and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.
And therefore the refuſing to vſe the ſame booke, or any parte
thereof, is ſo farre from being puniſhable by the ſame law, as by the
ſame law, it is a matter worthy of high prayſe, and commendation for
a Miniſter to refuſe to vſe it.</p>
               <p>Againe, what a vaine part were it, for an ordinarie to plead the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
canon law, for the validitie of his proceding <hi>ex officio,</hi> when as the
whole body and every title, chapter and verſicle of the ſame law, at
the petition and ſubmiſſion of the Clergie hath long ſince bene for
ever adnulled, made voide and of no value, by an act of Parliament?
In regard whereof, and in regard alſo, that every ordinaries proceſſe
<hi>ex officio,</hi> may be aſwell iuſtifiable in reſpect of him ſelfe, as aequall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Kings ſubiects, it much every way importeth him, that his
proceedings <hi>ex officio,</hi> be tempered hereafter with better morter, and
grounded vpon a ſurer foundation, then be the maximes &amp; principles
of that law. Namely it behooveth that they bee founded and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
vpon the Kings, either eccleſiaſticall or temporall lawes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
of which ſorte of the Kings lawes we may bouldly and honeſtly
ſay, that the Popiſh and foraine canon law is none: which ſaying alſo
of ours we briefly proove thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:21688:23"/>
The Clergie of the Realme, aſwell for their ſucceſſors, as for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
having (like humble and obedient ſubiects to the King) promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>in verbo ſacerdotij,</hi> that they would, <hi>never from thence forth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to attempt, alleage, claime or put in vre, or enact, promulge or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
any new canons, coſtitutions or ordinances, provinciall or other, &amp;c.</hi>
It was enacted by authoritie of Parliament, according to the ſaid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
and petition of the Clergie, that neither they, nor any of them
from thence forth ſhould preſume to attempt, alleadge, claime or put
in vre any conſtitutions or ordinances Provinciall or Sinodalls, or any
other canons. All canons then (by theſe wordes <hi>or any other canons</hi>)
of what ſort or degree ſoever, whether domeſticall and homebread or
ſtrangbread and foraine canons, before that time made, were once vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
forbidden to be attempted, alleadged, claimed or put in vre, by
which meanes they were once, concerning their practiſe and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with vs adnulled and made void, And therefore ſo many of them,
as at that time were not, or ſince that time have not bene revived and
reauthorized, ought not to be attempted, alleadged, claymed or put in
vre at this day.</p>
               <p>It remaineth then to be diſcuſſed, what canons, conſtitutions, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
Provinciall or Synodall, or what other canons, were at that
time, or have at any time ſithence bene recommanded, &amp; reeſtabliſhed;
vnto which point from the whole ſcope &amp; plaine letter of the ſtatute,
we anſwere, that only ſuch canons, conſtitutions and ordinances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
or Synodall, may be attempted, alleadged, claimed and put in
vre, as were made before that time, by the Clergie within the Realm, &amp;
were not contrariant nor repugnant to the lawes, ſtatuts and cuſtomes
of the Realme, nor to the domage or hurt of the Kings prerogative
Royall. And that therefore all canons, decrees, decretall, ſextes, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentines,
extravagants and all other whatſoever conſtitutions and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
Papall, being ſtrangers and aliens from the common wealth
of England, and not begotten by the Clergie within the Realme, are
forbidden at this day to be attempted, alleadged, claimed or put in vre:
The reaſons of which our anſwere drawne from the letter of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
be theſe:</p>
               <p>The Parliament having enacted, as before is mencioned, did never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
(according to an other branch of the petition of the Clergie)
not only give to the King &amp; 32. perſons, by him to be nominated, &amp;c.
power and authoritie to viewe, ſearch and examine the ſaid conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21688:23"/>
and ordinances Provinciall and Synodall, before that time made
by the Clergie of this Realme; but alſo enacted, that ſuch of them, as
the Kings highnes and the ſaid 32. perſons ſhould deeme &amp; adiudge
worthy to be continued and kept, ſhould be from thence forth kept,
obeyed and executed within this Realme; All canons then made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time, without the realme, being ſecluded by the Parliament,
from the view, ſearch and examination of the King and 32. Perſons,
though he and they had deemed and adiudged the ſaid canons to have
bene continued, kept, and obeyed: yet notwithſtanding the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
ought not to have bene kept, obeyed and executed. For only ſuch
canons, by the King and 32. Perſons, ought to have ben deemed &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged
worthie to be continued &amp; kept; for the continuance and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
wherof, power &amp; authoritie by Parliament was given to the King
and 32. Perſons. But ſuch canons, conſtitutions and ordinances, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
or Sinodall only, and not Papall, were committed, &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Papall being once diſclaymed, and diſauthoriſed by Parliament,
and not againe committed by Parliament, to view, ſearch and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
were never by intendement of Parliament, to bee continewed,
kept and obeyed within this Realme. And this againe moſt pregnant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is confirmed vnto vs by the laſt proviſoe of this act, the wordes
whereof are theſe:</p>
               <p>Provided alſo that ſuch canons, conſtitutions, ordinances, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodalls
Provinciall being already made, which be not contrariant or
repugnant to the lawes, ſtatutes and cuſtomes of the Realme, nor to
the domage or hurt of the Kings prerogative Royall, ſhall now ſtill be
vſed and executed as they were before the making of this act, till ſuch
time as they be viewed, ſearched or otherwiſe ordered and determined
by the ſaid 32. perſons, or the more part of them, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and effect of this act:</p>
               <p>Now by what other words, then by theſe of this proviſoe, could the
Parliament more fully and clearly have expreſſed their mind, that the
ſame, by the tenor and effect of this proviſoe intended for ever wholy
to ſeclude all Papall and foraine canons, from being vſed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within this Realme? For at the petition and ſubmiſſion of the

of them from thencefoorth, ſhould preſume to attempt, alleadge,
clayme, or put in vre any conſtitutions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſubmiſſion of the Clergie, the ſame Parliament having committed to
the view, ſearch; examination and iudgement of the King; and 32.
perſons, ſuch Canons, conſtitutions, and ordinances, or the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
conſtitutions, and ordinances provinciall and Synodall, which
as thertofore had bene made by the Clergie of this Realme: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by this proviſo, the ſame Parliament having enacted, that ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
provinciall, conſtitutions provinciall, ordinances provinciall, &amp;
Synodalls Provinciall (for the word Provinciall by the whole tenor
and effect of this Act, can not in this place but have reference to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of theſe wordes) ſhall ſtill be vſed and executed, &amp;c. till ſuch tyme
as they be viewed, ſearched, or otherwiſe ordered and determined by
the ſaid two &amp; thirtie perſons, &amp;c. Seeing theſe things (I ſay) be thus,
Firſt ſubmitted, then afterwards committed, and laſtly provided, and
not one word, ſillable, or lotter ayming at the continuance, vſe, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
or obedience of the popiſh canon law, it can not bee averred by
any, vnleſſe he be too too conceited, &amp; opiniative, that the Canon law
or any part thereof, made by the Pope without the Realme, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at this day be attempted, alleadged, claymed, or put in vre within
the Realme, by any Iudge Eccleſiaſticall what ſoever: yea and thus
much alſo is confirmed by a ſtatute 37. H. 8. c. 17.</p>
               <p>Howſoever therefore the Kings of England, deryving their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
Lawes from others,<note place="margin">Sir Edward Cooke, de iure reg. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, fol. 9.</note> being proved, approved and allowed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
and with a generall conſent, are rightly and aptly called the Kings
Eccleſiaſticall lawes of Englande in like maner as thoſe lawes which
the Normans borrowed from England, were called the lawes of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,
and as thoſe lawes which the Romans fetching from Athens,
being allowed and approved by that ſtate, were called <hi>Ius ciuile Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manorum,</hi>
howſoever I ſay this be true, nevertheles herevpon it will
not follow that thoſe Eccleſiaſticall lawes thus borrowed and derived
from others, may then any more rightly and aptly be called the Kings
Eccleſiaſticall lawes of Englande, when once by and with a generall
conſent in Parliament, they have bene diſproved and diſallowed; Yea
and when alſo they have bene vtterly adnulled, and commanded never
to be put in execution within the Realme of England: From whence
it ſeemeth to follow, that whatſoever ſubiect ſhall take vpon him, full
and plenarie power to deliver iuſtice in any cauſe to any the Kinges
ſubiects, or to puniſh any crime and offence within the Kings Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
by vertue of thoſe lawes, once by ſo abſolute &amp; high an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21688:24"/>
diſanulled, that the ſame perſon denyeth the Parliament, to have
full power to allow and diſalow lawes in all cauſes, to all the Kinges
ſubiects, and conſequently, that the high Court of Parliament, is not a
compleat Court for the whole and intyre body of the Realme.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, albeit we graunt (as the trueth of the Kings law is) vnto
the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp; other Ordinaries, that lawfully they may
proceede to inquire in their viſitations and Synodes, and els where, to
take accuſations and informations of all and every thing and things
above mencioned, done, committed, and perpetrated within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
of their iuriſdictions and authoritie, and to puniſh the ſame by
admonition, ſuſpenſion, ſequeſtration, or deptivation, though thus
much had never bene provided by the ſtatute: nevertheles we deſire to
be reſolved, whether any miniſter ought to bee puniſhed by theſe, or
any other cenſures and proceſſe, before the ordinarie, for any offence
mencioned in this act, if for the ſame offence the ſame Miniſter, by
vertue of this act, be not puniſhable before the Kings Iuſtices? And
therefore for example ſake, put this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Miniſter for the
not croſſing of a childe vpon the forehead (after baptiſme is fully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred)
be indighted before ſome of the kings Iuſtices, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vpon a traverſe before ſome other of the kings Iuſtices, the
ſame Miniſter be found to have miniſtred the ſame ſacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
in ſuch order and forme, as in the booke is preſcribed. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the omiſſion of this ceremonie, after baptiſme, and that
vpon ſuch a traverſe, the indightment, before the ſaid ſecond Iuſtices,
be found to be vnſufficient in law, and the Miniſter by the ſame Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be adiudged not to be in danger of the penaltie of impriſonment,
&amp;c. becauſe his ſuch not croſſing is no offence againſt the law, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(we ſay) in this caſe, whether the ſame Miniſter, by the Biſhops
of the Dioceſſe, may be ſuſpended, or deprived from his miniſterie, or
from his benefice for the ſame his not croſſing, yea or no.</p>

            <p>IN the whole body of the ſtatute, there is not one ſyllable or letter,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which any ſemblance of reaſon can be deduced, that any
Miniſter of the church, for refuſing to vſe, or for the not vſing of
any ornament appointed by the ſtatute, or by the book to bee in vſe,
ſhould be puniſhed with the peyne of deprivatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what ſoever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
a Miniſter, for the breach of the Statute, may ſuſtayne, by the
kings Iuſtices, the ſame is only to be impoſed for ſuch offences, as are
ſpecified before the laſt proviſoe of the ſtatute. Ornamentes therfore

concerning the Archbiſhops and Biſhops authoritie, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
whereof, a Miniſter, by the premiſes is puniſhable, it followeth
(there being no puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for refuſing the vſe of ornaments in the laſt

before the kings Iuſtices for the refuſing to vſe any ornament, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
much leſſe is there any puniſhment to be inflicted for the refuſall of
the vſe of a Surplice. For the Surplice is ſo farre from being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be worne, as an ornament, in every ſervice of the church, as the
ſame is not ſo much as once particularly mencioned, either in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh

            <p>Nay by the generall wordes, both of the ſtatute and the booke, the

of it ſelfe, in ſome part of the ſervice of the Church. For if with the
ſame in ſome part of the ſervice there be not a Cope provided to bee

whereof, it is neceſſary that we ſet downe the wordes of the Statute, of

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21688:25"/>
Church, and of the Ministers ſhall be retayned and be in vſe as was in
the church of England, by authoritie of Parliament, in the ſecond yeare
of the raigne of King Edward the 6. vntill other order ſhalbe therein ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by authoritie of the Queenes Mateſtie, with the adviſe of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
appointed and authoriſed vnder the great ſeale of England,
for cauſes Eccleſiasticall, or of the Metropolitane of this Realme.
<hi>Thus farre the ſtatute: the wordes of the pariſh booke follow:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be noted, that the Minister at the time of the Communion and
other times in his ministration ſhall vſe ſuch ornamentes in the Church,
as were in vſe by authoritie of Parliament, in the ſecond yeare of King
Edw. the ſixth, according to the act of Parliament, in that caſe enacted
and provided. <hi>The wordes of which booke of the ſecond of</hi> King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>are theſe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the day and at the time appointed, for the ministration of the
holy Communion, the Priest that ſhall execute the holy ministerie, ſhall
put vpon him the vesture appointed for that miniſtration, <hi>that is to ſay,
A white Albe playne, with a veſtiment or cope:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Afterward it is ſaid thus:</hi> Vpon Wenſdayes and Fridayes the Engliſh
Letany ſhalbe ſaid or ſong, &amp;c. And though there he none to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the Priest, yet thoſe dayes (after the Let any ended) the Prieſt
ſhall put vpon him a playne Albe, or Surplice, with a Cope, and ſay all
things at the Altar, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From all which places it is plaine, Firſt, that no Miniſter, at any time
vpon Wenſdayes and Fridayes, after the Letany ended, was bound ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
to weare a ſurplice at the Altare, for it was in his choyſe, to put v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him a playne Albe or Surplice, with a Cope.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that no Prieſt vpon the day and at the time appointed for
the Miniſtration of the holy communion, might put vpon him a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
but only a white Albe playne, with a veſtiment or Cope.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that no Miniſter vpon Wenſdayes and Fridayes, when hee
read the Letany, did weare, or was bound to weare an Albe, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
and Cope. For it had bene in vayne and a thing ridiculouſe for
the booke to have willed the Miniſter, after the Letany ended, to put
vpon him thoſe ornamentes, if in the time of reading the Letany, hee
had had them vpon his backe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that no miniſter at or in any of the times &amp; ſervices afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
is bound to put vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a Surplice, vnleſſe therewithall he weare
a Cope. For the vſe of ornamentes ought to be according to the act of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21688:26"/>
Parliament. And therefore where no Cope, there by the act no Surplice:
where no Altar to goo vnto after the Letany ended, there no Surplice
to be put on after the Letany: where a Communion with a white Albe
plaine, &amp; a veſtiment or Cope, there a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion without a Surplice.</p>
            <p>There is yet one other ſpeciall obſervation before touched, though
for an other purpoſe, worthy to be reiterated in this place againſt the
vſe of the Surplice at the communion, reading the Letany, and ſaying
prayers at the Altar. And that is this: Namely for that as well the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
1. <hi>Eliza.</hi> as the pariſh booke hath revived and commaunded the
vſe of thoſe ornamentes, according to the Act of Parliament, 2. <hi>Edw.</hi>
6. which were repealed and forbidden by the booke of the 5. and 6. of
<hi>King Edward the ſixth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be noted,<note place="margin">The order where mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer, &amp;c. fol. 1.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith the booke of</hi> 5. <hi>and</hi> 6. <hi>of</hi> King Edw. 6. That
the Minister, at the time of the communion, and all other times, in his
ministration ſhall vſe neither Albe, vestiment nor Cope, but being an
Archbiſhop or Biſhop, he ſhall have and weare a Rochet, and being a
Priest or Deacon, he ſhall have and weare a Surplice only.</p>
            <p>And here it is to be noted (ſayeth the pariſh booke) that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
at the time of the communion, and at all other tymes, in his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
ſhall vſe ſuch ornamentes in the church as were in vſe by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of Parliament in the 2. yeare of the reigne of <hi>King Edw. the</hi> 6.
according to the Act of Parliament in that caſe made and provided,
which were as the booke of <hi>K. Edw.</hi> ſaith, an Albe with a veſtiment or
Cope, at the communion, and an Albe or Surplice with a Cope, vpon
Wenſdayes and Fridayes after the Letany ended.</p>
            <p>But by the Provinciall conſtitutions,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> ratified and confirmed by Act
of Parliament, the pariſhioners are enioyned, at their coſtes and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to provide a Surplice, and in vayne were this charge layde vpon
them, if ſo be the Miniſter were not bound by the law to weare it.</p>
            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> and can not be denied, that all pariſhioners are enioyned,
and that every Maſſe-prieſt is bound by the Provincials, the one ſorte,
to provide, the other to weare a Surplice, for and at the celebration of
the Maſſe, and for and in the vſe of other popiſh ſervices. The reaſon
of the vſe of which Surplice, by the popiſh Gloſers and Provincials, is
yeelded to be this;<note place="margin">Lind de ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebra. Miſſae c. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:21688:26"/>
But how doeth it follow, either from the provincall, or reaſon of
the provinciall, that a Miniſter of the Goſpell is bound by the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
to weare a Surplice at the miniſtration of the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Goſpell, when the doctrine and ſervice of the Goſpell is
contrarie and repugnant to the ſervice and doctrine of the Maſſe?</p>
            <p>And when by the ſtatute the Provinciall is not to be vſed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but as it was vſed and executed before the making of the ſtatute,
which was Anno 25. of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, at what time the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Maſſe, called the Sacrament of the Altar, was only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
A Miniſter therefore of the Goſpell, by the Provinciall is no
more bound to weare a ſurplice, then by the Provincials &amp; other lawes
of the Realme, he is bound to ſay a Maſſe: For the Provinciall appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a ſurplice to bee worne at the Maſſe and other idolatrous ſervices,
all which ſervices and which Maſſe (as being blaſphemous to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of our Saviour Chriſt once made vpon the croſſe, &amp; repugnant
to the holy worſhip of God) is abrogated by the lawes of the Realme.</p>
            <p>Now then it were to bee wiſhed that all ſtates were given to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
by what equitie, law or good conſcience grounded vpon the ſaid
ſtatute, bookes or Provincials, ſundry grave, learned and godly Paſtors
and other Miniſters, for ſundry yeares paſſed, have bene deprived, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
or excommunicated from their benefices, dignities, promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and miniſteries, for not vſing the ſurplice?</p>
            <p>If the Archbiſhops, Biſhops and other ordinaries, have heretofore
proceeded lawfully in this caſe, by any other right then ſtatute lawe, it
were greatly to be wiſhed, &amp; a thing tending every way to their honor,
credite and reputation, that the ſame their Iuſtice were made publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowne, to the end all maner perſons and ſtates; might reſt them
ſelves fully ſatisfied and well perſwaded of the integritie of ſuch their
proceedings, as wherof they now ſtand in doubt.</p>
            <p>For our partes we acknowledge, that the Queenes Highnes had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
by the ſtatute with the adviſe of her Commiſſioners, &amp;c. or
Metropolitane, to take other order for ornamentes. But wee never yet
vnderſtood, that any other order was taken accordingly: and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in any ſuch ſorte, as that the Archbiſhops, Biſhops &amp; other Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
might warrant their ſentences of deprivation to be lawfull againſt
the Miniſters, which refuſe to vſe the Surplice. By the Advertiſements
wherevpon (as it ſeemeth) they did principally rely, and by authoritie
whereof they did chiefly proceed, it is apparant that neither the letter,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21688:27"/>
nor intendement of the ſtatute (for the alteration of ornamentes) was
obſerved: And that therefore the commaundement of wearing a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
in ſteed of a white Albe playne, by the advertiſſementes, was not
duely made.</p>
            <p>For though by her Highnes letters it doth appeare, that ſhe was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as the preface to the advertiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts importeth, to have adviſe from
the Metropolitane &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, that ſhe might take order; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
that her Highnes, by her authority, with their adviſe, did take order
&amp; alter the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: this (I ſay) doth no where appeare, no not by the
advertiſements them ſelves. Howſoever then the Metropolitane vpon
the Queenes mandative letters, that ſome orders might be taken, had
conference and communication, and at the laſt, by aſſent, and conſent
of the eccleſiaſticall commiſſioners, did think ſuch orders as were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in the advertiſements, meete and convenient to be vſed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:
nevertheleſſe, all this proveth not that theſe orders were taken
by her Maieſties Authoritie. For the Metropolitane and Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
might thinke, agree and ſubſcribe, that the advertiſementes were
meete and convenient, and yet might theſe advertiſements be never of
any valew, as wherevnto her Highnes authoritie was never yeelded.</p>
            <p>But be it graunted that the Surplice by the Advertiſements,<note place="margin">The Biſhop by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath no authority to deprive a mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſter for not wearing a Surplice.</note> or other
canons, hath bene duely authorized, yet herevpon it can not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that an ordinary by his ordinarie Iuriſdiction, hath power to
deprive a Miniſter from his benefice for not vſing a Surplice. <hi>vbi non
ſertur in contra facientes aliqua poena, conſtitutio eſt imperfecta, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum

the not vſe of a Surplice, how ſhould a Miniſter for the not vſe of a
Surplice, ſuffer the loſſe of his benefice, which is one of the greateſt
peynes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herevnto happily it wilbe anſwered,</hi>

            <p>Touching which anſweres it may brieflie be replyed, that the peyne
ſpoken of in the civil law, is generally vnderſtoode of a pecuniarie
peyne, to be aſſeſſed and applied to the ſilke; or more ſpecially, it may
be vnderſtood, that among many corporall peynes, the Iudge arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21688:27"/>
may chooſe which ſhall ſeeme to him moſt modicinable. Now,
theſe kinde of peynes, it is manifeſt, that neither of them by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
Iuriſdiction eccleſiaſticall, in the church of England, can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for contempt.</p>
            <p>And as for that which to the ſame effect may bee alleadged,<note place="margin">Foraine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſhed, 25.</note> out of
the forein canoniſtes or forein canon law, thus ſtandeth the caſe: The
whole plott &amp; frame of the building of the canon law (as before hath
bene proved) is cleane ruinated and waſted.<note place="margin">H 8. c. 19.</note> From whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that all the poſts, ſommers, walles, plates, rafters, and roofe of that
pallace,<note place="margin">A Biſhop by the forrain canon lawe, hath no iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</note> with all the yron, leaden and wooden implementes, and vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilles
thereof, be all likewiſe rotten and naught, elſe but droſſe &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
And ſo from the Nullitie thereof, it is to be inferred, that an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
can not defend or practiſe his ordinarie Iuriſdiction by that
law, againſt any of the Kings ſubiectes. For all ſtrange and forein law,
is both a ſtrange power, and a forein traytor to the Kings crowne, and
for that cauſe, can not be pleaded in any of the kinges eccleſiaſticall
courtes, without being in danger of looſing her head.</p>
            <p>Howſoever then this rule,<note place="margin">An ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the Kings eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical law cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an arbi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie peyne for not wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice.</note> in the romiſh conſiſtories, by the Romiſh
law, be true that an Ordinarie for inobedience or contempt, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
an arbitrary peyne, where a ſtatute or conſtitution hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no peyne: yet becauſe this rule is an irregular enimy to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the kings Crowne, it ſeemeth that the kings ſubiect is wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
whenſoever an eccleſiaſticall ordinary, for contempt, ſhal impoſe
arbitrarily, any peyne, for the which peyne he hath not expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the kings eccleſiaſticall law.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if the Romiſh canon law, were the Kings eccleſiaſticall law,
yet doth not the former exception prove, that a Parſon or Vicare, may
be deprived from his benefice, by the ordinaries iuriſdiction, for the
not vſe of a ſurplice; only the ſaid exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affordeth thus much: <hi>viz.</hi>
that if an ordinarie iudicially and canonically (as they call it) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſanctions, not of the Engliſh, but of the Romiſh church,
have admoniſhed a Miniſter to weare a ſurplice, the exception (I ſay)
affordeth in this caſe thus much, that his ordinary for contempt may
impoſe an arbitrary peyne, if ſo be nether by common right, nor by
conſtitutiue law, there be an ordinarie peyne impoſed. But now ſo it is,
that this caſe falleth not out to be within the compaſſe of the peyne of
deprivation, for not wearing a ſurplice. For it is contempt only, and
not the not wearing of a ſurplice, that arbitrarily may bee puniſhed in
this caſe:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:21688:28"/>
Why then though an ordinary be not able by the Kings Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
lawes,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> to drawe in a Miniſters deprivation, principally and by the
head, for not wearing a ſurplice, yet it ſeemeth that he may drawe in
the ſame conſequently, &amp; as it were by the tayle; namely, by chardg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with wilfull periury or obſtinat contempt; for the which
cauſes he may iuſtly be deprived.</p>
            <p>Nay,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> ſoft good Sir, your concluſion is without premiſſes. For who
ever graunted that the Romiſh canon lawe was the Kings eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
law? howſoever then, from part of mine anſwere made to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
of contempt, you might gather that by the Romiſh canon
lawe, the deprivation of a Parſon or Vicare, for contempt, may bee
drawne in by the tayle, though not by the head; nevertheles we ſtil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that any Parſons or Vicares deprivation, directly or indirectly by
the head, or by the tayle, either for contempt or periury, pretended to
be committed for inobedience to canonicall admonition, can iuſtly
be inflicted by the kings Eccleſiaſticall lawes.</p>
            <p>Firſt wee affirme (as earſt hath bene ſaid) that aſwell the branch as
the budd, the tayle as the head of the Romiſh canon law is cleane cutt
of from the body of the kings eccleſiaſticall law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the oath of canonicall obedience, exacted by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
from the Parſon or Vicare, hath ever bene exacted hetherto,
onely by vertue of the foraine canon lawe, and not ſo farre (as we can
learne) by any the kings eccleſiaſticall lawes.</p>
            <p>And therefore periury againſt a Parſon or Vicare, for refuſing to
weare a ſurplice at his ordinaries command (by the kings eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
lawes) can not be obiected; For where there is no lawfull oath
taken, there no lawfull puniſhment for the breach of the ſame oath
can be inflicted, by meanes whereof, one halfe of the tayle before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, is diſiointed.</p>
            <p>And as for the other halfe, <hi>viz.</hi> that for contempt of the ordinaries
iuriſdiction, a Parſon or Vicar (having promiſed reverently to obey his
Ordinary, and other chief Miniſters vnto whom the governement and
charge is committed over him; Following with a glad minde and will
their godly admonition, and ſubmitting them ſelves to their godlie
iudgementes) that a Parſon or Vicar, I ſay, may lawfully for contempt
be deprived from his benefice, if he refuſe to put vpon him a Surplice
at his Ordinaries admonition, and vpon his Ordinaries iudgment, this
might have ſome colour, if the Ordinaries admonition and iudgment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21688:28"/>
by the holy ſcriptures, could be proved to be a godly admonition, and
a godly iudgement: or if the former rule were a rule aſwell drawne
from the Kings eccleſiaſticall law, as from the forain canon law; or if
there were no certeyne peyne by the Kings eccleſiaſticall law appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for contempt: or that among divers certeyne peynes, deprivation
were one. But ſeeing the ſame rule is none of the Kings eccleſiaſticall
rules, and that admonition, ſuſpenſion and excommunication, &amp; not
deprivation by the Kings eccleſiaſticall lawes, be certeyne and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
peynes, to be inflicted for contempt, it followeth by the Kings ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
laws, that an Ordinarie may not arbitrarily, at his pleaſure,
for ſuch contempt, inflict the peyne of deprivation.</p>
            <p>Nay, were it true that the Romiſh and forein canon law, touching
this point of puniſhment by deprivation for contempt, were in force
within the Realme of England, yet we affirme, even by the ſame law,
that a Parſon or Vicare, for the not wearing of a Surplice, in divine
worſhip, at his Ordinaries commaundement, is no more by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
to be deprived from his benefice, having a reaſonable cauſe to
refuſe the wearing of a Surplice, then is a Biſhop to be deprived by an
Archbiſhop from his Biſhopricke, for not putting in execution ſome
of his provinciall Decrees; when as the ſame Biſhop hath any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
impediment, not to execute the ſame decree. For this Rule, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus

of <hi>Chichester,</hi> commanded by the Archbiſhops grace of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
to proceed to the deprivation of M. <hi>N.</hi> Vicare of <hi>P.</hi> in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> for his not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity in wearing a ſurplice, ſhould
notwithſtanding his commandement, ſpare the ſaid Vicare his depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and being convented before his Metropolitane to anſwere this
contempt, ſhould for his excuſe alleadge that he had received letters of
ſpeciall grace, in behalf of the ſaid Vicare from the Kings Maieſtie, by
which he was required to reſpite the ſaid Vicare, and to aſſigne him a
longer day. Suppoſe this (I ſay) for examples ſake to be true, I demand
in this caſe, whether the Kings letters directed to the Biſhop, were not
a reaſonable impediment and iuſt cauſe, to ſave the Biſhop from the
penalty of contempt, (which by the canon lawe, is the loſſe of his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick)
for the not execution of the Archbiſhops provinciall Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.
If all the Advocates of the Archbiſhops conſiſtories, muſt needs
grant that his Highnes letters were a iuſt excuſe to exempt the Biſhop
from the penalty of contempt, how much more iuſtly and reaſonably
may thoſe Advocats conclude, that the ſame Vicare was to be excuſed
from contempt, againſt the Biſhops admonition, when for his defence
he alleadged, and was ready by his oath to have avowed the teſtimony
of his owne conſcience, rightly (as he was perſwaded) grounded vpon
the holy commandement of the moſt high God, that he durſt not for
feare of wounding his owne conſcience, and diſpleaſing God, to weare
the ſurplice in any part of Divine worſhip? For if the requeſt of an
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21688:29"/>
earthly king ſuperior to an Archb. be a reaſonable excuſe, to ſave a BB.
from contempt againſt an Archb. How much more ought the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and precept of an heavenly king, be a iuſt and reaſonable impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to ſave a miniſter, from contempt againſt a Biſhops admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</p>
            <p>Vnleſſe then a Biſhop will avow and be able out of holy writ, to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
that a Miniſters conſcience (eſpecially a Miniſters conſcience,
who walketh (as <hi>Zakarias</hi> did) in all the commandements and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the Lord without reproofe,<note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> can not be any iuſt or reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
excuſe or impediment, why he ought not, or may not, or will not
in Divine worſhip weare a ſurplice, being thervnto admoniſhed by his
ordinary, vnles (I ſay) the Biſhop out of holy writ be able fully to prove
that ſuch a Miniſters conſcience is no iuſt or reaſonable cauſe to ſtay
him from wearing a ſurplice in Divine worſhip, in this caſe I ſay, that
even by the Romiſh canon law it ſelf, there can no contempt be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vpon ſuch a Miniſter, for not obeying his ordinaries, firſt, ſecond
&amp; third admonitions; the reaſons whereof, even out of the ſame canon
law have bene alleadged before in the firſt parte of theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations.</p>
            <p>But to leave the foraine canon law, and all the rules thereof, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no branches of the Eccleſiaſticall lawes of England, let it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that before the ſtatute of 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19. ſome canon or conſtitution
Synodall or Provinciall, had bene made, or ſince have bene made, by
the Clergie of the Realme, in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vocation aſſembled by the Kings
writ, that a Parſon or Vicare, for periurie or contempt eccleſiaſticall,
ſhould bee deprived of his benefice; nevertheleſſe it ſeemeth that the
ſame is a voide canon, and a void conſtitution: Becauſe it is contrary
or repugnant to the lawes and cuſtomes of the Realme: By which
lawes and cuſtomes no free man of the Realme, can be diſpoſſeſſed, of
his franck tenement, for contempt or periury in any of the kings tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Courts. All Parſons and Vicars then canonically inſtituted &amp;
inducted, being not ſubiects at this day to any forain power, but being
freemen of the Realme, in as large and ample maner as any Layickes,
the Kings other ſubiects be, it ſeemeth that a Parſon &amp; Vicare (by the
lawes and cuſtomes of the Realme) being a Freehoulder, ſhould for
none other cauſe looſe his Freehould, then for the which like cauſe, a
Layicke may looſe his.</p>
            <p>Yea and becauſe no Layicke by the laws &amp; cuſtomes of the Realme,
may bee put from his Freehould for contempt, no though the ſame
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt be committed againſt the kings Proclamation, or any decree
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21688:30"/>
made in his high Courte of Chancerie: by ſo much the more vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
it ſeemeth to be, that a Parſon or Vicare for contempt againſt
his ordinaries admonition, ſhould bee deprived from his benefice, by
how much a contempt againſt the Kings commaundement, is more
heinous then is a contempt againſt the ordinaries admonition.</p>
            <p>You miſtake the caſes,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> &amp; as it ſeemeth, you vnderſtand not the law.
The Freehold of a layick, and the Freehold of an eccleſiaſticall perſon
be not of one nature. The former belongeth vnto him by a title inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in his perſon, but the latter apperteyneth vnto a Church-man, in
the right of his Church: If then the Churchman be diſplaced from his
Church, it followeth by a neceſſary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, that he muſt likewiſe
be diſcharged from his freehold. For he, being in the eye of the law
dead vnto his Church, can no more enioy the freehold which he held
in the right of his Church, then can a dead Layick any longer holde a
Franktenement, in right of his perſon. And for your better ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
herein, I would have you to conſider, that the like courſe of Iuſtice
is kept and miniſtred againſt certeine officers in the common weale:
which officers, ſo ſoone as for any iuſt cauſe they ſhall be put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
offices, doe withall and forthwith looſe ſuch their freeholdes, as ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with their offices, and in regard of their offices they held.</p>
            <p>The Maiſter of the Rolles and Warden of the Fleete, having their
offices graunted for terme of life, though other of them by the ſame
graunt be ſeiſed of a freehold, the one of the houſe called the Rolles,
the other of the houſe called the Fleete: nevertheles if the firſt bee put
from his Maſterſhip, and the ſecond from his Wardenſhip, neither can
the one, nor the other, by the law and iuſtice of the Realme, reteyne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe houſes, as his Freehold; For as the houſes were iointly
with their offices, &amp; in reſpect of their offices granted. So their offices
being once taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they muſt withal by neceſſary conſequence
forgo thoſe their houſes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> for the time they held as their freeholds.</p>
            <p>Well: if this be all that may gayneſay our poſition, then be not our
caſes miſtaken, neither yet have we ſo ignorantly vrged &amp; applied the
law and free cuſtomes of the Realme, as you would beare vs in hande.
For though we grant, whatſoever you have excepted, to be true, yet can
not the ſame be a barre againſt our pleading.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> For wee have hetherto
pleaded no more in effect, but thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Parſon or Vicar during
his miniſteriall function, being in the eye of the law, no dead but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perſon, and a free man of the Realme, ought no more, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
vnto his Ordinaries admonition, by any law of he Realme bee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21688:30"/>
diſpoſſeſſed from the freehold, which in right of his function he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth,
then can a Layicke for contempt vnto the Kings commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be diſſeiſed of his.</p>
            <p>And what if the Freeholdes of a Layick, &amp; of an eccleſiaſtical perſon,
be (as you ſay they be) diverſly poſſeſſed, the one by right of church,
the other by right of perſon, what doeth this (I ſay) impugne our ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that no Freeholder for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of the Kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment may be
puniſhed with loſſe of his freehold, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great Charter of England
telleth vs, that a freema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall not be amerced for a ſmall fault, but after
the quantity of the fault. And for a great fault, after the maner therof,
ſaving to him his contenement or freehold. If then vnto every freema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
puniſhable by the law, though his fault be great, his Contenement or
Freehold ought to be reſerved; it ſeemeth much more reaſonable to
follow, that no Churchman, being a freeman of the Realme, may for
contempt be puniſhed, with loſſe of his Contenement or Freehold.</p>
            <p>And that you may conſider (againſt our next conference) more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of this matter, let me put this caſe vnto you <hi>viz.</hi> That a Churchman
and a temporall perſon, both freemen of the Realme; for one and the
ſelfe ſame contempt againſt the king, were puniſhable by the great
Lordes in the ſtarre chamber, or in any other Court, by other of the
Kings Iuſtices; would our lawes &amp; freecuſtomes of the Realme (think
you) iuſtifie, that the ſpirituall perſon, enioyning ſtill his ſpiritual fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
might in this caſe be mulcted with the loſſe of his benefice, and
yet the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral perſon not to be puniſhable by the loſſe of his freehold?</p>
            <p>The examples produced by you, relieve no whit at all your caſe, nay
rather they ſtand on our ſide, and make good our part. For how long
ſoever the Maiſter of the <hi>Rolles</hi> and Warden of the Fleete, doe enioy
their offices, for ſo long time, by your owne collection, they ought to
enioy their Freeholdes, annexed to their offices; yea and you aſſume in
effect, that they may not lawfully for contempt, or any other cauſe, be
diſſeiſed of their freeholds, ſo long as they be poſſeſſed of their offices.</p>
            <p>Now then, if from the identity of reaſon you would conclude, that a
Parſon or Vicare for contempt lawfully depoſed from his miniſteriall
function, ſhould in like maner lawfully looſe his freehold, annexed to
his office, as the Maiſter of the Rolles, and Warden of the Fleete, put
from their offices, ſhould looſe theirs, we would not much have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
your aſſertion. For we hold it vnreaſonable that a Parſon or Vicar
depoſed from his miniſteriall function, ſhould enioy that freehold or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21688:31"/>
maintenance which is provided for him that muſt ſucceed in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
charge. But then your aſſertion would make nothing againſt
vs. For ſo you muſt prove that your officers for contempt only, may
lawfully be put from their freeholds annexed to their offices, and yet
notwithſtanding remaine the ſame officers ſtill.</p>
            <p>And then indeed; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome parity or ſemblance of reaſon, you might
have inferred, that a Parſon or Vicare for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt deprived of his free
hold, annexed to his function, might notwithſtanding ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt,
enioy his miniſteriall function ſtill. But to diſpute after this ſort, were
idlely to diſpute, &amp; not to diſpute <hi>ad idem.</hi> For how doth this follow?
<q>The Kings officer, if for contempt he be displaced from his office can
not withall but be displaced from his freehold, which ioyntly with
his office, and in regard of his office, he poſſeſſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therfore a Parſon or Vicare for contempt, may lawfully be deprived
from his benefice or freehold annexed to his ministeriall function,
and yet notwithſtanding enioy his ministeriall function ſtill.</hi> And
this is the maine point &amp; generall caſe (for the moſt part) of all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
which at this day for contempt, ſtand deprived. For among all
the ſentences pronounced for contempt, there is ſcarce one to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
which depoſeth a Parſon or Vicare from his miniſterial office, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
which depriveth him from his Church, Parſonadge, or Vicaradge.
Whereby the vnreaſonablenes of certeine ordinaries, in their proceſſe
of deprivatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, become ſo much the more vnreaſonable, by how much
more vnreaſonable it ſeemeth to be, that any publicke officer ſhould
lawfully be continued in his publicke office, and yet not be ſuffered to
enioy any publick meanes, to mainteine the ſame his office.</p>
            <p>And thus much have we replied vnto your anſwere, made vnto our
pleadings, that by the lawes and freecuſtomes of the Realme, a Parſon
or Vicar, being a freeman of the Realme, may not for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt vnto his
ordinaries admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be deprived from his freehold, if ſo be you grant
that he may enioy his miniſterial function ſtill. As touching the lawes
of the church, it hath ben already ſufficiently demonſtrated, that there
is then no contempt at all committed againſt an admonition, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
partie admoniſhed can alleadge any iuſt or reaſonable cauſe of his not
yeelding to his admoniſher. And if no contempt in ſuch caſe be made,
then no deprivatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from a benefice, or depoſition from the miniſterie,
in ſuch caſe ought to follow.</p>

authoritie, no not by his ſupreame power, to alter their ſayd governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all. And to this end and purpoſe (as it ſeemeth) in their late
canons have they deviſed and decreed, this booke of ordination, to be
ſubſcribed vnto. Which ſubſcription can not but quite and cleane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
the Kings ſupremacie and auncient iuriſdiction, in the moſt
dangerous degree. For if their Provinciall and Dioceſan orders and
degrees of Miniſterie, together with their iuriſdiction, be to bee vſed,
(as eſtabliſhed and derived vnto them by the holy ſcriptures) how then
can it be in the power and iuriſdiction of the King, to graunt, or not
to graunt the vſe of Provinciall and Dioceſan Biſhopiſme and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction?
Or how may the provinciall Biſhops, with their Dioceſan

perſon, whole Nobilitie and Realme, is ſubiect and lyable to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the canon Law, excommunication? Which law the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

and confirmation, the very eſſence and being of a Provinciall, &amp; Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan
Biſhop with vs, So that theſe offices ought to be held only, from
the authoritie, gift and graunt of the King: how ought not the kings
nomination, preſentation, authoritie and gift, yea and the law it ſelf, in
this caſe wholy ceaſe, if the order, degree, miniſterie and iuriſdiction of
a provinciall and dioceſan Biſhop be founded in holy Scripture? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we ſhall affirme, that, that was in the Apoſtles times, which was
not, or that, that is to be found in holy Scripture, which is not? Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that there were in the Apoſtles times, and that there be in the holy
Scriptures, no Biſhops but provinciall and dioceaſan Biſhops to bee
found? And that by the law of God and the Goſpell, every King and
Potentate, hath ſupreme power to ſuffer none but Provinciall &amp; Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan
Biſhops to be in the Churches.</p>
            <p>So that by ſubſcription to allow, that provinciall and Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
be Scripturely Biſhops, and that their iuriſdiction and power, is
a Scripturely iuriſdiction and power, is to deny that their iuriſdiction
and power, dependeth vpon the kings iuriſdiction and power, or that
by the kings gift and authoritie they be made Biſhops.</p>
            <p>But how doeth ſubſcription (you will ſay) to the booke of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
approve the orders and degrees of provinciall &amp; dioceſan Biſhops,
to be by Divine right, rather then by humane ordinance? How? Why
thus: it is evident (ſaith the preface of that booke) to all men diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reading holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles
times, there have bene theſe orders of Miniſters in Chriſtes Church,
Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons. Yea and by the whole order of prayer,
and of Scripture read, &amp; vſed in the forme of conſecrating of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
or Biſhop, it is apparant that the order of an Archbiſhop or
Biſhop, conſecrated by that booke, is reputed &amp; taken to be of Divine
inſtitution. And therfore ſeing the names of thoſe orders of Miniſters,
muſt neceſſarily be taken and vnderſtood of ſuch orders of Miniſters,
as be ſett forth and deſcribed in the body of that booke, it muſt needes
be intended, that the Miniſters by their ſubſcription, ſhould approve
the orders of Miniſters, mencioned in that booke, to be of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and conſequently, that provinciall and dioceſan Miniſters or
Biſhops, have not their eſſence and being from the nomination, gift &amp;
authoritie of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:21688:33"/>
Beſides, if we ſhould vnderſtand by the word (Biſhop) him that hath
the Miniſtrie of the word and Sacraments, as the Paſtor &amp; teacher; and
by the word (Prieſt) the Preſbiter, that is the Governing elder; and by
the word (Deacon) the provider for the poore, then for the Miniſters
to ſubſcribe to the booke of ordination, would no way iuſtifie thoſe
officers or degrees of Miniſters, which are deſcribed in that booke, but
would indeed vtterly ſubvert and overthrow them. Becauſe the orders
and degrees of a provincial &amp; dioceſan Biſhop, of a Prieſt and Deacon
mentioned in that booke, be of a farr differing nature from thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and degrees of Miniſters, which are mencioned in the Scriptures:
becauſe they only agree in name, and not in nature.</p>
            <p>Wherfore ſeeing there be other orders and degrees of Biſhops then
Provincial &amp; Dioceſan Biſhops found in the holy Scriptures, &amp; ſeeing
alſo Kings and Princes being <hi>Vicarij Dei,</hi> be commanded to authoriſe
all things for the trueth; and nothing againſt the trueth: it ſeemeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
that his Maieſtie ſhould not only reſtrayne the Provinciall and
Dioceſan Biſhops, from vrging ſubſcription to this booke of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(being ſo derogatory (in their ſence and conſtruction) to his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
as nothing can be more,) but alſo to keepe the Biſhops them
ſelves within the tether and compaſſe of the word of God. For if the
word of God, doe approve amongſt the Miniſters of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
a primacie of order only, &amp; denyeth vnto them any prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of iuriſdiction and power in eccleſiaſticall governement, (as the
learned Proteſtants have proved againſt the Papiſts touching <hi>Peters</hi>
ſupremacie) then will it follow that ours alſo ought to bee reduced to
the ſame compaſſe, both for the Kings Maieſties ſafetie, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
good. Leaſt Princes giving them more then God alloweth them,
they ſhoud them ſelves looſe that right and authoritie, which they
ought to reteyne in their owne Royall perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now that it may not be obiected that we begge the queſtion of
Scripturely Biſhops, not having any primacie of iuriſdiction &amp; power
in eccleſiaſticall government, (to let paſſe all particuler reaſons of the

that any Biſhop of Rome, or elſwhere, ſhould preſume, vſurpe, or take

               <note place="margin">fol. 59. 60.</note> 
               <hi>and in the end conclude, and give vp their verdict thus.</hi> For
confirmation whereof, it is out of all doubt, that there is no mencion
made, neither in ſcripture, neither in the writings of any authenticall
Doctour or Authour of the Church being within the tyme of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:
That Chriſt did ever make, or inſtitute any diſtinction or difference
to be in the preeminence of power, order, or iuriſdiction betweene the
Apoſties them ſelves, or betweene the Biſhops them ſelves; but that
they were all aequall in power, order, authoritie and iuriſdiction. And
that there is now, and ſith the tyme of the Apoſtles, any ſuch diver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tie or
difference among the Biſhops, it was deviſed by the ancient Fathers, &amp;c.
For the ſaid Fathers conſidering the great and infinite multitude of
Chriſtian men, and taking examples of the ould Teſtament, thought it
expedient to make an order of degrees, to be among Biſhops and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
governours of the Church; and ſo ordeyned ſome to be Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riarkes,
ſome to be Primates, ſome to be Metropolitanes, ſome to be Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhops,
ſome to be Biſhops, &amp;c. Which differences the ſaid holy Fathers
thought neceſſarie to enact and eſtabliſh, by their Decrees and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
not for that any ſuch differences were preſcribed and eſtabliſhed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21688:34"/>
in the Goſpell, or mencioned in any Canonicall writings of the Apoſtles,
or teſtified by any eccleſiaſticall Writer within the Apoſtles tyme. And
thus farre their verdict.</p>
            <p>But let vs graunt, that orders of Biſhops, Prieſtes and Deacons bee
conteyned in the holy ſcriptures, yet if thoſe orders of Biſhops, Prieſts
and Deacons which are eſtabliſhed in the booke, be not the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Biſhops, Prieſtes &amp; Deacons, which are authoriſed by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
then (through the aequivocation of theſe wordes; <hi>Orders of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Prieſtes and Deacons</hi>) there being <hi>afalacie:</hi> how ſhould this
forme and maner of ſubſcription be lawfull? <hi>viz.</hi> that the booke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth
nothing contrarie to the word of God, &amp; that it lawfully may
be vſed? For only ſuch orders of Biſhops, Prieſtes and Deacons, ought
to be acknowledged, ſubſcribed vnto, &amp; vſed, as by the holy ſcriptures
are warranted. And therefore ſuch as are conteyned in the booke, if ſo
be they be divers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which are approved in the holy ſcriptures,
how ſhould they without ſinne be ſubſcribed vnto, and vſed? Vnleſſe
we ſhall affirme, that Miniſters of the Goſpell of God, may rightfully
approove of ſuch orders of Miniſters, as the Lord and Law giver of the
Goſpell never allowed ne approoved.</p>
            <p>And thus much have we ſpoken touching not ſubſcription, touching
the not exact vſe of the order and forme of the booke of common
prayer, and touchinge the not preciſe practiſe and wearing of the
rites, ceremonies and ornaments of the church.</p>
            <p>Wherein if we have ſpoken otherwiſe then as for our ſpeaking wee
have warrant from the Kings lawes, our earneſt deſire is that it may be
ſhewed vnto vs wherein we haue erred. For if there be any thing
whereof we be ignorant, we ſhalbe willing to be taught the ſame, and
having learned it, to yeald to the practiſe thereof.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, ſeing not to weare a Surplice in the miniſtration
of Divine ſervice, not to make a croſſe in Baptiſme, &amp; not to ſubſcribe,
&amp;c. in it ſelfe, is not a ſinne againſt any commandement of God, nor a
thing ſcandalous vnto the people: And ſeeing alſo the Parſons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to weare and vſe the ſame, be in every reſpect men of good note,
condition, fame, qualitie and behaviour, yea &amp; ſuch as againſt whom,
no miſdemeanor for doctrine or life, which might aggravate their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
can iuſtly be obiected, we may lawfully (as we thinke) conclude
in their behalf, that <hi>de aequitate &amp; miſericordia iuris,</hi> they ought to be
reſpected and tolerated, rather then for their refuſall meerely ſtanding
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21688:35"/>
vpon their conſciences (whether erroneous or not erroneous, it ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not) <hi>de rigore iuris,</hi> (if there be any ſuch rigour) to be ſuſpended,
excommunicated or deprived, yea and in ſo generall and doubtfull a
caſe of conſcience, vpon ſo ſlender a ground of periury or contempt,
vpon perſons every way ſo peaceable &amp; well qualified, and wherein no
ſcandall hath enſued, we ſuppoſe it can not bee ſhewed among all the
decrees and ſentences recorded, among all the Popiſh canoniſts, that
ever any Popiſh ordinaries, in any age have vſed the like iudiciall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
againſt any their Popiſh Prieſts.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted, that the foraine canon Law, is none otherwiſe in
any part of this Treatiſe intended to be the Kings Eccleſiaſticall law,
then only vpon a falſe ſuppoſition of the Archbiſhops and Biſhops:
Becauſe the ſame law is yet vſed &amp; practiſed in their Conſiſtories, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
it hath bene long ſince aboliſhed by Act of Parliament.</p>
