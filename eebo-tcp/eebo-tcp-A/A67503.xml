         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE may observe the Happiness

this Life, are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
owing to the Vigilent and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious,
or the careless and ungovern'd
Actions of our Youth; and as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
lays a probable Foundation, upon
which (by a continued Care) we may
build our succeeding Fortunes to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
height, so the latter robs us of
that Substance upon which we ought
(for our Security) to place the Pedestal
of our future Prosperity: And as there

is nothing tends more to the Destruction
of Youth, or renders them more inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

than the Conversation of <hi>Intrieguing

than present you with a small Pocket-piece,
which shall serve as Armour to

Fathers to your Children, Enemies to
your Countrey, and Slaves to others, as
well as to your own Vices. There is
nothing more evident, than that several
Young Men in this City of <hi>London</hi> have
been drawn aside, to their Ruin, by the
attractive Sorcery of these bewitching
<pb facs="tcp:35327:4"/>
               <hi>Load-stones,</hi> which having been observ'd
of late by the Right Honourable the
<hi>Mayors,</hi> and other the <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>
that they have been so commendably In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
in suppressing this Vice, within
the Bounds of their Jurisdiction, that
it is a hard matter for a <hi>Night-walking
Strumpet</hi> to strole through the City un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd.
The <hi>Magistrates</hi> have done
their Parts, and nothing is requir'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(for the more effectual Promotion
of the City's Glory) but your Care to
avoid the Lust and Subtilty of those

false Pretence to Modesty, gives them
Covert in reputable Families, where they
heard with the Vertuous, declaim against
the Vices of the Age, and seem to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

themselves do practice daily, to maintain
their Pride.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Study of Designing Women in
all Ages having been to Improve,
and set off <hi>Nature</hi> with such <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Charms, alluring Dresses,</hi> and <hi>resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Glances,</hi> that most of our <hi>Youth,</hi> before
they have shifted of the tender years of their
<hi>Infancy,</hi> are subdued by their Pollitick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements,
to their <hi>Ruinous Embraces,</hi>
which are frequently succeeded by irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Injuries,</hi> either to <hi>Estate</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi> if
not <hi>Both,</hi> except withdrawn Timely, (by
<hi>Prudence</hi>) from this <hi>Epidemical Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have therefore thought it necessary, to
present the <hi>Age</hi> (in this following <hi>Treatise</hi>)
with a fair Prospect of the Dangers that
wait on the <hi>Conversation</hi> of <hi>Intreiguing
Women:</hi> With a <hi>Scheme</hi> of their <hi>Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:35327:6"/>
Subtile Stratagems</hi> and <hi>Devices,</hi>
by which they oft Trepan <hi>Unwary Youth,</hi>
into a State of <hi>Misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not only (in brief Sentences) laid
open the <hi>studied Policies,</hi> and <hi>cunning
Delusions</hi> of the <hi>Female Sex,</hi> but have
given such <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Prudence,</hi> that shall
Arm you against their <hi>Subtilties,</hi> and teach
you to act <hi>Counter</hi> to all their <hi>Designs,</hi>
though laid and carried on with the greatest
<hi>Cunning</hi> and <hi>Industry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Vertue</hi> is better understood by <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
than <hi>Precept,</hi> so the knowledge of
<hi>Vice</hi> is better gain'd by <hi>Precept</hi> than <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;</hi>
and as all things are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Contraries, so it is necessary to
be acquainted with the latter, to compare
it as a Foyl, to set off the true Lustre and
Beauty of the former.</p>
            <p>In the Performance of my Task, I have
been as Compendious as possible; so that I
hope I shall neither offend the <hi>Judgment,</hi>
or Trespass much upon the <hi>Patience</hi> of the
<hi>Reader,</hi> but rather furnish him with such
<hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Maxims,</hi> (against <hi>Designing
<pb facs="tcp:35327:6"/>
Women</hi>) that shall be delightful to <hi>Read,</hi>
easie to <hi>Remember,</hi> and very proper to
<hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are few Persons, who have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from a Plentiful Fortune, into a State
of Necessity, but the World may observe,
<hi>Women</hi> have always had the greatest share
in their <hi>Ruin;</hi> Therefore, to be fortified
against <hi>Female Policy,</hi> is a matter of no
small Moment; and he that is without these
<hi>Prudentials,</hi> is not a day secure of either
his <hi>Estate</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi> from the <hi>Gripes</hi> of a
<hi>Female Vulture,</hi> but is lyable to be Trick'd
into such Labyrinths of <hi>Misfortune,</hi> where
you will find no Clue to return by to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I entreat of the <hi>Youthful
Reader,</hi> is, to peruse it without Prejudice,
and make it useful to himself, and I will
engage, he may at Eighteen or Twenty
Years of Age, evade the <hi>Designs,</hi> resist
the <hi>Temptations,</hi> and withstand the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>
of those <hi>Crafty Witches,</hi> better than
most Men (without it) shall be able to do
at <hi>Forty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35327:7"/>I do not intend any affront to the <hi>Chast</hi>
or <hi>Vertuous,</hi> nor would I have them offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at my Vndertaking, for may Design is
rather to raise them to such an Esteem, that

but such <hi>Women,</hi> whose affection to
<hi>Vertue,</hi> and resolutions against <hi>Vice,</hi> shall
oblige them to be <hi>Faithful.</hi> And if the
<hi>Reader</hi> will observe the <hi>Rules</hi> I have laid
down, he shall know how to <hi>Judge,</hi> and how
to <hi>Choose;</hi> To Instruct him in which, is the

the Maxims I shall give you in this
little Treatise, you will be arm'd against
<hi>Beauty;</hi> make <hi>Love</hi> your Subject, and
all the Subtilties of the <hi>Fair Sex</hi> shall
truckle, and become Instruments of your
Direction, instead of your Ruin.</p>
               <p>Be careful how you conceive too good
an Opinion of a Woman at first Sight,
for you see not the Woman truly, but
her Ornaments. Paint, Patches, and
fine Dresses, are to hide Defects; for
Beauty, like Truth, is always best when
Plainest.</p>
               <p>Many in rich Ornaments look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting,
whose Beauty, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
flies away with their Apparel, and
leaves you (as <hi>Iuno</hi> did <hi>Ixion</hi>) nothing
but a cloudy Mistress to embrace.</p>
               <p>If you like a Woman, and would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
if she be in Nature, what perhaps
she may seem by Art, surprize her in a
Morning undrest, and it is Ten to One,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35327:8"/>
but you will find your Goddess hath
shifted off her Divinity, and the Angel
you so much admired turn'd into a <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be always Jealous of a Maid, who
extols her own Vertue; a Wife, who
exclaims against her Husband in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
and a Widow, that courts your
Company; for when a Woman praises
her Vertues, 'tis as a Shop-keeper does a
Commodity, with a desire to be rid of
it; and she that will lay open the Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of her Husband to another, will, to
the same Man, lay open her self when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he shall require it of her; and
when a Widow seems fond of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
be sure 'tis through design;
and if you are not careful, she will bury
you alive.</p>
               <p>Be not tempted to pick up any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Street; but if you should,
be sure you have one Eye before you, and
another behind you; for wheresoever
Lust leads, Danger follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35327:9"/>Covet not the Presents of a fond
Woman, for they are Baits left to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare
you, and while you think you are
a gainer by her Gifts, you are loosing your
Self.</p>
               <p>Whoever is trepann'd by a Woman's
Smiles, is as a Fly hampered in a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web,
who waits the Leasure of the Spider
when he shall be devoured.</p>
               <p>He that serves the Lust of a Woman,
makes himself her Monkey; for she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
him no longer than while he is
playing with his Tail.</p>
               <p>Be careful how you live upon a
Whore, as how you keep one; for by
the former you will get nothing, and
by the latter loose every thing you
have got.</p>
               <p>Mistrust a Woman that seems Rich
by her own Discourse; for she that talks
much of her Fortune, hath generally
but little.</p>
               <p>Think not every Woman Rich that
wears gay Apparel; for many forfeit
their Vertue, to maintain their Pride.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35327:9"/>Build not too great a Faith upon the
sight of a few Guineas, or a Gold Watch,
these may be but shooing Horns, to
draw you on to your Ruin.</p>
               <p>Believe no Man's Affirmation of a
Woman's Fortune, unless you know him;
for Designs are never carry'd on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Abettors.</p>
               <p>Be sure of her Portion, though you
take her Vertue upon Credit; but he
that takes both upon Trust, may find,
when too late, he hath neither to trust to.</p>
               <p>Endeavour not to continue a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Love by Gifts, for every Present
you make her may be the Purchase of
a Rival: besides, they love Gifts, and
if you use them to it, they will Love
you no longer than you are giving.</p>
               <p>Believe not hte trivial Favours of a
Woman a demonstration of her Love;
for they pride to be Belov'd, though
it be by those they Scorn.</p>
               <p>Raise not an Opinion of your self
upon the Flatteries of a Woman, nor
think her Praises any sign of Love, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35327:10"/>
of her Cunning; for <hi>Designing Women,</hi>
like great <hi>Polititians,</hi> flatter them most
they design to Ruin.</p>

               <p>Let no Woman tempt you by her

               <p>WHosoever resigns her Vertue,
to gratify anothers Lust, will
not scruple the same freedom with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
to Pleasure her own; for few
Women Love so well, as to Love a
Gallant better than themselves.</p>
               <p>She who will lose her Reputation to
Oblige you, will Hazard your Love to
Gratify her self; and she that will do
both, can never be Constant.</p>
               <p>Put no Confidence in a Woman that
hath lost her Honour; for she who is
without Reputation, hath nothing to
engage her to be Faithful.</p>
               <p>Constancy is maintain'd by Vertue,
and she who hath lost her Vertue, hath
nothing left to oblige her to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35327:12"/>She that preferrs Pleasure before <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
will be Constant to her Lust, but
not to you.</p>
               <p>Nothing engages a Mans Affection so
much to a Woman, as a belief of her
Constancy; but 'tis better to believe
her otherways, for then she can never
Deceive you.</p>
               <p>Women are sensible that Constancy
is more priz'd than Beauty; but it is a
Maxim among their Sex, to Deceive
us most in what we most Value.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more Ridiculous than to
keep a <hi>Miss;</hi> for the that you keep,
will keep another if she can; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same Ambition in her to be
Mistriss of another, as there is in you
to be Master of her: and he that thinks
a Woman Constant, because he keeps
her, proves a <hi>Knave</hi> to himself, and a
<hi>Fool</hi> to his <hi>Madam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put no Faith in a Woman that is
Wife to another; for she who is not
Constant to her Husband, will never
be so to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:35327:12"/>A Woman who hath a Husband, and
will admit of a <hi>Gallant,</hi> let him look
upon her as Faithful as Monsieur <hi>Raggou</hi>'s
Mistriss, who was Constant to the whole
<hi>Troop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Married Woman, if Lewd, is Subtle
by Experience; for she who hath her
Husband to Deceive every Day, can
Deceive a Gallant at Leisure.</p>
               <p>A Durable Love is the Supporter of
Constancy; but that Love can never
be Lasting which stands on a False
Bottom.</p>
               <p>Be Constant to no Woman but a
Wife, if you be, you Deceive your
self; expect no Constancy in a <hi>Whore,</hi>
for she'll deceive you.</p>
               <p>Credit no Womans Words who hath
lost her Vertue, but believe the contrary,
for she talks Counter.</p>
               <p>If you have Contracted any Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with a Woman, let all she can do
for you be no more than you deserve;
but if she prove Constant, let it be more
than you expect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35327:13"/>Think not a Woman is most Faithful
to him she is most Fond off; for to
him the Deceives most, she seems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
most Obliging.</p>
               <p>Believe not all to be Virgins that talk
much of their Virginity; for all would
seem Maids that have been made other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>To one, a Woman may be Constant;
but if she divides her Affections between
two, she can be Constant to neither.</p>
               <p>If you are Familiar with anothers
Wife, believe her not, when she says
she knows none but her Husband and
you; for she will Swear to her Husband,
she knoweth none but himself.</p>
               <p>Credit nothing a Woman says, as to
her Constancy or Vertue; for she will
judify her Innocence before him, with
whom she hath been Guilty.</p>
               <p>Love no Woman in the Absence of
her Husband; you only stop a Gap for
another, who will return you no thanks
for your Labour; and remember, his
Approach, will be your Distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:35327:13"/>If you Love a Woman, Conceal it,
Oblige her with common Courtesies, but
show no Passion; for by your Prudence

a Servant.</p>
               <p>Measure a Womans Love by her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy;
for she Loves him best of whom
she is most Jealous, and of whom she is
most Jealous, to him she is most Constant.</p>
               <p>Be Jealous of a Woman that wo'nt
be Jealous of you; for she that won't
be Jealous, Loves you not; and she that
Loves you not, will never be Constant
to you.</p>
               <p>Answer all the expectations of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
you would keep Constant; for one
single neglect hazards the loss of her
Affections.</p>
               <p>Keep a Watchful Eye over the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
which you Love, seem not to be
over Credulous of her Vertue, if you do,
she will make tryals of your Faith.</p>
               <p>She who Kisses her Husband in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
hath generally her Eyes upon him
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35327:14"/>
she would Kiss in Private; and she that
will Kiss both in Publick and Private,
values not where she Kisses.</p>
               <p>Be Constant to your Wife, that she
may be Constant to you; for Gratitude
may constrain a Woman to preserve
those Bonds which Revenge may make
her violate.</p>
               <p>Chuse for your Wife a Prudent Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
for Prudence preserves Vertue,
Vertue Love, and Love Constancy.</p>
               <p>Inconstancy in a Wife makes Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
a Bramble, which bears Abundance
of Thorns.</p>
               <p>Inconstancy in a Husband makes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
in a Wife; and an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Wife makes a Husband a constant
Cuckold.</p>
               <p>Trust no Man with your Wife Abroad,
nor court your Friend to bear her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
at Home in your Absence; for
Opportunity and Importunity may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the most Heroick Vertue.</p>
               <p>Carry no Man to your Mistress if
you prize her; for if she loves you, she
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35327:14"/>
will be civil to your Friend for your
Sake.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Policy of a <hi>Designing Woman</hi>
to oblige the Friend of him that loves
her, to acquaint her self, by that means,

               <p>THE Love of a Woman is easie
to be gain'd, but difficult to be
preserv'd; you may with more facility
subdue Vertue, and bring a Chast Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to your Embraces, than engage
her to be Constant, after she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
her Honour. 'Tis a receiv'd
Opinion among their whole <hi>Sex,</hi> That
the <hi>Passion</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> ceases in a Man after
Enjoyment, and the Esteem he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of her Person is much lessen'd by
her Condescention to his Desires, which
Conception occasions her to withdraw
her Affections from you, (unless every
Hour you confirm her in a different
Faith by fresh Assurances) coveting to
be Belov'd by some Body who hath a
good Opinion of her Vertues; for there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35327:15"/>
is nothing more certain, that Women
who have been deceiv'd themselves, take
a secret Delight in Deceiving others;
therefore, you that are the Deceivers,
be careful you are not Deceiv'd.</p>
               <p>The Love of a Virgin is innocent
and lasting, as her Vertue. The Love
of a Just Wife friendly and delightful.
The Love of a Widow politick and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.
The Love of a Lewd Woman
lustful and revengeful.</p>
               <p>If you are the Favourite of a Lady,
and depend upon her Courtesies, you
must be industrious to oblige her, and
as watchful to preserve her from the
Efforts of Rivals, or you will soon find
your Mistress like a Pot-Gun, the last
Pellet she receives will drive out the
former.</p>
               <p>Simpathize not with a Woman who
loves you Passionately; for as she finds
your Love encreases, she will cool her
own with the Assurance of yours.</p>
               <p>If you have gain'd a Woman's Love,
and would preserve it, be sure be constant
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35327:16"/>
in your Visits, or you will find most
Women have so bad Memories, that a
Weeks Absence will make them quite
forget you.</p>
               <p>The Love of a Woman hath its Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
like the Year, its Spring, Summer,
Autumn and Winter. It begins with
a warm desire, and is nourished to a
grearer heat, by the kind Influence of
the Object, till the Harvest of her Joys
are full ripe; but when the Fruits of
her Affections are reap'd and gather'd,
you will soon perceive some sharp Breezes,
as Signs of an approaching Winter.</p>
               <p>The Love of a Chast Woman will
be continued towards you as long as
you behave your self well; but the
Love of a Woman who hath lost her
Vertue, is but during Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Love a Woman with Moderation that
loves you to an excess; her Passion will
naturally reduce it self to the same E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
for no Extreams are lasting,
and then you have the Advantage, for
the Continuance of a little Love shews
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35327:16"/>
a constant Temper, and looks friendly
and obliging, when a Passion cooled to
the same Indifferency will look slighting
and neglective; besides, he that loves
a Woman too much, is apt to love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
too little.</p>
               <p>Depend not on the Love of a lewd
Woman, 'tis a Reed will soon deceive
you, her Love is intangled with her Lust;
to continue the one, is to be a Slave to
the other; and rather than be that, I
would share the Punishment of <hi>Cesaphus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secure not your Love to a Woman
by Oaths or Protestations; for she will
then think you have bound your self
to continue that Respect which would
be otherwise her Care and Study to
merit and preserve.</p>
               <p>Let not the Protestations of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Love to you be a President for
you to follow, though you Love her,
for she does it purely to tempt you to
give in the same Security, that she may
have the more to upbraid you with when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you shall prove false.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:35327:17"/>If you are Belov'd by a Person you
cannot Marry, whom you are willing
to secure to your own Embraces, draw
what you can from her by Insinuations;
the more you get, the faster you bind
her; she will not part with that easily,
she hath purchas'd dearly; and the more
you cost her, the more she'll prize you.</p>
               <p>The Love of a Virgin is much to be
pitied; the Love of a Wife highly to
be valued; but the Love of a Vitious
Woman deserves neither; for she will
Love any that will serve her Lust.</p>
               <p>Give no Encouragement to the Love
of anothers Wife; for it is Lustful in
the beginning, Treacherous all along,
and Dangerous in the end.</p>
               <p>Love is a Distemper will wade through
the greatest Difficulties to obtain a Cure;
he that is the Phisician may exact what
Fees he pleases; therefore, do you be
careful how you become the Patient.</p>
               <p>Seraphick Love, is the Bliss of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
mutual Love, the Comfort of
Mankind; natural Love, the Chain of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35327:17"/>
the World; but Lustful Love, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Misfortune.</p>
               <p>To Love a Wife, is our Duty; to
Love a Friend, our Interest; but to

those ends in which the Sweetness
of their Revenge is center'd; and as they
love to extreams, every little neglect
they construe a great Slight, and through
their Weakness, mistake Accident often
for Design, and fling themselves, by their
own Whimsies and Conceits, into an
evil Opinion of Persons which they
Love. Thus, oftentimes, they let their
own Jealousies pass for Realities, and
sowre their Affections into a sharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
without a just Occasion, turning
Furies to those they Lov'd, through a
fanciful Ingratitude, which I conceive
to be the chief Reason why Women
are much more Subject to this Passion
than Men; therefore, covet no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Love, but whom you will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
to Oblige; for a small neglect
is taken by them as a great Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:35327:18"/>Deal with a Revengeful Woman, as
with a Hand-Granado, which you cast
from you as soon as the Fuse is lighted,
lest it burst, to the Prejudice of him
that fir'd it.</p>
               <p>Have no Familiarity with her you
have highly disoblig'd, least (<hi>Bee</hi>-like
she stings you with her Tail.</p>
               <p>She who once Lov'd you, and is
turn'd your Enemy, look upon her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be so; be not deluded by her
Flatteries, to give it into her Power to
hurt you; for Women, though they
seem to forget a Wrong they have been
forced to suffer, yet you will find they
have good Memories when they have
Power to revenge it.</p>
               <p>Trespass not on the Affections of a
Woman who Loves you to Excess; for
Women, (like <hi>Ale</hi>) if over Sweet, will
turn sowre the sooner.</p>
               <p>Take not always a Womans Frowns
as Slights, nor her Smiles as a sure
Argument of her Love; for every
time the Sun is clouded, it does not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35327:19"/>
predict soul Weather, and when it shines
out a Storm may be near at hand:
Women can dissemble their Passions,
and change their Looks, as a <hi>Scorpion</hi>
can its Colour.</p>
               <p>A Woman's Love turn'd into Revenge,
is like Wine turn'd to Vinegar, which
can never be reduced to its primitive
Goodness, but will always remain Sowre
till its dead.</p>
               <p>Nothing is so Revengeful as an injured
Woman; for which Reason, the Poets
have ordered the Furies to be put up in
the Feminine Gender.</p>
               <p>The Love of a Vertuous Woman is
a great Blessing; but if once lost by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
you will find she will turn
her Love that could not last, into a
Revenge that will.</p>
               <p>Shun a Woman that's your Enemy;
for every time she sees you it puts her
upon fresh Mischiefs.</p>
               <p>If you have dealt Ingratefully by a
Woman, converse with none that respect
her, lest at some time or other it should
happen to your Prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:35327:19"/>The Passion of an Envious Woman is
virulent, and Flattery the only Antidote
to expell the Poyson: To dissemble,
shows more Prudence than to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
by the one, you may pacifie the
Fury of fermented Spirits, when the
other will beget in your Enemy fresh
Resolutions of further Mischiefs.</p>
               <p>Be Merciful to those you can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power;
but Flatter such Enemies you
cannot Conquer; for Revenge (though
sweet to those who seek it) is always
bitter to the Sufferers.</p>
               <p>Some Women are so politickly Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
after a Revenge compleated, they
will palliate the Injury with succeeding
Pity; but think the Sorrow of such a
Person as great as hers, who (weeping)
follows a dead Husband to the Grave,
whom she hath wish'd out of the World
a Thousand Times whilst he was Living.</p>
               <p>Changes in inconstant Tempers are
never to be minded; she who does you
a wilful Injury, and seems Sorry for it,
it is your Prudence to believe she only
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35327:20"/>
grieves, that the Mischief she hath done
you is no greater.</p>
               <p>Trust an Enemy who hath once hurt
you, upon a Reconciliation, no further
than you would the Fawning of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiff
Dog who hath attempted to worry
you.</p>
               <p>Most Women are Politick in their
Love, but much more Subtle in their
Revenge; therefore, be careful how you
affront them or deceive them to deserve
it: besides, 'tis Ignoble to offend the
Pevish, or to hurt the Weak.</p>
               <p>Make not her that Loves you, by
Ingratitude, your Enemy; nor let not
the Ingratitude of whom you Love
excite you to be hers; for Revenge
(like a Crab-Tree) produces a sweet
Blossom, but a sowre Fruit.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Pride of Women.</head>
               <p>STateliness in a Woman may become
her as she walks; but Pride in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is hateful and ridiculous, and
exposes the Persons affected with it to
the Censures of the Company in such
awker'd Gestures, and uncouth Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,
such peremptory Sentences, and
impertinent Loquacities, that offends
both the Eyes and Ears of all that have
either Modesty or Prudence. Nothing
shows the want of Judgment more than
Female Pride, which is (doubtless)
nourish'd by the vain Conceits of their
own Perfections, and begets such a Self-Love,
grounded upon Self-Opinion, that
they look upon their whole Sex beside
with Envy and Contempt, and like
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35327:21"/>
                  <hi>Narcissas,</hi> daily dote on the Reflection
of their own imaginary Excellencies.
Cast not your Eyes too often upon
such Women, for they are chargable
Mistresses, implacable Wives, and ill
Mothers to your Children.</p>
               <p>A Proud Woman, like an imprudent
Prince, always Love him best by whom
she is most slatter'd.</p>
               <p>If you Aim at the Favours of a Lofty
Dame, you must highly extol her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and her Parts, and conceed with
her Opinion in all things, though ne'er
so opposite to Reason; for Flattery and
Humility must be the Supporters of
your Interest.</p>
               <p>Let Pride in a fine Woman anticipate
your Admiration; for never admire her
who admires her self too much; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her as a large Looking-Glass
crack'd, by which single defect is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of small Value, by reason it can
ne'er be mended.</p>
               <p>Pride in a Witty Woman, is like a
Whet-stone to a Scyth, it only serves to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35327:21"/>
sharpen her Reflections, and makes her
a more dangerous Weapon for a Man to
meddle with.</p>
               <p>A Proud Woman, like a stately Horse,
must be rid with a Curb, and manag'd
with a streight Rein, or she will soon be
the Bane of her Rider.</p>
               <p>If you Marry a Haughty Woman,
you ought to have a good Estate; for
you will find, a Proud Wife, in a low
Station, will be an uncomfortable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and the first in Adversity that
shall lend a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lping Hand to your Ruin.</p>
               <p>Pride in a Friend is dangerous, in a
Mistress chargable, but in a Wife an
implacable Torment.</p>
               <p>Many Women have forfeited their
Vertue, to gratifie their Lust, but more
to maintain their Pride; and Lust, though
it will make a Woman a Whore, yet 'tis
Pride that makes her Mercenary.</p>
               <p>Many Women have Vertue enough
to resist the bare Attempts of Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
but few that can stand against the
powerful Charms of Gold, fine Dresses,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35327:22"/>
Coach and Horses, and Attendance. It
is Grandeur influences Pride, and leads
Ambition by the Nose through the worst
of Vices; for there are many who are
honestly Poor by constraint, who would
willingly commit any Evil to be Rich.</p>
               <p>That Vertue is never Safe which is
under the Guardian-ship of Pride; the
latter will be maintain'd, though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is sacrifie'd to support it.</p>
               <p>He that hath a Proud Woman to his
Wife is like an <hi>Oak</hi> begirt with <hi>Ivy,</hi> he
Suffers himself to be Embraced by that
which will bring him to his Ruin.</p>
               <p>When Ambition leads the Van, the
whole Body of Vice follows; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you see Pride in the Front, be
sure Lust Marches in the Rear.</p>
               <p>Pride in a Beautiful Woman is like
a Flaw in a Diamond, it lessens the
Value, Spoils the Lustre, and Remains
Incurable.</p>
               <p>He that Marries a Proud Wife is as
unhappy as a Prince who hath a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Nation to Govern, as the latter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35327:22"/>
must grant every Petition of the People
to secure Peace in his Kingdom, so must
the former every request of his Wife
to preserve the same in his Family.</p>
               <p>Of all Imperfections in a Woman,
Pride is the most Intollerable, for that
is hardest to be excused, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be mended.</p>
               <p>Pride in a Wife, makes a Husband
appear little; it oft-times compels him
to Submit, where he hath right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</p>
               <p>He that hath a Prudent Wife, hath a
Guardian Angel by his Side, but he
that hath a Proud Wife, hath the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
at his Elbow.</p>
               <p>A Proud Woman is an Imperious
Wife, an Undutiful Daughter, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Mistriss, a Harsh Mother, and
a Sawcy Servant.</p>
               <p>Pride is the Parent of Iniquity, the
Innovator of Vice, the Seed of Rebellion,
and the Rise of Faction. Pride lost
Mankind their Paradice, the World its
Peace, and made a Devil of an Angel.</p>

               <p>LET no Man deceive himself with
the Expectancy of Gratitude in a
Mercenary Woman; for she, who for
Suks and Satins, or a splendid Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
will submit to your Pleasure, and
swear Constancy to her Keeper, shall be
first that forsakes you in a declining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and though she hath built a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for her self out of the Ruins of your
Fortune, yet she shall be the last Person
that shall lend you the least Assistance
when your Occasions shall most require
it; Therefore, look upon whatsoever you
give such a Woman to he buried, as in a
deep Sea, from whence no Returns can
be expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:35327:23"/>If you love a Woman, be not deluded
by her trifling Presents to make chargable
Returns, for that's the Aim of her Policy.
Let not a Point Cravat, because 'tis her
own Working, give her Title to a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of your Estate, lest while your
Mistriss extols your Gratitude, the World
laughs at your Folly.</p>
               <p>Giving Presents to a Woman to secure
her Love, is as Vain as the Endeavouring
to fill a Ceive with Water; for you may
continue Giving the one, and Pouring into
the other, till the last Trump sounds, e're
you find the one the Faster, or the other
the Fuller.</p>
               <p>The Gratitude of a Mercinary Woman
lies only in her Tayl, with it she dissolves
all Obligations, and will still be a Gainer
even when the Debt's Paid.</p>
               <p>Whoever blames a Woman for her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
is equally culpable for Trusting
her with the Power to prove so; for Love
with Moderation, keeps a close Heart and
a wary Hand, and her Ingratitude can
never hurt you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:35327:24"/>Debauch no Virgin to maintain her
after, lest you are serv'd as a Gentleman,
who having wasted his Fortune in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Support of a Young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whom he had first desil'd, sent his
Man to her upon a particular Exigence,
to desire her to lend him Ten Guinea's;
to which she answer'd, Pray present my
Service to your Master, and tell him when
he hath made me amends for the Vertue
he hath forc'd from me, I shall be glad to
Oblige him; but I wonder he should think
I would lend Money to him who hath
rob'd me already of that which admits of
no Restitution, but for ever continues him
my Debtor. Therefore, corrupt no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
or the Surrender of her Vertue to

                  </gap>mbraces, will remain upon you as a
perpertual Obligation, and serve her at all
times to excuse the highest Ingratitude,
or the greatest Injury she shall act against
you: besides, the World shall condemn
you under all the Mischiefs you shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by her means, crying, you were first
her Ruin, and all the Evils she can do you
is no more than you deserve.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:35327:24"/>Love is the Legature that binds a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Gratitude; she that Loves you,

               <p>She that hath a Design upon you, will
first oblige you with some engaging Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
to become her Debter; but be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of those Women who are generous in
the Beginning, lest you pay, with your
Ruin, for their Kindness in the End.</p>
               <p>Ingratitude is said to be worse than the
Sin of Witchcraft, and he that trusteth a
Woman he hath once found Ingrateful, is
worse than bewitch'd.</p>
               <p>Court not a Reconciliation with a Woman
who hath once deciv'd you, lest she triumphs
over your Submission, and makes von become
