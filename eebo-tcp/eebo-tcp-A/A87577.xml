            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE IESUITS CREED: <hi>OR,</hi> The forme of the Profeſsion of Faith, to which all Popiſh Prieſts and Eccleſiaſtiques, of what Order ſoever, are faſt tyed by oath: by the ordinance of Pope PIUS the fourth, in the fifth yeare of his Popedome. <date>
                  <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> 1564.</date>
            </head>
            <p>1. <hi>I.N.</hi> Doe with a firme faith beleeve, and profeſſe all, and every one of the things which are contained in the Creed, which the holy Romane Church doth uſe: To wit,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I beleeve in one God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Amen.</hi> As it is in the Nicen and Conſtantinopolitan Creed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I doe moſt firmely admit and imbrace Apoſtolicall and Eccleſiaſticall traditions, and the reſt of the obſervations and conſtitutions of the ſame Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In like manner, I admit the ſacred Scriptures, according to that ſenſe, which the holy mother Church, to whom it belongs to judge of the true meaning and interpretation of the holy Scriptures, hath held and doth hold: Neither will I ever receive and interprete it, but according to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I doe alſo profeſſe that there be ſeven true and proper Sacraments of the New Law, inſtituted by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and neceſſary for the ſalvation of mankinde, though not all of them to every one; That is to ſay, Baptiſme, Confirmation, the Euchariſt, Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, and Matrimony: And that they doe conferre grace, and that of theſe, Baptiſme, Confirmation and Orders, cannot be reiterated without Sacriledge.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I doe alſo receive and admit the received and approved Rites of the Catholique Church in the ſolemne adminiſtration of all the foreſaid Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I doe embrace and receive all and every one of the things, which have been defined and declared in the holy Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning Originall ſinne, and Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I doe likewiſe profeſſe that a true, proper, and propitiatory ſacrifice is offered unto God in the Maſſe for the quicke and the dead: And that the body and bloud of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (together with his ſoule and God-head) are truely, really, and ſubſtantially in the moſt holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt: And that the whole ſubſtance of the bread is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into his body, and the whole ſubſtance of the wine into his bloud; which converſion the Catholique Church calleth Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I doe alſo acknowledge that under one of the kindes onely Chriſt is received whole and entire, and a true Sacrament taken.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I doe conſtantly hold there is a Purgatory, and that the ſoules therein detained are holpen by the ſuffrages of the faithfull: In like manner alſo I hold that the Saints, reigning together with Chriſt, are to be worſhipped and prayed unto; and that they doe offer up prayers unto God for us, and that their Reliques are to be worſhipped.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I doe ſtedfaſtly affirme that the Images of Chriſt, and of that ever Virgin Mother of God, as alſo of other Saints, ought to be had and reteined, and that due honour and worſhip ſhould be given unto them.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I doe alſo affirme that Chriſt hath left in his Church the power of Indulgences, and that the uſe of them is very wholeſome for Chriſtian people.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I doe acknowledge the Holy, Catholique, and Apoſtolique Roman Church to be the mother and miſtris of all Churches: And I doe promiſe and ſweare true obedience to the Biſhop of Rome, the ſucceſſour of bleſſed <hi>Peter</hi> the prince of the Apoſtles, and Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I doe likewiſe undoubtedly receive &amp; profeſſe all other things delivered, defined and declared by holy Canons, oecumenicall Councels, &amp; eſpecially by the holy Synod of <hi>Trent;</hi> and I doe with all condemne, reject, and accurſe all things contrary, and all hereſies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that are condemned, rejected, and accurſed of the Church.</p>
            <p>This true Catholique faith, without which no man can be ſaved, which I doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly profeſſe, and truely hold at this preſent time, the very ſame I the ſaid <hi>N.</hi> doe promiſe, vow, and ſweare to keep and confeſſe whole and undefiled moſt conſtantly, by the helpe of God, even to the laſt gaſpe of life; and that I will take care, as much as lies in me, that it be held, taught and preached of thoſe which are under me, or of thoſe, the care of whom ſhall belong unto me in my office. So helpe me God, and theſe holy Goſpels.</p>
