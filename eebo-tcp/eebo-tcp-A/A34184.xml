            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> his LETTER to the Clergy of his Diocess.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may remember, that by the help of your ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, we had three Conferences, the last year, upon the two Sacraments and Catechising, in the reason of which, that you may be the better provided to satisfie such as shall enquire, especially those that are immediately under your care: I have thought fit to let you know, in short, what induced me to take this method:</p>
            <p>Which was in general, that notwithstanding the great duty and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of each particular, with the necessary and prudent directions of our Church for their due observance, there was so great a neglect in most pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the substance of Religion, unless timely remedy'd, would be lost amongst us.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Baptism.</head>
               <p>THE first Conference we had was concerning Baptism, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which, you are directed by 29 and 30, and 68, 69 and 70 Canons, and the Rubricks contained in the Office for the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptism. And to perswade us the more earnestly and effectually to prosecute this, we consider'd, 1. Of how great use and experience publick Baptism was in the Church. 2. What might be the best means to recover the shameful disuse of it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The great use and expedience did appear from the several advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Church receives by publick Baptism, which are all lost in Private. 1. There is the joynt-Prayers of the Congregation to give a blessing to that holy performance. 2. There is an occasion given to the people to reflect upon their own promises, both which are exercises of mutual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 3. It makes us not to be asham'd of our vow of Christianity. And, Lastly, If gives that solemnity which is due to so great a Sacrament, and from which a greater awe and regard is contracted upon the minds of men, who are in a great measure mov'd by the outward appearance, and for the want of which, by being hudled up in private, I fear I may but too truly say it is grown into contempt among us.
<p>That which adds great weight to confirm these reasons, is the constant and universal practice of the Church in all Ages; which, however diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the manner, was always attended with two circumstances, a high Reverence to the sacredness of the Institution, and a solemn and publick Performance: witness the Primitive usage in the burying-places of their Martyrs, where their Assemblies were then held, and afterwards their magnificent Baptistaries, the remains of which, are to be seen in some Cities to this day. It would be to little purpose to quote either Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils or Fathers for this, when there is not a Church, to this hour, that does not appoint as publick an administration as its condition can allow of. And if any come shorter of this decent observation than another, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some wild Christians) it is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has defaced the beauty of it.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The way therefore to recover this decent and most useful practice, and to restore the Church to its just Discipline, is, earnestly to lay before those who are committed to our care, not only the reasonableness of their duty in complying, but likewise the great obligation that lies upon us, especially in obedience to so just a command. So that at the least, if they will not bring their Children into the Congregation (supposing they have health to bear it) we ought to refuse the Registring of them.</item>
               </list>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Lords Supper.</head>
               <p>THE next Conference was upon the Lords Supper, in the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, you are directed by 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, and 28 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, as likewise by the Rubricks in the Office. All which we did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animously agree, not only entirely to obey, so far as concerns our selves, but likewise to promote in others where we are injoyn'd, as having sworn to observe all such Injunctions. But we found our misfortune here, not so much to lye in unworthy or irreverent Communicants, as that there is a general Apostacy (if I may so call it) from this sacred Institution. Our great work therefore in this particular, was, and still is like to be, to perswade men of the great benefit and necessity of this Sacrament; and from thence to excuse our selves, while we leave no means unattempted to bring them to this Communion.</p>
               <p>Nothing certainly can be more positive than the Institution set down in three of the Gospels; nor the benefit and great advantage more clearly exprest than I <hi>Cor.</hi> x, xi. Chapters; where you have in the xi Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 26. a plain Declaration of the continuance of it to the end of the World, from this expression, <hi>Ye do shew the Lords death till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident to any that shall in partially read the forementioned places of Scripture, that none can pretend to Gospel-obedience that omit this
<pb facs="tcp:107453:1"/>
Ordinance. And it does as evidently appear, that there is a shameful neglect of it throughout this whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The reason of which is plain to any that will look back to the late times, and observe how industriously by an universal discouragement, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through a superstitious terror, or prophane contempt, the omission of it was promoted. And this was natural under an usurp'd power, where sin was the Law, and transgression the best obedience. But now that these hardships are blown over, where shall we find the bond of peace, and the unity of the spirit without Communion? What security have we of being one body, if we are not one bread? I <hi>Cor.</hi> x.17. How know we that there are not more Papists amongst us than Protestants, and more that offer up strange Fire, and partake of other Altars than ours, if they eat not of the Sacrifice? <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Surely, if we condemn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for putting off half the Communion, they will rise up in judgment against us at the last day, and utterly condemn all such as neglect the whole.</p>
               <p>Since then the security, not only of every private person, but even of the whole Church, depends upon the due observation of this Sacrament; it may easily be concluded what diligence we ought to use to bring the people to a just sense of this duty, by Exhortation, Reproof, private Communcation from house to house, especially at such times as we appoint Communions, and whatever else Law or Prudence can suggest to us.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Catechism.</head>
               <p>THE last thing we met upon was Catechising, the want of which has left the Church without a foundation; for as the wise man says, <hi>If early provision of good principles be not laid up in the youth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal shall a man have to support himself in his riper years?</hi> Eccles. xii. 1. I am sure the Church has order'd the care, in this particular, with great exactness, as may be seen in the Rubricks of the short Catechism, and in the 59th Canon, besides the several publick admonitions, whereby its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution has been recommended to us. What reverence or respect can be lookt for from the people to the two Sacraments, when they have never learnt what they are? What obedience or other Morality to be expected, when they have never understood the Commandments? What Faith shall we think to find upon the earth, when the first Principles of its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles have been never laid?</p>
               <p>And therefore if Parents will not answer at the last day for the ruin of their Children; if Masters and Mistresses will not take upon them the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of their Servants and Apprentices; if we do not intend to be found guilty of the sins of the growing Generation in our respective flocks: we ought certainly to use all diligence and Authority to bring such as have need of it, to receive due instruction at the appointed times, or oftner if we find it needful; that at least, whoever miscarries, we may save our own souls.</p>
               <p>I hope I have prest this duty so often, and earnestly, to my Brethren of the Clergy, that I shall never find cause to complain of their neglect. Which, should I find my self disappointed in, I could not but resent it with great grief. But in full assurance of your complying, I shall only recommend one method to you, that what part of the Catechism you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one day, you would make those you Catechise, give you an account, the next day, of its meaning: That so you may be assured of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and improvement each person receives from that instruction.</p>
               <p>All this, and whatever else, in your own discretion, you shall find ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the promoting of what has been said, I do beseech you, from my self, and conjure you, by the obedience you owe the Church you are establisht in, that you omit no care nor diligence for the effecting of it. For this you may be confident of, that I shall never enjoyn you any other thing, than what you have already submitted to, and are bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. Our Canons and Constitutions are the common voice of the Church; the words of which only, are they that can direct us to an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of I <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Chap. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>That we all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions amongst us, but</hi> that we <hi>be perfectly joyn'd together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</hi> Otherwise, without some common direction and mark to steer our selves by, it were impossible to avoid the same confusion as they are subject to, that are disordered by uncertain sounds, I <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. That God would direct you and your Flock in these and all things else, is the most hearty Prayer of,</p>
