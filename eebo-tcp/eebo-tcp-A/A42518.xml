            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Muſt deſire my Reader to obſerve here three things concerning this Book. <hi>Firſt,</hi> What were the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which induced me to write it; <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Methods which I obſerved in it; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have to dedicate it to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Several of the Order of Gray and Black Fryars, having had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, not only to flock by Troops from beyond Seas into <hi>England,</hi> but alſo to appear publickly in their Monkiſh Habits, and a
<pb facs="tcp:95414:4"/>
great many others of different Colours preparing to follow. The People here was not in a little amazement to ſee theſe new Faces, while the Papiſts were very buſie in combing the Fox's Tail to make it appear finer, and magnified every where the pretended Holineſs, both of theſe Monks and of their Habits. The good Proteſtants did only laugh at them, but the wiſer ſort inquired who they were, and in what Book one might have a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient notice of them. There were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome <hi>Latin</hi> Books which treated of Monks, and alſo ſome <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> but beſides that, all theſe were written in Foreign Tongues, unknown to the moſt part of the vulgar ſort of People; they were almoſt all of them written in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh way, and by Monks, who had not forgot to be kind to themſelves. There wanted then an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book to give a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and true information about this matter. A learned Doctor in Divinity undertook, at that time, to do it, whoſe Pen would have, without doubt, far out-done mine, had he perfected the Work which he had begun. But theſe mimical Faces of Monks, having diſappeared in the late happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
<pb facs="tcp:95414:4"/>
and the Doctor's applications being required another way, he thought fit to leave off, and I was deſired to try what I could do on this Subject, both with ſhortneſs and impartiality.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Theſe <hi>Two</hi> Parts I have endeavoured to make good, having briefly related the times of the Inſtitution of each Religious Order, their Founders, their Tempers, their Habits, and given a ſhort Abſtract of their Rules. I have made uſe both of Proteſtant and Popiſh Authors, amongſt whom I have endeavoured to retrieve the Truth. After each Rule, I have treated of thoſe Monks who do profeſs the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the times of their reſpective Foundations, excepting only ſome few, who are under the pretended Rules of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and have taken the Name of <hi>Regular Clerks,</hi> whom (becauſe they are ſo newly hatched) I have placed after the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant Fryars. After theſe you ſhall find a little Treatiſe of Nuns, and another of Military Regular Orders. All theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes might have been more enlarged, each of them affording very plentiful matter; but I have choſen to he ſhort, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb facs="tcp:95414:5"/>
only what might give a ſufficient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. I am further now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Reader of ſome Reaſons I had to dedicate this ſmall Performance to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Clergy of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As I cannot ſufficiently praiſe God for his great Mercy in calling me to be a Member of this Holy Church, ſo I I thought I could not honour enough thoſe who are the Pillars, and the chief Ornaments of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Having many particular Obligations to ſeveral of the Clergy, I hoped they might perceive in this Dedication of my Book to them, though in General, the earneſt deſire which I have to be thankful. But what inclined me yet very powerfully to do it, was, that being not altogether ignorant of the great diſturbances which the Monks in all Ages, almoſt from their firſt Eſtabliſhment in this Country, Cauſed amongſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; nay, of the violent Uſurpations, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Tyrannies, Perſecutions, and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherewith they ſo deviliſhly attempted the total Deſtruction both of Churches and Church men, I thought it would well
<pb facs="tcp:95414:5"/>
ſuit with the Honour of the Reformation, if I ſhould bring in theſe Monks as vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Slaves, and lay them at the Feet of the Proteſtant Clergy, who, at laſt, by God's Grace and Mercy have ſo gloriouſly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over them. The Church Hiſtory is full of the bold and malitious attempts of the Monks againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Secular Clergy; and it will not be, methinks, amiſs to relate here ſome few inſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many, to verifie what I have ſaid before.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt who declared againſt the Clerical State, was <hi>Dunſtan.</hi> The Monks, who always reverenced him as their great Support, Patron and Favourer, ceaſed not to extol him to the Skies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and went ſo far, as to aſſert, that he had been <note place="margin">Martyrol, Eccl. Cant.</note>ſanctified in his Mothers Womb; and they made ſo much noiſe with Lyes, and pretended Miracles, that he was eaſily made a Saint in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> However, ſeveral good Authors ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <note place="margin">Osbernus. Park, Ant. Brit. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Dunst.</note>of him, that he had been a very debauched Youth, exceſſively inclined to Women, and a great lover of Magical Arts, wherewith he bewitched to that degree, <hi>Alfgina,</hi> Princeſs of the Royal Blood, that
<pb facs="tcp:95414:6"/>
ſhe could not live ſeparate from him. <note place="margin">Osbernus.</note>Therefore that ſhe might enjoy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his Company, ſhe cauſed a Houſe to be built near the Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> where the Hypocrite <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> to deceive the World, had built a little Cell for himſelf. When ſhe died, ſhe left to him the whole diſpoſal of her Eſtate to be given to Pious Uſes, thinking thereby to <note place="margin">In Legend. Dunſt.</note>attone for her great ſins before God. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> builded with the Mony five Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and richly endowed them, making himſelf Abbot of the beſt of them. Which which was alſo, they ſay, the firſt that <note place="margin">Stephan Birkington.</note>was built in <hi>England.</hi> Nevertheleſs he did not build them out of any love for Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for during the Reigns of ſeven Kings, under whom he lived, he almoſt never ſtirred from great Lords Houſes, or from the Court. He at firſt refuſed a Biſhoprick that was offered him, rather out of Pride, or ſome other End, as may be ſuppoſed, <note place="margin">Osbernus. Joh. Capgr.</note>than out of Humility, becauſe ſome while after he accepted two of them, to wit, that of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and that of <hi>London,</hi> both which he poſſeſſed at once, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſcruple of Conſcience. He was made at laſt Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95414:6"/>
and got ſo far into King <hi>Edward</hi>'s favour, that nothing was done, either in the Kingdom or in the Church, without his conſent, or rather without his Order. He made uſe at firſt of the great power he had at Court, to advance to Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks ſome of his own Relations, who, to pleaſe him, were become Monks. <note place="margin">Sim. Dunel. Rog. Hoven.</note>Amongſt thoſe were <hi>Oſwald</hi> and <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald,</hi> the firſt of whom was promoted to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the other to that of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> In which having ſucceeded, he undertook to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Affairs of the Monks, to the great prejudice of thoſe of the Clergy. Thus <hi>Dunſtan</hi> being a very luſtful man, hated (as ſuch uſually do) Lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and ſeeing that the Clergy-men, in that time, were permitted to Marry, he undertook to force them to forſake their Wives and Children, and to turn Monks. <hi>Oſwald</hi> and <hi>Ethelwald</hi> joined with him in the ſame deſign; and all of them having unanimouſly forged ſeveral falſe Accuſations and Calumnies againſt thoſe of the Clergy, who refuſed to take the Monaſtical Habit, they turned them out of their Churches, Prebendaries and
<pb facs="tcp:95414:7"/>
Colleges. The offended Party carried im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately their Complaints to the King, who appointed Commiſſioners to examine their Cauſe in the Chapter of the Church of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> of which the Monks had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſſed themſelves in the year 963. The Judges being fully convinced by the juſt Reaſons of the Clergy, were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point to pronounce in favour of their re-eſtabliſhment, when the Monks, thinking they had no time to loſe, made uſe of this crafty Device. They hid one of their Gang upon the Roof of the Hall where the Aſſembly was kept, who cryed out with all his ſtrength through a hole, not being ſeen, <hi>Non bene ſentiunt qui Presbyteris fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, Thoſe who ſpeak in favour of the Prieſts are not in the Right.</hi> Then the Monks, clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their Hands, called out this was the voice of an Angel, and that they needed no other Judgment, but what Heaven it ſelf had pronounced. The Commiſſioners were ſo much terrified at it, that againſt all Juſtice and Reaſon the Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men were caſt, and loſt the right of their Cauſe. After this <hi>Dunſtan</hi> and his Agents ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved no longer any moderation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Secular Clergy, but uſed
<pb facs="tcp:95414:7"/>
them with all ſort of violence. The King himſelf at their ſollicitation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them utterly, and commanded them to be chaſed out of all Cathedral Churches and Colleges. In a Letter which he wrote to <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> to <hi>Oſwald</hi> and to <hi>Ethelwald,</hi> he expreſſeth himſelf in theſe words, <hi>I have the Sword of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>in my hand, and you that of</hi> St. <hi>Peter; let us join them together, and drive the Lepers out of the Camp. (viz.</hi> the Church-men, who lived in the ſtate of a Lawful and Honeſt Marriage) <hi>So let us cleanſe the Sanctuary of the Lord, and henceforward receive none to the Miniſtry of the Altars, but the Children of</hi> Levi, <hi>who ſaid to his Father and Mother, I know you not, and to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I know not who you are,</hi> &amp;c. (Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in this laſt Clauſe the Monks, who had renounced their Relations and Families, to live with more eaſe and leſs care in the Cloiſters) The three Biſhops had no ſooner received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but like Ravenous Wolves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they fell upon that Flock, which, as good Paſtors, they ſhould have protected, and unmercifully oppreſſed it. They build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:95414:8"/>
with their Spoils, during the Reign of that King, XLVIII. Monaſteries, and richly endowed them. The affairs of the Monks having ſuffered ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay under the Reign of the following King, <hi>Dunſtan</hi> took upon himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them under King <hi>Edward,</hi> in the year 975. He aſſembled for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a National Council in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But having had no ſucceſs in it, he aſſembled another in <hi>Wilceria</hi> or <hi>Calne,</hi> where he refuſed to diſpute againſt <hi>Beornelmus,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Biſhop, and a very learned man, and one well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture, who offered to prove by it, the lawfulneſs of the Marriage of Prieſts. And indeed the Aſſembly begun already to be perſuaded by the ſtrength of his Reaſons, when a fatal and deplorable accident carried the Cauſe in favour of <hi>Dunſtan.</hi> The Houſe in which this great Aſſembly was met, ſunk, and there were buried in its ruins almoſt all the Chiefeſt both of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Nobility of <hi>England.</hi> The Monks alone had the good luck to eſcape; who publiſhed immediately that Heaven had eſpouſed their Cauſe, had wrought a
<pb facs="tcp:95414:8"/>
Miracle for their preſervation, and aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of their Adverſaries. But ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authors of great ſenſe do accuſe, not without Reaſon, this <hi>Dunſtan</hi> and his Monks of a Plot, no leſs Treacherous and Abominable, than was that of the Gunpowder Treaſon, to have undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Building, and made it ready to fall upon this Aſſembly, in caſe their Affairs did not take that turn which they deſired; in which caſe it was an eaſie thing for the Monks to make their eſcape. For as Biſhop <hi>Parker</hi> wiſely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, How is it poſſible to believe that God would have wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to maintain the cauſe of thoſe who had refuſed to be tried by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Holy Word? Nevertheleſs ſo ſad an accident gave the Victory to the Monks over the Secular Married Clergy, whoſe places they continued to uſurp, almoſt during ſix hundred years, until King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. exterminated them in a leſſer time, and with more facility than <hi>Dunſtan</hi> had for eſtabliſhing of them. I come now to give you ſome inſtances of the Pride and Sauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Monks, in oppreſſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Unmarried Clergy</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95414:9"/>
               <hi>Lanfrank,</hi> a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> of <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> having been raiſed to the Dignity of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the year 1070, he immediately introduced his Brethren the Monks, into the Cathedral Church, who in proceſs of time, by the great power they had at Court, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give their Votes in the Election of the Archbiſhops, together with the Suffragan Biſhops, Chief Prelates, and Great Canons of that Dioceſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards grown Inſolent by the Poſſeſſion of the Relicks of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> they pretended to have alone the power of Electing the Archbiſhop with exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſubordinate Biſhops and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; and not only ſo, but they had the brazen Face to ſend Commands perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily to the Archbiſhops, obliging them to do or undo what they liſted. We have a famous example of both in the Life <hi>Balduinus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> related by <hi>Parker</hi> in his <hi>Britannick Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> Firſt concerning his Election, 'tis ſaid that the Suffragan Biſhops, and the chiefeſt of the Clergy of that Province being aſſembled to join with the Monks
<pb facs="tcp:95414:9"/>
in the Election of a Succeſſour, to <hi>Richard,</hi> Archbiſhop then deceaſed, the Monks refuſed to admit them. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had recourſe to the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but the Monks having only laught at it, they were obliged to addreſs themſelves to the Pope, who ſeeing the juſtice of their cauſe, ſent immediately his Letters to confirm them in their right of electing together with the Monks. The Day for the Election being agreed upon on both ſides, the Prior of the Monks, out of a fantanſtical Humour, abſented himſelf from the Aſſembly, and the Biſhops with the others elected una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly <hi>Balduinus</hi> for their Archbiſhop. This <hi>Balduinus</hi> was a <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monk, a pious and learned man, of a ſweet and moderate temper, and very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to King <hi>Henry</hi> the II. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, the Monks proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Election, as having been made by the Biſhops and the King's Council, and prepared themſelves alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cut out much work for the King at the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Prince very unwilling to have any thing more to do with the Popes,
<pb facs="tcp:95414:10"/>
ſaw himſelf obliged to uſe ſome means or other of accommodation, to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Monks. He deſired the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to be ſo kind for his ſake, and for the love of Peace, as to conſent that the Monks ſhould likewiſe Elect the Archbiſhop, provided they would promiſe to chuſe the ſame perſon, who was already choſen by the Biſhops, <hi>viz. Balduinus.</hi> They aſſented to it, and the Monks ſhewed themſelves ſo much the more willing to comply herewith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he who was propoſed to them, was a Monk, hoping he would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very favourable to them. But this <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who was a very honeſt man, either out of gratitude towards the Biſhops, who elected him firſt, or becauſe he could not ſee without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror the injuſtice of the Monks, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Secular Clergy, ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite otherwiſe affected than they did expect. He declared himſelf a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Epiſcopal Authority, and to re-eſtabliſh it more effectually, he undertook, with the help of the King, and with the Pope's permiſſion, to build a Church at <hi>Hackington</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:95414:10"/>
of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> and to eſtabliſh <note place="margin">Parker Antiq. Brit. in Vita. Balduini.</note>there ſome Secular Clerks and Prebends, with a deſign to meet there very often with the Biſhops. He was at the ſame time willing to introduce Secular Prieſts into the Church of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> uſurped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by the Monks. But theſe made ſo great cries and complaints of it to the Pope, as alſo of the New Church which the Archbiſhop cauſed to be built, that this Pope at laſt granted them their requeſt, ſending a reiterated Order to <hi>Balduinus</hi> to re-eſtabliſh the Monks in St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and moreover to pull down the New Church at <hi>Hackington,</hi> the ſight of which the Monks could not bear. It was then demoliſhed to the ground, and the Materials of it were tranſported to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> which <hi>Balduinus</hi> had bought of the Monks, and where he gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to a Palace, and to a Church for the Archbiſhops there. Nevertheleſs, he could not bring them to perfection, being hindred by the badneſs of the Times, and the continual oppoſition of the Monks.</p>

               <hi>Hubert,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> undertook to make an end of both about the year 1194. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he deputed ſeveral Abbots to the Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to intreat them at the King's deſire and his own, to permit that he might go on with the building of the Church, as a Work purely intended for the Glory of God, and of his Saints. They no ſooner heard of it, but they fell in a rage, and conceived a mortal envy againſt <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi> They raiſed a thouſand Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt him, and ſucceeded ſo well in their devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh deſigns, that an expreſs Order of the Pope came to the Archbiſhop for demoliſhing wholly the Church of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> whoſe building was continued at his own charges, and ſuſpending from any Clerical Office, all thoſe Clergy-men who ſhould be ſo bold as to celebrate therein the Divine Service. The Chappel was then pulled down, and the Archbiſhop having undertook to build another at <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> the Monks oppoſed likewiſe, and hindred him herein. However at laſt, for what
<pb facs="tcp:95414:11"/>
fanſie I know not, being come a little off from their ill humour, they were pleaſed, at the King's Requeſt and of the Lords of the Kingdom, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the building of a Church at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> provided they might preſcribe theſe Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of that Church ſhould not exceed the ſum of an hundred pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>per annum,</hi> nor the number of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, that of twenty: That neither Orders ſhould be Conferred, nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Conſecrated, nor Abbots bleſſed in it: That the Archbiſhop ſhould not have power to make there Holy Chriſm, or Holy Oyl, nor to officiate in it Pontifically. Theſe are part of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Conditions which Archbiſhop <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was obliged to ſubmit to, and which ſhew plainly the inſolence of Monks againſt the Secular Clergy. I ſhall give here one inſtance more of the ſame.</p>

               <hi>Hubert,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canturbury,</hi> was no ſooner fallen a ſleep, but the Monks fearing leſt the King ſhould meddle with the Election, aſſembled themſeves at Midnight in their Chapter, and elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:95414:12"/>
without the Royal Aſſent, <hi>Reginald</hi> their Subprior for Archbiſhop, obliging him to take an Oath, that he would immediately depart for <hi>Rome,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to none his Election until his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival there. But <hi>Reginald</hi> had no ſooner croſſed the Sea, but he divulged what his Brethren had done in his favour. The Monks having had notice of it, were very much offended at it, and for a revenge had recourſe to the King, asking his leave to proceed to another Election. This Prince, giving them good words, deſired they would elect <hi>John Gray,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> which the Monks (enraged againſt their Subprior, whom they called a Traytor) did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly, and he took poſſeſſion of the Archiepiſcopal See, with the uſual Ceremonies. But as ſoon as the news of this double Election was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> took occaſion from that inconſtancy of the Monks, to make uſe of his Authority in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling them both, and obliged the Monks of the two Factions, who were at <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſupport of their Partics, to Elect Cardinal <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:95414:12"/>
very pious and learned Engliſh man, but whom he ſuppoſed to be very much in the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> where he had his firſt Education, and as Cardinal, more yet in the Intereſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt thoſe of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which he had left being very young. Theſe Monks, who the moſt of them had ſworn to the King with Sacred and Inviolable Oaths (as they termed them) that they would never yield to any thing prejudicial to <hi>John Gray,</hi> made no difficulty at all to break them, to pleaſe the Pope. In the mean while, the Biſhops uſed all their endeavours at <hi>Rome</hi> to obtain the reſtauration of their lawful right of Electing their Metropolitan; but the Pope rejected them ſhamefully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed again in ſpight of the King, and of their Remonſtrances the Monks in their Uſurpation.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:95414:13"/>
be ſufficient to ſhew that I had ſome Reaſon to dedicate this ſhort Hiſtory of Monks, (who ought to be conſidered as an Anticlergy) to the Clergy it ſelf, and to that Clergy, which, by God's great Bleſſing, is become a juſt Terror, and a Scourge to them.</p>

               <p>THOSE who have applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to find out the Original of the Monks, do generally agree, that it only proceeded from the Perſecution wherewith the Church from time to time hath been afflicted; the Chriſtians at ſuch times

                  <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at the time of the Perſecution which <hi>Decius</hi> cauſed, fearing to be declared Chriſtian by his Brother in Law, and to be delivered into the hands of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who would have put him to death, fled away into a Deſert, about the year of our Lord, 260. and hid himſelf in a Cave at the foot of a Rock. His Neceſſity and the Beauty of the Place keeping him there; he at laſt ſo much delighted in it, that he never left it during his life. He lived there without any converſation with men, and only upon the fruit of Palms. He died there, being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen years old, having paſt eighty eight of them in this Deſert, entirely unknown to the laſt day of his Life, when St. <hi>Antony</hi> wandring from one Deſert to another, found him by chance, aſſiſted at his Death, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him. This <hi>Antony</hi> was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and great Lover of Solitude. Having got ſeveral together, who followed his Example, he brought them to live in common in little Cells or Cabins near one another, and became their Abbot. So that, as <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have been the firſt Hermite, ſo is <hi>Anthony</hi> to have been the firſt, who took upon him the quality of an Abbot, or Father of a Monaſtery. He died in the 105th year of his Age, in the year of our Lord 361. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having paſt the better part of his Life in Solitude.</p>

Nevertheleſs it was not the Example of theſe two great Men, which only conduced to the ſo much filling of ſeveral of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces with Monks or Solitaries: But alſo the Pagan Philoſophers helped much to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of this new kind of Life, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps gave the firſt Model of it.</p>

                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great having reſtored to the Church that Peace which his Predeceſſors had taken from it, the Chriſtians found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that means in more liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Gentiles. Now there being at that time certain Sects of Pagan Philoſophers, who made a great noiſe in the World; ſome of them having even ſequeſtred themſelves from all humane Commerce, nay quitted their Wives, Children and Poſſeſſions; in a word, affecting to deſpiſe all things to give the better Proofs of the excellency of their own Philoſophy; Some Chriſtians, who ſaw that this ſort of men captivated the people, and paſſed in their Opinions for Admirable and Divine Perſons, ſo being an Obſtacle to the Converſion of the Gentiles, undertook to ſhew them, that the Philoſophy of the Goſpel was by no means inferiour to theirs. They fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied they had found the Precepts of it in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> chap. x. verſ. 29. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is no man that hath left Houſe, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren, or Lands for my ſake and the Goſpels, but he ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and eternal Life.</hi> Interpreting therefore this very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95414:22"/>
according to the Letter, and not in the ſenſe in which it ought to be underſtood, they left all theſe things, and returned into thoſe diſmal Solitudes which before had been their abode in time of Perſecution: Where they covered themſelves with great Frocks to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from other Chriſtians, in like manner as the Pagan Philoſophers were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from other Men by their great Robes with Fringes. This was that which made peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to call them Philoſophers; and that ſort of Life which they profeſſed, Philoſophy. Thus it is that <hi>Sozomen,</hi> a very ancient Author, and great Admirer of that Monkiſh ſort of Life, ſpeaks of them. <hi>Here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is what I could learn of the wonderful life of theſe holy Solitaries, who are the Philoſophers of our Religion.</hi> The ſame Author relates a great many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by the Monks; whether it were that God was willing by that means to give a kind of approbation of the ſimplicity of their hearts; or that the Church, being then, as it were, in its infancy, he continued to confirm the Truth of the Goſpel by Miracles wrought by thoſe perſons, who made the greateſt ſhew of Religion: Or laſtly, Whether they were in thoſe times men as ſubject to illuſions as there hath been ſince: However great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Vices and Errors which crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Solitaries, plainly ſhewed that this condition of Life was not in itſelf holy, and that even one day, it might prove the fatal Gate by which infinite Novelties might be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95414:22"/>
brought into the Church. For ſome of them thought that Prayers were not acceptable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs offered up in ſolitary places, or at leaſt in Gardens apart from the Cities. Others maintained, That man could never arrive to perfection without renouncing Marriage; and that to pleaſe God, it was abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to abſtain from eating any thing that had life, and even from Bread it ſelf. Laſtly, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were of opinion, that a Chriſtian was obliged by his condition, not only to mortifie, but even to deſtroy Nature by indiſcreet Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Not to ſpeak of many who zealouſly miſtook virtue; witneſs him who ſhut his eyes <note place="margin">Ammonio Teſte.</note>becauſe he would not ſeé his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who came a great way to viſit him: And another, who being deſired to accept a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, cut one of his Ears off, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to cut out his Tongue alſo if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to preſs him any farther, that by that means he might be incapable of exerciſing the Functions of it.

What doeſt thou do in Cities, who art called Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary?</hi> I find that there was already in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> four ſorts of Monks or Solitaries about the middle of the fourth Age.</p>
               <p>The firſt was of thoſe who, following the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> and firſt Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, retired into Deſerts, living without the leaſt communication, in Caves betwixt Rocks, or in the middle of Foreſts. The ſecond were thoſe who lived in Cells at ſome diſtance one from another: They met together on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain days of the week to pray, which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they called <hi>Synaxis</hi> or <hi>Communion.</hi> They there heard the ſhort Sayings and <hi>Apothegms</hi> of their Elders, and of thoſe whom they thought the moſt advanced in the perfection of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical Life. The third were thoſe who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in common in a Monaſtery, under the direction of one Abbot, whom they obeyed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95414:23"/>
as their Father; <hi>(Abbot,</hi> being a <hi>Syriac</hi> word which ſignifies Father.) Each Abbot had a particular Rule, ſuch as his Prudence or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſuggeſted to him. Laſtly, The fourth ſort of Monks, were thoſe who lived in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. <hi>Paoomius</hi> was the firſt who inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of them, that is to ſay, who made one Rule to be obſerved in ſeveral Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. His Monks were called <hi>Tabenniſiens,</hi> from the firſt Monaſtery which he founded at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benneſe</hi> in <hi>Thebais;</hi> and all the other Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries acknowledged this Houſe as the Mother and Chief of the whole Order. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Euſtatius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sebaſte,</hi> about the ſame time inſtituted a Congregation of Monks, who ſpread themſelves in <hi>Armenia, Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>Pontus.</hi> He gave them a Rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he marked out to them the whole manner of their Life, the Food they were to abſtain from, the Habits to be worn by them, and other like practices. Now ſince theſe are properly thoſe ſorts of Congregations which we call Religious Orders, and which I intend to treat of, I ſhall begin to ſet forth the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Rules of theſe two Orders, the <hi>Taben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtens</hi> and the <hi>Euſtatiens,</hi> which are the two firſt which I could meet with in ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

His account of the firſt is as follows, <q>
                     <hi>Pacomius</hi> the Chief, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutor of the Monks, called <hi>Tabenniſiens,</hi> flouriſhed in the ſame place (in <hi>Egypt)</hi> and at the ſame time, <hi>(Anno</hi> 350.) His Monks are cloathed with Skins, as was <hi>Elias,</hi> to reſiſt, like him, the concupiſcence tending to Pleaſure. 'Tis ſaid the differences which are remarkable in their Habits have ſomething myſterious in them, and relation to ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of their Holy Philoſophy. They wear Caſoks without Sleeves, to ſhew their hands are never to be ready to do evil; and Hoods, to ſignifie they ought to live in the ſame ſimplicity or innocncy as Children, who have on their Heads Caps of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. The Girdle and a ſort of Saſh which they wear, admoniſhed them that they ſhould be always ready to ſerve God. 'Tis ſaid <hi>Pacomius,</hi> at firſt, lived by himſelf in a Grotto, but that an Angel commanded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95414:24"/>
him to aſſemble ſome young Monks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to teach them that Rule which he would give him. 'Tis added moreover, That the Angel gave him a Table, which is to this day in the hands of thoſe Solitaries, in which it was ordered him to ſuffer every one to eat, to drink, to faſt, to work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities; to oblige thoſe who eat, to harder labour than thoſe who faſt; to build many Cells, to lodge their Monks in each, to make them to eat in a common Refectory in ſilence, with a Vail on their Heads: That they ought to wear little Woollen Caps, adorned with red Nails; to ſleep in their Cloaths upon Chairs inſtead of Beds: To receive the Sacrament every firſt and laſt days of the Week, having firſt ungirded themſelves, and left off their Garments made of Skins; to pray twelve times in the Day, and as many in the Evening, doing the ſame in the Night; to ſing a Pſalm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grace at Meals; to divide the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in four and twenty Companies and to denominate each of them from the four and twenty Letters of the Alphabet, ordering that the letter I ſhould be given to the moſt ſimple amongſt them, and the Letters <hi>Z</hi> and <hi>X,</hi> to thoſe who were moſt perfect. Theſe are the Rules which <hi>Pacomius</hi> gave to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who multiplied in ſuch numbers, that there were thirteen hundred of them in the place called <hi>Tabenneſe,</hi> the others being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed into <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Thebais.</hi>

As for the <hi>Euſtatiens, Sozomen</hi> gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them at the end of the ſame Chapter. <q>Tis ſaid that <hi>Euſtatius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sebaste</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> hath inſtituted an Order of Monks, and given them Rules. Some will have him to be the Author of the <hi>Aſcetica,</hi> attributed commonly to <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> They ſay that too great Auſterity carried him into very extravagant Obſervances, nay quite contrary to the Rules of the Church. Some nevertheleſs endeavour to clear him of theſe Imputations, and caſt the blame upon ſome of his Diſciples, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Marriage, deſpiſe married Prieſts; who faſt on <hi>Sundays,</hi> and cannot abide thoſe that eat Fleſh; who inſtead of cloathing themſelves as the others do, have invented a new and extraordinary Habit, and brought in a world of other Novelties. They ſay that a great many Women, deceived by their Diſcourſes, and infected with their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, have ſeparated themſelves from their Husbands, and not being able afterwards to keep themſelves Chaſte, have committed Adulteries. 'Tis farther ſaid, that ſome of them have cut their Hair, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Mens Apparel. The Biſhops about <hi>Gangres,</hi> the metropolitan City of <hi>Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> being aſſembled together, have excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated thoſe who were the followers of ſuch Maxims, unleſs they did recant. Since that time, they ſay, <hi>Euſtatius</hi> changed his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and did not appear cloathed otherwiſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95414:25"/>
than the other Prieſts, being willing to ſhew that what he did was not out of Pride, but out of a deſire to attain greater perfection.</q> Thus far <hi>Sozomen</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Euſtatiens.</hi>

               <p>THE Devil was too much concerned in the eſtabliſhment of Monaſtical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not to make it his buſineſs in that very beginning to promote them. He made uſe of ſome Inſtruments of Wickedneſs to divulge, that an Angel brought this Rule from Heaven to <hi>Pacomius,</hi> in like manner as the Law of God was given to <hi>Moſes</hi> upon two Tables of Stone. But there is a great deal of difference betwixt theſe two Laws or Rules. The Law given to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> containeth nothing but what is well-becoming the Holineſs of God, who is the Author of it; whereas <hi>Pacomius</hi> his Rules are in many particulars very defective, not to ſay ridiculous. For what virtue had thoſe Garments made of Skins towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Concupiſcence? Were they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very fit for the increaſing of it? What
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95414:26"/>
was the meaning of thoſe Caps with red Nails? likewiſe of thoſe Veils which they were to have on their Heads at Meals? In placing three in each Cell; did not this give them an occaſion to break their ſilence? And that which ſeems to me yet more unreaſonable, the diſtinction they made between raw and imperfect Monks, and the more perfect and great Wits; was it not enough to diſcourage them which were marked but with an <hi>Iota,</hi> and to puff up the others with a great deal of Pride, who were eſteemed worthy of the Letters <hi>Z</hi> and <hi>X</hi>? How then can any one imagine that God could be the Author of ſuch Whimſies, which even Humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath corrected in following Ages? For indeed we do not find any ſuch practices ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Cloiſters now a days. But it muſt be acknowledged, that to give better credit to men's Inventions, there is no way more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, than boldly to give out, that they come from Heaven. Nevertheleſs this Order had ſo good ſucceſs, that <hi>Pacomius</hi> ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a very ſhort time Father of above nine thouſand Monks, who lived under his Rule, as well in Deſerts as Monaſteries. We do not find at this time any Monaſtery which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that ancient Rule. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> tranſlated it into Latin, and it is to be ſeen at the end of <hi>Caſſian</hi>'s Works. <hi>Palladius</hi> alſo makes an abridgment of it in the <hi>Lauzaick</hi> Hiſtory. <hi>Pacomius</hi> lived at the beginning of the firſt Century, and died in the year 405. I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95414:26"/>
come now to ſpeak of the Order of the <hi>Euſtatiens,</hi> which multiplied alſo conſiderably, but withall apparently ſhews, that the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Life went not very far without becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſource of Errors in the Church, being already of it ſelf a kind of Schiſm, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of greater Perfection. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Errors wherewith the <hi>Eustatiens</hi> were charged, were theſe, That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Marriage, deſpiſed married Prieſts, had their meetings in private Houſes, and had invented a new and unaccuſtomed ſort of Garment. This was the reaſon why the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, about <hi>Gangres,</hi> aſſembled in a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Council, thundred with Anathema's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Monks of their Juriſdictions, who adhered to ſuch practices. This ſhews plainly, that Marriage was ſo far from being prohibited to Prieſts in thoſe times, that they were counted Hereticks who thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to Celibacy, or would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by any Habit, different from that of the Laicks or ſecular Clergy. <hi>Eustatius</hi> humbled himſelf, or at leaſt feigned ſo to do, left all his Practices, and the Monaſtick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. I leave now the Roman Catholicks to judge, if their Monks be not guilty of ſuch, and greater Innovations, and whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> had not great cauſe to cut them off from its Body, having ſo good an Example of an Age, which excepting ſome few Errors into which they were fallen, did not in purity come behind that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>

                     <hi>BASIL,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> being perſecuted by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> his Biſhop, withdrew himſelf to a ſolitary place in <hi>Pontus,</hi> where he applied his mind wholly to Pious Studies. Great numbers of Solitaries having <note place="margin">Vadianus lib. de tribus terrae par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</note>met with him there, he undertook to inſtruct them, and converted his Deſert into a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed School of Divinity and Philoſophy; being alſo very careful to bring them up in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſtian Virtues. Therefore he gave them Rules, not much unlike to them which are preſcribed in Colleges and well governed Accademies. Notwithſtanding, that Rule which is commonly attributed to him, is ſo <note place="margin">Hoſpinian. de Orig. Monachat. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>95.</hi>
                     </note>different from St. <hi>Baſil's</hi> ſtile, and ſo variouſly related, that there is ground enough to doubt whether he indeed wrote it. In ſome Copies it hath but 35 Chapters, in others 95; and again in ſome others even a 100. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who was contemporary with him, his Fellow-ſcholar, and great Friend, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not a word of it in the Elogy which he wrote of his Life and Death; though he takes notice withall of ſeveral little Works of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> of leſſer moment than this Rule is. However, ſolitary Life is quite otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95414:27"/>
there, than that Monkiſh one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Vows, and a world of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions amongſt the Romaniſts now a-days. This Rule is writ by way of Dialogue, in which <hi>Baſil</hi> anſwereth the demands of his Diſciples, and is ſo large, that it makes alone a great Volume. Therefore to give a leſs te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious draught of it to my Reader, I thought fit to ſeparate what is in it purely Monaſtick, from the common Duties of Honeſty or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which belong to all men; to the end that one may ſee what the Monaſtical Inſtitutions have added to the Goſpel. I ſhall then, for an example, leave the Firſt, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and the Third Chapters which enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to love God with all their Hearts, Soul and Strength, and their Neighbour as themſelves: The fifteenth, which commands that they ſhould ſerve God with upright hearts, and all fervency of affection; the 75th which bids them to hate Sin, and make Gods Law their delight; and all the reſt of that kind, which containing the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Duties of Chriſtian Life, ought not to be look'd upon as Rules given by <hi>Baſil</hi> to Monks only, but as the Law of God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his only Son, given to all of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever condition they be. I ſhall likewiſe omit certain common Duties of Society, which do generally belong to all well-ruled Houſes and Families, as the 16th Chapter, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he who is the head of them ought to conſider himſelf as Gods Miniſter; the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95414:28"/>
59th bidding the Steward to be truſty and honeſt; for why ſhould theſe and other ſuch be called <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Rules, which are common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reaſon, or obligations binding, even thoſe, who, by a very improper diſtinction, are called Seculars and men of the World? Thus have I ordered the matter, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that great Rule, which goes commonly under the name of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> to 25 Chapters, that ſeem to relate more to a Monaſtick Life.</p>

                  <p>Beſides theſe twentyfive Chapters, there is another wholly Monaſtick, but which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper to him who is the Director of the Nuns. That when he confeſſes a Nun or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe, he ought to do it with decency in the preſence of the Abbeſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Monaſtical Inſtitutions. His Order flouriſhed particularly in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where almoſt all thoſe who lived in Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

It increaſed to admiration afterwards; but ſince theſe Countries are fallen into the hands of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, the moſt part of thoſe Monaſteries have been deſtroyed. Nevertheleſs it is to be ſeen with ſome ſplendor in <hi>Greece,</hi> where it hath ſtill continued ſince the ſeparation of that Church from the Romiſh.

They wear on their Heads a Hood which reacheth to the Shoulders. They wear no Linnen, ſleep without Sheets upon the Straw, eat no Fleſh, faſt very often, and Till the ground with their own hands. There are alſo ſome Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Order of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria,</hi> of which that of St. <hi>Saviour</hi> of <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> is the Chief, and was founded in the year 1057. by <hi>Robert Guiſcard</hi> of <hi>Normandy.</hi> It hath the pre-eminency over all the others: They uſe in their Office the Greek Tongue, though ſome in <hi>Spain</hi> make uſe of the Romiſh Breviary, being alſo ſomewhat different from the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Habits. There are alſo ſome Monaſteries of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Principal founded by <hi>Nilus,</hi> near <hi>Tivoli</hi> or <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> is called <hi>Crypta Ferrata.</hi> But at preſent, thoſe, as well as the other <hi>Italian</hi> Monks are very much corrupted. We ſee likewiſe Monks of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who differ alſo from the others in the Colour and Faſhion of their Habits: They wear a long
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95414:30"/>
Caſock, a <hi>Patience</hi> or <hi>Scapulary,</hi> a Frock with large Sleeves, a Hood or <hi>Caputium,</hi> and over it a broad flat Cap. They are much eſteemed amongſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> and paſs amongſt them for very Religious Perſons. All theſe Monks, beſides the Rule of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who is very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in his Precepts, and preſcribed almoſt nothing elſe but the Duties of Chriſtian Life; have alſo their particular Conſtitutions, which have been eſtabliſhed, refined, and changed from time to time by their Superiors or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Chapters. So that if we compare them now with the ancient Rule attributed to St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> we ſhall ſee a ſtrange difference, which demonſtrates the Corruptions and Novelties of the Greek and Latin Churches.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE New Orders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to get themſelves Reputation and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, have not been wanting to make their greateſt efforts to perſwade the Ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the moſt Famous Men, who anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently flouriſhed in the Church, have been the Inſtitutors of their Rules and Orders. After this manner the Regular Canons and the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, called <hi>Auguſtinians,</hi> pretend that this great Doctor of the Church writ and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame Rules they do; imitating in that the <hi>Heronimitains,</hi> who have violently forced St. <hi>Hierom</hi> on their ſide. The truth is, that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> having been made Biſhop of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hoſpin. de Orig. Mon. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note>in <hi>Africa,</hi> lived in common with his Canons in a ſeparate Cloiſter near the Cathedral, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the almoſt general and worthy coſtom of the Biſhops of thoſe times; and which continued ſome conſiderable time after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But nevertheleſs they were not Monks by this manner of living, being obliged nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confinement, nor to Monaſtick Vows and Practices. So St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> lived with his Canons, whom he brought up as in a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95414:32"/>
where they were inſtructed in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Piety, and in the ſtudies of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Divinity, to render them capable to take upon them the adminiſtration of the Churches whereto they might be called, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Paſtors or Biſhops. 'Tis then in vain that the Religious Congregations of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> who continue ſtill in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and who have other very different Conſtitutions, pretend that this was the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of their Orders. Furthermore, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> wrote no Statutes or Rules; and at moſt we find but ſome Precepts which he wrote, perhaps for ſome pious Women, who lived in ſociety with his Siſter. Notwithſtanding as the three Rules, which falſly bear the name of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſerve at preſent as a foundation to ſeveral Religious Orders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; I will therefore here briefly relate the ſubſtance of them.</p>

                  <p>IN the Prologue, the Monks are ordered to love God and their Neighbour, and in the Chapters to obſerve the following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ought to poſſeſs nothing but in common.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Superior ought to diſtribute every thing in the Monaſtery with proportion to every ones neceſſity.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. They ought to honour God in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being become his holy Temples.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They muſt attend to Prayer at Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hours.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The only buſineſs at Church is to pray, and if any have a mind to do it out of the time of Canonical Hours, he ought not to be hindred.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They muſt perform their Prayers with attention, ſinging only what is appointed to be ſung.</p>

                  <p>THE Church of St. <hi>John Lateran</hi> hath had for ſome Ages, Regular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to officiate in it. Thoſe of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which is erected under his name, falſly maintain, that they were eſtabliſhed there from the very time that it was built by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine;</hi> and that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> afterwards brought from <hi>Africa</hi> Diſciples of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who had been uſed to live in Common in the Church of <hi>Hippo:</hi> But the truth is, that the Regular Canons of <hi>Lateran,</hi> ſuch as they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, were not introduced till the year 1061, by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Second, who having found that the Canons had left the Canonical Obſervances, ſent thither Regular Canons from St. <hi>Frigdian</hi> of <hi>Luca,</hi> who there eſtabliſhed the novelty of their Inſtitution, and this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Father Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linet,</hi> Reg. Canon of S. <hi>Genev.</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in his Hiſt. of Reg.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95414:37"/>
they came, and put in their places Secular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. They lived thus in the Secular State till the year 1446, when <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, a great lover of Monks, made thirty of them with a Prior, come again from St. <hi>Frigdian,</hi> and reeſtabliſhed them in the poſſeſſion of the Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi> ordering that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſhould be henceforwards called by the name of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran;</hi> but Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Firſt drove them away again from thence; and reeſtabliſhed the Regular Canons, where they are continued to this very day. To quiet theſe poor Monks, ſo ſhamefully expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Church of our Lady of the Peace in <hi>Rome</hi> was given to them. Notwithſtanding this hard blow, they lived ſtill in a Body, called the Congregation of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and they poſſeſs yet to this day in <hi>Italy</hi> a great number of Monaſteries. Their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is a White Woollen Caſock, which reacheth to their Heels; and over it they have a kind of a Surplice, which they call a Rochet, made of Linnen, having the form of a Shirt, for which they are now commonly called in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Shirted Fathers, or Fathers of the Shirt. They gravely pretend to have their origin from the Apoſtle St. <hi>James,</hi> the Greater, and from St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt, or at leaſt from <note place="margin">Hoſpin. de Orig. Mon.</note>St. <hi>Augustin:</hi> But indeed the Canons of thoſe times, which they would have for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were very different in their practices from what theſe are. They frequently appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the ſtudy of the Holy Bible,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95414:37"/>
were Helps and Suffragans to the Biſhops, preached and taught in publick, and were not bound to their Profeſſion by Monaſtical Vows; whereas the Regular Canons of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and other like Congregations of whom we are to ſpeak hereafter, are no more than a lazy ſort of Fellows, who ſpend idlely their lives, thinking to have performed all the Canonical and Apoſtolical Duties, when they have ſung in their Quire, at ſome ſtated hours, a certain number of Pſalms and Prayers; who make a Vow of Obedience, and will have into the bargain that their Superior ſhall command nothing but what they liſt, a Vow of Poverty; being well aſſured before of a good proviſion which is already made for them: And laſtly a Vow of Chaſtity, till they find an opportunity to ſatisfie their Luſtful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Their Scandalous Lives were the reaſons of their being ſo often chaſed from St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran;</hi> and yet they continue ſtill the ſame in thoſe many Monaſteries, which this Congregation is in poſſeſſion of at this preſent time in <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <p>ALthough this Rule hath been extreamly exalted by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have declared that it was dictated to St. <hi>Benet</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf; nevertheleſs, they who do rightly conſider it, will eaſily find, that beſides many ſuperſtitious and falſe Doctrines compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Rule, the lxix Chapter is very cruel and inhumane, the lxviii very raſh and preſumptuous; and that every where this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> who was of a high and imperious Spirit, endeavours to eſtabliſh his tyrannical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over his Monks, under pretext to have them obey Chriſt; and eſtabliſhing, as he does in the liii Chapter, a Kitchin a-part for the Abbot and Strangers, <hi>Qui nunquam deſunt Monaſterio,</hi> of whom the Monaſtery is never empty, as it is ſpecified in the ſame Chapter, and for whoſe ſakes he muſt always break his faſt; it followeth from thence, that he took a particular care of his own Belly, and that of his Succeſſors the Abbots, being reſolved to obſerve but very ſeldom the Faſts. I have very often had the honour to eat with the Abbots of the Order of St. <hi>Benet</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> and do well know with what ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95414:62"/>
and delicacy they treat themſelves on the account of this part of that Rule. As for St. <hi>Benet,</hi> as I cannot ſpeak ſo poſitively of him, let us hear what his own Diſciples have ſaid of him. He orders in the xxxix Chapter a pound of Bread to each Monk for his Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of which a part muſt be reſerved for Supper; and in the following Chapter, he gives them a meaſure of Wine, which he calls <hi>Hemin.</hi> But the Fathers of Mount <hi>Caſſin,</hi> in their Declarations on this Rule ſay, That this portion of Bread is exorbitant, the pound of <note place="margin">Declar. Caſſin. in Reg. S. Ben. ſuper cap. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note>the Monaſtery of <hi>Caſſin</hi> being of thirty three ounces and an half, therefore they would have given to their Monks no more than what is neceſſary. <hi>Cum pondus librae ut habuimus à Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterio Caſſinenſi, ſit unciarum triginta trium &amp; ſemis: ut vix tantum panis unus Frater die un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Conſt. S. Juſt. in cap. <hi>11.</hi> Reg. S.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95414:62"/>
cocta Fratribus ſufficiant,</hi> where by the word <hi>Pulmentaria</hi> may be meant (as they ſuppoſe) Pullets. We ſee then by the Teſtimony of the Religious of that Order, that their St. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> was very extravagant in his meaſures, and perhaps he did it for to hinder his Monks from murmuring at the good Chear he made himſelf. For what belongs to the Poverty which he ſo often preaches in his Rule, one may eaſily ſee what was the practice of it by the opulency of the Monaſtery of <hi>Caſſin</hi> in St. <hi>Benets</hi> time, of which I have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the eighth Chapter. And a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the ſame Monaſtery of <hi>Caſſin</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo great a poverty, that it alone poſſeſſed but

All which, either to the Spiritual, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porat Part, appertained to the Monaſtery of <hi>Caſſin.</hi> This was to renounce the World rightly, while ſo many thouſands of poor people died with hunger in <hi>Italy,</hi> as one may gather from the publick miſeries of that time.

                  <hi>BENET,</hi> when living, ſent two of his moſt beloved Diſciples, <hi>Maurus</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidus,</hi> one into <hi>France,</hi> and the other into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> for to found there ſome Monaſteries. They made there in a ſhort time a wonderful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs by the favourable diſpoſition of ſeveral great Lords, who did help them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. It hapned alſo beyond <hi>Benet</hi>'s intention, and by a particular providence of God, who draws good from evil when he pleaſeth, that ſome years after his death, many of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries became well indowed Colleges, wherein Youth were inſtructed, and Sciences did flouriſh. Becauſe as in that time the moſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> was not yet converted to the Chriſtian Faith, or was lately brought over to it, there was need of good learned men to convert and confirm the people in the Doctrin of the Goſpel. The Chriſtian Princes, conſidering <note place="margin">Trithem. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi> de Monaſt. &amp; Monach. Bened.</note>the advantages of retirement for Studies, and that <hi>Benet</hi>'s Rule did contain, for the moſt part, Statutes very proper for the adminiſtration of a College, they founded many Monaſteries of his Order, with the intent they ſhould teach
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95414:64"/>
in them not only their young Monks, but all others who would come there to board. Hence it was that the manual labour which, according to St. <hi>Benet</hi>'s Rule, took up the beſt part of the day, was ſhortned, if not quite releaſed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Students; and thoſe who had not wit enough in their heads to apply themſelves ſeriouſly to ſtudies, and to compoſe Books, found enough in their Fingers to Tranſcribe, Bind and guild them. This in a very ſhort time did furniſh all the Monaſteries with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Libraries, that were a great help to their Studies, becauſe Printing not being uſed in thoſe times, all Books being in Writing, were extream dear, and thoſe Seculars, who had not the advantage of the Libraries of Monks, were not able to have many. This gave then fair opportunity to the Religious of becoming learned, and what encouraged them more yet, was, that on the account of their Learning, they were called to Biſhopricks and other Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, even to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy it ſelf. In an old Table of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Order of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> I find 28 Popes, 200 Cardinals, 1600 Archbiſhops, 4000 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. The principal Monaſteries where Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Learned Men did flouriſh with great reputation, were thoſe of <hi>Fulda, Milan, Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauge, Auxerre,</hi> St. <hi>Martins</hi> of <hi>Treves, Hirsfeld, Rheims,</hi> St. <hi>Gall,</hi> St. <hi>Denis, Wiſſembourg, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesbury</hi> in <hi>England, Corbie, Neubourg, Altendorf, Luxevil,</hi> and a great many others, the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which might prove perhaps too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

Theſe were the Golden Ages of the Monks, very different from thoſe of our times. It was then that the Abbies of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Benet</hi> became ſo rich by the great and noble gifts which the Princes and great Lords gave them, as an encouragement to the learned. By which means the Abbots became themſelves great and mighty Lords, and got <note place="margin">Bruſch. lib. de Germ. Monaſt.</note>magnificent Titles. The Abbot of <hi>Augia</hi> the Rich, in <hi>Germany,</hi> has yearly 60000 Golden Crowns, and in his Monaſtery were received none but Princes, Earls and Barons.

Should I treat here in particular of all the Abbies of the Order of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> this could not be done without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great Volume. They were formerly above 15000 in number, but they are now a great deal more. As the intentions of thoſe who founded Monaſteries were very various, I ſhall here relate ſome of the principal motives which gave riſe to theſe Foundations.</p>

               <head type="sub">What were the motives to the Founding of ſo many Monaſteries.</head>
               <p>SOME, as I have already ſaid, had a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereto, the making attonement for their Extorſions, Paricides and Robberies, and hoped they had done it in great meaſure, by employing part of what they had pillaged or ſtollen, in founding Monaſteries; ſuch was the infatuation of thoſe times. Others indeed carried by a truly noble Spirit and good Zeal, founded many of them to favour Virtue and Letters; witneſs <hi>Oſwaldus</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> who founded ſeveral, <hi>Ut inventus in</hi>

                  <hi>iis bonis Literis &amp; Moribus imbui ac erudiri poſſet,</hi> to the end that Youth ſhould be inſtructed in them, both in Learning and good Manners. Not very long after, the Falſe Doctrin of Proper Merit, and of applying the Merits of one man to another, having crept into the Church, the moſt impious and wicked under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to lay foundations, with this infamous Bargain, that while they gave themſelves up to all ſorts of Crimes and ſinful Courſes, the Monks ſhould pray and merit Heaven for them and their Poſterity. A fourth reaſon which perſwaded a great many perſons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, particularly of the tenth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95414:66"/>
to found Monaſteries, was a falſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had imbibed, that the World would come to an end with that Age. This does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the old Charters of Donation of thoſe <note place="margin">Stum. in Chron. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>

capricious thoughts, to found Monaſteries, as may be ſeen in ſeveral Charters of the old Foundations. I will relate here one or two Examples to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agnes,</hi> Wife to <hi>Leopold</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> being very importunate with her Husband for the foundation of a Monaſtery, the Veil which ſhe had on her head was carried away by the wind into a neighbouring Foreſt; and <hi>Leopold</hi> going a hunting ſome years after, in that very place in the Wood where he found it, built a Monaſtery.</p>
               <p>The great and powerful Monaſtery of the <hi>Vines,</hi> in the Dioceſe of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>Caprice,</hi> yet more curious, in the year <note place="margin">Bruſ. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Counteſs called <hi>Irmentrude,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that a poor Woman was delivered of three Children at a Birth, reproached her with Adultery, ſaying, that it could not be otherwiſe, and that ſhe deſerved the ſeverity of the Law. This ſame Lady was delivered the year following of twelve Children, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, in the abſence of the Count her Husband, who was gone into the Country. Fearing then leſt the raſh Judgment which ſhe had paſſed upon the poor Woman, might juſtly fall upon her ſelf, ſhe ordered, being willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the thing from her Husband, that only one of theſe little Children ſhould be kept, and the reſt drowned in the River. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was intruſted with that cruel Office, was by chance met by the Count on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Country, who asked what ſhe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95414:67"/>
carried in her Apron? She anſwered, It was little Puppies which ſhe went to drown. The Earl was very importunate to ſee them, and the Woman being ſo very much preſt, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd the whole myſtery to him. He ſeeing theſe eleven little Children, all living, gave order that they ſhould be brought up in a Country Houſe, without giving notice of it to the Lady Counteſs, who remained ſtill in the belief that her Orders had been executed. Six years after the Earl made theſe eleven young Lords, richly cloathed, to come before their Mother, who asked her ſmiling, whether ſhe knew them. The Counteſs finding her ſelf guilty in her Conſcience, and not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning but theſe were the eleven Children whom ſhe had ſent to be drowned, fell at her Husbands Feet, asked pardon for her Fault, which was immediately granted her: And for an acknowledgment of ſo great and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence of God towards theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as well as to attone for the Crime of their Mother, he converted his Palace of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> into a Monaſtery, that was afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and enriched by the liberalities of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Princes.</p>

So that towards the end of the ninth Age, this Order was fallen into an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable remiſſneſs; and it was in the year 912, that <hi>Oden,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cluny</hi> in <hi>Burgondy,</hi> in the Dioceſe of <hi>Macon,</hi> a man learned indeed, but a great Hypocrite, and a Counterfeiter of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, undertook to repair, or rather to give a new Life to the ancient obſervances of the Order. He begun with his own Monaſtery of <hi>Cluny,</hi> where he eſtabliſhed the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was imitated by above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Monaſteries, and rendred <hi>Cluny</hi> ſo famous, that from time to time, Monks were elected thence to govern the Church of <hi>Rome. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frede,</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> was very diligent to tranſlate this Reformation of <hi>Cluny</hi> into her Kingdom, for by her means it was eſtabliſhed there the ſame year that it begun in <hi>Cluny.</hi>

This <hi>Vermin</hi> extended it ſelf, under pretence of Piety, into all the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe;</hi> but it was in effect the work of the Devil, who hath always mightily endeavoured to eſtabliſh Monaſteries; and rather than to ſuffer them intirely to periſh, ſeeing how much they have already profited him in introducing new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins and damnable Maxims into the Church, he would bear with a reformation. It was manifeſt that God had no hand in this, ſince a while afterwards theſe new Reformiſts fell into a relapſe worſe than the former, of which <note place="margin">Petrus Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas Clunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci lib. <hi>6.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>7.</hi>

                     <hi>Peter,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cluny,</hi> mightily complains in theſe terms. <q>Our Brethren, ſaith he, deſpiſe God, and having paſt all ſhame, eat Fleſh now all the days of the week except <hi>Fryday,</hi> not only in ſecret but in publick alſo, boaſting of their ſin like thoſe of <hi>Sodom.</hi> They run here and there, and as Kites and Vultures flie with great ſwiftneſs where the moſt ſmoak of the Kitchin is, or where they ſmell the beſt Roaſt and Boil'd.

                  <p>THE Monaſtery of St. <hi>Juſtina</hi> at <hi>Padoua,</hi> in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territory, being much fallen from its firſt Splendor, they had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Rome</hi> to introduce in it the <hi>Olivetan</hi> Monks.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95414:70"/>
to make it good, gave his Poſſeſſion to <hi>Romuald,</hi> who built there in the year 1009. about twenty Cells for Hermits (which place is called to this day the <hi>Sacred Deſert)</hi> and ſome miles lower a Monaſtery where the Monks lead an eaſier life, and furniſh the Hermits on the top with all neceſſaries. I have given to the publick a deſcription of theſe two places, and laid open the Frauds of theſe Monks in the third of my Letters, pag. 119. One ought nevertheleſs to confeſs that theſe Hermits of the <hi>Sacred Deſert,</hi> and the others of the ſame Habit, who have all ſet their Hermitages in places frightful to Nature, are the Religious of <hi>Italy,</hi> who live with more auſterity and retirement from converſing with the World. But their illuſion is yet the greater, that they believe themſelves to be in thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſolitudes as in well ſecured Havens of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and, as Phariſees, are fully conceited with their own holineſs and merits, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in ſuch manner the fooliſh imaginations of their hearts, to all the good works which one may practiſe in the World with leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and more edification of his Neighbour. As for thoſe Monks of <hi>Camaldoli,</hi> who make a body of a Congregation by themſelves, they are now in the ſame depth of Corruption as the other <hi>Italian</hi> Monks. <hi>Romuald</hi> their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lived 120 years, and died in the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Val di Caſtro</hi> in the Marſh of <hi>Ancona</hi> in the year 1027. They wear white Cloaths, to wit, a Caſock, a long Scapulary and a Hood,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95414:70"/>
and a ſtately Gown with large Sleeves. But the Hermits wear only ſhort Cloaths, <hi>viz.</hi> a Caſock, a Scapulary and a Hood.</p>
                  <p>There is yet in <hi>Italy</hi> another Congregation of Hermits of St. <hi>Romuald,</hi> called otherwiſe of the Mount of the Crown. <hi>Paul Juſtinian,</hi> a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> begun their eſtabliſhment in the year 1520, founding a Monaſtery ten miles from <hi>Perugia</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>Apennin,</hi> on the Mountain of the Crown, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Church of it to the Saviour of the World, in the year 1555. They differ but little from thoſe of <hi>Camalduli,</hi> and in the year 1523 there was a kind of union amongſt them. Their Habit is a ſhort Caſock, a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulary, and a Cloak on their Shoulders which falls a little lower than their Knees, the whole being of a white Wooll. It was ſuperfluous indeed to found an Order ſo like to that of <hi>Camalduli,</hi> had not this <hi>Paul Juſtinian</hi> had the vanity ſo common to thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Orders, to make himſelf the Head of a Party.</p>

He wrote there a Rule, or rather a Rapſody, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſeveral things got together from the Rule of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> from that of Regular Canons, and of what he could find moſt ſuperſtitious in the Hermits manner of Life, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his Diſciples as an infallible way to Heaven.

They have got the name of being very good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and what hath yet more contributed to the conſervation of their Riches, was, that the Superiors of this Order never took upon themſelves the Title of Abbots, but were always called Priors. So that when the Abbies, by an agreement with the Popes, were put in Commands, the Charter-houſes, which were not called by that name, were not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended amongſt them, and conſequently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their Revenues was taken away from them.

him, was delivered from the Sacred Fire; and contrariwiſe, thoſe who blaſphemed, or took the Name of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in vain, were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the Saints unmerciful vengeance, delivered up to it. This gave occaſion to one <hi>Gaſton Frank,</hi> in company with ſome other perſons, to inſtitute in the year of our Lord 1095, the Religion of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> whoſe principal care was to ſerve thoſe ſick, who were tormented by the Sacred Fire.

They have this mark <hi>T</hi> of a blew Colour on the left ſide of their Cloaths. The Papiſts do repreſent Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> with a Fire kindled at his Side, to ſignifie by this, that he delivers people from the Sacred Fire. They paint beſides, a Hog near to him as a ſign, that he cures the Beaſts of all Diſeaſes; and to honour him in ſeveral places, they keep, at common charges, a Hog, which they call St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Hog, and for which they have great veneration. Many others will have St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Picture upon the Walls of their Houſes, hoping by that to be preſerved from the Plague. And the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> who did not know the true ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fire painted at his Side, thought that he preſerved Houſes alſo from being burnt, and they call upon him on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

Normandy, Flanders, England, Spain,</hi> and other Countries. They wear a white Caſock and a Rochet over it, with a long white Cloak.

Having been both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed (as the Papiſts ſay) in a Dream to go to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. accordingly they went.

A hideous Phantom (they ſay) while he was ſaying Maſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him the day before, all in white, with a Croſs half Red and half Blew on his Breaſt, holding with his Hands two Slaves bound in Chains; and this Viſion made him reſolve to eſtabliſh an Order, whoſe care ſhould be to go and redeem the Chriſtian Captives, detained in Slavery by the Infidels. Having then conferred with the two Hermits, he made them take an Habit like to that which the Phantom appeared in, while he was at the Altar; and having gathered great Alms, he ſent them to redeem, with that mony, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Captives; which undertaking having

This Religion fell into a very corrupt State after the year 1400, and its Monaſteries became a prey to ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Prelates.

                  <p>
                     <hi>DOminick,</hi> the Inſtitutor of this Order, was born at <hi>Calahorta,</hi> a City of <hi>Arragon,</hi> in the year 1170. His Mother dreamed when <note place="margin">Hoſp. de Orig. Mon. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>4, 5.</hi>
                     </note>ſhe was with Child of him, that ſhe bore in her Belly a Dog (ſome ſay a Woolf) which carried in his Mouth a lighted Torch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole World was put in a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration. This was a fatal preſage of the barbarous and cruel Humour of this <hi>Dominick,</hi> and of the bloody Maſſacres which he and his Diſciples, as helliſh Furies, ſhould be Authors of through all the World. <hi>Dominick</hi> was an indifferent Scholar, and being made Canon of the Church of <hi>Oſimo,</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> to offer his Service to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. for the extirpation of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> From <hi>Rome</hi> he paſſed into <hi>Languedock,</hi> where he laid the foundations of his Order, and was made Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor againſt Hereticks. The <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> whom ſome do pretend to have been the <hi>Vaudois,</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:95414:96"/>
were a People who would not worſhip the Beaſt, nor bend their Knees to <hi>Belial,</hi> though charged by the Papiſts (to render them the more odious) with ſeveral impious Doctrins which they never held. 'Twas chiefly againſt them that <hi>Dominick</hi> vented his rage; and he had ſo good ſucceſs in his wicked deſign, by his Preachments, that he ſtirred up almoſt all the Popiſh Princes to arm in a Croiſade againſt theſe poor <hi>Albigenſes;</hi> and to work more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably their Converſion, they, at his Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, murdered, in a ſhort time, above a hundred thouſand of them. <hi>Dominick,</hi> proud of the ſucceſs of his Expedition, found it no hard matter to eſtabliſh his Order; which took ſo readily, and ſuited ſo well the Genius of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It was then approved by <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. and afterwards confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Honorius</hi> the III. in the year 1216. He ſubmitted it to the Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but <hi>Dominick</hi> added to it ſome particular Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. He made three Diviſions of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The firſt was of thoſe, who made it their buſineſs to apply themſelves, with him, to Preaching, and the Converſion of Hereticks, for which he would have them to be called <hi>Preaching Fryars.</hi> The ſecond was of the Nuns, who lived incloſed in Monaſteris. The third was a Troop of mercileſs Fellows, whom he maintained to cut the Throats of Hereticks when he was a Preaching; he called them the <hi>Militia of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and preſcribed them a manner of living different from that of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95414:96"/>
Laity. Theſe having at laſt routed the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks out of their own Country. ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both Sexes joined with them, and were called afterwards Brothers and Siſters of the Penitence of St. <hi>Dominick.</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the VI. approved their Rule about the year 1360. They do not tye themſelves ſo ſtrictly to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Obedience as the Preachers do. The Principal Statutes of the Preaching Fryars are, that they ought to poſſeſs nothing of their own, nor any Eſtate in common, being obliged to live only by Alms. Their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chapter is to be kept every year. They ought to faſt almoſt ſeven months in the year, to eat no Fleſh, unleſs in Sickneſs, to wear no Linnen, and to ſhun all converſation and familiarity with Women, to keep ſilence in ſome places, and at certain hours. Their Buildings ought not to be Stately, but becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Monaſtical State. Their chief employ is that of Preaching. The General of their Order is called <hi>Magiſter Ordinis,</hi> Maſter of the Order. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> were called for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Brothers of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> by reaſon of the ſuperſtitious Worſhip they paid to her, of the Confraternities of the <hi>Roſary,</hi> which they eſtabliſhed in Honour of her, and of the <hi>Saturdays</hi> which they wholly Conſecrated to Her. What gave much credit to this Order <note place="margin">Hoſp. ibid. ut ſupra.</note>was, that <hi>Dominick</hi> having perſwaded Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the III. to eſtabliſh the Office of the Maſter of the Sacred Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom only was committed the interpretation of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95414:97"/>
the Holy Scripture, and the Cenſure of Books; he was the firſt who filled this place, which was aſterwards conferred ſucceſſively upon a Religious of the ſame Order. Oh! the fine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Holy Scripture, whom Papiſts are bound to believe, not having the power them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to read it. The Inquiſition wherewith they were intruſted, rendred them extreamly formidable. But what ſerved yet more to abuſe the ſimplicity of credulous People, and brought them to favour this New Order, was, the Cheats, Impoſtures, Frauds and lies of this <hi>Dominick,</hi> who left no ſtone unturned for <note place="margin">Hoſp. l. <hi>6.</hi> de Orig. Mon. c. <hi>6, 7.</hi>
                     </note>the advancement of it. <hi>Hoſpinian,</hi> in his Book of the Original of Monks, hath ſet them forth in two whole Chapters, to which I refer my Reader. I ſhall only relate here a Viſion of this great Saint, by which he may judge of <note place="margin">Apol. Dom. in vita Ganct. Dom.</note>the reſt. He was once (ſaith he) raviſhed as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the third Heaven, where he ſaw Jeſus Chriſt and his Mother the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> ſurrounded by great numbers of Monks, and Religious of all Orders, his own excepted: Which ſight made him extreamly aſhamed and troubled. Jeſus Chriſt ſeeing him ſo much concerned, bid him to come nearer to himſelf, and asked him the reaſon of it. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> told him his anxious thoughts very freely. Then Jeſus asked him if he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee the Children of his Order; with all my heart, ſaid <hi>Dominick;</hi> Jeſus immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately commanded his Mother to open her long Royal Robe, and <hi>Dominick</hi> ſpyed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95414:97"/>
number of his Religious, whom ſhe cheriſhed under it as her dear Children, far above the others. Are not theſe very fine Viſions!</p>
                  <p>Theſe Peſtiferous <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all over the World, and about the year 1494, were already reckoned above 4143 <note place="margin">Anth. tit. <hi>23.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> parag. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note>Convents of this Order. From that time they continued to increaſe more and more, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day new Monaſteries. They have inherited, from their Founder, a Spirit of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; and the Popes, to whom they were always very uſeful, have mightily favoured them. They have afforded to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeveral Popes, great numbers of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Archbiſhops and Biſhops; and the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt Hereticks does ſtill continue in their Hands. As for the obſervance of their Rule, it is now quite down. They poſſeſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in common, and have beſides that, every one their own mony. They obſerve no Faſts, eat Fleſh every day, lie in good Feather-beds, wear Linnen, and keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant company with lewd Women: The moſt part of their Convents are ſo many ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, &amp;c. Father <hi>John Michaelis</hi> applied <note place="margin">Moreri.</note>himſelf to reform this deformed Order at the beginning of this Age, and ſome few of their Convents did embrace the Reformation; but the looſeſt ſort amongſt them, by the great power they have at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> have put a ſtop to it. The Reformed Fryars, as well as thoſe who are not ſo, are governed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95414:98"/>
by one and the ſame General, and wear the ſame Habit, except that the former have it made with a courſer Cloath, and cut nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower: It conſiſteth in a white Caſock and a Patience, and over this Patience they wear a Hood all of the ſame Colour; but when they go abroad, they put over their white Cloaths a black plited Cloak with a black Hood. This is one of the four <hi>Mendicants,</hi> or begging Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Fryars, who to ſatisfie their infamous Luſts, and to fill their Guts, are the devourers of the ſubſtance of the Poor.</p>

                  <p>THE Fryars of this Order, who were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called Hermits of Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> ſay that the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> was the firſt <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite,</hi> and the Founder of their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though he never left them any written Rule. But this Title of Antiquity, to which they pretend, is denied to them by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves. The true time of their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Joan. Stock. Ang. Dom.</note>was in the year 1122, by <hi>Albert,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He gathered together ſome Hermits, who lived diſperſed here and there upon Mount <hi>Carmel</hi> and in <hi>Syria,</hi> and gave them a Rule; which is nothing elſe but a collection out of that which is attributed to St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> He cauſed a Monaſtery to be built for them, near a Spring of Water, called the Fountain of <hi>Ely,</hi> and a Church, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> He gave them one <hi>Brochard</hi> for their Superior. In the diſorders of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> the <hi>Saricins</hi> having chaſed thence the Chriſtian Princes; this Order which was already much multiplied, paſſed into <hi>Europe</hi> with its Rules and Statutes. Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the IV. having made ſome alteration in their Habit, ordered that they ſhould be called Brothers of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and gave them

the ſame Priviledges of the other <hi>Mendicant</hi> Fryars. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the IV. having taken them under his Protection, mitigated their Rule, tied them to Monaſtical Vows, which they never made before, and commanded them to blot out of their Rule this important <note place="margin">

his Hiſtory of Monks.

The third in the year 1221, which was common to both Sexes, and did not oblige to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, permitting every one to live at home in his own Hermitage.

They ſhewed long Liſts of blind People, to whom this Saint had reſtored their Sight, of Deaf reſtored to their Hearing, of Lame made to Walk; in a word, of all Sickneſſes healed by him. In another Liſt there was to be ſeen all that were poſſeſſed with Devils, whom he had delivered; all the Captives Miraculouſly ſet at Liberty; Laſtly all the Dead riſing to Life again.

Thus runs the Hiſtory, or rather the Fable of it, as it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Book of the Conformities of this Order, which is held by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſuch a truth, whereof one cannot doubt, without becoming an Heretick; as it is declared by ſeveral Bulls of the Popes <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the IX. <hi>Alexander</hi> the V. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the III. and <hi>Benet</hi> the XII.</p>

Chriſt was ſo much pleaſed with this thought of <hi>Francis,</hi> that he came down from Heaven, and appeared to him in form of a Seraphim nailed to a Croſs, and made the ſame prints on the Side, Feet and Hands of <hi>Francis,</hi> which he had upon his own Body.

A young Monk eſpying them, and taking them by their ridiculous Habit, to be ſome Juglers, ran immediately to give notice of it to the Abbot, who in hope of having ſome good ſport with his Monks, bid them come in. But they having made them underſtand they were poor Fryars who came to implore their Charity, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and the Monks commanded they ſhould be thruſt out of Doors. There was only a young Monk, who taking pity on them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed them ſecretly into a Hay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>loft, and there gave them Bread and Beer, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to their Prayers. After which he went to Bed, and in his Sleep he ſaw Jeſus Chriſt ſitting upon a bright Throne, who with an angry Look and a terrible Voice ſaid, <hi>Go and bring before me all the Monks of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</hi> Which being performed accordingly, he ſaw on the other ſide a poor Beggar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Habit of the Brothers <hi>Minors</hi> (it was St. <hi>Francis</hi> himſelf) This man made his bitter complaints to Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Juſt Judge, the blood of my poor Brethren, which theſe wretched Monks have ſpilt this Night, as much
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95414:107"/>
as in them lay, by denying them Bread</hi> and <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſo great extremity; the blood, I ſay, of my poor Brethren, who have left all for thy ſake, and are come hither to ſeek the Souls which thou haſt redeemed by thy Precious Death, demands venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for ſo great a cruelty: They have denied thy Servants what they were ready to grant to</hi> Morris-dancers, <hi>as they took them at firſt to be.</hi> Then Jeſus Chriſt, in fierce Anger, ſaid to the Abbot, <hi>What Order art thou of?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>of St.</hi> Bennet. Chriſt turning himſelf to St. <hi>Benet,</hi> ſaid, <hi>What this Abbot ſays, is it true? No Lord,</hi> anſwered the Saint, <hi>He is a deſtroyer of my Religion, he and his Companions; becauſe I have ordered in my Rule, that the Abbot ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Strangers, of what condition ſoever, to his Table, and theſe have denied them the moſt neceſſary things.</hi> Then Jeſus Chriſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be hanged that very hour on a Tree, which was in the midſt of the Cloiſter. After which looking on the Monk who had exerciſed mercy towards the poor Religious of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> he demanded of him of what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he was. This Fellow ſeeing in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> his Brethren, had been treated, ſaid with fear and trembling, <hi>That he was of the Order of that poor man who ſtood by. Is it true,</hi> Francis (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>is this Monk of thy Order? Yes,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Francis, he belongs to me, and I receive him now as mine;</hi> and as he was embracing of him with all his ſtrength, the Monk awaked, and almoſt beſides his Senſes, run to the Abbot to

tell him his Viſion, but he found him ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and black as a Coal in his Chamber. From thence he went to the Apartment of the other Monks, whom he found in the ſame manner without life, and their Tongues hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their Mouths.

                  <p>IT would be too great a Volume, ſhould I in this manner run over all the Rules of this Society; but I will be content to ſay, That part of theſe Rules aims only at eſtabliſhing the Authority of, and Subordination to other Superiors. Some are for the direction of their Studies and Colleges, others for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95414:122"/>
of their Novitiates and Profeſt-houſes. Others again are for their Diet, and their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. Tis not poſſible to expreſs the great care they ought to take of their Health. The Means they uſe to that purpoſe, are admirable. <note place="margin">Regulae Praefecti ſanitatis.</note>They have in every Convent a Prefect, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer of Health, whoſe care and Application is continually to Study the way of promoting the ſame. A part of his Office is to examin, if the Meat which is prepared for the Fathers Jeſuits, is good and well dreſt. He is to look that they be not prejudiced in their Health by bad Air; by too much Heat, Cold, immoderate Labour, or by too great Application of Mind; and ought to give notice of it to the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, that he may remedy it. One cannot but ſee in all theſe Rules, the extrordinary great love which the Jeſuits have for their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and one would think, they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve another Life hereafter. There is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over amongſt theſe Rules, a great Catalogue to be ſeen of the Maſſes, which their Prieſts ought ſay, and of the Roſaries or Beads, which, thoſe who are not Prieſts, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite every Month, and every Week for their Benefactors, as well living as deceaſed, to get more of them, if poſſible may be. Every Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit Prieſt is alſo obliged to ſay one Maſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Month, and thoſe who are not Prieſts, one Row of Beads, or the third part of a Roſary, for the Reduction of Hereticks, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe of the Northen Countries. (They do not ſay for their Converſion, but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95414:122"/>
for their Reduction, being all one to them, whether this be effected by way of Perſuaſion, or by Fire and Sword) They do declare in many places of their Rule, that to teach Youth, to preach the Doctrins of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, to execute Miſſions, to aſſiſt ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on their Death-Beds, to hear Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to extend, as much as lies in them, the Popes Spiritual Domination, ought to be the chiefeſt employments of the Society. They give directions for that purpoſe, and make an expreſs Vow of the laſt, which they call a Vow of Obedience to the Pope, or of Miſſion. The Subjects who do compoſe this Company, are conſidered five different ways, either as Profeſſed of four Vows; or as Spiritual Coadjutors, who are Prieſts; or as <note place="margin">Moreri. Dict.

                  <p>THIS Society favoured by the Popes, as wholly devoted to them, did ſo much multiply, and ſo faſt, that Father <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> a Jeſuit, having made a Catalogue of their Provinces, Colleges and Religious Houſes in the year 1608. (to wit, ſeventy years after the Foundation of their Order) reckons 31 Provinces, 21 Profeſt Houſes, 293 Colleges, 33 Novitiates, other Reſidential Houſes 96. But ſince that time they are ſo much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that there is no Religious Order ſo much dilated, ſo abundantly favoured with Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſo Rich and ſo Powerful as theirs: A Book in Folio would not be enough to give to the Publick the Hiſtory of it: I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay in general, that they are ſpread all over the World; and in thoſe Countries where they have not the liberty to appear in their Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Habit, they keep themſelves there <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,</hi> in great numbers, and leave no ſtone unturned to compaſs their intreagues and ill deſigns.

                     </note>very ſtately and curiouſly built.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95414:123"/>
a College. The ſame Pope gave them 25 Tuns of Gold towards the raiſing of it. They maintain there 500 Jeſuits, of all the parts of the World, who are the chief Emiſſaries of the General, and as ſo many Maſtiff-dogs ready to be let looſe, at his pleaſure, upon thoſe whom they call Hereticks. King <hi>Louis</hi> the XIV. was no leſs liberal towards this Order in his Kingdom, where he cauſed to be built every where ſtately Palaces for them; while <hi>Spain, Germany, Poland, Italy,</hi> and the other Popiſh Countries, have ſuffered theſe Vulturs to gnaw their Entrails, and become fat upon them. <hi>Rodolphus Hoſpinianus,</hi> a very grave and faithful Author, hath left us four Books of the Jeſuitical Hiſtory. He treats in the Firſt, of the Origin, Name, Habit, and Rules of the Jeſuits; he handleth in the Second, the Increaſe and Power of this Order; in the Third, he expoſes to publick view, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acts, Frauds, Impoſtures, and Bloody Counſels of the Jeſuits, both in <hi>Portugal</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> the Conſpiracies, Troubles, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Parricides, horrid and enormous Crimes, which they have committed in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Bohemia, Hungary, Moſcovy, Poland,</hi> &amp;c.

in their Churches, called by them Oratories (from whence they have got the Name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Oratory) on what the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> hath done while ſhe was yet a Child; with what Diligence ſhe went to School, with what Modeſty ſhe plaid with the young Girls of her Age; on the great Reſpect ſhe had towards the Prieſts, bowing to them in the Streets; and running in ſuch manner over all the Actions of her Life, till her Death, with particulars, which were never known by Scripture or anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Tradition; they believe they have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great exerciſes of Piety, by Preaching to the Seculars three or four hours at each meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon theſe and ſuch like matters. They make it alſo their buſineſs to teach Youth in their Colleges, to Preach and to go on Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They make no Vows, and can very eaſily go out from their Society to poſſeſs ſome good Living offered to them. They are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally much beloved by all ſorts of people for their Honeſty, and Affability, but mortally hated by the Jeſuits, who have perſecuted them extreamly in theſe laſt Times, accuſing them of favouring the Opinions of <hi>Janſenius;</hi> but indeed it is becauſe they are their Rivals, and they fear, leſt the Papiſts, weary at laſt of their tyranny and impieties, ſhould one day give their Houſes and Colleges to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Oratory.

to fall upon them, unleſs by a ſpeedy Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they did appeaſe Gods Anger. All his Hearers very much frighted, having put on Sack-cloth, armed with Whips and Diſciplins, went Proceſſionally along the Streets, beating ſeverely their Shoulders for the expiation of their Sins. This Sort of Penance, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards practiſed in ſome other Countries, and particularly in <hi>Hungary,</hi> during a raging Plague, wherewith the whole Kingdom was miſerably afflicted and waſted. But ſome while after, it occaſioned a very dangerous ſect of Flagellants or Whippers, who running by Troops, naked to the Waſt, put their Backs all in a gore Blood, publiſhing that this new Baptiſm of Blood (ſo they called it,) blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out all Sins, even thoſe that they might commit hereafter.

               <head type="sub">Of the Habits, and of the Tonſure or Shaving of Monks.</head>
               <p>I Have ſet down at the end of each Order, what Habits thoſe Monks wear, and in what Form and Colour they do differ one from another, according to the Fancy of their Founders. Now I muſt further more explain to you what a Capuchon, a Scapulary, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, a Force, a Plited Cloak, the Scandals, and the Monaſtical Crown are.</p>
               <p>The Capuchon in its firſt Inſtitution, was no other thing but a Sack, which the firſt Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents wore upon their Heads, with one Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in, after the manner of the Colliers here in <hi>London.</hi> But our Monks have brought it at laſt, to the form of a Hood, and is of the ſame Stuff with their Habits. It is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious contrivance, becauſe when they are hot, they caſt it back upon their Shoulders, and when they are cold, they draw it very deep on their Heads, to keep their Ears warm: Some have it ſo curiouſly Wrought, that three Women at work can hardly make one in four days. Speaking of it in a Spiritual Senſe, they call it the Helmet of Salvation; <hi>Galeam ſalutis,</hi> and believe, that the Devil hath not the Power in that Harneſs, to ſuggeſt
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95414:134"/>
to them ill Thoughts. Some Monks, as the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> the <hi>Auguſtinians,</hi> the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> &amp;c. wear it very broad, and hanging down al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the Calf of their Legs, to extend the more on their Bodies the virtue of this holy Garment. The Capucins contrarywiſe, have the tail of their Capuchion turned right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which makes them (they ſay) more Terrible to the Powers of the Air, and unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them more immdiately to God.</p>
               <p>The Scapulary is a piece of Stuff, divided length-ways in half, (and ſowed to their Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion) which reacheth before and behind, al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moſt to their Feet. Tis called Scapulary, <hi>à Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> becauſe it covers their Shoulders, and in the Spiritul Senſe, it is an Armour againſt the Devil, Impenetrable to all the Arrows of his Malice.</p>
               <p>This Scapulary, when firſt contrived, was an Habit for work, whereof almoſt all the <note place="margin">In Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go teſtium veritatis f. <hi>214, 215.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But as for the Monks in our days, who have preferred Idleneſs before Working, they might alſo go without a Scapulary. When the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Regicide <hi>James Clement,</hi> a Dominican
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95414:134"/>
Fryar, went to kill <hi>Henry</hi> the III. he hid hisgreat Dagger under his great Dagger under his Scapulary, and made it ſerve in ſuch manner, to an uſe very different from its Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The Patience is only another name, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the two ſides of their Scapulary; the part which is one their Backs, is called the Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and that one their Breaſt the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. This word is in expreſſion of their Sufferings, becauſe one of theſe Monks, having once by chance ſtretched his Scapula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, together with the Capuchion on the ground; they ingeniouſly obſerved that it repreſented a kind of a Croſs, and very lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them, they publiſhed that they were the Imitators of Jeſus Chriſt, bearing after him their Croſſes in this World. And, indeed who can doubt but theſe Scapularies being for the moſt part of a very fine Cloth or Linnen, be very heavy Croſſes to theſe poor Monks?</p>
               <p>The Frock or Cowl, is a Stately Gown with large Sleeves, which the Monks wear over their other Habits, when they go to Church, or to work in the Towns. In a Spiritual Senſe, it is the Protection of God Almighty, that Surrounds them (they ſay) on every ſide.</p>
               <p>The Cape is a long Cloak, plited round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Neck, and without Sleeves, of which ſome Fryars make uſe in ſtead of the Frock. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> particularly wear ſuch Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe (they ſay) it repreſents better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Beda,</hi> in the firſt Book of his Hiſtory, Chap. 22. ſaith, that the Monks and Prieſts have their Heads Shaved, and leave above the Ears a Circle of Hair, in the form of a Crown, to repreſent the Crown of Thorns of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and that this Crown is a warning to them, that they ought to imitate Chriſt in his Sufferings, and bear patiently all ſorts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Injuries for the ſake of his Name. <note place="margin">Hoſp. de Orig.

How weary, how tired are they in cutting up the Partridges, the Snipes, the Pheaſants, and others Dainties, wherewith their Tables are covered! Oh the Sharp Thorny-Crown, that ſo cruelly afflicts their tender Heads!

This Circle notwithſtanding, according to them, is a Royal Crown, that raiſes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Chriſtians, as much as Kings are above their own Subjects. Tis very true, (goes on my Author <hi>Hoſpinian)</hi> that theſe Fellows wear a Royal Crown on their Heads, ſince they are exempted from all Juriſdiction and Power of the Magiſtrates, when all the others are bound to obey. Nay, they are above Kings and Princes, to whom they are become formidable, and are adored by thoſe of their party, like Gods. Having already gathered for themſelves, almoſt all the Riches of the Univerſe, they may well boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Frugality, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Wordly things, which they ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiably purchaſe.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> adds another Myſtery to it, and ſaith, that this Crown is a mark of Penitence and of Converſion.

               <p>I ſhall conclude this matter, with ſaying, that the Monks of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do attribute ſo much Holineſs to their Shaving and Habits, that they think they may with folded Arms go to Heaven, and therefore do neglect the true practices of Juſtice and Piety, which are approved by God, and commanded in the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>IT is an eaſie thing to obſerve, that there hath been formerly two ſorts of Nuns, or Virgins, Conſecrated to God. The Firſt and moſt Ancient begun almoſt in the times of the Apoſtles; and as Prudent Virgins, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by the Grace of God, and with all Humility and Freedom followed St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in keeping their Virginity, not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it an extraordinary merit in themſelves, nor being bound to it by a ſolemn Vow, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95414:137"/>
without condemning Marriage, which they often embraced after ſeveral years of Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as not being accounted infamous for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Such were the Virgins of the Pureſt Times. As for the Second Sort of Nuns, who make Vows, they ought to acknowledge their Original from <hi>Euſtatius,</hi> an Heretick, who put into their Heads, as fooliſh Virgins, that there was no Salvation to be hoped for in a Married State; and bound them by Vow, to keep their Virginity. This hapned about the year of our Lord 330. And it was likewiſe about the ſame time, that ſome Virgins and devout Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Firſt Order, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe who made no Vows, in imitation of the Hermits and Monks of <hi>Thebais</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and incloſed themſelves in Monaſteries. This <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Novelty paſſed alſo ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Eraſm. in vita Hier.</note>into the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Some Prieſts of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> flying from the <hi>Arian</hi> perſecution, retired to <hi>Rome,</hi> and informed the Noble Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <hi>Marcella</hi> with this kind of Life, which pleaſed her ſo much, that having gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, ſhe perſuaded them to live in common, and took upon her <note place="margin">Hierom. in Epit. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note>ſelf their conduct. After the example of ſo great Ladies, what appeared at firſt very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious for its Novelty, became more Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and even Honourable; and in ſeveral places were built Monaſteries for Widows and Virgins Conſecrated to God. The Vail which was in uſe for all the Women in the Primitive <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note>Church, and wherewith St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95414:137"/>
ought to be covered at Church,</hi> in reverence to the Angels, was appropriated to thoſe who did retire into Monaſteries, as an Habit that was to be particular to them, and their diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from thoſe who lived in the World. Some time ſince, the Councils which were held, and particularly that of <hi>Valence</hi> held in <hi>France,</hi> in the year 378, made very rigorous Statutes againſt the Vailed Virgins, who ſhould go out of their Monaſteries to Marry, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to receive them ſo eaſily to Penitence: Nevertheleſs there was yet a Door open for them. But Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the I. by a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Zeal, and contrary to that Meekneſs <note place="margin">Epiſt. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. <hi>2</hi> Can. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note>of the merciful Jeſus, who is ready to receive Sinners at the firſt moment of their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ordered in the year 407, that after ſuch a fault as this, they ſhould not be received to Penitence before the death of the Husband whom they had taken; and if they died firſt, they ſtill lay under the ſentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This Law was confirmed ſince by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Synods; and every thing going ſtill worſe and worſe in the Church, the Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Nuns were quite diſſolved, and thoſe who contracted them, both Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were burnt alive. By ſuch means the Nuns were, at laſt, forced to keep their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity againſt their Wills. In the mean time, St. <hi>Benet,</hi> having given, as it were, a new Life to Monkery in the <hi>Weſt, Scholaſtica,</hi> his Siſter, Founded a great many Monaſteries for Women, whereof ſhe made her ſelf Abbeſs,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95414:138"/>
and gave them the ſame Rule which her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had written for Men. The following Ages, as more abundant in Superſtition, did alſo abound more in Monks and Nuns, who made ſolemn Vows, and the ſhaving of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that was in uſe only in ſome <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monaſteries, which had borrowed it from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Virgins, was brought alſo into the <hi>Weſt.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Letter to the Virgin <hi>Eusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note>calls it the Devil's Work. St. <hi>Paul</hi> at leaſt ſaith, <hi>That it is a ſhameful thing for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to go ſhaved.</hi> However the Nuns, a great deal wiſer than this holy Apoſtle, did in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of time attribute to their cutting off their Hair, to their Vails, and mimical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babits, a holy Virtue, and more than a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Grace. But this, notwithſtanding their Habits, remaining always whatever really they were, to wit, pieces of Cloath without that imaginary ſanctifying Virtue, theſe Nuns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill expoſed to Temptations ſo much the more violent and ſhameful, as their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes were raſh and unwiſe. Some bad circumſtances, which hapned very often, ſhewed enough that they were only Virgins by force; taking all occaſions to converſe with Men. Therefore the Biſhops thought neceſſary to raiſe up their Walls higher, and to order that they ſhould ſpeak to no body but through Iron Grates, being kept as cloſe as the Priſoners in <hi>Newgate.</hi> Oh ſhame! Now Pagans and Infidels muſt know that Chriſtian Virgins, that they may ſecure ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95414:138"/>
of Life, ought to be kept in Irons. And let the Papiſts be thanked for the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which reflects from their infamous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices upon the whole Body of Chriſtendom. As for the Government of Nuns, ſome of them are under the Direction of the Biſhops, in whoſe Dioceſe they are, and others under the Obedience of the Generals of the Orders of Men, who profeſs the ſame Rule as they do. The former have Secular Prieſts for their Confeſſors, and the later, Fathers of their Order.</p>

with Iron Chains, for the Souls in Purgatory. Chriſt Jeſus (ſaith the Legend of her Life) came very often into her Chamber to viſit her.

Another time Chriſt Jeſus appeared to her, and Bathed her whole Body, with his own precious Blood, that ſprung out of his Wounds: And another time again he Cloathed his dear Spouſe, with a Robe which he drew out of his Sacred Side, all died with his Blood. Since that time, <hi>Katherin</hi> did not feel any cold in her Body, even in the midſt of the bittereſt Winters.

Some Merchants of the City of <hi>Melphi,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who Traded into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> got permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the <hi>Calif</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> to build for them, and for thoſe of their Nation, who came in Pilgrimage into <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> a Houſe at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> paying for it a yearly Tribute. Some while after they built alſo two Churches, that of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> the firſt for the Men, and the other for the Women who went thither a Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. This deſign encouraged ſome others to do the like, who Founded likewiſe a Church, and an Hoſpital, in which care was taken of the Sick, and of thoſe who went to viſit the Holy Places. In the year of our Lord 1099, the Chriſtians, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of brave <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Brothers of St. <hi>John</hi> did not a little help <note place="margin">Hoſpinian.</note>towards it: For obſerving that the <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to loſe ground, and to yield to the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attack of the Beſiegers, they fell unawares on their Reer, and with the help of all the other Chriſtians of the Town, they forced
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95414:159"/>
the Guards, and opened the Gates of the City to the Beſiegers. One <hi>Gerard Tune</hi> was then their Director, or Grand Maſter, who having alſo ſignalized himſelf in the great fight at <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> King <hi>Godfrey</hi> gave, for a Reward to the Hoſpitalers, great Eſtates and Poſſeſſions, to put them thereby in a condition to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Hoſpitality, and reſiſt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that ſhould oſfer any injury to Pilgrims on the Highways. King <hi>Baldwin,</hi> Succeſſor to <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> loved and favoured them mightily; and it was under his Reign, in the year 1104, that they took the Religious Habit, to wit, a black Caſock, and over it, on the left Side, a white Croſs, with eight Spikes, obliging themſelves by Vow, to receive, treat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Pilgrims; and alſo to maintain with force of Arms the Chriſtian Religion in their Country. They followed St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Rule, except in the Cononical Office; being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, inſtead of it, to recite every day a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of <hi>Pater Noſters.

               <head>Concluſion of Military Order.</head>
               <p>THERE are, as I already have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, two ſorts of Knights, one of Regulars, and the other of Seculars. The Regulars may be divided again, according to the end of their Inſtitution, into Knights who do profeſs to ſight againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and other <hi>Inſidels,</hi> and into Knights Inſtituted to deſtroy all thoſe, who do not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> As for the firſt, one cannot deny, but they have done great Services to Chriſtendom, by the brave Expeditions, wherewith they have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized themſelves, and the great Victories they have got over the Enemies of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and they would deſerve indeed more praiſes yet, if Chriſt had left us any Precept, to propagate his Holy Religion, with Fire and Sword. There is no reward, as I know of, promiſed, to thoſe who ſhall deſtroy the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, but for thoſe who ſhall work their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. I dont queſtion, but the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> are good Soldiers, and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion they have, that by ſpilling <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Blood they ſave their Souls, and acquire great Merits before God; hath a conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon their Enterpriſes, upholds them in the midſt of the greateſt Dangers, and makes them to ſight like Lions; but who is
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95414:169"/>
the Warrant of all thoſe fair Promiſes in the other World, but the Pope's Word alone? Nevertheleſs, I muſt ſay in honour of thoſe of <hi>Malta,</hi> that they are now the only Knights true to their Profeſſion, of fighting againſt the <hi>Infidels.</hi> The others, as the <hi>Teutonicks</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> do indeed enjoy great Eſtates, but where is their Standards, where are their Military Expeditions? What is become of that Noble, Acient Valour, which made them formerly the Bulwark of Chriſtendom in <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks?</hi> It ſeems now turned entirely againſt Pots and Drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes, <note place="margin">Hoſpin.</note>ſaith a very grave Author. I paſs from theſe Orders to thoſe that are Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to deſtroy the Enemies of the Popiſh, See, whom they call Hereticks, and eſpecially the Proteſtants. As we are very reaſonably perſuaded, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not only full of Errours, but alſo poſſeſt with a Spirit of Perſecution and beſtial Fury againſt thoſe who refuſe to embrace them; we can give no other name, but that of Barbarous Cuthroats, to thoſe wretched perſons, who by a Sacrilegious and abominable Vow, do promiſe at the Altars, to promote with their Fortunes and Lives, her Bloody deſigns and Vengeances againſt thoſe who maintain the Purity of the Faith. The Dragoons, who in our days ſo cruelly perſecuted the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> wanted nothing but to make Vows, for to be Knighted at <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather to become yet more worthy of <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:95414:169"/>
Theſe Dragoons put me in mind of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Dragon, Inſtituted in <hi>Germany</hi> by <note place="margin">Le Sieur de Thuy de l' Orig. des Ordes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litaries.</note>the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond.</hi> This Prince (ſaith a Popiſh Author) ſhewed ſo great a Zeal for the advancement of the Chriſtian Religion, that not ſatisfied with having ſo often fought the <hi>Turks,</hi> and got many Victories over them, at his inſtance two General Councils were called, one at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and the other at <hi>Baſil,</hi> for the extirpation of Hereſy and Schiſm; eſpecially in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary;</hi> and for a laſting Monument of his Devotion, he Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Military Order of the Dragon, ſo called, becauſe theſe Knights had for their Coat of Arms, a Precipitated Dragon, as a ſign that Hereſie and Schiſm, (thoſe venemous and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Dragons) were by him vanquiſhed and ſupplanted. This is the Notion which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives us of that Order, which manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, to what Merit and Honour theſe deluded People think they arrive, by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution which they raiſe againſt the true defenders of the Goſpel. Time will come, ſaith Chriſt, when thoſe who Perſecute you, ſhall think they do great Service to God. As for the Secular Orders of Knights, having not Treated of them in this Book, it would be ſuperfluous to give here the Character of them. I only ſay, that moſt of theſe Orders being Inſtituted, to eſtabliſh a true Submiſſion of the Subjects to their Princes, or a perfect Friendſhip amongſt equals; or laſtly, to ſerve for Badges of Nobility, and honour to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

Illuſtrious and brave Men, they cannot but produce very good effects in thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, where they are eſtabliſhed; and Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heads will always do well to make them Glorious, by becoming themſelves the Heads of them.</p>

            <head>A CONCLUSION OF THE Whole WORK.</head>
            <p>NO Body will deny, but it is very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to retire now and then into Solitude, far from the noiſe and diſſturbances of the World, there to examine, more at leiſure, and with a compoſed mind, the State of his own Conſcience, and the Ways of Salvation; to the end that one may diſpoſe himſelf to diſcharge better afterwards his great Duties towards God, and to order more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably his Employments and Converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. A Retirement made for ſuch good Ends and Purpoſes, cannot but be very good and commendable; and in this ſenſe ought to be underſtood all the Elogies which the Holy Doctors, and Firſt Fathers of the Church have given to Solitude. Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath commended the ſame by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when he retired into deſert places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mountains, with his Diſciples, where he taught them to pray, and inſtructed them in all the duties of the Goſpel. He gave them in the Solitude, thoſe Precepts which they
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:95414:171"/>
were to practiſe in the Cities; inſomuch that all theſe Retirements were only ordered for to converſe better afterwards in the World.</p>
            <p>The Romaniſts, who commonly take things very materially, without well examining what goes before, and what after, were not wanting to pronounce, that becauſe Chriſt did practiſe Retirement, this ſame Retirement, conſidered abſolutely in it ſelf, without reference to the end for which it was chiefly intended, was to be looked upon as the moſt perfect State in which a Chriſtian may live, not obſerving, that it was only to be conſidered as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means for better ordering civil Life. Upon this miſtaken Principle, are grounded all the the Monaſtical Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Monks are called, by a very improper Emphaſis, <hi>Religious Men,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, perfect Chriſtians. Would to God they were ſo indeed, or at leaſt that they did come ſomething near to the ſimplicity and honeſty of Life of the moſt part of the firſt Monks, who inhabited, in the Third and Fourth Ages, in the Deſerts of <hi>Paleſtina</hi> and <hi>Thebaide;</hi> they in this caſe ſhould be only guilty of a little too much Superſtition, which the uprighneſs of their Hearts might render excuſable both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and before Man. But the Monks of our times have brought things to ſuch a point of Abomination, by their Hypocriſies, Cheats, perfidious and infamous Practices, that happy a thouſand times thoſe Kingdoms and People are, who ſee themſelves freed from ſuch a
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95414:171"/>
Brood of Vipers, who tear in pieces the very Bowels of thoſe who cheriſh them in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms. Nevertheleſs, I know very well, that theſe wretched perſons, well ſtocked with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are very eager in taxing the Proteſtants with being declared Enemies to thoſe very Chriſtian Virtues, Poverty, Chaſtity, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, endeavouring by that means to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more odious to thoſe of their own Party. But in this they are very unjuſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is never a good Proteſtant but will acknowledge, that voluntary Poverty for the love of God, is a great Treaſure to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who knows how to make a good uſe of it; that Chaſtity is a Virtue, beloved both of God and of Angels; and that Obedience to lawful Superiours, Spiritual and Temporal, is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Virtue, to maintain that good order of things, which God hath eſtabliſhed here on Earth. All the diſference between a Papiſt and a Proteſtant in this Point is, that the firſt believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he can make bold with God's Gifts, diſpoſe of them after his own Will, and make a Vow before-hand, to obſerve what is not in his own power to perform, unleſs it be given him from above; expoſing himſelf thereby to an evident danger of becoming perjured and Sacrilegious, in not performing his ſolemn Oath and Promiſes. The other, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hath a juſt and reſpectful ſentiment of Gods Grace and his Holy Gifts, which being meerly free, are above our natural reach, and therefore muſt be fervently prayed for, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:95414:172"/>
when given, humbly received; but not diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of before-hand, as being not ſure, if God will be pleaſed to beſtow them upon us. It is then the Vow that is found fault with, as Bold and Raſh, and not the Virtues, which are Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Holy This Declaration, I hope will be enough fore the preſent, to defeat all theſe odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Calumnies laid ſo unjuſtly by Popiſh Monks and Prieſts at the Proteſtants doors, <hi>viz.</hi> that they hate Retirement, Chriſtian Poverty, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity and Obedience. Having done with this, I come to another Obſervation, concerning the beginning of Monaſtical Orders.</p>
            <p>In the firſt page of this Hiſtory, where I ſay, that it is generally agreed that Monaſtical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, did begin towards the middle of the third Age; I dicourſe only to thoſe who have truly, unpartially, and with unprejudiced mind inquired into theſe matters. I know very well, that ſome Popiſh Writers blinded by a falſe Zeal for Monkery, have been ſo hot in puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up, as to make Monks, of almoſt all the Ancient Fathers, and the Primitive Chriſtians; of the Holy Apoſtles and the Bleſſed Jeſus him, St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Sons of the Prophets; <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, and a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him <hi>Enos.</hi> Nay, they go back beyond the World, and ſay, that God before the Creation of the Univerſe was a Monk <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> alone. As for this laſt, I make no diſficulty to call it a down right Impiety and Profaneneſs, to raiſe ſuch ridiculous compariſon, between their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Monks and Almighty God. And for <hi>Enos</hi>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:95414:172"/>

I have already ſpoken here above of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Retirement into Solitude, and of what inſtruction it does afford to us. Now it will not be a hard matter to vindicate the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, from their having been Monks. They whoſe Miſſion was to all over the World, to Preach the Goſpel to all Nations, and who did converſe both with the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> were very far from being Solitaries. Nor
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95414:173"/>
can the Romaniſts ſay, that the Apoſtles were Monks by their condemning Marriage, as the Monks do, ſince all of them (according to St. <hi>Ambroſius)</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were Married and had Wives. But ſaith the Popiſh Monk, they lived ſome while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did poſſeſs every thing in common, as we do, therefore they were Monks as we are. If this be to be a Monk, then <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his Diſciples, who poſſeſſed likewiſe every thing in common, were Monks; then all the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians who did the ſame, were ſo. Nay, all Married People who maintain big Families of one and the ſame Stock, and live together, are Monks. We ſee then what poor and ſilly Arguments theſe well-wiſhers to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Antiquity do bring, to make their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Imaginations, go down with the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to make it appear that the Apoſtles were Monks, and Founders of the <note place="margin">Proſper Stel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar. de Reg.

The miſtake of the Romaniſts in this Point, proceeds from three heads. Firſt, from their living in common, which for ſeveral good reaſons, was eſtabliſhed amongſt the Chriſtians of the Primitive Churches, to which they give the name of Monaſtical Life. Secondly, From the retreat of the firſt Chriſtians, to Solitary places during the Storms of Perſecution: And thirdly, From the voluntary Retirement of ſome eminent men into Solitude, who betook themſelves thither for a while, the better to apply themſelves to their Studies. As to the firſt, I ſay, that their Life in common, eſtabliſhed amongſt the Chriſtians of the former times was ſo far from having been a Monaſtical Life, or the pattern of it, that it was quite contrary to it. For what is more oppoſite to a Solitary ſtate, than to live many together, in order to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually applied to Charitable Offices in the World, as to take care of the Orphans and Widows, to viſit the Sick, to comfort the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and to relieve the Poor; which to do more effectually, theſe firſt and truly Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Chriſtians ſold their Eſtates, and brought the Mony, laying it at the feet of the Apoſtles; not indeed as the bony Fryars of the Romiſh Church do, who pretending to deſpiſe the World, retire with what they have, or what they can ſcrape from their Families, into rich 
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:95414:174"/>
and well endowed Houſes; there to enjoy their Prey, in company of Cheats and lazy Fellows, bidding farewel to all the good Works practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the World. For the ſecond head miſtake, it hath not better Foundation than the former. God be praiſed for theſe Bleſſed times, in which we enjoy here in <hi>England,</hi> the liberty of our Religion; but if he was pleaſed to let a time of Perſecution come, and we were obliged to hide our ſelves in Deſerts, Grottos and Caves, in the days of Wrath and Indignation, ſhould we be called Monks and Fryars for doing ſo? As for the third head of miſtake, it is methinks, of ſo weak and ſo ſlight conſtitution, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one hath a great mind to be miſtaken, it cannot ſtand by it ſelf. Every one knows, that Retirement and Solitude are a great help to Studies, and extraordinary Application of Mind, and therefore the ancient Fathers of the Primitive Churches, when not only the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> endeavoured with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wiſdom and Philoſophy, to overthrow the Principles of Chriſtianity, but many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and falſe Chriſtians made it their buſineſs alſo to corrupt, deprave, and undermine the ſoundneſs of Chriſtian Doctrin and Piety; then I ſay, the Holy Fathers and Doctors of thoſe Times, did not think fit amiſs to retire now and then into Solitude, there the better to apply their Minds to untie and diſſolve the Sophiſtical and deceitful Arguments of their Adverſaries, and to explain in their learned Writings, the eminent Truths contained in the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95414:175"/>
Goſpel. Their Solitude became then, by the good uſe they made of it, a Bleſſing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to the World, but was not lookt upon as an holy State by it ſelf, and moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, till in the third Age; when this Error together with Monaſtical Diſcipline, begun firſt to creep into the Church, as it is generally agreed upon by all good and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Writers. Neverthel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs, ſome Popiſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have not only taken the boldneſs, to pretend theſe to be the times for the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monks; but even the confidence to aſſert that it is ſo true, that Monkery was <note place="margin">Proſper Stellartius Ord. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. S. Aug. Tract. de Reg. Mon.</note>hatched as ſoon as Chriſtianity it ſelf; that Chriſt could not well diſpenſe with it, nor frame a perfect Church here on Earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Monks. The two reaſons which they bring, to prove the two parts of their Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt being come into the World not to break, but to fulfil the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> his Office was to ſubſtitute the Reality to every Shadow or Figure repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; but there was, they ſay, a Shadow of Monaſtical Life in the <hi>Phariſees, Saducees, Eſſeans,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore Chriſt could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the Inſtitution, of true and perfect Monks, (ſuch as they pretend to have in the Popiſh Church.) The ſecond Argument runs thus, Chriſt would not have been able to Frame a perfect Church, if he had left out the moſt Holy and perfect State of human Life; but ſuch a State is that of the Monks, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without them, he could not have Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:95414:175"/>
a perfect Church. Amongſt ſeveral ſilly proofs, which they make uſe of to back this laſt <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, I find this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moſt part of the World hath been ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, that Monaſtical Life is the moſt pefect State here on Earth, that even the <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves, the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the moſt barbarous Nations have their Monks, and the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had ſome likewiſe, and conſecrated Virgins, whom they called Veſtals; and they conclude upon the whole, that Chriſt could not exclude that State from his Church, and that it would be a great ſhame for Chriſtians, if they were alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Holy Fryars and Monks. I do not think it worth my while, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o make here a long Diſcourſe, to diſcover the foulneſs of theſe rotten Arguments. I ſay only as to the firſt, that though Chriſt was to ſubſtitute Reality to every Figure of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> yet every Inſtitution, or Obſervance of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was not a Figure, but might come to an end with the Law. As for Example, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, was an Obſervance of the Law, which we ſee hath been quite and clean aboliſhed by Chriſt; ſo we know likewiſe, that amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſome kinds of Monks, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nazareens,</hi> the <hi>Recabites, Saducees, Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Eſſeans.</hi> But beſides that, they were moſt of them dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Hereticks, we do not ſee, that Chriſt hath ever commended their Inſtitutions, or Perſons in the Goſpel; on the contrary we
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:95414:176"/>
read how often he forwarned his Diſciples, and firſt Believers, to beware of them in the preſence of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were at that time, the chiefeſt and moſt eſteemed Monks amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> and how many Woes he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt their Singular and Hypocritical Practices, as contrary to Communion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Union and Charity. Now to Anſwer the Second Point.</p>
            <p>Tis true indeed, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> had, and have ſtill amongſt them ſeveral ſorts of Monks, perhaps not very unlike thoſe of <note place="margin">Polydor. Vergil. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> de Invent. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> There were of old the Brothers of the Goddeſs of <hi>Siria,</hi> who, like the Popiſh Mendicant Fryars, went from one place to another, with the Statue of their Goddeſs, offering their Cloathes to Kiſs, ſelling their Prayers, and cheating the poor Country People, of their Goods and Monies. The <hi>Druides</hi> among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> were famous heatheniſh Monks, who lived in the Woods, making their continual Sacrifices to their Gods; they were in great repute and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enjoyed great Priviledges and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſerved not their Gods for nothing. There were likewiſe other Monks of the Grand-Mother of the Gods, called the Brothers of <hi>Cibele, Curetes, Corybantes,</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyli Idaei,</hi> who lived upon the Mountains of <hi>Phrygia.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> had a College, or Monaſtery for the Brothers called <hi>Arvalos,</hi> whoſe office was to Sacrifice to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> They had beſides their Nuns or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:95414:176"/>
called Veſtals, who were intruſted with the care and preſervation of the ſacred Fire, and were to pray for the Proſperity of the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> But what need we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount ſo far in the ancient Times to look for Monks, do we not ſee now-a-days, ſeveral ſorts of them amongſt the <hi>Turks?</hi> Some go Stript naked Winter and Summer, and make many Cuts and Inciſions on their Bodies. Some others do profeſs ſo ſtrict an Abſtinence and Faſting, that they paſs many days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eating and Drinking. Others affect to be ſo great Lovers of Poverty, that they do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs nothing in the World, and will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Victuals, even for the next day. Others again are ſo ſilent, that it is not poſſible to draw one word from their Mouths, either by fair means or ill uſage. Theſe are called <hi>Czamutlar</hi> or <hi>Dumbs.</hi> Others pretend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, Extaſies, Prophecies and Miracles, and go under the name of <hi>Dermſhler,</hi> who are moſt eſteemed amongſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> Some of them live in their Monaſteries in Towns, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Country, and Solitary places, or in Tombs amongſt the Dead. The <hi>Czofilar</hi> are another ſort of Monks amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are much given to Contemplation and Prayer, are ſtrict holders of the Traditions of their Fore-Fathers, rely entirely upon their own Merits, without the Grace of God; riſe in the Night to ſing praiſe to God, and are in great honour with the Nobility and Gentry, who are of the ſame Opinions as
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:95414:177"/>
they. But generally, all theſe <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monks do profeſs Chaſtity, and condemn Marriage. There was formerly another Order in <hi>Turky</hi> called <hi>Dervis;</hi> but for their Impieties and bad <note place="margin">Marinus Barl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Indians</hi> likewiſe have their <hi>Talapoi,</hi> who make as great pretenſe of Holineſs, as the Romiſh Fryars do. But what then? muſt we conclude, that becauſe the Heathens and Idolaters have Monks, there muſt be ſome alſo in the Church of the living God? Ought we not rather to conclude the contrary, that becauſe they have ſome, we muſt have none, eſpecially when we know that thoſe Heatheniſh Monks have been in all times the greateſt contrivers and uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Idolatrous Worſhip and Superſtition, and when it is manifeſt likewiſe, that the Romiſh Monks in imitation of thoſe Infidels, have at laſt brought downright Idolatry into
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:95414:177"/>
their Popiſh Church. Monks where thoſe who invented the Adoration of Saints, of Croſſes, of Wooden or Stone Statues and Images, who contrived Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Proceſſions, Pilgrimages, Vows, in a word, almoſt all the new Doctrins and Practices, wherewith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is miſerably infected. Upon which we may reaſonably conclude, that though it could be proved, (which I do not grant) that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Life was at the firſt beginning very Holy, yet ſeeing the great evils which have been cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at all times, by the Profeſſors of it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but very ſafe to cut them off from the Churches Body. Becauſe when any State whatſoever occaſioneth Evils, far greater than the good for which it was intended, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways much better to be without it, than to bear with the continuance of it. A State, ſuch as Monkery is, cannot but bring forth ſingularity, and ſingularity in one Body is a kind of a Schiſm. In reading the Declarations of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks upon their Rules, I obſerved, that they ſtrictly forbid to them, any ſort of ſingular practice from the common obſervances of their Cloiſters; as being, they <note place="margin">Declar.
