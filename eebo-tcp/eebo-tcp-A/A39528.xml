            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his much Eſteemed Friend Mr. THOMAS LAMBARD.</head>
            <p>THAT this Sermon was firſt Compoſed, then Preached, and now Publiſhed, I muſt plainly tell you without a Compliment, is not ſo much to be attributed to Your Requeſt, as to that great Reſpect and Kindneſs I have for You. In which, that I might not leave the Text I had pitched upon, and the Bible too, or ſpend upon the Subject a meer Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of Words and pure Invention: I have confined my Thoughts and Meditations to the Word of God, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fetched them from it; becauſe it is that only Rule which ſhould regulate our Opinions and Practices in the weighty concerns of our Life and Salvation, and which ought to give an Authority, Life, and Pungency to all Pulpit-Diſcourſes. A Rule this is which God has given us, and which every Chriſtian eſpecially muſt conſider and ſtudy with Fear and Veneration. I know there are, and have been ſome Men in the World, (witneſs the <hi>Theologo-Political, Leviathan, Theory, Critical Hiſtory, Annotation</hi> and <hi>History-of-Religion-Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100635:3"/>
who by the Power of Criticiſms and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtart No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Philoſophy, either of their own, and ſome other mens Invention, <hi>i. e.</hi> in my Judgment, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation of the Devil, and the Pride of their Hearts, all conſpire to ruin and undermine it. Many Books of this kind have appeared in the World, which if the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Age had not diſpoſed men to receive, and even to gape for, had been comdemned to flames, of which they are worthy; and their Authors cenſured, as becomes the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Laws of the place they live in. Curioſity knows no Bound, either of Modeſty or Satisfaction; and therefore, tho it has been my misfortune to look into ſuch Books (of which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire You to beware, and not to follow the Wondering and Silly World, if Ten thouſand ſuch ſhould again appear in it) and in ſome meaſure to conſider the Subject-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Tendecy of them; yet I thank God they have no more influence upon my Mind to deſtroy my Faith, or leſſen my Veneration for the Holy Bible, than Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Morals, or Ingenious Diſcourſes upon the Praiſes of Vice, ſhall by the Grace of God move me to approve them in my Judgment, or in my practice to follow them. I look upon an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſanctified, Proud, and Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Head, to be as dangerous, as an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Heart; nay, far more; becauſe the iſſues of this run in open Contradiction to the general Reaſon of Mankind: Whereas a Learned <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or one who pretends to be ſo, is beyond the Sphere of Ordinary Intellectuals; which is the ſole Reaſon why he is admired ſo much, even then, when he preys upon the Ignorance of Men, and ſpreads looſe Principles, Irreligion and Atheiſm in the World. Now ſome ſuch Men as theſe have been trying their Skill on the Subject of my Sermon, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb facs="tcp:100635:3"/>
from the Armoury of their Learning, ſome indulged Practices of former Ages, and unwary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Ancient and Modern Authors, to overthrow the Laws of God and Man for no other end at all, than to let the Reins looſe to Laſciviouſneſs, and in a manner to Brutalize the World. I have in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, as I ſaid before, confined my Thought; to the Word of God, and next to that, the Laws of Men; which are nothing leſs than the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Deliberations, Deciſions, and Reſponſes of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt Authoritative Perſons of former Ages. For by theſe are we to frame our Notions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and to ſolve all Doubts concerning Marriage, which is a Subject, perhaps, that affords as many Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful, and Nice Enquiries, as any falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Humane Cognizance. The only end I aimed at, was to ſhew the Inſtitution and Deſign of it, that You may know what State and Condition of Life You are now entered upon, and therefore I offer it to Your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious peruſal. For I am perſwaded, if we would but conſider what God expects of us in every Stage and Station of our Life, we would ſoon live as becomes Reaſonable Men and Chriſtians. Be pleaſed then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this as a Teſtimony of my Kindneſs; and God in Heaven bleſs You and the Excellent and Virtuous Lady, which is now your Wife, with his Spiritual and Temporal Bleſſings, and give you Grace to do his Will; that ſo you may fulfil the Deſires of Your moſt Loving and Tender Parents, and the good Wiſhes of all your Friends; that you may attain thoſe ends for which God has given you Excellent Endowments of Mind, Body, and Fortune, and anſwer the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of your Country; that you may follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb facs="tcp:100635:4"/>
of your Great Grandfather, of whoſe Learning and Charity, the Books he writ, and the Colledge he Erected at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> are laſting Monuments; And laſtly, that you may not fruſtrate the earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for your Temporal Proſperity and Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Prophane and Profligate Age, wherein Men generally, either from the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of their <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> or from the Open and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Debauchery</hi> of their Lives, clamour againſt the <hi>Holy Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as things either above, or below, or contrary to their <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or rather as <hi>Appointments</hi> to curb that <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> they give themſelves up unto; I hope it will not be amiſs, eſpecially for Perſons of my Function, to endeavour all they can, as becomes them to put a ſtop to ſuch ſpreading Impiety as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100635:5"/>
now abounds every where, but more notoriouſly in the moſt populous Places. And for this end, I think there can hardly be taken a more effectual Courſe, than to demonſtrate to mens Reaſon, That Revealed Religion, as to the Moral and Preceptive part of it, injoyns no Duty but what is in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing agreeable to the unprejudiced Voice, and promotive of the Common Good of Mankind. Wickedneſs may cloud mens Underſtanding, and ſomewhat <hi>Stifle</hi> the Natural Dictates of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but it can never wholly exſtinguiſh them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Divines may have this comfortable proſpect for all their pains which they ſhall take in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they may force the moſt Looſe and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to an inward Self-accuſation, although their Arguments and Dealings with them may not prove Efficacious enough intirely to reform them.</p>
            <p>It is our Duty to labour in the <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to leave the ſucceſs of our Induſtry to his All powerful Bleſſing. For as there are Seaſons wherein he <note place="margin">Iſaiah 55. 11.</note>
               <hi>makes his word to proſper in the thing for which he ſent it;</hi> So are there times of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial  Blindneſs, in which, what Prophets or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſoever <hi>God</hi> raiſes up amongſt them, mens hearts are hardened, and <note place="margin">Iſaiah 6. 9, 10. Matth. 13. 14, 15. Rom. 11. 8.</note> 
               <hi>in ſeeing they ſee not; and in hearing, hear not; neither will they underſtand.</hi> Thus we know it was twice, if not oftner with that Nation which <hi>God</hi> made choice of to be his <hi>Peculiar People</hi> and <hi>Church;</hi> and if ever the like Judgment ſeize and harden any other <hi>Nation,</hi> we have the greateſt reaſon to think it is then, when the Word of God has no effect upon it. For then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100635:5"/>
Men ſeem to be curſed with an hardened Heart, with an obſtinate and rebellious Temper, and to be given up to a Spirit of Deluſion, which will infatuate and confound them more and more, till they are ripe for Vengeance. God in his Mercy avert this ſad Judgment from us of <hi>England,</hi> which has been heretofore peculiarly remarkable for a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Diſpoſition. And therefore why ſhould that Complaint be as juſt againſt us, as it was once againſt <hi>Iſrael? <note place="margin">Jer. 1. 21.</note>How is the faithful city become an Harlot! it was full of judgement, righteouſneſs lodged in it, but now murderers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible ſuch a Preface as this, is too large for that Diſcourſe, which the Nature and Deſign of the Words I have read, lead me to. Be it ſo; yet I am fully convinced, it is not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent. For is it not that ſame Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from which men deride, much more refuſe to practice the Sacred Laws of God, and the <hi>Aweful Eſtabliſhments</hi> of his Will, that prompts them now to revile that Sacred and Neceſſary Inſtitution and State of Life I am to ſpeak of; which one would think needed not any thing like a poſitive Law from Heaven at firſt to ratify it? If we can ſee any thing in the World without a borrowed Light, we may ſee the neceſſity of this. And when the Laws of God, and the Verdict of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon meet together in the ſame thing, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence can we have either of the Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Obligation of it? There is no curing by meer Natural Means that Blindeſs and Boldneſs which dare riſe up againſt ſuch an Inſtitution; and therefore when the will and Sanction of God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100635:6"/>
are made manifeſt to the Conſciences of Men; if wicked Wretches will ſtill open their Mouths againſt them, it is becauſe they are judicially blinded and given up to <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 26. 1 Peter 2. 11. Eph. 4. 19.</note>
               <hi>vile affections, to filthy and fleſhly luſts,</hi> and <hi>unto laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs.</hi> 
            </p>
            <p>I have ſaid thus much before hand, becauſe I am ſenſible that Marriage has been decried and reviled of late by thoſe, who abſtain from it, not for their Virtues or Religion ſake, that they may with the more freedom of mind <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 34.</note>
               <hi>care for the things of the Lord;</hi> but rather that they may feed thoſe  Vices, and take their Paſtime in thoſe abominable Sins; for the prevention of which, it was in a great meaſure appointed and permitted to all Men, and Chriſtians; ſome of whom perhaps might otherwiſe with more Eaſe and Undiſturbedneſs in their Functions have lived without it. He muſt be a Man of ſtrange Reſervedneſs and Solitary Life, who knows not this to be a common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to break Jeſts upon, and then to give Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for Mirth and Laughter, when the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs of either Married Party, or the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe Religious and Solemn Vows which they made to each other, is either <hi>truly</hi> or <hi>falſly</hi> talk'd of. But believe me, it is a very dangerous thing to jeſt upon the Iniquities of Men. This is to meddle with edged Tools, <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 9.</note> 
               <hi>to make a mock of ſin,</hi> and to be pleaſed with that which ſhould make us all both Fear and Tremble. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men ſay what they liſt (for that wicked Men will do in ſpite of every thing that is Sacred) it is the Duty of all Conſcientious Perſons to regard
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100635:6"/>
the Word of God, and to frame Notions of things, and to have a Veneration for them according to that Sacredneſs they derive from his Will and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now after this manner I intend at preſent to conſider Marriage, from theſe Words of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Author.</p>

But if theſe Words be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as I think they ought to be, in Oppoſition to all Uncleanneſs and Unlawful Beds, then their meaning is, that Marriage only makes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation and Mutual Knowledge of Man and Woman lawful. To every one beſides the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, the Bed is defiled either by Fornication or Adultery, which are Sins of a very heinous and dreadful Nature; for <note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. That God, by what Maniſeſtation of himſelf I know not, was actually intereſted in it. And that firſt of all by framing the Woman out of the Man, which made her the more an affectionate and ſuitable Companion for him. She was but a Part and Portion of himſelf, beautified and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attract his Love, to charm and win his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; ſo that ſhe was but <note place="margin">Eccl. 36. 24.</note>

God's Intention to make them One again in a Bond of Marriage. He offered her to him like a Father amongſt us; he as it were contracted them. and gave her unto him in Wedlock. And on the other ſide, the Man approved and conſented to this Act of God, and received her to be his Wife at his hands; this is ſpecified in the 23d and 24th Verſes of the Chapter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then laſtly, in this Tranſaction may be conſidered that Bond and Union which reſulted from hence; even ſuch an One as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cancel, or at leaſt, <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

Sota, p. 66.</note> not to mention that peculiar hand of Providence, which is obſerved to be in all Marriages; I ſhall infer theſe Three following Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Marriage is to be lookt upon as a Religious Bond and Contract. It depended at firſt upon a Solemn Inſtitution of God, as to all the Eſſentials of it. And ſurely, amongſt all Men, either of Reaſon or Religion, for this Cauſe it ought to be highly eſteemed and honoured. The Laws of God, you know, ſhould regulate every Act of ours that is governable by Reaſon; they ſhould controul and direct our Natural Appetites, and keep them within thoſe Bounds and Limits which he has ſet them. And therefore, becauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100635:10"/>
whatever has any Character of <hi>Religion</hi> ſtampt upon it, does as ſuch proceed from God, and he is the <hi>Author</hi> of it, and in our uſe thereof we ſhould direct it to thoſe ends which he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; we are to look upon Marriage as a Sacred Obligation, and to obſerve the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Deſign of God, whenever we enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whatever God has made lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his written Word, with reſpect to Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, we muſt own and acquieſce in, as ſuch; for his poſitive Law, and the Actual Revelation of his Will, is the Fundamental Director in this caſe. I mean not that God ſhould determine eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that belongs to Marriage-Solemnity; but that whatever he has determined at ſeveral times, and upon ſeveral occaſions, to be of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual practice, ought and muſt be Religiouſly obſerved by them, who have and acknowledge his Revelation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All that are Married, muſt look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as obliged to each other under a Sacred Bond and Tye of Religion. They are to be <hi>faithful</hi> for fear of a Curſe from God, or of being <hi>Betrayers</hi> and <hi>Perverters</hi> of his Holy Inſtitution. They are to drive on no ſeparate Intereſts; they muſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly diſcharge thoſe Duties which the ends of Marriage, their Union, and God himſelf, requires of them. <hi>No man</hi> ſhould act contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and conſequently, <hi>no Married Perſons</hi> ſhould prejudice each other, for they are made One by <hi>Promiſe,</hi> by <hi>Bargain,</hi> and by <hi>Vow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100635:10"/>
II. The next thing I am to conſider, is the Neceſſity of Marriage for the Propagation of the World, and the good of Mankind. Indeed, if God had left Man as undetermined, as he has done other Creatures, which multiply their ſeveral kinds, then there would have been no ſuch thing as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but having not only framed Man, and made him fit to propagate his Species by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Individuals; but likewiſe determined him as to the Manner and Lawfulneſs of it by a Solemn Matrimonial Contract, which he has done in no other Species beſides that I know of; it muſt needs be a Sin in any to break the Rules of this Determination; becauſe it is an open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a perpetual Law, for which an Account muſt be given in the Day of Judgement. And hence is it, that if Men muſt contiune to the World's end, 'tis neceſſary that People marry; otherwiſe they muſt Sin againſt God, and their Off-ſpring will be unlawful. This I would not have ſo underſtood, as that there is a neceſſity upon every one in particular to Marry; but that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ought not, and therefore cannot lawfully be perpetuated in the World, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Wedlock. I know the <note n="*" place="margin">Tal. Babyl. Tit. Jeb. 65. 2. Shulcan Aruch. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben. Ezre. p. 3. N. 1.

This is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation (<note n="*" place="margin">Ex V. ſi Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſeos Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thori fides.</note> tho borrowed from another) of a <note n="†" place="margin">Mr. Le Clerk.</note> Learned and Late Critick upon the 22 Verſe of this Chapter: Whom with <note n="*" place="margin">F.

For they appear to me to labour on purpoſe by their Criticiſms, of which to unbridled Wits, there will never be an end, to undermine the Scriptures (as others do by their Whimſical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Modiſh Philoſophy) and to render them altogether uſeleſs for the ends of Piety and Religion, which God deſigned them for. May he in his due time by ways beſt known to himſelf, and agreeable to his Wiſdom, blaſt ſuch attempts upon his Sacred Oracles, which theſe men look on as a <hi>good old Book</hi> they may Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticize upon, and not as it is the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith and Manners.</hi> In ſhort then, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Text containing a Benediction founded in the Nature and Faculties of Men, the uſe and exerciſe of them ought to be, and are, (as I have ſhewed before) regulated by the Law of God, as all our Powers governable by Reaſon muſt be.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as God has ordained Marriage as the only means for the Continuation of Men in the World, none can violate this method without ſinning moſt heinouſly againſt him. For whoever is ſuch a Tranſgreſſor, turns the <hi>Sin of his Soul</hi> into the <hi>Fruit of his Body;</hi> makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf polluted and brutiſh; propagates the Seed of <hi>Baſeneſs, Reproach,</hi> and <hi>Corruption;</hi> lets his Luſts and Vile Affections hurry him on to break the Laws of God, and he kindles and fans that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flame which will deſtroy him in the loweſt Hell. God has reſtrained all licentiouſneſs by a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100635:12"/>
Maraiage Inſtitution; and why then ſhould men tranſgreſs this Law which is ſo <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual;</hi> hardly any Sins are more provoking than Adultery, Fornication, and Uncleanneſs: God will avenge ſuch ſeverely, he will puniſh them dreadfully, if we may believe his written Word; and therefore thoſe that are guilty of them, cannot eſcape Everlaſting Fire. Now, from all this, you ſee what an Honour is reflected on Marriage from God; it makes the Bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; legitimates the World; makes Parents honeſt, credits their Off-ſpring, and derives a Bleſſing from Heaven. In fine, it gives <hi>Being, Honour, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Rights,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſings</hi> to Children, amongſt all Civilized Nations.</p>

For theſe are the greateſt Worldly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that God can beſtow upon any; they are the <hi>Repoſitories</hi> where <hi>Parents</hi> beſtow the Fruits of their Induſtry and Labours; they are the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> of their <hi>Affections,</hi> which ill Behaviour and Undutifulneſs can never wholly extinguiſh. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches us, and the young Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind may be glad of it, that nothing excites greater Love or Care in Parents than Children; for which this reaſon may be given, that Nature, whoſe Inclinations and Propenſions are unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, has implanted in them a deep Tenderneſs and Love for their Off-ſpring: whereas God knows they have too too often very little cauſe to be kind and loving. Oh! how do they rejoyce at the blooming <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of their Children! They think no <hi>Pains</hi> too much, no <hi>Labour</hi> too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100635:15"/>
for a happy Proviſion for them: And why ſhould not Fathers do ſo? for their Children are nothing leſs than themſelves <hi>multiplied,</hi> their <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Beings</hi> in a manner made <hi>Immortal</hi> in the World, or continued down from <hi>Generation</hi> to <hi>Generation.</hi> This we find reckoned a Bleſſing from God on the Pious Man.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. The laſt thing I propoſed, was to conſider Marriage as an Antidote againſt the moſt <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

1. That they are downright Violations of the Marriage Inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They bring an infamy upon Humane Nature; for they baſtardize the Race of Men, they entail a Diſgrace upon Poſterity, which is counted Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and Baſe both in the Laws of God and Men. And then,</p>

For my Text tells us, <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now finiſhed ſo far as the time would give me leave, the Four Particulars I at firſt propoſed, and ſhall haſten to a Concluſion. You find from what has been ſaid, from whence a Marriage had its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, what are the Benefits and Bleſſings of it, which are <hi>ſo</hi> many and <hi>ſo</hi> great, that to men who conſider what the World is, what the State and Condition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100635:16"/>
of Humane Nature is, it muſt both appear <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> and <hi>Praiſeworthy.</hi> God and Nature has made it an <hi>Honourable State</hi> of Life; and where it is, there is <hi>Power,</hi> and a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>high Reſpect</hi> is due unto it. So that every Married Man as ſuch, <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 23.</note>
               <hi>Should be known in the gates, when he fitteth amongſt the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Land.</hi> To be a Father or a Mother, a  Husband or a Wife, a Maſter or a Miſtriſs, are all of them Titles of Authority and Honour; and ſome of them are communicated to the greateſt Monarchs, as Names of Endearment and Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for they are Fathers to the Kingdoms they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; and when they are ſuch as that Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, they then <hi>have</hi> Power, and they <hi>do</hi> deſerve it. What now need I add more to recommend this State of Life to the good Opinion of all Men, ſeeing that by the Laws of God ſo much Honour is due to it? Yet, however, what I have ſaid, muſt not be ſo underſtood, as that I would ſeem to lay a Neceſſity, or an Obligation in conſcience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Men to Marry. No! I do not intend that, for I dare not cenſure Celibacy ſo ſeverely, <note n="*" place="margin">Ber. Rabbah. par. 34. 21. 2. Ed. ven.</note> as the <hi>Jews</hi> do; and it is ſufficiently known what the Opinions and Practices of the Primitive Chriſtians were with relation to the Unmarried and Married Life. A great deal, I think, is to be allowed to the Prudence or Tempers of Men in this caſe, and to their Circumſtances in the World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho I dare not condemn any for remaining Single, yet I think no reaſon can be ſo <hi>excuſable,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>laudable</hi> for it, as when Men continue in it upon the account of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> when they may ſerve God the better in <hi>that,</hi> than the Married Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100635:16"/>
Certainly to abſtain from Marriage, from a principle of <hi>Looſeneſs,</hi> a <hi>ſordid</hi> and <hi>baſe</hi> Temper of Mind, from Sowreneſs, ill Nature, and the like, is a thing very ſinful.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, I ſhall from a Conſideration of what has been ſaid upon the <hi>Sacredneſs, Neceſſity, Conſolations, Ends,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> of a Married Life, ſhut up this Diſcourſe with ſome Expreſſions of the wiſe Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> whoſe Rules of Life, Judgment of Things, and Elegance of Speech, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with a ſtrain of Piety, ſhew him to be a Man of an extraordinary Spirit. <note place="margin">Eccl. 40. 23. and 26. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>A friend and a companion never meet amiſs; but above both, is a wife with her husband. Bleſſed is the man that hath a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wife, for the number of his days ſhall be double.
