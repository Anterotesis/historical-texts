         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his late prosperous proceedings.</head>
            <div type="body_of_letter">
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have of late addressed some relations
of my proceedings here, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
appointed for the safety of the
Kingdome; being assured, that they
would from time to time impart them
to both Houses, that such considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might be had of them, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the cause required: Now I addresse this relation
to you; not doubting but that it shall be timely imparted
to both Houses, and to the Committee for safety of the
Kingdom, that the affaires of the Country being known
to them all, they may be provided for, as their great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
shal see convenient. I have formerly advertised, that
the Earl of <hi>Newcastles</hi> army have seized upon <hi>Leeds,</hi> where
they plunder the well affected party, and raise a very
great sum of money, out of those that they can draw to
compound for their securities. And from <hi>Leeds</hi> they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
on Sunday, the 18 of this moneth, with 5 Troops of
Horse, 6 Companies of Dragoones, 200 Foot, and two
Drakes, of the Earl of <hi>Newcastles</hi> army, besides Sir <hi>William
<pb facs="tcp:111386:2"/>
Savile,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen of <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> and
their forces that joyned themselves with them, and came
to <hi>Bradford,</hi> about ten a clock in the morning, intending
to surpize the Town, in time of prayer; but the Town
having scours abroad, had notice of their com<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, and
gave the alarme to the Country, who came in to their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
from the parts adjoyning, yet they had not in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
80. Muskets, the rest being armed with Clubs, and
such rustique weapons; with which smal force, they put
the cause to tryall, with the great strength of the enemy,
who planted their Drakes, and discharged each of them
17 times upon the Town, until a Townsman, with a Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-piece,
kil'd one of the Canoniers, and then they all
with great courage issued from the Town upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys,
and kild many of them, and took about 30 priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and forced the rest to retreat, leaving 40 of their
Mu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kets and barrell of their Powder, with much other
provision behind them, and this with losse of three <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
men: The report of the Country is, that the enemies
amongst those that were kild lost Collonel <hi>Evers,</hi> and
Captain <hi>Bynnes,</hi> and an other Commander, and that Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
<hi>Goring,</hi> (Generall of the Horse, with the Earl of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi>)
was wounded, and Serjeant Major <hi>Carr</hi> taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner;
and it is generally spoken, that 150 more are run
away upon the retreat, and are not since returned to <hi>Leeds.</hi>
In which victory the hand and power of God was most
evident, the Town being open on all sides, and of it selfe
not defensible, assaulted on every side by a malicious and
bloody enemy, and defended by a few half-naked men,
there being in the Town not above 80 Muskets, before
they got 40 more by the spoiles of their enemies: so that
slaughter was for the most part with Clubs, and Sythes
mounted no poles, when they closed, and came to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows;
<pb facs="tcp:111386:3"/>
with this defeat the enemies are so enraged, as
they threaten revenge to <hi>Bradford;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>-men
sent to me for succour, of men, and armes; and I
have sent my son, and Sir <hi>Henry Fowles</hi> to them, with three
Troops of Horse, and 120 Dragoneers, who are safely
arived there, and received with great joy, and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Country, who flock to him and offer themselves
most willingly, to serve against their popish enemies, if
armes could be furnished to them; he hath already sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
some Victuals sent in upon warrants to the enemy
at <hi>Leeds</hi> by the overawed Countrey, and he hath sent
Captain <hi>Mildmay,</hi> with his Troope of Horse, and some
Dragoones into <hi>Craven,</hi> to stop the raising of money, and
Forces in that Country, which is attempted by the Earle
of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who is lately retyred from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Skipton,</hi>
and I hope he wil leave nothing unattempted, that may
conduce to the safety of the Country, so far as can be
expected, from the few forces he hath with him. The
Earle of <hi>Newcastle</hi> proceeds in raising money by all the
illegal and oppressive waies that can be devised; and both
by the Commission of Aray, and by presses made in the
Churches, raised all the men he can, which being attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Cleveland</hi> by certain of the disaffected Gentry, their
expectations were prevented, and the resort and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the people stopped, and the Commissioners
themselves forced to fly, by Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley,</hi> to whom I
sent speciall order to that end; and I heare he hath also
been at <hi>Malton,</hi> and there surprised both the receiver and
moneys, raised out of the Countrie thereabouts, by those
warrants. I cannot heare certainly what moneys, or men,
the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> hath raised since he came into this
Country; but he grants Commissions to sundry convict
Recusants, to raise Troops of Horse; as Sir <hi>Iohn Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:111386:3"/>
Sir <hi>Walter Vavasor,</hi> M. <hi>Tyndal,</hi> and others, who I heare
are now raising their men, and I heare daily complaints
of horrible plunders, and spoyls done by that army, and
those by speciall order, and in such manner, as if they
be not speedily restrained, and his popish army expelled
the Country, they wil not only utterly ruine the trade and
commerce of the Country, but discourage and disable all
husbandry, and so bring poverty and famine upon the
Land. Since our last estimate of our Forces, there is little
alteration of them, onely 120 Dragoners of Sir <hi>Anthony
Irbyes</hi> Regiment are come, which I have sent to <hi>Bradford,</hi>
with my sonne, and Col. <hi>Boynton</hi> with his Regiment being
500 Foot, and 40 Horse are come hither, Cap. <hi>Cromptons</hi>
Dragooners, as he complains to me are all run away, so I
have given him a new Commission to raise a Company,
and for any further supplies, I cannot expect them, untill
the ayds come from the South; for Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley,</hi>
as I heare, cannot bring above 130 Men, and those are
so much desired, to be retained in the Northriding, to
interrupt the rising of that Country, in aide of the Earl of
<hi>New-castle,</hi> as I doe not presse his march this way. And
for the <hi>Lincolneshire</hi> aids expected to be sent to us, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hope for any from them having this day received a
Letter by Captaine <hi>Hatcher,</hi> wherein the Earle of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne,</hi>
and the Committee at <hi>Lincolne</hi> write, that they are
not able, to defend themselves, against 500 Foot, and
three Troops of Dragoones, and two Troops of Horse,
with seven peeces of Ordinance sent to <hi>Newarke,</hi> by the
Earle of <hi>New castle</hi> and therefore desire help from me, I
have formerly represented to the Committee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
want of money here, and how impossible it is to
raise any, the Enemy being master of the Field; I have
sent to Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Rhodes,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Cholm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:111386:4"/>
and Captaine <hi>Hotham,</hi> but they all aleadge great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of their own, and helpes me with none; so that I
am put upon such streights, as seldom happen, to retaine
an Army together, and with it serve upon a more potent
Enemy; having neither money to pay them, nor free
quarter to give them; if speedy supply of money do not
come, I much feare the Souldiers will steale away, and
desert the service: I now have received your Letters sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
that the House have designed us 10000. l. to be
presently sent, and do take further care for all necessaries
to be supplied; for which I beseech you, returne my
humble thanks, and assure them that there shall want no
care, nor fidelity in me, to advance the service, so highly
concerning the Religion, and Lawes of the Land: I am
now about to procure billet for 14 dayes, of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Townes where I quarter, and to engage for
the payment assoone as the money comes to mee; All
which I beseech you, represent to that honorable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
whose care I doubt not, but will supply all our
wants now represented, especially hasting down the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the <hi>Southerne</hi> parts, with the money intended for
our supplies. It is advised by the commanders here not
to fall upon any of the Enemies quarters at this time,
untill we be stronger, or have certaine intelligence of
their weakenesse; in the meane time, we ly still waiting
for opportunities, which shall not be neglected if once
offered unto,</p>
