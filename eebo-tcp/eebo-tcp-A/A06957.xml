         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is an Age, (gentle Reader) of much inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition &amp; exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mens printed workes: neither is it in my conceit either vnreaſonable or vnneceſſary that men ſhould giue account for their labours, eſpecially where they make the world beleeue
<pb facs="tcp:765:6"/>
they doe the world a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for otherwiſe the world might come to bee coſened: Therefore for my ſelfe, thus me thinkes I heare the world ſay: Sir why loade you thus both mens mindes and the Booke-ſellers ſtalles with ſuch change and variety of bookes, all vppon one ſubiect, as if men were tyed to your readings? mee thinks the little Pamphlet you firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, might haue giuen ſatisfaction; To this I anſwer: that Pamphlet was the milke of my firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, drawne, not to nouriſh the world, but to giue a little ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a noble Kinſman I had, from whom a very corrupt copy was ſtolne, and in printing without my knowledge; ſo that to ſhield both mine owne ſhame and the bookes, I was compeld to put it forth in that manner as it went,
<pb facs="tcp:765:6"/>
&amp; then, many iudicious Gentlemen in the ſame art found faint in the breefnes therof, ſaying, that the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of my rules took away much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction from the yong ſcholler, an that there was a lameneſſe therein, becauſe I had not handled the whole members of the art, but heere a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and there a toe, as I was led by mine owne fancy. Hence it came I writ the great Boohe <hi>Cauelorice,</hi> and in it omitted nothing in my knowledge appertinent to Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip: but by reaſon of a too greedy and haſty Booke-ſeller, and the diſtributing of the worke into the handes of many Printers, it was not onely exceeding falſly printed, but alſo moſt part of the booke of cures left out, which was ſuch a maime to the booke, that I was many yeares ſtird vp by my friends to repaire that error; which I did by writing that booke intituled the <hi>Maſter-peece,</hi> wherein I haue ſet

downe euery diſeaſe &amp; euery medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, ſo full &amp; ſo exactly that there is not a farrier in this kingdome, which knowes a medicine for any diſeaſe, which is true &amp; good indeed, but I wil find the ſubſtance thereof in that booke yet this book did not ſatiſfie my friends, for they ſaid though it was a worke right good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet the greatneſſe of the booke and the great price thereof, depriued poore men of the benefit; and that the multiplicity of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and the coſt of the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, were ſuch as poore men ſtood amazed at, and found that their beaſts periſht before they could compaſſe that ſhould cure them: from hence onely I haue with much labour and experience found out the Contents of this booke, where with twelue medicines, not oftwele pence coſt, and to bee got com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly euery where, I will cure all

                  <head>The firſt Medicine.</head>
                  <p>If the horſe haue bene brought weake by ſickneſſe, and that you finde it proceedeth from ſome inward infection, or corruption of bloud, you ſhall giue him in the morning faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two ſpoonefull of the powder of Diapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, well brewed and toſt to and fro in a pinte of ſweete wine, as Muſkadine, or Malmſey, and then ride or walke him vp and downe in the Sunne an hower after: then ſet him vp ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry warme in the ſtable, and let him faſt an hower, and then giue him ſuch prouender as he will eate, and his hay ſprinkled with a little water: But if his ſicknes proceed from any colde cauſe, as from ouer-riding, and too ſodaine cooling, or from waſhing when he was hot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſuch like, then you ſhall giue the ſame quantity of Diapente in Sacke, or other hot wine, in the ſame manner, as aforeſaid: But if his ſicknes be leſſe contagious, or that wine is not ready to be had, then you ſhall giue the ſame quantity of the aforeſaid pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, either in a quart of ſtrong Ale, or a quart of ſtronge Beere, obſeruing all the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons formerly declared. Now for this powder which is called Diapente, or (of ſome) Horſe Methridate, becauſe it is a generall Antidote
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:765:10"/>
or preſeruatiue againſt al poyſonous infection, you ſhall make it in this manner. Take of <hi>Aristolochia rotunda,</hi> of <hi>Gentiana,</hi> of <hi>Mirrhe,</hi> of <hi>Bachilauri,</hi> and of <hi>Ebori,</hi> of each a like quantity, beat them all togither in a morter to a very fine powder, and then ſearſe it till not any groſſnes be left, and then keepe it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a cloſe pot, or in a bladder, and vſe it as before ſaide when you ſhall haue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and obſerue to doe it diuers mornings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, if the ſicknes be violent. Now for as much as this powder may many times be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or at leaſt hard to come by on the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, therefore in caſe of ſuch extreamity you ſhall take a good handfull of <hi>Cellodine,</hi> rootes and leaues and all, and hauing pickt and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, you ſhall take of <hi>Wormewood,</hi> and of <hi>Rue,</hi> of each halfe an handfull, boyle theſe in a pottle of ſtronge Ale or Beere, till a full halfe be conſumed, then ſtraine it, and preſſe the hearbes excedingly, and then diſſolue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the drinke almoſt halfe a pound of ſweete butter, and an ounce and a halfe of the beſt treakle: and being no more but luke warme, giue it the horſe to drinke in the morning faſting, and ride or walke him an hower after it, then ſet him vp warme, and let him faſt an other hower, then giue him meate as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: and doe thus diuers mornings accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:765:11"/>
to the greatnes of his ſicknes. Now in this cure, you muſt by no meanes forget to let the horſe bloud in the neck-veine, an hower or two before you giue him the firſt drinke, and let him bleede till you ſee the corrupt bloud change &amp; begin to looke pure, to know which, you ſhall ſaue the firſt bloud, and the laſt bloud, in two ſaucers, and as they coole, they will eaſily ſhewe you the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Now if your horſe happen to fall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſicke vnder you, as you trauell, when there is no towne nor helpe neere you, then you ſhall preſently light from his backe, and with a ſharp poynted knife, or bodkin, or for want of both, with a ſtronge poynt tagge, you ſhall pricke him in the roofe of the mouth amongſt the barres, ſomewhat neere to his vppermoſt teeth, and make him bleed well, walking him foreward, and ſuffering him to champe and eate his owne bloud which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wholeſome, and almoſt a preſent cure: Now if the bloud ſtanch of it ſelfe (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it will) then you ſhall preſently piſſe in his mouth, and ſo ryde him with all gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eaſe home-ward, and being ſet vp warme, waſh his mouth and noſtrills with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, and the next morning let him bloud in the necke-veine, and giue him either of the drenches before preſcribed, and no doubt
<pb facs="tcp:765:11"/>
but you may hold on your iourney without danger. Now if in the pricking of the horſe in the mouth, you either ſtrike your knife too deepe, or elſe cut the veine in ſunder, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you cannot ſtanch the bloud (as it many times hapneth) in this caſe you ſhall put ſome big rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d peece of wood into the horſes mouth (to keepe him from byting) and then take a little of the fine downe of a Hares ſkinne, or a Conies ſkinne, or (for want of them) the fine linte of any wollen cloth, and hold it hard to the wound and it will ſtanch it, neither will it be lickt away with the horſes tongue.</p>

drinke thereof as much and as oft as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Now it may be at the firſt, that partly through the colour thereof, &amp; partly through the ſmell, the horſe will be coy to taſt it, but care not you therefore, but be ſure to keepe him from all water elſe but it onely, and that he may the readier take it, you ſhall doe well at firſt to offer him this water in the darke, that the colour may not offend him, of which when he hath but once taſted, he will then forſake all water whatſoeuer to drinke of this water onely, as I haue often knowne by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.

breed moſt dangerous and mortall ſickneſſes, but alſo it comforteth and ſtrengthneth the inward parts, and breedes great courage and ſpirit in the horſe, whence it comes to paſſe that it is of eſpeciall and great vſe for hunting horſes, &amp; ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning horſes, to be giuen after their heates, becauſe it doth clenſe the body, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents all inward ſickneſſes, keepes a horſe coole and ſoluble in his body, and adds more courage &amp; mettle then any other foode what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: Laſtly the vſe of this medicine one fortnight is as good as a quarter of a yeares graſſe at any time of the yeare, and worketh as many and more good effects, eſpecially in this, that this medicine is to be had at al times, and graſſe is to be had but onely in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeaſon: and whereas at graſſe (if it be ranke and ſweet) a horſe is in danger of many ſickneſſes, as the yellowes, ſtaggers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other which proceed from the corruption of the bloud, or the heat of the ſeaſon, by the vſe of this medicine all thoſe infirmities are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the horſe recouereth fleſh, ſtrength, and liuelihood of ſpirit, without any danger, as proofe ſhall teſtifie, much better then my writing.</p>

Of theſe kinde of Cattell with vs in this Iland of great Brittaine are foure ſorts: the firſt, and beſt, are thoſe which are bred in the weſt parts, as in Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Gloſter-ſhire, Dorſet-ſhire, and the Countries adioyning, theſe are for the moſt part of a bloud red colour, with great, large, and long bodies, tall of ſtature, and ſlenderly caſt downewards, their hornes are little and crooked, and the milke which the Cowes giue is the moſt beſt and wholſomeſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſecond ſort are bred in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Darby-ſhire, Cheſſe-ſhire, Lancha-ſhire, Yorke-ſhire, and the countries adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: theſe are for the moſt part of a coole blacke colour, with large bodyes and ſhort legges, ſtately large and white hornes, and the Cowe moſt fruitfull of all other for breed. The third ſort are bred in Lincolneſhire and the countries adioyning and are of a pied co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, very tall, and large of body, onely ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and long legged.

It is writ of them that they are Aſtronomers, and know the courſe of the ſtarres; certaine it is that they keepe a true diſtance in their times, and crowe more after proportion then order, they are great commanders and rulers of their owne kinde, and ſo iealous of their wiues, that they will die ere any ſtrange Cocke inioy the leaſt ſhowe of their preſence.

the Hens are no leſſe valiant then the Cocks if they be true bred, and will with their oppoſites fight to the laſt drop: they are exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding louing and naturall to their young, and will not onely fight in their defence, but alſo ſtarue themſelues to giue the Chickens ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

Of this nature alſo is the Peacocke,<note place="margin">The Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke</note> who for beauty, pride, and vnderſtanding excedeth all other birds, yet onely are careleſſe of their young. The Peacocke is a birde of long life, ordinarily liuing to the yeares of fiue &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or vpwards, he is a diſh much vſed at ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, for ſhowe, more then for raſt, for his fleſh is not held exceeding wholeſome: for it is certaine that if he be neuer ſo well and dry roſted ouer night, yet he will be bloud-rawe the next day following.

they are alſo excellent flights, and make rare ſport before the hauke, they flye not high but nere to the ground, and though not very nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of winge, yet ſwift after they are on winge: they loue not to flye long by reaſon of their much earneſtneſſe, but muſt haue many reſts, but being ſo ſlaine with the hauke, they are the beſt, tendereſt, and moſt pleaſing foode: they bring forth their broods in great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and hauing once diſcloſed them, the young ones are able to defend themſelues by flight, euen when the ſhel is on their crownes: ſo ſtrong &amp; wilie they are by nature as houſe Doues are, of an innocent nature, and very chaſt, and neither male nor female change their make, but keepe together one true to the other, liuing as coupled by the bond of marriage, keeping their owne hen continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neuer viſiting the holes of others, vnleſſe they be ſingle by the death of their make: The females are humble to their males: the male and female are both carefull of their young ones, nay, you ſhall haue the Cocke oft times chaſtice the hen if ſhe keepe not the neſt well, and yet kinde they be to them when they are about to build, lay, and ſet, as may be ſeene by their readines to them in that caſe: when the hen cometh off the neſt, the Cocke goeth on preſently.

pleaſure to behold them, as hath beene often ſeene by their gazing at the bowe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the hunter, or at a Carter and the like, they are at mighty enmity with Serpents and renew their ſtrength by eating of them, they haue alſo a ſtrange property, that if they goe to feed in yong ſprings or coppes they go full againſt the wind, and ſo can tell whether there be any perſon there or not: and if any man chance to ſpit or piſſe vppon any ſpring or branch in the coppes, they will find it out preſently and vtterly abandon the place: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hunted and ready to bee taken by the houndes, they will for their laſt refuge fly to houſes and places of reſort, rather yeelding to man then to the dogges: and as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith they can indure to ſwimme thirty miles end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes: and when they are to paſſe any great riuer to goe to rut in ſome Ile or foreſt, they aſſemble themſelues together in great heards, and knowing the ſtrongeſt and beſt ſwimmer they make him goe formoſt, and then hee which commeth ſecond ſtayeth vp his head vppon the back of the firſt, and all the reſt in like manner euen vnto the laſt: the formoſt being weary the ſecond taketh his place, and he cometh backward: they go to rut about the middeſt of September, and beare their young ones 8. monthes: ſomtimes they bring

two calues at once: their little ones they practiſe and exerciſe to vſe their legges from the very beginning, leading them vp to high rocks, teaching them to leape, run, &amp; fly away acquainting them with their dens and ſecret places of harbor: the males are horned, and they aboue all other liuing Creatures caſt them euery yeare once at a certaine time of the ſpring, and to that purpoſe a little before their mewing they ſeeke out the moſt ſecret corners and moſt out of the way to hide themſelues: when they are Pollards they keepe cloſe hidden as if they were diſarmed: and all this they doe as if they enuied that men ſhould haue good of any thing they had. Their age may bee knowne by their heads, (for euery yeare they haue one more branch then they had the laſt yeare before) vntil they come to ſixe, after which time: they come new euer alike, ſo that their age cannot be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any more by their head, but their marke is taken by their mouth and teeth: for as they grow in age they haue few or no teeth at all: yet the branches grow out of the root, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all the while they were yonger they vſed to haue them breake forth and ſtanding out at the very forehead.
