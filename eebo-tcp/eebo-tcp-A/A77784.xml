            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. IN primis to find out all ſorts of Mines, and Mineralls of what nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever they be that lie within the body of the Earth and to direct the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, according to their ſeverall natures, and qualities.</p>

            <p n="3">III. To find out the Levell of any Countrey for the draining of Fennes or low grounds; or to direct the making of Engines for the raiſing of water for the ſervice of Cities and Towns where nature failes.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Item a new way of finding out any Ship, Bark, or Boat, which doth lie above the Sand or Rocks, although they lie twenty or thirty Fatham deep in the bottom of the Sea, and to take up the Decks, and the goods that are under the Decks, be they Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance or other commodities without diving an inch under water, and to perform as much labour with one man upon that ſervice, as is now commonly uſed in Seafairing buſineſſe with ten men, and in the ſame time.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Item to ſhew many concluſions, as well for pleaſure as for profit which may ſeem by relation to be things impoſſible, yet to be as really performed as propounded, and with little charge.</p>
            <p>All which ſecrets the propounder hath gained with much ſtudy travell and expences of many thouſands of pounds as was well known to his Majeſty and moſt of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nobility in this Kingdom: And now being old, and out of imployment, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew his Art in theſe things to any which are deſirous to learn upon aſſurance of ſuch reward as they ſhall agree upon, he performing what he promiſes before he do exſpect his reward.</p>

            <p n="1">I. To raiſe any weight from the bottom of the water to the ſurface without diving at all, or making uſe of any principle or motion ſaving the form of an element onely.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. To weigh any uncertain weight without Center, and poize it ſo, that by adding the ſtrength of an horſe hair it may be raiſed up higher from its reſt, in the aire or water.</p>
