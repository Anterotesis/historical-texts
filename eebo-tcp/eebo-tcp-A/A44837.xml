            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the word of the Lord to all people, as I am moved of the Lord to clear the scandals and false accusations cast upon the righteous seed; and as the seed of God in all generations hath suffered reproaches from the world, so now the same seed, where it is brought forth, suffers by this generation of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and is afflicted and tormented, and shamefully accused now in <hi>England,</hi> whom you call Quakers: and you say we deny all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ; and you say we do not honour the Magistrates; nor are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto authority, but are disturbers and breakers of the peace, which is false.</p>
            <p>The first Accusation. You say, we deny <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And this is false, for <hi>Repentance</hi> is the gift of God, and this gift we have received, and his free Grace, which <hi>teacheth us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts,</hi> Tit. 2. 12. And by <hi>Repentance</hi> have forsaken sin, as it was discovered to us by the light of Christ, which he hath enlightned us withall, and so the mercies of God we have found according to his promise, and are sent of the Lord to preach <hi>Repentance</hi> to all people, <hi>who would have all men come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to the acknowledgement of the truth, that they might be saved.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 25. And with the word of the Lord, as they are moved of the Lord, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go now with this Doctrine into your Streets, into your Markets, into your Synagogues, and into your Cities, to call you to <hi>repentance,</hi> before the wrath of the Lord come upon you: &amp; both sons and daughters now are sent to preach this doctrine amongst you from the Lord, and for obeying the Lord herein, are they reviled by you, and persecuted, and falsly accused, and this is left for a testimony against you from the Lord, and shal bear witness against you.</p>
            <p>The second Accusation is, <hi>That we deny baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The baptism of Christ we own, which all the Saints were baptized into, which was, <hi>by one Spirit into one body,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. and by this bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism we do witness the washing away of sin, not onely the washing away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God: But sprinkling of Infants we deny, which there is no Scripture for. And all you who from your imiginations do imitate <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, and so go into the water, and say, You are believers, and have right to the Ordinances of Christ, but you to be believers we deny, who are not yet come to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and your water-baptism, which is but an imitation from the Letter; for the Lord never sent you forth, nor commanded you neither to preach nor baptize, as they did whom you go about to imitate, who are not yet come to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor to the first Principle of the Doctrine of Christ, not to own the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99806:3"/>
light of Christ in your <hi>consciences,</hi> which should exercise them, and lead you to wait upon <hi>God,</hi> and lead you to repentance, and the faith of believers you know not, for <hi>the mystery of faith is held in a pure conscience.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 9. which you cannot witness, which hates the Light of Christ, which should exercise your <hi>consciences,</hi> and so your mindes and <hi>consciences</hi> is defiled, and with that minde you talk of faith, and of the Ordinances of Christ, and of water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, which serveth unto us for a figure, as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. And Jesus Christ was baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> by water, that <hi>he might fulfill all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Mat. 3. 15. And <hi>Iohn</hi> was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and Christ is the end of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> and <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism was but a figure, for he said, <hi>He did but baptize with water,</hi> but Christ is the end of all figures, types, and shadows, and did fulfil them, for he fulfilled all <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Iohns</hi> Ministery, and <hi>Iohns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and he that fulfilled all <hi>Righteousness,</hi> the same baptizeth, which <hi>Iohn</hi> did bear witness unto, and <hi>all men came unto him,</hi> John 3. 16. but hee baptized none with waeer: but this is a mystery to thy dark minde, which knows not the baptism of Christ, nor <hi>Iohns Doct<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine,</hi> nor Jesus Christ <hi>the true light, which enlightneth every one that cometh into the world,</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> bare witness unto, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. but goes to hold up the types and figures which Christ came to fulfill, and so denyest Christ to be come in the Flesh to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and so thou art an Antichrist, who holds up the figures which Christ came to fulfill, and so thou denies the Scriptures and Christ, who said, <hi>he came to fulfill all Righteousnesse;</hi> and the Saints baptism thou art ignorant of, which is, <hi>by one Spirit into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. And <hi>Paul</hi> who was a Minister of Christ, and preached the <hi>Gospell,</hi> did bring many into this baptism, and he was not sent to baptize with water, but to preach the <hi>Gospell;</hi> and all the Churches which he preached unto, came to witness Christs Baptisme with the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> and with <hi>Fire, by one Spirit into one Body,</hi> and was baptized into Christ who was the Head of the <hi>Body, Rom.</hi> 6. 3. and by this baptism we are thus washed from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit; but your imitated baptisme of Water we deny, who live in your filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, whose mindes and <hi>Consciences</hi> are defiled; but the baptism of Christ we own, which purifies our <hi>Consciences</hi> from dead <hi>works,</hi> and keeps our minds undefiled <hi>by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Tit. 3. 5.</p>
            <p>The third Accusation is, <hi>That we deny the Sacrament, which is an Ordinance of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For the word Sacrament, there is no such Scripture which speaks of a Sacrament, therefore we do deny you and your Sacrament, and your bread and wine, which is carnall, and feeds the carnall which must die, and your <hi>Communion</hi> is in that which is carnal in the creatures; and <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Swearers</hi> have fellowship together with you in those things; and all <hi>Lyars, Covetous ones, Prophane</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous ones</hi> eats of the bread, and drinks of the cup, and sits at the Table, which is the Table of devills, and this is your Sacrament, which stands without in carnal bread &amp; wine, and feeds the carnal, which oppresseth &amp; murders the seed of God within you; &amp; you say, <hi>Christ hath left that as an Ordinance for you to practise:</hi> which is false, which we deny; but the Supper of the Lord we own, <hi>The Cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ? and the bread which we break, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99806:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the body of Christ? for we being many are one bread, for we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10 16, 17, 21, 22. <hi>And this is the bread which came down from heaven, he that eateth thereof shall never dye;</hi> and this bread we all eat of, and this cup we all drink of, and this is that which is practised and commanded in the Church of Christ, and so we sit at the Table or Christ, and cannot sit nor have fellowship with the Table of Devills: and they who sit at your Table and your Sacrament, and eats of your bread, and drink of your wine, they die, for it is not the bread of life; and you who eats and drinks it, doth not di<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cern the Lords body, for it is spiritual, and your Sacrament is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>And so you eat and drink damnation to yourselves, not discerning the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> feeding the carnal with the carnal, and so we deny your Sacrament to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ordinance of Christ, or the Supper of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29.</p>
            <p>The fourth Accusation is, <hi>That we deny the resurrection of the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And that is false, <hi>For at the sound of the last trumpet the dead shal be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they that have done good shall arise to the resurrection of life, they that have done evill, to the resurrection of condemnation. And we preach Christ risen from the dead, and if the dead rise not, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also in vain, and you are yet in youe sins, who knows not this resurrection, Christ risen from the dead in you,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>But some man will say, How are the dead raised? and with what bodies do they come?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 35. <hi>Thou fool, that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain, but God giveth it a body as pleaseth him, and to everyseed his own body. There is also coelestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; and the glory of the coelestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another; there is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars, for one Star differs from another Star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead, it is sown in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power, it is sown a naturall body, it is raised a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 35, 36, 37, 38. <hi>Now this I say unto you all, That flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdome of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50, 51, 52. But this is to you all a mystery, who are in the first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whose understandings are not enlightned by the light of Christ, who lives in your sorms, notions, and professions of these things in the letter, feeding your carnal mindes with the Letter, which is death and killeth, and so your mindes are drawn from the Light of Christ within you, into outward obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of meats and drinks, bread and wine, <hi>divers washings and carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which were figures of the time then present,</hi> Heb. 9. 9, 10. and you deny. Jesus Christ the substance, <hi>who is the true light that enlightneth everyone that cometh into the world.</hi> Now to the light in you all I speak, which Christ Jesus hath enlightned you withall, and if you love this light it wil lead you out of all your carnal Ordinances and worthips, and divers washings, which stands in the first covenant, which was before Christ, and is done away in Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond covenant, and it wil lead you to worship God in the spirit, and into the doctrine of Christ, to yea and nay in all your communications: but all you who are got up high in forms and profession, you are not yet come to yea and nay, but are out of the doctrine of Christ, and walks contrary to the light of Christ in your consciences, which light shall be your condemnation that hates it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 19, 20. though you be got up high in your forms, and notions, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99806:4"/>
words of the Saints conditions, who spoke in the light and from the life: And you who have the form, but not the life, shall be condemned by the life; and you who hate the light, shal be condemned with the light and life which gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The fifth Accusation is, <hi>That we do not honour Magistrates, nor are subject unto Authority, but are disturbers and breakers of the peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Justice we own, and righteousness; and all who love the light of Christ which he hath enlightned them withall, it will lead them to act justice. And all Magistrates, I charge you in the presence of the living God to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is pure of God in the conscience. And all Magistrates who act according to that of God in the conscience, are honoured by those who fear the Lord, and walk in obedience to that in the conscience: and these who act justice according to that in the conscience, they do not bear the sword in vain, for that in the conscience is according to the Law of God, and all you Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, who are set over the people to do justice, and execute the Law upon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, this is the word of the Lord to you, to mind the light of Christ in your consciences, and it will cause you to act according to the place of a Magistrate; but if you suffer swearers, and drunkards, or lyars, or oppressors, or fal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And them whom you call quakers are no drunkards, nor no swearers; for Jesus Christ saith, <hi>Swear not at all, but let your yea be yea, and your nay be nay;</hi> and so they abide in the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Christ, and keep the peace of <hi>God,</hi> and are justified in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> and are no breakers of the peace, but are subject unto Authority, and for conscience sake cannot break the Commands of Christ, nor do any wrong nor violence unto any man and the peace; for they are no fighters nor strikers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 45. but they are smitten and striken, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And you are the same generation now, for any who are sent of the Lord now, to preach repentance, to turn you from your iniquities, that your mindes might be turned to the Light of Christ within you, which will check you for sin and evill, then your Cities are on an uproare against them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute them, and so you fill up the measures of your fathers iniquity.</p>
            <p>A word from the Lord to all you who are called before the Magistrate to be a Jury, who swear before the Magistrates to see the Law put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that you will execute the Law upon drunkards and swearers, and that you will see that the poor, the fatherless, and widows be relieved, and

not see them want, and this you swear before the Magistrates, That you wil see it performed, and that none be idle, nor wander abroad without a calling; and some of you that swear to punish drunkards, are drunkards, and have fellowship with drunkards; and you that swear to punish swearers, are swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and here out of your own mouth you are condemned, and by the light of Christ you are judged, who are swearers, you are out of the commands of Christ, who saith, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> And you see the poor, the fatherless, and widows in want, and you do not relieve them; and you see idle persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any calling, and you do not set them on work; but they live in idleness, devouring the creation; and herein you do not perform your vowes, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuse the Law which you profess, and so acts contrary to the light of Christ in your consciences.</p>
            <p>Now to the light of Christ in you all I speak, and charge you in the presence of the living God, to take heed unto it, and it will let you see wherein you have transgressed the pure Law of God, and suffered sin to reign unpunished, and it will bring the condemnation upon you, who have acted contrary to it, and taking heed to the light, it will lead you out of all those things which the Law of God takes hold upon, and will adde the Law upon every transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all you that act contrary to the light of Christ in the conscience, it will be your condemnation, and you are they who deny the Ordinances of Christ, which walks not according to the light of Christ, which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned you withall; and you are they who are not subject to Authority, who are not obedient to the light of Christ in the conscience, and you are the disturbers and breakers of the peace, whose mindes are not guided by the light of Christ; and this light will let you see, giving heed unto it, who are out of the commands of Christ, and is not subject unto authority, nor obedient to the light of <hi>Christ</hi> in the conscience.</p>
            <p>And here I have cleared my conscience to you all from the Lord, to the light of Christ in your consciences I speak, which will eternally witness mee to have spoken the truth unto you all, who have falsly accused the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</p>
