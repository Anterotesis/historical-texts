         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I must also confesse, I had rather haue had my head broken, then my Sermon so mangled. For this Sermon hath
<pb facs="tcp:5306:3"/>
beene twice printed already without my procurement or priuitie any manner of way; Yea, to my very great griefe and trouble. Neuerthelesse, I haue thought good to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of no man: For in whom the fault re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, I cannot learne certainely; This I am sure, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>

To whom <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> answered; what <hi>Clinius,</hi> dost thou not know I haue done as I did, that such fellowes as thou art might write as you would? And so, it was my part to take such paines as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently I could, in furnish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng and prouiding this Sermon against the appoynted time. But afterward, what others, either by reporting, or printing, would make of it, that was not my fault, that was not in mee either to helpe or hinder. Therefore I haue not gone vnto any Magistrate to complaine; but though it bee one of the greatest iniuries that euer was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered mee, yet because I know not what secret purpose the Lord had in laying this affliction vpon me, I doe most willingly pardon it. Yea euen as <hi>Moses,</hi> when the first Tables were broken, was content to make a new; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb facs="tcp:5306:3"/>
finding in the first Editions so many bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-ended sentences, I haue, as it were, gone to a Chirurgian, or rather indeed I haue played the Chirurgian my selfe, and by setting out the Sermon anew, haue salued the matter as well as I could.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diogenes</hi> seeing the Citie of <hi>Myndus</hi> very little and poore, but the gate therof ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large and stately, said, You of <hi>Myndus,</hi> shut your gate, and keepe in your Citie, that it runne not away. After the same sort, the gate (as I may say) and the first entrance into this Sermon, was before very loftie and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Sermon it selfe very simple and poore. Such a stirre they kept in terming it, very vainely, and most fondly, <hi>A most Excellent Sermon,</hi> as if they would haue cast the house out of the window, or the Citie out of the gate: wherefore I haue made the gate lesser, and the Citie greater: the gate lesser, by entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, <hi>The Meane in Mourning,</hi> which is the very drift indeede, and the right scope of the whole Sermon: and the Citie greater, by adding diuers notes in sundry places of the Sermon, as I haue since thought best. So that if any which heard it preached, bee disposed to reade it, hee shall not, I hope, altogether loose his labour. For though he haue all here
<pb facs="tcp:5306:4"/>
which hee heard then, yet he heard not all then, which hee hath heere. But how it will please God to affect others, I know not; This I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t well, that many a time and oft I haue beene much moued my selfe with the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some poynts in this Sermon. And now of late, next to God, and to his holy word, I could take comfort in nothing so much, as in reading that which I haue written in the seuenth part, the first Section thereof. Occasioned thereto by the certaine report of the death of my most deare Father, who was well knowne for his place and calling to be as good a man, and as sincere a Christian, as any hath liued in this age. But for conclusion, I humbly desire your Ladishippe, that as I haue dedicated the <hi>Path-way to Perfection</hi> to my very Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good Patron, Sir <hi>George Carey</hi>: so it would please your Ladishippe, to let this Sermon passe vnder the countenance and credit of your name. For if your Ladishippe will deigne to reade it ouer, then I doubt not but diuers other Ladies and Gentlewomen which haue vertuous and noble mindes, will vouchsafe also to learne thereby, how they ought (with the daughters of Ierusalem) not to weepe for Christ, but to weepe for themselues, especially hauing such a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

And when they offered vp to the Lord their first borne, who was ordinarily in euery family their Priest or their Preacher, they offered also with him, a paire of Turtle doues, or two yong Pigeons; That paire of turtle doues did signifie a paire of mournefull eyes; These two yong Pigeons did signify like wise two weeping eies.

Christ Iesus is much delighted in such kinde of eies, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so often to his Spouse, <hi>Thine eyes are Pigeons eyes.</hi> The holy Ghost also descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe in the forme of a <hi>doue.</hi> And the Prophets like <hi>doues</hi> vpon the waters which are washt with milk, and remaine by the full vessels <note n="g" place="margin">Cant. 5.12.</note> vsually receiued their prophesies besides riuers.

The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> was so valiant, that he ouercame a mightie huge Giant, and tare a Beare in peeces, as easily as if it had beene a Kid, and slew a fierce Lion with no other weapon, but only with his naked hands, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times like a violent whirlwinde bare downe all before him: Yet when hee came to preach, he was so soft-hearted, and so tender-eyed, that he sayd, <hi>Mine eyes gush out riuers of water, because men keepe not thy law.</hi> O that my head were full of water, saith <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and mine

                  <p>Touching <hi>Prayer,</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>The prayer of a iust man preuaileth much, if it be feruent,</hi> For a feruent prayer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from a feruent spirit, which is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inspired with that holy spirit who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth request in vs, and for vs, with sighes and grones which cannot be expressed.

were turned into a sweet sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of teares. Therefore God heard her prayer, and sent her a sonne. The rather, because this weeping, the more bitter it was to her, the more sweet it was to God. So <hi>Iacob</hi> wrastled with God, and preuailed against God <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 32.28.</note>.

                  <p>THE third part is next, <hi>Weepe not.

Too much is contrary to nature. <hi>But weepe,</hi> too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is contrarie to repentance. <hi>Weepe not,</hi> too much is contrarie to reason. <hi>But weepe,</hi> too little is contrarie to Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. <hi>Weepe not,</hi> too much is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to religion. <hi>But weepe,</hi> too little is contrary to prayer.

thee? Death (I warrant) will answer you, that the only cause of this is the death of Christ. Euen as a Bee stinging a dead body, takes no hurt, but stinging a liue body many times looseth both sting and life together; in like manner, death so long as it stung mortall men only, which were dead in sin, was neuer a whit the worse: but when it stung Christ once, who is life it selfe, by and by it lost both sting and strength. Therefore as the brasen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was so farre from hurting the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, that contrariwise it healed them: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same sort, death is now so far from hurting any true Israelite, that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, if affliction, as a fiery serpent, sting vs, or if any thing else hurt vs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently it is helped and redressed by death.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:5306:19"/>
vizard from his face, then euery boy laughes him to scorne. So is it in this matter. Death was a terrible bulbeggar; and made euery man afraide of him a great while; but Christ dying, buckled with this bulbeggar, and coniured him (as I may say) out of his hollow vault, when as the dead comming out of the graues, were seene in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and puld the vizard from his face, when as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe rising, left the linnen clothes which were the vizard of death, behinde him.

O blessed, blessed bee our Lord, which hath so disarmed death that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do vs any hurt, no more then a Bee

Hee that felleth a tree vpon which the Sun shineth, may well cut the tree, but cannot hurt the Sunne. He that poureth water vpon Iron which is red hot, may well quench the heate, but hee cannot hurt the Iron. And so Christ the Sun of righteousnesse did driue away the shadow of death: and as glowing Iron was too hot and too hard a morsell for death to disgest. All the while <hi>Adam</hi> did eate any other fruit which God gaue him leaue to eate, he was nourished by it: but when he had tasted of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tree, he perished. Right so, death had free leaue to deuoure any other man, Christ onely excepted, but when it went about to destroy Christ, then it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed it selfe.

so properly bee said to liue in our first birth, as in our second birth: and Christs life when he lay in that new wombe, in which neuer any other was conceiued, is nothing to his life, when hee lay in that new tombe; in which neuer any other was buried. Wherefore as <hi>Iacob</hi> trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards <hi>Haram,</hi> when he had laid an heape of stones vnder his head, and taken a nap by the way, was much reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with it after his tedious iourney: so Christ trauelling towards heauen, when hee had slept a little in that stony sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre which was hewn out of a rocke, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued then most princely after his painfull passion.

                  <p>It is lastly <hi>the life of man.</hi> When Christs speare had opened that way of life which the Cherubins sword had stopt vp; Then said our sauiour to the Theefe, This day shalt thou be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> both in one day were expelled out of Paradise; Christ &amp; the theefe both in one day were receiued into Paradise; yea, both in one houre of the day: For about Noone, when the winde blew, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; and so about the sixth houre, that is, about twelue of clock in the day time, Christ and the Theefe were receiued.

                     <hi>and that they might haue it more aboundantly. More aboundantly?</hi> What is that? That aboundantly wee might haue more life by the Crosse of Christ, then euer wee could haue by the tree of life: that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly we might gaine more by the obedience of Christ in his death, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we lost, or could loose by the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Adam</hi> in his life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though that sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was so heinous and so horrible: that it cast the Image of God out of Paradise; that it polluted all the race of mankinde; that it condemned the whole world; that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the very frame of heauen it selfe; yet considering the sequell, how not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the guilt of this sinne, but euen the very memory of it is now vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the bloud of Christ, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> is not afraid to say, O happy, happy, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man was <hi>Adam,</hi> that euer hee so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and transgressed against GOD <note n="b" place="margin">

such life by Christs death. For as honey being found in a dead Lyon, the death of the Lyon was the suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Sampson</hi>: so Christs gall is our hony, <note n="c" place="margin">

Now then to the fifth part. <hi>For your selues.</hi> Weepe not too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for your owne life: For the life of man is quite contrarie. The life of man is <hi>the life of Death, the life of the Diuell, the death of himselfe, the death of Christ.</hi> The reason of all this is his iniquitie and sinne. Which euen in Gods deere chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, saies <hi>Bernard,</hi> is cast downe, but not cast out. <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>De iectum non eiectum.</hi>

sometimes rule ouer vs, because it is cast downe, yet it will alwayes dwell in vs, because it is not cast out: For it is so bred in the bone, that till our bones be with <hi>Iosephs</hi> bones carried out of Egypt, that is, out of the world, sinne cannot be carried out of our bones. The Irish histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry telleth vs, that the Citie of Waterford giueth this poesie, <hi>Intacta manet,</hi>

We cannot say thus of the nature of man; that it is either so cleare from treason as that Citie, or else that it is so cleare from infection as that Island is. Nay, our very reason is treason, and our best affection it is no better then an infection, if it bee well sifted in the sight of God. <hi>Euagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> recordeth,<note n="f" place="margin">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:5306:33"/>
in such sort as the Romanes did this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian King. But doe we what we can doe, sinne will alwaies be a Iebuzite, a false borderer, yea, a ranke traytor, rebelling against the spirit. Which makes the life of man, first to be, sayes <hi>Chrysostome, a debt</hi> (as it were) owne and due <hi>to death</hi>

Hereupon Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, that sinne being finished, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling in child-birth like a mother bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth death. And <hi>Dauid</hi> in the ninth Psalme calleth sin the gate of death: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as a man comes into a house by the gate; so death came into the world by sinne. The corruption of our flesh did not make the soule sinfull; but the sinne of our soule did make the flesh corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

                        <hi>Pabulian mortis.</hi>
                     </note>. As a fire goeth out when all the fuell is spent, but burneth as long as that lasteth: so death dieth when sin ceaseth, but where sin eboundeth, there death rageth. The Prophet <hi>Abacucke</hi> sinning not, death was so farre from him, that hee was able to flie without wings: But King <hi>Asa</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, death was so neere to him, that hee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5306:33"/>
was not able to stand vpon his feet. Nay, we may see this in one and the selfe-same man. <hi>Moses</hi> sinning not, death could not meet with him in the bottome of the red sea; but sinning, death did seaze vpon him in the toppe of mount <hi>Nebo.</hi> So that the life of man by reason of his sinne, is <hi>the life of death.</hi>

Then being asked againe, if he had not rather liue then die, No saith he as before, for they are al one. But <hi>Ierome</hi> saith farre more excellently, They are not all one. That is not true. For it is one thing to liue in continuall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death; another thing to die in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall assurance of life. <note n="q" place="margin">

                     </note> Therefore <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes</hi> saith, That the day of our death is better then the day of our birth: For when we are borne, we are mortall; but when we are dead, we are immortall; And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5306:35"/>
we are aliue in the wombe to die in the world; but wee are dead in the graue to liue in heauen. Hence it is that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are merry at their birth-day, as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> made a feast at his birth-day, when his chiefe Baker was hanged <note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 40.20.</note>: and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> likewise made a feast at his birth-day, when <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was beheaded: but they are sorry at their dying day, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was sorry when hee went about to hang himselfe: and <hi>Caine</hi> was afraid euery one would kill him that met him. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the godly are sorry at their birth-day, as <hi>Iob, Let the day perish wherein I was borne:</hi> and <hi>Ieremie, Let not the day wherein my mother bare mee, be blessed</hi> 
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Ier. 20.14.</note>: But they are merry at their dying day, as <hi>Simeon, Lord, now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace</hi>: and <hi>Paul, I desire to be dissolued, and to be with Christ.</hi> Therefore we also keepe holy dayes, and celebrate the memory of the Saints, not vpon their birth-daies, but vpon their death-dayes, to shew that these two are not all one, but that the day of our death is better then the day of our birth. For whereas there are 2. waies, the one hauing in it, first a transitory life, and then an eternall death, the other hauing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5306:35"/>
in it first a transitory death, and then an eternall life: the wicked chuse to liue here for a time, though they die for it hereafter eternally; but the godly chuse to haue their life hid with Christ here, that they may liue with Christ eternally hereafter. Therefore the wicked neuer thinke of death, but the godly thinke of nothing else. As <hi>Alexander</hi> the Monarch of the world had all other things saue only a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre to bury him in whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was dead; he neuer thought of that: But <hi>Abraham,</hi> the heire of the world, had no other pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his own but only a field which he bought to bury his dead in; he thought of nothing els. We read that <hi>Daniel</hi> stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed ashes in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to descry the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of <hi>Bels</hi> Priests, which did eat vp the meat: So did <hi>Abraham</hi> strow ashes in his memory, saying; <hi>I will speake vnto my Lord, though I be but dust and ashes.</hi> So doe all the faithfull, remembring they shall one day be turned to dust and ashes. That so seeing and marking the foot-steps of death, how it continually commeth and steales away their strength (as <hi>Bels</hi> priests did the meat) how it daily eateth vp and wasteth and consumeth their life, they

may be alwayes prepared for it. Our first parents made them garments of figge-leaues: But God misliking that, gaue them garments of skins. Therefore Christ in the Gospell cursed the fig-tree which did beare onely figge leaues to couer our sinne: but commended the Baptist which did weare skins to discouer our mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

Wherefore let euery one as soone as he is tempted to any sin, thinke straight-waies that hee sees Christ comming towards him, wrapt vp in white linnen cloathes, as he was buried, with a kercher bound about his head, and crying after a ghastly and fearefull sort, Beware, Take heed what you doe, Detest sinne, abhorre sin: Fie vpon it, A shame light on it It: did once most vilely

Our sinnes are those Soldiers which take him, those tormentors which whippe him, those thornes which gore his head, those nailes which pierce his feete, that speare which sheds his bloud, that crosse which takes away his life. And yet if to grieue him thus continually would doe vs any good, then hee would be most glad to preferre our good, though neuer so little, before his owne griefe, though neuer so great.

As Asse carrying Christ into Ierusalem, the children sung most merrily; Christ carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his crosse out of Ierusalem, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wept most mournfully.

bad them, straight wayes the stones fell a weeping before Christ bad them. And what heart of man then could here haue refrained from weeping, though it had been harder then any stone, seeing the hard stones before his eyes thus dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and distilled into teares? Yet behold the <hi>benignity</hi> &amp; louing kindnes of Christ, Christ died, not for the <hi>Sunne:</hi> not for the <hi>Temple:</hi> not for the <hi>Graues</hi>: not for the <hi>stones</hi>: but for vs men, and for our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he died. Yet he suffereth these sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les creatures to weep, and to haue a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feeling of his death, though they had no benefit by his death. But being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himselfe to shed his dearest, and his best bloud for vs, yet will not suffer vs in recompence to shed so much as one little teare for him. No, no, sayes he, I will beare all the sorrow, you shall haue only ioy: and though I die and shed my very heart bloud for you, yet you shall not so much as weepe, or shed the least teare for me. <hi>Not you, weepe not for me.</hi> Thus much for his <hi>Benignitie.</hi>

                  <p>Lastly, for <hi>Magnanimitie</hi> he sayes, <hi>Not for mee.</hi> Strange stoutnesse and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: Especially in him that was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5306:49"/>
not onely to bee bound, but euen to die also for the saluation of man? He knew well enough his passion would be a new kind of transfiguration vnto him: For at his transfiguration he was accompanied with his deere Disciples, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>: but at his passion <hi>Peter</hi> denied him, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> forsooke him. And there he was vpon mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sweetly of hearbs and flowers: but here he was vpon mount <hi>Caluery,</hi> which smelled loathsomly of bones and dead mens sculs. And there his face did shine as the Sun: but here his face was couered, nay it was buffeted and spit vpon. And there his garments were white as the light: but here his garments were parted, nay they were like <hi>Iosephs</hi> coate, all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed in bloud, and he himselfe stript stark naked. And there he was betweene two famous Prophets, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>; but here when they thought hee called for <hi>Elias</hi> to helpe him, <hi>Elias</hi> would not come, nay he was betweene two theeues, the one at his right hand, the other at his left. And there his Father spake most ioyfully to him from heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is my beloued Sonne, in whom only I am plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5306:50"/>
but here he screeched most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to his Father from the Crosse, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Yet behold, behold, the Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christ. Christ knew well enough, before hand, of all this fearefull and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible passion prepared for him, wherein he was not transfigured, as before, but disfigured, so as neuer was any man. Yet nothing could moue him. This coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of his Disciples, this noisomnesse of the place, these diuelish buffets vpon his bare face, these bloudy wounds vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his naked body, these vile theeues, these hideous screeches, could not one whit daunt his heroicall heart. But euen as a noble Champion hauing already had a legge and an arme slasht off, when all the stage in admiration of his valour and manhood, cries, <hi>Saue the Man, saue the man,</hi> yet puts out himselfe, and standing vpon one legge; and striking with one arme, fights stil as stoutly as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer been hurt at all: so Christ hauing bin scorned and scourged already, when the whole theater of heauen and earth wept for him, yea when the powers aboue the heauen came downe, and the dead vnder

with the crowne wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his marriage, and in the day of the gladnes of his heart.

He calleth the day of his passion the day of his marriage, and the day of his death vpon the crosse, the day of the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his heart. Thus you see in this seuenth part, the Wisedome, the Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the Magnanimitie of Christ, in that he saith, Not weepe, Not you, Not for me. <hi>Weepe not for me.

                  <p>THE eighth part, which is the last, now onely remaineth; <hi>But weepe for your selues:</hi> Wherein wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likewise three vertues that ought to be in vs: Deuotion, Compunction; Compassion. For Deuotion hee sayth, <hi>But weepe</hi>: For Compunction, <hi>But you</hi>: For compassion, <hi>But for your selues.</hi> But weepe; But you; But for your selues.

                     <hi>But weepe for your selues.</hi> First for Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee saith, <hi>But weepe.</hi> Deuotion generally is a supernaturall dexteritie, wrought by the Holy Ghost, in the heart of a deuout man, whereby hee is made prompt and ready to performe all those duties which appertaine to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. As a man may bee said to bee deuout in Preaching, deuout in hearing, deuout in making prayers, deuout in giuing Almes. But here espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Deuotion; I vnderstand a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine softnesse and tendernesse of the heart, which oftentimes is resolued into teares, considering the mischiefes and miseries of this world. For if Christ in this place wisheth them of Ierusalem to weepe for themselues, and did himselfe else-where weep for Ierusalem, saying, O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how often would I, but you would not? How much more then ought wee to weepe for the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse of this world? They of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem were carried captiue into Babylon; That captiuitie of Babylon endured se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty yeeres, or threescore &amp; ten yeares. Now iust so long lasteth our life. As the Psalmist saith; The dayes of our life are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5306:52"/>
threescore yeeres and ten. So, that by this account, our whole time in this world, is nothing else but the captiuity of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.

We reade that King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, hauing the King of Scots and the French King his prisoners here in England both together at one time, held royall iusts in Smithfield: The iusts being ended, hee feasted both the Kings most sumptuously at supper: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter supper perceiuing the French King to be sad and pensiue, hee desired him to be merry, as others were.

captiuity? Especially seeeing neither we haue such welcome in the world as hee had in England, neither yet is England so farre from France, as Heauen is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from them both.

Our whole life is nothing else but such a spoyle and sackage. And among all the miseries of this life, nothing is more miserable then this life it selfe. For euen those things which might be most comfortable vnto vs, as we vse them, do breed vs much sorrow. Learning and knowledge, a great delight: Yet <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> sayth, Hee that addeth knowledge, addeth sorrow. Wealth and riches, a good complement: Yet Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, Goe to now you rich men, weepe and howle for the miseries which shall come vpon you. So that the onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5306:53"/>
wee can haue in this life, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and a godly bewailing of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happines. Which made our Sauiour say, Woe be to you that laugh now, for you shall waile and weepe. But on the other side, Blessed are they that mourne now, for they shall bee comforted. Therefore holy <hi>Iob</hi> desireth God to spare him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, &amp; let him liue a while longer. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? That hee might laugh?

He thought a man could not haue time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in this life, though it were neuer so long, to lament and rue the miseries of this life, though it were neuer so short.

spoken, as our whole life, and all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, especially these affections of ioy and sorrow, vvhich rule all the rest, might thereby be ordered and directed aright. For weeping, or not weeping, are things indifferent, simply of themselues neither good nor bad, but thereafter as according to circumstances, and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, they are either vvell or ill vsed. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as <hi>glorying,</hi> or <hi>labouring,</hi> or <hi>fearing,</hi> or <hi>louing.</hi> For <hi>glorying</hi> it is said, Let not the wise man glory in his <hi>wisedom,</hi> but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Lord.</hi> For <hi>laboring</hi> it is said, Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which abideth for euer.

onely, but him that can destroy both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule. Loue not, but loue: Not the World, but God. And so here, weep not, but weepe. Not for mee, but for your selues. <hi>Weepe not for mee, but weepe for your selues.</hi> To weepe is lawful; to weepe without not weeping, is vnlawfull. Not to weepe is lawfull: not to weepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weeping, is vnlawfull. Againe, To weepe for your selues is lawfull: to weep immoderately for Christ is vnlawful. Not to weep for Christ is lawfull: not to weep moderately for your selues, is vnlawfull. Whereas without any vnlawfulnesse in either, both weeping and not weeping will be lawful.

But alas, I can doe no more now, but commit and commend all that hath been spoken to the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual working of the Holy Ghost in you, and to the faithfull obedience of your good hearts to God. Blessed be God: I am yet very much reuiued (being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise almost quite spent with speaking so long) when I looke about me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold euery one that is present. For I see no place in this great Auditory, where there are not very many ready to weepe, the water standing in their eyes, and some already weeping right-out, in true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse and sorrow for their sinnes. You make me remember that which we read in the booke of Iudges, when the Angell of the Lord found fault with the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites for their disobedience, they lifted vp their voyces and wept, and called the name of that place <hi>Bochim,</hi> and offered vp sacrifices there vnto the Lord <note n="d" place="margin">Iudg. 2.5.</note>. This place also may bee now called <hi>Bochim,</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:5306:64"/>
that is, the place of weeping, wherein you haue offered vp as many Sacrifices to the Lord, as you haue shed teares for your selues. O what an acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God is this your sorrowfull spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? I warrant you you shall neuer repent you of this repentance: you shall neuer be sorry for this sorrow. This sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spirit of yours makes God haue a ioyfull spirit, and greatly pleaseth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth the holy Ghost. Wherefore now that we haue once made the good spirit of God reioyce and take pleasure in vs, let vs not in any case hereafter, let vs not hereafter grieue the same spirit of God, whereby wee are now sealed vp to the day of redemption. The Holy Ghost is grieued when we are not grieued, but if wee be thus grieued for our sinnes, then is the Holy Ghost delighted. Yes such griefe and sorrow will not onely bee to the Holy Ghost a great pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but also it will be to vs the very seed or the interest and loane of euerlasting life <hi rend="sup">c</hi>. For looke how a Father pittieth his owne childe, and if he see him crie, doth what hee can to still him, and takes out his handkercher, and wipes the infants

eyes himselfe; after the same fashion God our heauenly Father will with his owne holy finger wipe away all teares from our eyes, and take vs most louingly by the hand, and lead vs out of the house of mourning into the house of mirth. Then though wee haue sowen in teares, yet wee shall reape in ioy <note n="f" place="margin">

Therfore it is said of the law, <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 7.19.</note> That
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:5306:70"/>
it made nothing perfect: but of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 19.13.</note> that it is most perfect in it selfe. And of the tower of Babel, <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 14.30.</note> these men began well to build, yet could not perfect it: but of the frame of the world, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 2.1.</note> thus the heauen and the earth were perfectly finished; yea so perfectly, that euery thing since, which hath had any little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of this perfection, is said to be as perfect as God made the world. Now of all things in the world; man especially is borne, not to die, as an vntimely birth, but to liue: and man liueth not to rot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as vntimely fruit but to flourish for euer. Therefore we that doe not die vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, but liue vnder grace, <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> must not bee like the law, but like the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? and wee which shall not rot away as the Tower of Babel, but flourish for euer, as the building of God, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.9.</note> must not be like the tower of Babel, but like the frame of the world, labouring continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be perfect, as our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is perfect <note n="(g)" place="margin">Mat. 5.48.</note>.

And yet al this is but the outside of heauen: al this we shal see with our bodily eye. The inside and the insight is much more glorious. For the best glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy seeing innumerable Saints &amp; Angels more highly exalted then he is, hath his ioy doubled and trebled, and beyond all measure multiplied, when he considereth that he is loued vnspeakably more by all of them, yea by euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than hee can be by himself. And therfore again see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself so deere vnto them, he for his part likewise as a hot burning cole is set on fire and inflamed with loue, and the more he seeth any other excell him in glory, the more doth hee reioyce, and is gladder of his glory then his owne. But now when hee lifteth vp his eyes to the

glorious Trinitie, and seeth how the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost doe eternally and perfectly loue and like and enioy one another in surpassing sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and content, then all his affections are swallowed vp in loue, all his spirits are rauisht in delight, all his desires are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radized in pleasure. Insomuch, as if on the one side were laid the loue of Christ as he is man, and of all the Saints &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels among themselues, and on the other side, the loue which the least glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in heauen beholding the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, breatheth out to God, this loue would without all comparison excell &amp; exceed that as far as light doth darknes, or as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doth the earth.

waues of the Sea: another while hee was boyled in the bowels of the Whale. But as soone as he returned to God, by &amp; by he was cast vp safe vpon the sea shore: and then he said to his soule, My soule returne vnto thy rest, because the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored thy selfe vnto thee <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Quia dominus reddidit te tibi.</hi> Psal. 119.7</note>. Because whereas before, thou hadst lost thy selfe: lost thy selfe in the tempest: lost thy selfe in the sea: lost thy selfe in the Whale: now the Lord hath restored thy vnto thee. Wherefore the <hi>heart</hi> of man hath lost all rest: nay, it hath lost it selfe, before it be cast vpon the Sea shore; before it be cast vpon God: but when once it delighteth in the Lord, when once it findeth God, then it findeth it selfe, then it returneth vnto rest. <hi>Nicaula</hi> Queene of Saba, could neuer bee quiet in her owne country, till shee came to <hi>Salomon</hi>: but when she saw his glory, and heard his wisdome, then her heart fayled her, she had enough, she could desire to see and heare no more.

For like as <hi>Noahs</hi> doue could finde no rest for the sole of her foote, all the while she was flickering ouer the floud, till shee returned to the arke with an oliue branch in her mouth: so the <hi>heart</hi> of a christian, which is the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doue of Christ, can finde no rest all the while it is houering ouer the waters of this world, till it haue siluer wings as a doue, and with the oliue branch of faith, flie to the true <hi>Noah,</hi> which signifieth rest, till Iesus Christ put forth his holy hand out of the arke, and taking this heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand, receiue it to himselfe. Euen as one good <hi>heart</hi> saies for all, I will not climbe vp into my bed, nor suffer mine eies to sleepe, nor mine eieliddes to slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

But whats the reason of all this? I am som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bold to aske, because I wold be glad to know: whats the reason I say, that the bull can neuer bee quiet, till hee come to the staule; that the bucket can neuer bee quiet, till it come to the water; that the needle can neuer be quiet, till it come to the north pole; that <hi>Ionas</hi> can neuer bee quiet, till he come to the sea shore; that <hi>Nicaula</hi> can neuer be quiet, till shee come to <hi>Salomon</hi>; that <hi>Noahs</hi> doue, can neuer bee quiet, till it come to the arke; that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5306:144"/>
mans <hi>heart,</hi> can neuer be quiet, til it come to God? The reason of it is this. When God created heauen and earth, hee rested not in the heauen, or in any heauenly thing, not in the earth, or in any earthly thing, but onely in man, which is both. A heauenly thing for his soule, &amp; an earthly thing for his bodie. As soone as hee had made man, he kept a sabboth, and rested.

Lord of heauen and earth: Lord of soule and body. As soone as it commeth to God, &amp; delighteth in him, it keepeth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day, &amp; resteth. Gods hart neuer resteth till it come to man: mans heart neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth til it come to God. For as God sayes to man, My sonne giue me thy heart <note n="m" place="margin">Prou. 23, 26</note>: so man sayes to God, my Lord giue me thy self. For euen as the heart desireth the water-brookes: so longeth my heart, my soule, after thee, ô God. Therefore, ô God, giue me thy selfe. Shew me thy selfe, and it sufficeth <note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 14.8.</note> mee.

another hell, wheras they might goe out of one heauen into another heauen? For why do you (beloued) why doe you tell me so much, of I know not what? of a worme, that neuer dieth? of a fire, that ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer is quenched? of a lake, that burneth with Brimstone? of weeping, &amp; gnashing of teeth? Thus I tel you (good christians) and I tell you truely, and God in heauen heares what I say, though you heare me not; I tell you as loud as euer I can; that, to serue sinne so slauishly: to please the diuell so wretchedly: to delight in the world so brutishly, as many men doe: this is worse then all wormes: worse then all fires: worse then all lakes: worse then all weeping: worse then hell it selfe.

Of frankinsence, is a heart that seeketh, and myrre, in a hand that knocketh. When <hi>Moses</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mount Oreb, <note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 17.5.</note> his handes were holden vp by <hi>Vr</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Yea they did not only hold vp his hands, but also they held his rod in his hands. Now the rod of <hi>Moses</hi> was a figure of the crosse of Christ. Whereby we are taught, that wee must not <hi>knocke</hi> with our owne hands, but with <hi>Moses</hi> rodde in our hands, not trusting to bee heard for the workes of our owne hands, for our own merits, but for Christs mercies. For this rodde of <hi>Moses</hi> is the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5306:162"/>
crosse of Christ, the key of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the key wherewith <hi>Elias</hi>

                     <hi>knockt,</hi> or rather indeede he stood not without, knocking like a stranger, but with this key of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hee lockt and vnlockt heauen at his pleasure. Among them that haue beene borne of women, there hath not risen vp a greater then <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist. Not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. True, Onely the first <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> was as great, as the second <hi>Elias Iohn</hi> Baptist. For both of them came in one and the selfe same spirit, in one and the selfe same power. No maruel then though <hi>Elias,</hi> being such a holy man, one while by turning the key one way, did lock vp the whole heauen, another while by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the same key of prayer as much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, in the turning of a hand, did vnlocke all the doores and windowes of heauen, and set them wide open. Why do ye maruel at this? Euen we, we our selues I say, shall bee able to doe as much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Elias</hi> did, if wee come in the spirit &amp; power of <hi>Elias,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist did. If we haue such a spirite in our heart to seeke and such a power in our hand to knocke it shall likewise be opened vnto vs. For Christ hath sayd here, <hi>Knocke,</hi> and it shall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5306:163"/>
be opened vnto you. Thus much for the first part, what wee in our prayers must performe to God, in these words, <hi>Aske, seeke, knocke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second part followeth, what God for our prayer will performe to vs, <hi>And it shall be giuen you.</hi> That's for temporall things. In another place it is sayd, Giue, and it shall be giuen you. Here, Aske, and it shall be giuen you, So that it is all one with God. We may get as much of him by asking, as by giuing. By asking, that which wee haue not, as by giuing that which we haue. Yet S. <hi>Iames</hi> sayes, <note n="r" place="margin">4.3.</note> you aske, and it is not giuen you. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son followes, Because you aske amisse: For you aske temporall things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them vpon your lusts. Now though this be the end which thou intendest, yet thou darest not confesse so much with thy mouth. Therefore then perhappes, thou maiest aske and misse, when at thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest aske amisse. When as, sayes <hi>Barnard,</hi>

Hee saies not, their praiers are in his eares, but his eares are in their praiers, To signifie, that though our praiers be so weake, that they cannot pierce through the cloudes, and much lesse enter into the eares of the Lord of Hoastes, yet that hee will bowe downe, &amp; incline his eares vnto our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. So that though our praiers cannot bee in his eares, yet his eares shall bee in our praiers. A captaine of the hoast of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael being cut off by the time, before hee could cut off all his enemies, spake to the sonne, saying, <hi>Sunne, stand thou still.</hi> This was a temporall thing, euen time it selfe which hee praied for.

wherein the Lord obeyed the voice of a man <note n="y" place="margin">Ios. 10.14.</note> His praiers were not in the eares of the Lord. They went vp to the sunne, and no further. Yet the eares of the Lord were in his praiers. For the Scripture saies not that the sunne obeyed, but that the Lord obeyed the voice of a man. To signifie, that not onely God himselfe will yeeld vnto vs, but also if the sunne, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of his creatures, should refuse to giue vs our asking, yet that hee will command and compell them also, with himselfe to serue vs. And what man then will not obey the voice of the Lord, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord will obey the voice of a man? <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> being plagued with frogs, got the man of God to pray for him, <hi>And the Lord did according to the word of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

                  <p>Hence wee may learne two special points for our instruction. One is, that our repentance must bee continuall. For the Psalmist hauing said before, <note n="(9)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Laboraui in gemitu meo</hi>
                     </note> I haue been weary of my gronings, addes hereat the last, <note n="(10)" place="margin">

                     <hi>I will water my couch with my teares.</hi> I haue bin weary; and, I will be weary. or, I haue watered, and I will water: implyes a perpetuity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Wee read it commonly in the Psalme thus: The mouth of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shall be stopped<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 107 42.</note>. Which is true, first in this life: where seeing before their eyes so many examples of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; protection ouer his children, if they will not praise him, yet they shall be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5306:179"/>
forced will they nill they, at least wise to hold their peace, and not blaspheme him. Then at the day of iudgement.

                     </note>. The mouth of all wickednes is stopped. For foolish men are plagued for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and because of their iniquities<note n="d" place="margin">Vers. 17.</note>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they rebell against the words of the Lord, and lightly regard the councell of the most high<note n="e" place="margin">Vers. 11.</note>. Therefore many times their fruitfull land maketh hee barren for the wickednes of them that dwel therin. <note n="f" place="margin">Vers. 34.</note> Yet so foolish are they, that they will not once open their mouth to confesse, either their owne wickednesse, or Gods goodnes. Their mouthes are so stopped, that they will neither cry to the Lord in their trouble, that so they may be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from their distresse, nor yet when they are deliuered, praise the Lord for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5306:179"/>
his goodnesse, and declare the wonders that hee doth for the children of men. The stopping of their mouth then, is a double, both sinne in them, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them. A double sinne, because they open it not, to crie vnto the Lord for deliuerance, or to reioyce in the Lord, and to praise him after deliuerance. A double punishment, because for their not praysing God, their mouthes shall be so stopt that yet they shall not blaspheme him, and for their not dispraysing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and confessing their sinnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and crying to God for pardon, they shall haue nothing, though they would neuer so faine, at the last to say for themselues. Whereby we see that wicked mens mouthes shall be stopped, because they haue bin stopped. Seeing if they had bin open in this life to accuse their owne selues for their sinnes, then they should be open also at the day of iudgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excused by the Lord. But, because they haue bin stopt here to couer theyr sinne, therefore they shall be stopt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to discouer theyr shame.

                  <p>The other point which we may hence learne, is this, That our repentance must alwayes be ioyned with a purpose of new obedience.

But though he haue bin wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yet indeed he is not wearie, seeing he purposeth twice as much as hee hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

I will wash my bed, and <hi>I will water my couch with my teares.</hi> So that the greatest righteousnesse of the saints in this life, consisteth rather in a dayly deploring of their sinnes, and in a faithfull purpose to

amend, then in any eminent and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection <note n="f" place="margin">

Not that we ought to serue God by halfes as it were, with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and intents, but that hereby the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfitnes of our obedience may appeare, which though it be as much as wee can doe, considering the weaknes of our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, yet it is not halfe so much as wee ought to doe, considering the excellencie of Gods law. Wherefore I shew now, not what should be, but what is, because the best obedience of ours that is, is not so much as the least part of that which should be. Harken I pray you attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth<note n="20" place="margin">Rom. 7.19</note>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To will is present with me: but I finde no meanes to performe that which is good. For the good which I would doe, that do I not: but the euill which I would not doe, that doe I. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but sinne that dwelleth in me. Where the Apostle plainely distinguisheth betweene these two, to will good, and to performe good. And the one he sayth is present with him but the other he can no where find. Now if so chosen a vessell<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 9.15</note>, will much more good, then he can performe, than questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5306:181"/>

                  <p>Hence we may gather two very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table notes, worthy of our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The first is, That euerie new act of sin must be bewayled by a new act of repentance. Not that it is possible for vs to reckon vp, or euen so much as to remember all and euery of our sinnes, but that hauing heartily repented of those or of that sinne which most daungerously hath wasted and almost destroyed our conscience, then we ought at the last to say with the Psalmist, <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 29.12.</note> VVho can tell
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5306:191"/>
how oft hee offendeth? O clense thou me from my secret sinnes. This same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet, euen when he was in the state of grace, defiled himselfe with an other mans wife. Yet he slept not ouer long in this sinne, but being awaked by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nathan,</hi> and more throughly by this sickenes which was Gods messenger vnto him, he renewed his repentance, &amp; <hi>watered his couch with his teares.</hi> So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> we. For it is nothing but a slander which the Church of Rome casteth vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that forsooth wee should teach a man whose perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iustified by faith in Christ committing some foule act, is neuer a whit the worse for it. Nay, our doctrine is this, That such an one hath hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe two wayes. In respect of his owne guiltinesse and in respect of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. For the first; though God for his part doe not breake off the purpose of adoption, and adiudge him to wrath, and therefore he is not guiltie of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for sinne; yet he is simply guiltie of sin, &amp; hath grieuouslie wounded his own conscience. For the second, though God againe hath pardoned al the sins of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, euen those that are to come, by his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5306:191"/>
decree by his promise, by the valew and price of his sonnes merites, yet absolutely and actually hee doth not apply this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the apprehension and feeling of the sinners faith, till hee recouer himselfe, and renew his repentance. Many this we teach, that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This question consisteth of two parts. The one touching condemnation: the other touching impenitency. To the former part I say as before. Though there be sin in them, yet there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them, which are in Christ Iesus. <note n="g" place="margin">Rom 8.1.</note> But how? this is no thankes to them that sin, thereby making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues guilty of sin, &amp; as much as in them lieth subiect also to condemnation for the same: but onely to God, who wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vp all the sinnes of his children in

the bowels of his deare sonne, that they appeare not in his sight to condemne them, either in this world, or in the world to come. As <hi>Shew</hi> went backwarde, and couered his fathers nakednes <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 9.23</note>so God casteth our sinnes behind his backe, and doth not impute them to vs. Howbeit though condemnation neede not be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet there are reasons enough besides to perswade all those to hate sinne, that loue God, One is, because God doth vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally withdraw the outward signs of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 44.24.</note>. Why standest thou so farre off, O Lord, and hidest thy selfe in the needfull time of trouble?

And euen so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the godly sinning, though they quench not the Spirite altogether <note n="p" place="margin">1 Thes. 5 19</note> yet by grieuing it, they felt such a desolation in their soules, as if they were quite cast out of fauour with God. To the latter part of this question I aunswere, that the sinnes of the godly are therefore with repentance, because the graces of God are without repentance <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 11.29</note>. And as it is vnpossible that they which sinn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of the spirit, should bee renewed by repentance <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 6.6.</note>, so it is vnpossible that they should not bee renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which sinne of infirmity, as all the

faithfull doe. For though the flesh haue the vpper hand, one while enforcing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to sinne, yet the spirit will get the maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie another while, making them heartilie sorrie for their sinne.

For first, what a horrible thing is it, either for God to withdraw his fatherly and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable countenance from vs, or for vs, to haue a hell as it were in our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, both which as I haue alreadie shewed, doe necessarily follow sinne? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, seeing all the good wee get by sin, is repentance and griefe, farre better it is to beginne by times to repent, and so forthwith to enioy the comfortable fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Gods mercifull pardon, then by deferring our repentance, still to bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the horrour of our guiltie conscience. Moreouer, the ende is not a barre against the meanes, but rather a great furtherer, and setter of them on forward. We being therefore sure we shall

Here is the Dictamus. For this abhorring of himselfe is a recouering of himselfe: and the sooner hee repents in dust &amp; ashes, the sooner is hee freed from all his sinnes, &amp; from al the punishments due to the same. But now some man may further obiect and say.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary one to the other, so that yee cannot doe the same thinges that yee would <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note>. For if the faithfull would doe Gods will in earth as it is in heauen, and serue him as obediently, and as perfectly as the good angels doe, they can not, because still in them the flesh

Which spirit though it may for a time bee shutte vp as it were, yet it will finde meanes well enough at length to shew it selfe. Thus <hi>Elibu</hi> saith. The spirit within me compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me. Behold my bellieis as wine which hath no vent, and like the new bottles that burst.

in him, neither can he sinne, because hee is borne of God. Marke yee this well. The Apostle thinketh it not enough to say, Hee doth not sinne: but addeth more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, He cannot sinne. What is that? To witte, presumptuously without feare, hee doth not sinne: and desperately without remorse he can not sinne, He can not sin, I say, presumptuously, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did desperately, as <hi>Caine</hi> did, malitiously, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did blasphemously, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did. He cannot, hee cannot sinne thus. Why so, Because the seede of God remaineth still in him. And what is the seede of God? It is the spirit of God, of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> saide euen now. The spirit lusteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the flesh, and these are contrary one to the other, so that ye cannot do the same thing that yee would. Yee doe not sinne, nay yee cannot sinne as the flesh would haue you, ye cannot doe the same things that ye would: but yee doe, nay ye can not choose but doe manie times as the seede of God remaining in you, and as the spirit of God lusting in you, would haue you. So that this is a legall kinde of preaching to say. Take heede you sinne not: yee may happen so to loose your

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:5306:219"/>
may note, what great difference there is betweene the first Adam, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. The first Adam was in Paradise, a place of all abundance and pleasure: the second Adam in the desart, a place of all scarcitie and want. The first was full, and so the lesse needed to eate the forbidden fruit: the second fasting, and so the easilier drawne to make himselfe meate. Yet the first, though he were in Paradise, and full, when his wife inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to eate the apple, tooke it, and ate it: but the second, though he were in the desart, and fasting a long time, when the deuill enticed him to turne stones into bread, would not yeeld to him, but said, <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>

Holy Iob was vpon a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill: Christ was in the desart.

                  <p>Where, before we goe any further, it will not be amisse to assoyle one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Why our blessed Sauiour at his mothers request turned water into wine, and yet at the deuills request would not turne stones into bread? But the answer is easie enough. This begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of miracles, saies S. Iohn, did Iesus at Cana in Galile, and his Disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in him. Two ends therefore did hee propound to himselfe in working that miracle. The encrease of his owne glorie, and his disciples faith. Now here, neither of these two ends could be attained: For how should hee not haue disgraced his glorie, if hee had shewed any vaine glorie? If thou bee the Sonne of God, sayes the Tempter, commaund that these stones bee made bread. So that his temptation tended onely to this end, to make the Sonne of God vain-glorious. Againe, how could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5306:220"/>
we haue beene perswaded by him, if he had beene perswaded by the deuill? For he might haue seemed to haue done this miracle not onely by the deuils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, but by his power. The summe is this therefore, To conuert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore soule vnto God, or to make a sonne of God, he would haue done it; vaine-gloriously to shew himselfe the Sonne of God, he would not doe it; but said, <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>man</hi> is very materiall: As if hee should haue said Any ordinarie man liueth not by the bread; but by the power, &amp; strength, and as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calleth it, the staffe of bread, which God giueth it. Now if he that is but a bare man, liueth rather by the blessing of God, then by the bread; much lesse need I presume vpon vnlawfull meanes, that am both man and God. Againe, wee must obserue, that by <hi>The word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> we are not to vnderstand the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten will or word of God, but the secret counsell and decree of God, in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5306:220"/>
and sustaining his creatures: For example, if the word haue gone out of Gods mouth, and if God haue set it downe, and said it, that I shall liue as well without bread, as with bread, so it shall be. Or if God in his prouidence haue prouided, that a stone shal nourish mee as well as bread, then I shall not need to distrust his goodnesse, or to vse vnlawfull meanes for my releife. For, <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely, but by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>

                  <p>There are two places of Scripture, which are fit Commentaries vpon this text.<note place="margin">cap 9. v. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, saith the Preacher, Bread is not to the wise. One would thinke him but a simple wise man, that cannot by his wisdome prouide himselfe bread, that is, sufficient maintenance for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. Yet thus is falleth out oftentimes.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5306:222"/>
The prodigall child was wise enough:<note place="margin">Luk. 15.17.</note> Beeing but the yonger brother, he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the matter so, as that he got of his father an equall portion of goods with the elder brother. But what came all his wisdome to in the ende? Forsooth as length he was driuen to such shifts, that for want of bread he was faine to eate husks with the hogges. And then hee said, How many hired seruants in my fathers house haue bread enough, and I starue here for hunger? Thus falleth it out many times with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are wise to follow their owne pleasures, and not to serue God. But with the seruants of God it is not so. Therefore saith the Princely Prophet, I haue beene young, and now am old: yet did I neuer see the righteous forsaken, nor their seed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their bread. So that man getteth not bread by wisdome onely, and when he hath gotten bread, <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the mouth of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, saith the preacher, Riches are not to men of vnderstanding. That rich man in the Gospell wanted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>

                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:5306:222"/>
had so much riches,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.10.</note> that he could not tell what to doe with them, he resolued to pull downe his olde barnes which were too little, and to build bigger. But what saide the answer of God? Thou foole, this night shal they take away thy foule from thee, and then, whose shall thy goods be? Wherfore be that thoght himselfe of great vnderstanding before, is here declared to bee foole, and a poore foole also, hauing not so much as his soule left to helpe him. The losse whereof can not be recompenced and counteruailed with winning the whole world. A mans life then doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the aboundance of those things which he possesseth. But the louing kindnesse of the Lord is better then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Psal. 63.4. Prou. 10.</note> better then liuing, yea better then life it selfe. For in God onely we liue: And only the blessing of God maketh a man rich. Whereupon we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that man getteth not riches by vnderstanding only, but by the blessing of God: Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, saith the Preacher, Fauour is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5306:223"/>
not to men of knowledge. It seemeth that a man of knowledge and learning should obtaine fauour and acceptance, wheresoeuer he becommeth. But it is not so. Oftentimes, either he getteth none, or else he looseth that which he hath gotten. <hi>Haman</hi> a man of great knowledge,<note place="margin">Ester 7.10.</note> and authoritie, and fauour with his Prince. Yet because he abused this fauour to the oppression of Gods people, and of true religion, therefore he lost it. And that mischeife which he imagined against others, lighted vpon his owne pate. Indeede when God hath appointed any one to be a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of his glorie, either in Church or Common-wealth, then sodainly the Lord giueth him extraordinary fauour. So he gaue Ioseph fauour with King Pharao: so he gaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mardocheus fauour with King Assuerus. For fauour and promotion commeth neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the North, nor from the South, but God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is which setteth vp one, and casteth downe an other. He, as the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin singeth in her Magnificat,<note place="margin">Luk 52.</note> casteth downe the mighty from their se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>s, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5306:223"/>
exalteth the humble and meeke. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man getteth not fauour by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely, but by the fauour of God. Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine teacheth vs, that if we haue gotten the race, gotten the battel, gotten bread, gotten riches, gotten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, we should not ascribe these things to our owne sacrifices, to our owne strength, to our owne wisedome, to our own vnderstanding, to our own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but to the grace of God, and the blessed word proceeding out of his mouth. Thus the Prophet exhorteth, saying, Let not he wise man glorie in his wisedome, nor the strong man in his strength, but let him that gloried glory in this, that he knoweth the Lord. Now no man knoweth the Lord, but hee which knoweth that all good successe he hath in any thing, commeth of the Lord. And thus much for the first place of Scripture, which is a commentarie vpon this text. Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the mouth of God.</p>

they labour but in vaine that build it: and except the Lord till the field and sow the seede, they labour but in vaine that sowe it. Paul planteth, Apollo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, but God giueth the encrease: which is true not onely in the spirituall watering of the word, but also in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall planting and sowing seede. So that man bringeth not much in by sowing onely, but by the encrease which God giueth. Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, saith the Prophet, Ye eate, but ye haue not inough. Many there are which want for no eating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but like that rich glutton fare deliciously euery day: yet it is smally seene by them. But as those seuen leane kine hauing deuoured the seuen far,<note place="margin">Gen. 42.21.</note> were neuer a whit the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; so these.

In conclusion then, Man hath not enough by eating onely, but by the peace and loue of God. Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly saith the Prophet, Ye drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ye are not filled. Many consume, &amp; as we say, drinke down their whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. Like the horseleach they euer say, Giue, giue: like the man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, that had the dropsie, they drinke still, and the more they drinke the more they list. Committing in the meane season two sinnes, forsaking God the fountaine of liuing waters, &amp; digging to themselues pittes that can hold no waters.<note place="margin">Ier. 2.13.</note> On the other side, <hi>Elias,</hi> when as the Angel brought him a cake ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5306:225"/>
so fully satisfied with these, that hee went in the strength of this meate and drinke forty daies vnto Oreb the mount of God.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 19.6.</note> Could such a small pittance of bread and water of it selfe sustaine him so long? No marrie. What was the matter then? The word that proceeded out of Gods mouth had appointed so, that one cruse of water should suffice him all that time. Whereby we see, that man is not filled with drinking onely: Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Commentar. in c.

Whereupon he saith, I will take a way my corne in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof,<note place="margin">Hos. 2.9.</note> and I wil deliuer my wooll and my flaxe.

                     </gap> prentises to vs, to preserue vs, and serue vs, if we serue him. But in case we serue him not, then the creatures are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and are bound no more to serue vs. The wool and the flax contrary to their nature will not serue our turne, if we contrarie to grace rebell against God. Whereas Iohn Baptist hauing a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Camels haire, and a girdle of leather about his loynes, was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. This leather serued him to as good vse as flaxe, and the Camels haire kept him as warme as wool. Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not warme by cloathing onely, but by vertue of God annexed to the clothing. Man liueth not by bread one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, saith the Prophet, Hee that earneth wages, putteth the wages <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a broken bagge. We see in the world
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5306:226"/>
many men haue great fees, great offices, great reuenues, and yet can scarse keep themselues out of debt. Other some, haue but very small wages, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who indeed earned wages, but seeing it was the wages of vnrighteousnesse, therefore it run out of the bagge as fast as it was put in: For first, when he had it he could not hold it in his hands, but brought it backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, saying,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.5.</note> I haue sinned in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent blood. Then himselfe went and made away himselfe, and that which is feareful but once to name or mention, all his bowells gushed out: There is a broken bagge. But the Patriarch Iacob, earning wages verie hardly, to wit, seruing fourteene yeares for his vncles daughters, and sixe years for his lambs, in all twentie yeares, in the ende filled his bagge full. And though Laban changed his wages ten times, yet he could not one time change that blessing of god, which was alwaies

And though he allotted his nephew only the spotted lambs, which commonly were verie fewe to his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet the word proceeding so out of Gods mouth, this prooued an infinite gaine vnto him.

O that we had such good soules, such thankefull hearts in vs, as that euery one of vs would in like sort confesse and acknowledge his owne vnworthinesse, and the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worth and wealth of Gods mercie. O Lord, sai's he, I am not worthy of the least, or I am lesser then the least of all thy mercies. He makes no mention of his owne paines and trauailes, though they had beene very great in that long seruice, but onely of the mercies of God. These were the only cause that his bagge was so full. Wherefore man fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not his bagge by earning wages onely, but by the mercies of God, Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery

Not sacrificing to our own yarne, as the Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, or kissing our owne hand: but kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the sonne, and offring vp to him only the sacrifices of praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing at whose hand we receiue all good things. For it is not our painfull sowing that giues vs a plentifull crop: not our eating that feedeth vs: not our drinking that satisfieth vs: not our clothes that warme vs: not our earning wages that filleth our bagge: but the good word that proceedeth out of Gods mouth, which blessed all these things vnto vs. Therefore as we must not begin any of these without grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying, so must we not end any of them without thanksgiuing. And thus much for the second place of Scripture, which is a commentarie vpon the text: Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5306:229"/>
word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>To make good vse then of all that hath beene spoken, I shall desire you to obserue foure points. First, that God can worke great matters with small meanes. Thus saith our Lord; When I brake the fiue lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> how many baskets full of broken meate tooke ye vp? they said vnto him, Twelue. And when I brake seauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong fowre thousand, how many bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of the leauings of broken meate tooke ye vp? and they said, Seauen. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely there is no reason in the world that seauen loaues should satisfie fowre thousand; and much lesse, that fiue loaues fiue thousand. But Christ hauing giuen thanks and blessed the bread, did that by the might of the word procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of his mouth, which by the naturall power and condition of the bread could neuer haue beene done. Therefore also he repeateth it, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioneth with his disciples about it. That by their confession and report, all the Church afterwards might bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e, that God can worke great matters with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5306:229"/>
small means, &amp; that Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that God can work strong matters with weake meanes. What a strong violent matter is it, to pull the soule of any one sinner out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell, and out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>awes of destruction? yet this God doth. But how doth he it? This strong matter, howe doth he worke it? By the weakest means that may be. Wee haue this treasure, saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">2. Cor 6.7.</note> in earthen vessells, that the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of that power might be of God, and not of vs. O marueilous words, That the excellencie of that power might be of God, and not of vs. For if Angels were sent to preach vnto vs, it might be thought, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of sinners consisted in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the Angels ministrie, not in the power of Gods word. Now simple and sinnefull men, such as our selues are, no better then earthen vessels, bringing such a treasure vnto vs, the excellencie of this worke must needs be wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to God. And as it is in spirituall foode, so it is in corporall. It is not the

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth the soule. And so it is not the bread onely, but the blessing of Gods grace vpon the bread which sustaineth our life. Thus God can worke strong matters with weake meanes; and Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, that God can worke some matters with no meanes. When King Asa sawe himselfe ouer pressed with the multitude of his enemies,<note place="margin">2. Chr. 14.11.</note> he praied th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> to God: O Lord, it is all one with thee, to saue with many, or with no power. If he had said with many, or with a small power, it would haue beene plaine. But with many, or with no power, is verie wonderfull. Or rather it is no wonder at all, seeing it is spoken of God, with whom it is a very ordinary matter to saue, not onely as well with a small or a weak power, as with a great or a strong power, but also as well with no power, as with some power. It is a good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5306:230"/>
who hauing crooked and rough timber put into his hands, can hew it and make it fit for the building. Onely the creator of all it is which can worke, hauing no matter at all to worke vpon. The ordinarie meanes for plants and hearbs to growe by, is raine: Yet God prouided for Adam plants and herbes before euer it had rained.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.5.</note> The vsuall meanes for light is the sunne. Howbeit God created light before he made the sunne.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> Light the first day, the sunne the fourth day. We see then that God is ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no meanes. God can saue with no power, as wel as with some power: God can giue vs hearbs with no raine, as wel as with some raine: God can giue vs light without any sunne, as well as with the sunne: God can feede vs if it please him, as well with no bread as with bread. Therefore God can worke some matters with no meanes; and so Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that God can worke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some matters with contrarie meanes. He can not onely shewe vs light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5306:231"/>
any sunne,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.6.</note> but also bring light out of darkenesse. So our Sauiour, when hee went about to cure him that was borne blind,<note place="margin">Iohn 9.6.</note> tempered spittle and clay, and put it vpon his eyes. This plaister seemes more likely to put out his eyes which sees, then to cure his eyes who is blind. Yet this is the power of the word proceeding out of Gods mouth. So the Prophet Elizeus,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 4.40.</note> when colloquintida was put into the pot, by casting in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meale into it, made of tanke poyson a wholesome broth. So, when the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites wanted bread in the desert, God sent them Manna from heauen; &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses said vnto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath giuen you to eate.<note place="margin">Exod. 16.25.</note> Many things here were contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. One thing especially, that the dew which made the manna, fell in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereas other dew vseth to fall in the euening, and ascend in the morning. Therefore Moses putteth Israel in mind of this strange miracle afterward;<note place="margin">Deut. 8.3.</note> God made thee hungry, and fed thee with Mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, saith hee, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers knowe it, that hee might teach them that man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5306:231"/>
not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth a man liue. Christs answer then to the tempter is, as if hee should haue said; I want now bread in the desart, as long agoe the Israelites wanted it. But God by his word proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them. Therefore I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach vpon vnlawfull meanes, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending still vpon his prouidence, I shal neuer want. For God can worke great matters with small meanes, strong mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with weake meanes, many matters with no meanes, and some matters with contrary means. So that Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>And yet this is no doctrine of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and securitie neither. As we must not by diffidence or distrust in God, vse vnlawfull meanes: so we must not by presuming vpon God, neglect lawfull meanes. That we be not too distrustfull we are sent to the lillie; and yet that we be not too negligent, we are sent to the ant.

                     </gap>ion. Such are they of the Church of Rome. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of S. Pauls Epistles, they doe notably peruert this. For out of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:5306:233"/>
that the Apostle saith, Affliction wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth glory; they endeauour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the patience of the Saints, and other their vertues, merit euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life. But first the word, To worke, is very generall, and signifieth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causes properly so named, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny antecedent, though it be but an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct, or an accident. Againe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles words elsewhere are these:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the afflictions of this life, are not worthy of the glorie which shall be reuealed. Wherefore they might haue done well, to choose some indifferent construction which would haue recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled both these places together, rather then to embrace such an exposition of the one, as doth iustle, nay quite thrust out the other. S. Bernard doth thus, saying,<note place="margin">Via regni. non causa regnandi.</note> that good workes, are not any cause meriting a kingdome, but onely a way directing to a kingdome. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are no cause, neither haue any correspondence, or proportion in them in respect of the glorie to come, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle saith, The afflictions of this life are not worthy the glory that will be reuealed. And yet againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:5306:234"/>
the possessing of our soules in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, is a way directly tending to the saluation both of our soules &amp; bodies, therefore hee saith, The momentarie lightnesse of our afflicton worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall weight of glory. To which our Sauiour sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth in these words, The gate is straight, and the way narrowe which leadeth vnto life. This straightnesse therefore and narrownesse of affliction, is not a cause which deserueth, but a gate or a way which leadeth vnto l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e. So in an other place we haue, that by many tribulations wee must enter into the kingdome of heauen. Not by many tribulations, no nor by any tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we must merit heauen, but by many tribulations as by a gate or way, wee must enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And in this sense S. Paul sayes, The momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall waight of glory.</p>
                  <p>But now though this sentence doe not confirme any Popish error, yet it doth excellently comfort any distressed and afflicted. For it exhorteth vs to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5306:234"/>
patient in all afflictions, and that for foure reasons. The two first drawn from the nature of our affliction, the two last from the nature of that glorie which shal be the reward of our affliction. The first is, because our affliction is momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie: the second because our affliction is light: the third, because our glorie shall be eternall, yea surpassing eternal: the fourth, because our glorie shall bee weightie, exceeding waightie. And therefore hee saith, The momentarie lightnesse of our affliction, worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.</p>
                  <p>I need not here make any Apologie for my selfe, not yet render any reason, why I discourse of pouertie, before the rich; of affliction, before those that are euery way flourishing.<note place="margin">Mv L.

Certainely though ye haue not beene afflicted heretofore, neither are at this time, yet beeing men, yet may be hereafter. Wherefore it is not amisse, that we all learne the doctrine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5306:235"/>
of patience in tribulation. Partly that we may be more thankefull to God, if hitherto we haue not beene afflicted and plagued like other men: Partly that if any time of affliction happen hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as any greife, any losse, any sicknes, or such like, we may be prepared afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and as it were armed with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to endure it.

                  <p>First, our affliction is momentary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which is of small co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance. Now our whole life is very short. What is our life,<note place="margin">Iam 4.14.</note> saith S. Iames? It is a vapour which for a time appeareth, but anon after vanisheth away. Therefore saith the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psal. 56.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> O Lord, thou knowest my life, as it is in the Septuagint: but as it is in the Hebrewe, Thou knowest my flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And therefore seeing our whole life is but a vapour, or a flitting, certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our afflictions which are all compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed within the compasse of this life, must needes be much more momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. All affliction, as the Apostle writeth,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.11.</note>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:5306:235"/>
for the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t seemeth not to be ioyous but greiuous; but afterward it bringeth forth the quiet fruits of righteousnesse to them that are exercised thereby. He saith not that affliction is, but that it seemeth to be. So that affliction see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be one thing, and is indeede an other. It seemeth to be greiuous, it is indeed ioyous: it seemeth to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, it is indeede comfortable: it seemeth to be long and tedious, it is indeede momentary and short. Euen as God himselfe determineth this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for a moment,<note place="margin">Esa 54 8.</note> saith he, in mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for a little season haue I hid my face from you; but in euerlasting mercy will I turne vnto you againe. That we should not doubt of this doctrine, he redoubles the promise, for a moment, for little season.<note place="margin">Psal. 30.6.</note> Therefore the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet say's plainly. Heauines may endure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning. As the two Angels then that came to Lot log'd with him for a night,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.2.</note> and when they had dispatch't their errand, went away in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: so afflictions, which are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or the messengers of God. God
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5306:236"/>
sendeth afflictions to doe an errand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, to tell vs, we forget God, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our selues, wee are too proud, too selfe conceited, and such like: and when they haue said as they were bod, then presently they are gone. Whereupon we read, that the spirit of life returned into the two witnesses which had beene slaine by the beast,<note place="margin">Reu 11.11.</note> after three dayes and an halfe. Why after three dayes and an halfe? To teach vs, that affliction and persecution may perhaps tyranize ouer vs three dayes and an halfe, but they shall not fill vp the whole sowre dayes.<note place="margin">Matth. 24.22.</note> For the elects sake those dayes shall be shortened. Agreeable to that which Iohn Baptist begunne his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with, Repent; for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.<note place="margin">Matth. 3.2.</note> Repent, that's a matter of mortification and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>2.</note> So our Sauiour, Behold I come quickly, and my reward with mee: if Christ will come quickly, then afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be gone quickly. Thus momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie is our affliction: For our whole life is short, much more then the afflictions
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5306:236"/>
of this life: affliction is greiuous but for the present: heauines endureth but for a night: persecution lasteth but three dayes and an halfe: the kingdome of heauen is at hand, therefore deliuerance is at hand: Christ will o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the quickly, therefore affliction will be gone quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wherefore seeing our affliction is so momentarie, let vs be patient in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For the momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our affliction is light. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God setting forth his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, saith, Who hath measured the heauens with his span,<note place="margin">Esa. 40.12.</note> and the waters with his fist? By the heauens are meant the diuine blessings of God; by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, afflictions &amp; woes. Those he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth with his span, which is a longer measure: these with his fist, which is a shorter measure. So that the Lord is as I may say a rhetoritian, verie plentifull and copious in his blessings; he measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them with his spanne: But he is a logitian, more short and sparing in his afflictions,<note place="margin">Psal. 75.9.</note> these he measureth with his fist. For in the hand of the Lord there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5306:237"/>
is a cuppe, the wine is redde, and full mixt, he powreth out of the same: as for the dregges thereof, the wicked of the earth doe drinke them vp. First, we drinke not this cup onely full of redde wine, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of the wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, but mixt with diners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts otherwise. Then besides we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with the dregges. Vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly he shal raigne snares, fire, &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, storme, and tempest, this shall be their portion to drinke. We drinke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little of the vppermost. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith, God powreth out of the same. That after we haue suffered a <hi>

And looke how Abraham laid nothing but wood vpon his sonne Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac, carrying the knife and the fire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: after the same sort dealeth our heauenly father with vs. He laieth vpon vs wood without a knife. The Phisitian saith, that is the best exercise which is <hi>ad ruborem, non ad sudor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m,</hi> refreshing the spirits and stirring vp the blood a little, but not putting a man into any great sweat. But the Diuine may say, that is the best affliction, which is <hi>ad su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorem, non ad sanguinem.</hi> Therefore God laieth vpon vs wood <hi>ad sudore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to make vs sweat,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> In the sweat of thy browes shalt thou eat thy bread; not a knife <hi>ad sanguinem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.4.</note> to make vs bleed, Ye haue not yet resisted vnto blood. God laieth vpon vs wood without fire. Now wood without fire, is not greatly dangerous.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5306:238"/>
Or say he lay vpon vs both wood and fire: yet the voice of the Lord deuideth the flame of fire. For in the flame of fire naturally there is heate and light. But notwithstanding the omnipotent voice of the Lord deuideth these, one from the other. As the cursed in hell shew, and the elect vpon earth. I am tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the flame, saith <hi>Diues.</hi> Theres heat but no light. Contrariwise the three children in the furnace shined as Angels for light, but were so farre from heat, that no one haire of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

When <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> saw a bush burning and not consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he saide, I will goe, and see this great vision. A great vision indeede. There was a flame of fire. Els how was the bush burning? There was light. Els how did Moses see it? There was no heat.<note place="margin">Exod. 3.2.</note> Els how was not the bush consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Yet in euery faithfull one afflicted you may see this great vision. The voice of the Lord in his affliction, as in the flame of fire,<note place="margin">Psal. 97.11.</note> diuideth the heat from the light. So that he is not consumed by the heat, (nay rather his infirmities and carnall concupiscences are consumed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5306:238"/>
thereby) but onely illuminated by the light. According to that, Onely vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giueth vnderstanding. And in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, Light is sprung vp to the righteous, and ioy to them that are true of heart. Thus ye see how tenderly our deare father dealeth with vs, He laieth either no fire at all vpon vs, or else no burning fire for heat, but onely a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing fire for light. To make short. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands (as we say) make light worke. Now wee haue many comparteners and fellowes which make the labour of our affliction light. First, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures sigh and grone with vs;<note place="margin">Rom 8.22.</note> Then, all the faithfull beare one an others burthens,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> and so fulfill the lawe of God. Thirdly, the good Angels haue a charge giuen them of vs,<note place="margin">Psal. 91.11.</note> that we hurt not our foot at any time against a stone. Next,<note place="margin">Psal. 55.23.</note> God the father biddeth vs cast our burthen vpon him, and promiseth to nourish vs. Fiftly, the holy Ghost helpeth our infirmities,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.19.</note> and helpeth them euen when we are readie to be oppressed by them. Lastly, God the sonne setteth to his hand likewise, and saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.10.</note> Come vnto me all ye that labour
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5306:239"/>
and are heauie loaden, and I will refresh you: take my yoake vpon you; for my yoake is easie, and my burthen is light. As if he should haue said, To drawe in the yoake without me, would be a hard matter; and to beare the burthen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me, would be aboue our strength: but if you come to me, if you drawe and beare with me, I will refresh you; For my yoake is easie, and my burthen is light. Thus light is our affliction. For God measureth to vs the water with his fist, which is the shorter measure: he causeth vs to drink of the cup on other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise but as it is mixt with many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: he maketh vs not swallow vp the lees of it, but onely a little <hi>modicum</hi> of the vppermost: he laieth affliction vpon vs, which is rather a seeing, then a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of euill: he laieth wood vpon vs to exercise vs, but neither a knife to cut vs not yet fire to burne vs. Lastly, we haue many fellowes in our affliction which make it light. All creatures: all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: all the good angels: God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: God the holy Ghost: God the Sonne, who saith, My yoake is easie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my burden is light. Wherefore seeing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5306:239"/>
our affliction is so many waies light, we must be patient in all affliction; For the momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall waight of glorie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our glorie is eternall, yea, surpassing eternal. The glorie we looke for is called a kingdome. Of which the Princely Prophet saith thus;<note place="margin">Psal. 145.13.</note> Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is an euerlasting kingdome, and thy dominion endureth throughout all ages.<note place="margin">Origen in Can 42.</note> Whereupon <hi>Origen</hi> noteth, that as there is a holy, and a holy of holyes; as a saboth, and a saboth of saboths; as a heauen, and a heauen of heauens; as a song, and a song of songs: so there is an age, and an age of ages. And againe, as that which is not onely a holy, but also a holy of holies, is the holiest place of all; as that which is not onely a saboth, but also a saboth of saboths, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest rest of all; as that which is not onely a heauen, but also a heauen of heauens, is the highest heauen of all; as that which is not onely a song, but also a song of songs, is the excellentest song of all: so that which is not onely an age, but also an age of ages, and especially,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5306:240"/>
as the Psalmist speaketh, an age of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is the most infinite eternitie of all. Which seeing it is attributed to the kingdome of Christ, beeing likewise the kingdome of all true Christians, it followeth that our glorie is surpassing eternall. Whereupon <hi>Prosper</hi> noteth, that that which <hi>Virgil</hi> writeth of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Caesar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De promiss &amp; praedict.</note> He hath giuen vs an Empire without ende;<note place="margin">Imperium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> raigned very long, aboue fiftie yeares, yet at length his gouernment as all other earthly kingdomes, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. But of our heauenly King on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the angel Gabriel said most truely, Of his kingdome there shall be no end.<note place="margin">Luk. 1.53.</note> Of his kingdome there shall be no end. Now this glorie is as well called a crowne, as a kingdome. And this crowne,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.14.</note> as S. Peter saith, is vndefiled, which neuer fadeth away. The Greeke words which S. Peter vseth,<note place="margin">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5306:240"/>
though it be neuer so much soyled, yet it can neuer at all bee blemished. And beeing cast into the fire, it is taken out still more bright and cleane. Also <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> writeth, that there is a flower cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amarantus,</hi>

To both which, the stone and the flower, the Apostle, as I am verily perswaded, alludeth in this place. As if hee should haue said, The crowne which yee shall receiue, shall be studded with the stone Amiantus, which cannot be defiled; and it shall be garnished with the flower Amarantus, which alwayes is fresh and neuer fades away: ye shall receiue a crowne vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that neuer fades away. Which as Beda noteth, was in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or rather euery where there is a beginning, euery where an ending; and so no where any beginning or ending. To shew that the patient also shall haue a crowne set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their head <hi>per circuitum,</hi> running round in a circle, and neuer comming
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5306:241"/>
to any end of eternitie. Well, our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is called also a treasure. Three kind of treasures there are: A treasure in hel: a treasure in earth: a treasure in heauen. That in hell is a treasure of torments: that in earth is a treasure of snow: that in heauen is a treasure of eternitie. For the first,<note place="margin">Iam. 51.3.</note> S. Iames sayes; Go to now you rich men, weepe and howle for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series that shall come vpon you; your riches are corrupt, and your garments are moath-eaten: your gold and siluer is cankred, and the rust of them shall bee a witnesse against you, and shall eate your flesh as it were fire: Yee haue heaped vp treasure for the last dayes. Here's a treasure in hell. Which to be a treasure of torments the Apostle proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, saying,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> Thou after thy hardnesse, and heart that cannot repent, treasurest vnto thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath. A treasure of wrath and of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. From which God for the deare blood of his Sonne sake deliuer vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one. The second is a treasure in earth. Of which our Sauiour saith;<note place="margin">Matth. 6.19.</note> Lay not vp treasures for your selues vpon earth, where the moath and canker cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5306:241"/>
and where theeues dig through and steale. And this is a treasure of snowe. For S. Gregorie vpon those words of Iob;<note place="margin">Qui ingreditur in thesauros ninis.</note> Who entreth into the treasures of snowe; she weth that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treasures are treasures of snow. You see little children what paines they take to rake and scrape snowe together to make a snowe-ball: right so, they that scrape together the treasure of this world, haue but a snowe-ball of it; as soone as the sunne shineth, and God breatheth vpon it, and so entreth into it, by and by it comes to nothing. The third, is a treasure in heauen. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which our Sauiour saith,<note place="margin">Mark. 10.20.</note> Lay vp for your selues treasures in heauen, where are bagges that neuer waxe old. Now this is a treasure of eternitie. And therefore the Christians of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, suffered with ioy the spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their goods,<note place="margin">Heb 10.24.</note> knowing that they had in heauen a better, and a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during substance. They contemned all treasures of snow in respect of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For they haue no substance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are simply good, though they bee called goods, but melt away as snowe:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5306:242"/>
this is a better, and a more enduring substance; yea most enduring, a surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing eternall waight of glorie. Thus ye see how eternall our glorie is. It is a kingdome: a crowne: a treasure. And this kingdome is an euerlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: this crowne is an incorruptible crowne: this treasure is an eternall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And therefore seeing our glorie is so surpassing eternall, we must be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in all affliction. For the momentarie lightnesse of our affliction, worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our glorie is waightie, yea exceeding waightie. The glorie to come, by some resemblances is shewed to be eternall, by other to be waightie. First, to this purpose it is compared to wine. Touching which our Sauiour saith,<note place="margin">Mark. 14.15.</note> Hereafter will I not drinke with you of the fruite of the vine, till I drinke it newe with you in my fathers kingdome. Now how waightie this wine shalbe, appeareth in that the spies bringing clusters of grapes out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, carried them vpon a poale on their shoulders.<note place="margin">Numb. 13.24.</note> To shewe, in the celestiall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5306:242"/>
Canaan what waightie glorie there shall be. So when our Lord turned wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into wine, he commanded to fill the vessels to the toppe. These vessels top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of wine,<note place="margin">Ioh 27.</note> doe signifie at the marriage of the Lamb, that the patient shall haue a full reward:<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 8.</note> pressed downe, shaken together, running ouer. So that euerie one of them may say, My cuppe doth ouerflowe.<note place="margin">Psal. 13.</note> Againe our glorie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a peny. Now in a peny we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider fowre things. The image: the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription: the sound: the waight. So our Sauiour when they shewed him a peny, asked whose image and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription it was. First, then for the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, Christ shall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note> that they may be like the glorious bodie of his Sonne: that as wee haue borne the image of the earthly, so we may beare the image of the heauenly. For the superscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our Sauiour saith; To him that ouercommeth will I giue a white stone,<note place="margin">Reuel. 2.17.</note> and in it a name written, which no man knoweth but he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it. As a Prince seeing his name vpon a peice of coine, knoweth it is of his owne mint: so euery patient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5306:243"/>
seeing his owne name in this white stone, which is a token of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, knoweth it properly belongeth to himselfe. For the sound, the Psal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ist saith, Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they shall alwayes praise thee. This shal be the sound of the peny con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, the praise of God. As the foure and twentie Elders, neuer ceased day, nor night,<note place="margin">Reuel. 1.8.</note> to sing, Holy, holy, holy, to him that is, and was, and is to come. Fourthly, for the waight, the shekel of the Sanctuarie was twise as waighty as the common shekel: in like manner our glorie shall be as the shekel of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie, exceeding massie and waightie. But what speake I of wine? What of a peny? God himselfe shall be our glory. According to that;<note place="margin">Psal. 3.3.</note> Thou art my glorie and the lifter vp of my head. As if hee should haue said, Affliction would make me cast downe my countenance, and hold downe my head like a bulrush <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> but the remembrance of this that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> art my glory, makes me lift vp my head. So say's God to Abraham;<note place="margin">Gen. 15.1.</note> Feare not Abraham, I am thy buckler, and thy exceeding great reward. I am thy burk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5306:243"/>
to latch those blowes which afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would lay vpon thee: and thy excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great reward, blessing thee with exceeding waighty glory. For they that shall enioy this glorie, shall see God. Agreeable to that of our Lord;<note place="margin">Matth. 5.8.</note> Blessed are the pure in spirit, for they shall see God. And how shall they see God? Not standing behind the lattisse, or looking out of a window,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.12.</note> that is darkly and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, but face to face, talking with him familiarly as one friend doth to an other. O ioy aboue all ioyes! O glorie that passeth all vnderstanding! when we see the amiable and gracious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our Lord reconciled to vs by Christ. Doubtlesse if the Queene of Saba thought her selfe happie, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wisedome of Salomon, and seeing the riches of his house, and the order of his seruants: then much more shall we be happy, when we shall see the glory, and heare the wisedome of the Father, not as the preachers shewe it out of the word, but as our owne eies shall behold it in heauen. O how blessed shall we thinke our selues then, that by any paines, by any afflictions we haue
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5306:244"/>
at length attained to such waighty glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For this glorie is wine r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; is a pony waighty according to the shekell of the Sanctuarie; is the blessed sight and fruition of God himselfe. Wherefore considering how waightie our glorie is, we must be patient in all affliction. For the momentarie lightnes of our affliction, worketh vs a surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing exceeding eternal waight of glory.</p>
                  <p>Compare then the affliction on the one side, with the glory on the other side: the shortnes of the affliction, with the eternity of the glory, the lightnes of the affliction, with the waightinesse of the glory. And then be content for an eternall glorie to suffer momentarie affliction: for waightie glory to suffer light affliction. The Stoicks if their greife were either momentary or light, cared for no more: for if it were short, they cared not how heauie it were: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if it were light, they cared not how long it were. Our affliction is both momentarie and light. One helpe was sufficient for them: we haue two for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5306:244"/>
hauing fewer meanes then wee haue, should shew greater patience then we shew. But the Scriptures affoard vs yet more forceable inducements. Iacob be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in loue with Rachell, serued for her first seuen yeares, and afterward seauen yeares more, in all fourteene; and these many yeares seemed to him but a fewe dayes. O deere Lord, that we had thy grace to loue thy eternall waightie glorie, but as well as many a man hath done a mortall earthly creature. Then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o doubt many years of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would seeme to vs but a few dayes: heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of affliction would seeme to vs very sweet and light. Christ Iesus for the ioy that was set before him, indured the crosse, and despised the shame, and now sitteth at the right hand of the throne of God. Questionlesse, beloued, the crosse of Christ was tedious and long; the shame that he suffred was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy and vntollerable. Yet this crosse see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but momentarie to him, and this shame seemed but light vnto him, in comparison of the ioy that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and of the eternall waightie glory which he hath now attained sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5306:245"/>
at the right hand of the throne of God. To the which plate of honour and worship, we beseech thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O louing Lord, to bring vs, after all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this wretched world; not for our owne deserts of merits, but for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that crosse which Christ endured, of that shame which Christ despised. To whom for his crosse, be all praise, for his shame, be all glory; together with the Father, and the holy Ghost, now and euermore, Amen.</p>

doe they terribly set vpon vs to get our bodies onely, but our soules also. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, they doe this at the day of death, and will doe more dilligently at the day of iudgement. Now their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions are yet more dangerous then their threatnings. When they come to vs in the shape not of an vnclean spirit, but of an angel of light. Thus Satan did set vpon the first Adam,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> Hath God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed commanded you not to eate of the tree? He makes a question of it.

                  <p>But God hath glorified vs. It is not now to be doubted whether Satan shal preuaile against vs or not, but it is most sure he shall not. He hath glorified vs, saith S. Paul. Though the possession of it be to come, yet the assurance of it is past. Euen as our Lord auoucheth in

                  <p>OVr blessed Sauiour Iesus Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his body for foure causes. First, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue his resurrection: secondly, to appease his Father: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to confound his enemies: fourthly, to comfort his friends.

                  <p>The first cause why Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his body, is to approoue his resurrection. When Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs children told him, saying, Ioseph is yet aliue, his heart failed, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued them not, but as soone as he saw the chariots, which were sent for him, by and by his spirit reuiued, and he said, I haue enough,<note place="margin">Gen. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In like manner, when the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples said to Thomas, we haue seene the Lord, he beleeued them not; but nowe that hee beholdeth Christs glorious wounds, the triumphant tokens of his victorie, and the chariots, as I may say, whereby we are with Elias carried vp into heauen, he confesseth indeede that Christ is risen againe; and that the true Ioseph is yet aliue.<note place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ our King, who did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, could likewise, if it had pleased him, haue quite and cleane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and abolished all the markes of death. Neuerthelesse as at his transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration he shewed Peter, Iames, and Iohn, the signes of immortalitie in his bodie, which was then mortall; so here contrariwise at his resurrection; he sheweth Thomas the signes of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie in his bodie, which is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. That he and all we might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly confesse, that though they perhaps might bee deceiued in King Arthurs bodie, yet we can neuer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, so long as we beleeue, that the very same body of Christ, which in Golgotha the place of dead mens skuls was wounded from top to toe, and put to death for vs, is now risen again from death to life.

Christs case was euen almost the same. Hee was thought by some to be quite dead and gone. But Thomas seeing those very hands of his which were nailed to the crosse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that this our brother was dead, and is aliue againe, was lost, and is found.<note place="margin">Ios. 2.18.</note> For if the spies that were sent to view Iericho, knewe Rahabs house from all the rest, by a red thread, which hung out of the windowe: how much more easily then might Thomas knowe Christ, especially seeing Rahabs house was a figure of Christs bodie; the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe a signe of the wound in his side; the red thread a figure of the streame of blood issuing out of that wound? When Vlysses had beene long from home, no man almost at his returne knewe him, yet Euriclea his nurse espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by chance the marke of a wound in

his foote, which he got by hunting the wild boare,<note place="margin">Hom. Ody. 9.</note> by and by made him known to his friends. In like manner Thomas, beholding the wounds not of Christs feete onely, but also of his whole body, beleeueth verily, though the wilde boare out of the wood stroke fore at him that he might fall, yet that he hath nowe recouered himselfe, and is risen and returned home againe. Euen as the wisemen knewe Christ was borne, by the starre which appeared in the East,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.9.</note> and knewe also where he lay when he was borne, by the standing of that star directly ouer against him: so Thomas, not by one starre, but by many starres, which notwithstanding are more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and bright then all the starres of heauen, knoweth and confesseth that the true sunne of righteousnesse is now risen, and shineth ouer all the earth. Thus these blessed wounds witnesse and approoue the resurrection of Christ.

Hee sawe a doore open in heauen, to teach vs that we can haue no accesse vnto the Father, but by Christ, neither yet by Christ simply, but as he is crucified, and hath set open a doore in his side for vs to enter by him. He sawe a rainebowe round about the throne of God, to teach vs that the throne of God would be altogether a throne of iustice, a throne of wrath, a throne of anger and indignation, were it not that the blood of Christ, spinning out as I may say still liuely and freshly in the sight of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, maketh a rainbowe round about his throne, putteth him in minde of his couenant, appeaseth his displeasure, and so maketh his throne to all vs that loue him,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.37.</note> a throne of grace, a throne of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, a throne of fauour and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

in Christ. We read that Iacob pilled certaine rods, which beeing laid in the watering troughes before the sheepe, made them bring forth such lambes, as afterward fell to his own share. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if we sinne, wee haue an aduocate with the father Iesus Christ the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he is the propitiation for our sinnes. The marke of the roddes in his wounds laid open in the sight of God, ingendreth and breedeth in him a loue and a liking toward vs, so that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth well of vs, and seuereth vs as good sheepe from the goates, and in the blood of the lambe is pleased and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and satisfied for our sinnes. This blood is the blood of sprinkling,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note> which speaketh better things then that of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. For Abels blood vpon earth cryed out once for vengeance, but Christs blood in heauen cries continually for mercie. One deepe calleth another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the noise of the water pipes.

wounds of Christ make a continuall noise in the eares of his father, and the depth of the extreame misery which he was in vpon earth, calleth for the depth of Gods bottomlesse and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy in heauen. Thus these holy wounds of Christ pacifie and appease his father. For now Moyses standing in the gappe sues for pardon: the poore creeple lying at the beautifull gate, begg's an almes: Ezechias spreading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his letters, makes his supplication: Salomon stretching out his hands, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers vp his prayer: Epaminondas being wounded, mooues Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As if our Sauiour should say thus vnto his Father, O my louing father,

looke vpon the face of thine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, looke vpon the hands, looke vpon the side of thine annointed. The hands of thine anointed, how cruelly they are mangled, the side of thine annointed, bow wofully it is wounded. Behold, and see, if there be any sorrowe like to my sorrow. These hands can signifie what exceeding sorrow I haue suffered: this side can shew that I haue humbled my selfe, and haue been obedient vnto death, euen vnto the death of the crosse. Therefore, O my deare father, Put thy finger here, and see my hands; and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and as thou art not faithlesse, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, so be not mercilesse, but mercifull for my sake, and pitifull to thy people. So much for the second cause, which is to appease his Father.</p>
                  <p>The third cause, why Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his bodie, is to confound his enemies.

When like as Ioseph said to his brethren, I am Ioseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt: so Christ shall say vnto them, I am Iesus of Nazareth, whom you persecuted and put to death?

confound his enemies. As Saul was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished, when he heard Iesus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth calling to him: as Herod was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted when he thought Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist was risen againe: as the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans were troubled, when they sawe Sciplo's sepulchre: as the Saxons were terrified, when they saw Cadwallo's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: as the Philistims were afraid whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they saw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So shall Christs enemies be confounded, when they shall see his hands and his side. As if our Sauiour should say thus to euery one of his enemies, Thou ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of all righteousnesse, Many things many times hast thou done against me, and hitherto haue I held my tongue; but now will I reprooue thee, and in before thee the things that thou hast done.

Therefore thine owne eyes shall giue euidence, and thine owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall giue sentence against thee. See now whether I say true or no. Look what thou hast done. Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and as thou art not faithfull, but faithlesse, so looke for no mercie at my hands, but for shame and euerlasting confusion. So much for the third cause, which is to confound his enemies.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cause, why Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his body, is to comfort his friends. Almighty God in the old law appointed cities of refuge, whether they which had sinned vnwillingly might flie and be safe,<note place="margin">Num. 35.23.</note> if they staied in any of them till the death of the high Priest. Our high Priest can yet plainly prooue by his hands &amp; side, that once he died for vs. Whether then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5306:268"/>
should we flie, sinnefull soules; whether should we flie for succour and comfort but to Christ? His wounds only are the cities of refuge, wherein we are safe and secure, according to that of the Psalmist, The high hills are a refuge for the wilde goates, and so are the stony rocks for the conies. O blessed be these high hills, blessed be these stony rocks, which protect &amp; defend vs, yea though we haue willingly sinned, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the furie of man, and the rage of the world, but also against the terrible and dreadfull displeasure of Almighty God. Therefore our Sauiour speakes to his Spouse in this sort,<note place="margin">Can. 2.14.</note> My doue thou art in the holes of the rocke, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place of the staires, shew me thy sight, let me heare thy voice.

The rocke, is Christ. The staires also and the ladder, whereby Iacob climb's vp to heauen is Christ. So that the doue, which is the Church, lying hid in the holes of this rocke, and in the secret places of these

The coale is so hot, that if it be rackt vp in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of the same, it continueth vnextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the space of a whole years. Therefore whereas we read in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twentieth Psalme, With hot burning coales; it is in the Hebrew, as S. Hierom noteth, with Iuniper coales. Which prooueth that Iuniper coales be the most hot burning coales that are. Now the coale is not so hot, but the shadowe is as coole. Insomuch as the only shadow of the Iuniper tree, slaieth

Therefore Elias seeking to rest himselfe where he might be safest from serpents, and other daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerr, sat downe vnder a iuniper tree, and desired that hee might die: For hee thought he could neuer with the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row finde him a house, and with the swallow make him a nest in a better place, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where he was ouershadowed with that Iuniper tree, which shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the tree of the Crosse of Christ. Of which the Church sai's, Vnder his shadowe had I delight, and sat downe, and his fruite was sweete vnto my mouth. So that if Simeon holding the child in his armes, desired to die, how much more blessedly then might Elias haue departed now in peace, when as beeing wearied with the world, he was shadowed with the tree of life; and not onely held the child in his armes, but also was held himselfe as a child in the wounded and naked armes of Christ.

And we that with eagles wings flie vp by faith into heauen, shall euer resort to this dead bodie, and we shal vnsatiably desire to feede our eyes, and our soules with the sight of Christ, who was once dead, and euen now hath in his bodie those skarres which continue the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of his death, that in all eternitie it may neuer be forgotten. Thus these heauenly wounds of Christ delight and comfort his friends. As the cities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, which saue the sinner: as the holes of the rock, which defend the doue; as the shadow of the iuniper tree, which reuiueth the wearied; as the doore of the Arke, which preserueth the world: as the lure of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So doe the hands and side of Christ comfort his friends. As if our Sauiour should say thus to euery one of his friends, Can a mother forget her

child, and not haue compassion on the son of her wombe? though they should forget, yet would not I forget thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I haue grauen thee vpon the palmes of my hands. Here I haue still in my hands that price of thy redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I paid for thee, so that no man can take thee out of my hands. Yea I haue written and sealed thy saluation in my side. A speare is the penne: my blood is the inke: my body is the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Assure thy selfe therfore, assure thy selfe of my loue, of my good will, of my fauour for euer. Make no doubt of it. If thou doubt any thing, Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. So much for the fourth cause, which is to comfort his friends.</p>
                  <p>You see then, blessed Christians, you see how these causes of Christs wounds differ one from an other. The first cause, to approoue his resurrection, was, but neither is, nor shall bee. The second cause, to appease his Father was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5306:274"/>
and is, but shall not be. The third cause, to confound his enemies, neither was, nor is, but shall be. The fourth cause, to comfort his friends, both was, and is, and shall be. So that Christs wounds, did serue, to approoue his resurrection, onely between his resurrection, and his ascension: doe serue to appease his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onely between his ascension, and his second comming: shall serue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found his enemies, onely at the day of iudgement: did, doe, and shall serue, to comfort his friends, for euer. Wherfore though wee be neuer so great sinners, yet let vs neuer despaire of the grace and mercie of Christ. His hands are still stretched out to embrace vs, his side is alwaies open to receiue vs. Therefore let vs creepe low, and come humbly to him, that wee may with the woman in the Gospel, touch but the hemme of his garment; nay that we may with S.

For wee knowe that not euery one that saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.21.</note> Lord, Lord, shall be saued. Neither yet euery one that saith, The Temple of the Lord,<note place="margin">

Therefore as that figtree was accursed, which did beare leaues and no fruit:<note place="margin">Mark. 21.14.</note> so shall euery man be accursed which beareth leaues without fruit.

It is strange that a man should steale with his tongue: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as it is strange also, that a man should speake with his hand. Yet as I noted before, that these speak false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction with their hand: so now I note that these steale true construction with their tongue. They steale their words, I say, howsoeuer otherwise they be most true, who as Austin writeth, would seeme to be righteous in that they teach the words of God,<note place="margin">Qui boni vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt videri lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo quae dei sunt, cum mali sint, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo quae sua sunt.

Wherefore we that are a holy people, must not teach the words of God, and doe the workes of the deuil; we must not teach one thing, and doe an other. For not hee that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth, but Hee that both doth and teacheth, the same shall be called

                  <p>The second part affirmatiue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, what must be.

But the godly Pastor must haue not onely wings of high wisedome and knowledge, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hands vnder his wings to doe that which he knoweth.<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> For as the Prophet Malachie witnesseth, The Priests lips should keepe knowledge.

But hauing deliuered it to others, they must as well as others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and doe it themselues. And then indeede may their lips rightly be said to keepe knowledge. For euen as they which repaired the walls of Ierusalem,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5306:283"/>
held a sword in one hand, and wrought with the other:<note place="margin">Neh. 4.17.</note> so Preachers which by winning soules repaire and build vp the walls of the heauenly Ierusalem, must not onely hold the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God in one hand, but also they must labour with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand. Else they shall pull downe and destroy rather then build vp. But if they doe as fast as they say, then they shall build apace, and edifie very much. Therefore Saint Paul exhorteth Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie to shew himselfe a workeman, which needeth not to be ashamed,<note place="margin">2.

And the same Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the same Timothy againe, to shew the true patterne of wholesome words.<note place="margin">2.

And thus must euery faithfull preacher doe. He must haue not only a brest-plate, but also an Ephod; he must haue written in this brest-plate, not onely Vrim, but also Thummim: he must be like the snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the tabernacle, not only purging others, but also made of pure gold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: hee must haue for his share of the sacrifices not onely the shake-brest, but also the right shoulder: he must be as Elias was, not onely the horseman, but also the chariot of Israel: hee must haue vpon the fringes of his vesture, not onely bells, but also pomgranats: hee must be like the pillers of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, not only ouerlai'd outwardly with gold, but also inwardly made of Shittim woode: hee must not onely lift vp his voice, but also lift it vp as a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: he must not onely haue wings, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must, not onely as a Cypres tree reach vp to the clouds, by a high gift in teaching, but also hee must as an oliue tree bring forth the oyle of mercy, and be euery way fruitfull in doing.

Noah is appointed to make a windowe in the toppe of the Arke,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.16.</note> and a doore in the side of it; A windowe is for the eye onely to looke out; a doore is for the whole bodie to goe out. And in like manner a godly man, must not haue a windowe for contemplation as Daniel had, who said his praiers thrice a day looking out of his chamber windowe; but also he must haue a doore for action as Abraham had, who entertained his guests about the heat of the day fitting

At the windowe of contemplation he must meditate and looke to his teaching; at the dore of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hee must goe forth to his doing.<note place="margin">Leuit 11.4.</note> Threfore by the olde lawe all those beasts are accounted vnclean that chew the cud, but diuide not the hoofe; which lawe was not made for beasts, but for men.

When Gedion went to warre against the Madianites,<note place="margin">Iud. 7.6.</note> he sent home againe those souldiers which kneeled down to lappe water, and tooke those only with him, which lapt out of their hands. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause indeede they are not fit to be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in Christs campe, which haue mouthes to say somewhat, but no hands to do any thing. For if they haue no hands to helpe themselues, much lesse to hurt their enemies. And looke how these Souldiers did put their hands to their mouth; in like sort the wise woman putteth her fingers to the distaffe. Now there is a great resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

betweene the distaffe and the tongue. For as a thread either longer or shorter is spun off from the distaffe; so from the tongue a speach. Therefore he may be said to put his fingers to the distaffe,<note place="margin">Prou. 31.19.</note> which puts his doing to his teaching, and doeth that which hee teacheth. Our Sauiour speaking to his Spouse, saies thus, Let me see thy sight, let me heare thy voice.

                     </gap>iades a heathen man could say thus much, Better done then said. A good thing if thou knowe it, doe it. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Iulius Caesar, that he neuer said to his souldiers, <hi>Ite,</hi> but <hi>Venite:</hi> he neuer said, Goe ye yonder, but Come ye hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will goe with you; nay, I will go before you. And so saves our heauenly Captaine and conquerour Iesus Christ, not <hi>Ite,</hi> but <hi>Venite,</hi> Come vnto me all ye that labour, and learne of me, because I am meeke and humble in heart. Hee saies not, because I talke of my humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but because I am humble, because I shewe the practise of it continually in my selfe. I (saies he) came downe from heauen to earth, I left my Fathers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and tooke a traytors kisse, to teach all men true humilitie. Therefore there is no teacher to me, there is no
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:5306:288"/>
master to me: Learne of me, because I am meeke and humble in heart. This kind of instruction both by teaching, and by doing, is that two-edged sword which proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lambe. For tell me I pray you (if it be no trouble to you) tell me, what is the reason thinke you, why so many Preachers in their Churches, so many masters in their families, seeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse abuses, striue against sinnes, and yet preuaile so little, but onely because they fight not with this two-edged sword, but with a backsword: the sword which they fight withall is very sharpe, and cuts deepe on the teaching-side, but it is blunt and hath no edge at all on the doing side. Whereas if we would fight against vngodlines with this two-edged sword, both by teaching and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we should soone cut downe sinne in such sort, as it should neuer bee able to stand out against vs. Therefore Dauid beeing readie to reforme many things, among his people, saies in one of the Psalmes,<note place="margin">Bonitatem &amp; scientiam doce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me.</note> O Lord giue me goodnesse, &amp; knowledge. Goodnes, that I may do well, and Knowledge, that I may teach
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:5306:288"/>
well. For I am sure (saies he) that all my teaching without doing, all my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without goodnes, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Therfore, O Lord, giue me good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and knowledge. But first goodnes, and then knowledge. Because indeede, one heartfull of goodnesse, is worth an hundred headfulls of knowledge: one handfull of doing, is worth an hundred tongue-fuls of teaching. For what is the hand els, but the very seale of the tongue? So that as a writing is not pleadable by the law of man without seales, no more is a word warrantable by the law of God, without works. And therefore if they which serue the beast, receiue the marke of the beast, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their foreheads, but also in their hands: how much more then ought we which serue the liuing God, to receiue the marke of God, not onely in our foreheads by open professing of him, but also in our hands by faithful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that which we professe. Therefore it is an vsuall phrase well-nigh in all the Prophets to say, The word of the Lord by the hand of Amos, by the hand of Zacharie, or such like; I know indeede

it is an Hebrewe phrase, where the hand of the Prophet signifieth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the Prophet. But yet this phrase may giue vs thus much to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that if the Prophets deale so, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery word of God passed not only tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their mouthes, but also through their hands, that when we also must so deale in hearing and handling the word of God, as we may bring vnto God, sayes Agapetus, not onely a profering of words, but also an offering of works. Wherefore deare brethren, let your light so shine before men, that they not onely hearing your good words, but also seeing your good works, may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie your Father which is in heauen. For then I assure you, if we glorifie our Father which is in heauen, he will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie vs his children which are vpon earth, and in the ende make vs great in the kingdome of heauen. O remember therefore that golden saying in the Scripture,<note place="margin">Psal. 111.16.</note> The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome, a good vnderstanding haue all they that doe thereafter, the praise of it endureth for euer. A good vnderstanding haue
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:5306:289"/>
all they that doe thereafter? Why so? Because an ill vnderstanding haue all they that doe not thereafter. They that haue vnderstanding, and doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that is, according to it, haue an ill vnderstanding. But they that haue vnderstanding, and doe thereafter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, haue a good vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. A good vnderstanding haue all they that doe thereafter: the praise of it endureth for euer. It shall be eternally rewarded. O how richly are the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles rewarded, how highly are they nowe honoured in heauen, because when they were vpon earth, they had a good vnderstanding. They had clouen tongues.<note place="margin">Act. 2.3.</note> Clouen tongues? What's that? I'le tell you. Doe you not see how our hands are clouen and diuided into fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; So were the Apostles tongues. They (in a manner, if I may so say) had fingers vpon their tongues, as well as we haue vpon our hands. It was but a word and a worke with them. They had no sooner taught others any good thing (as O Lord what good thing did they not teach vs all) but by and by they were readie to practise it, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:5306:290"/>
it themselues. Therefore they are alreadie great in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yea, and much more shall be. The twelue Apostles shall sit vpon twelue thrones, iudging the twelue tribes of Israel. And if we can happily obtaine so much grace and goodnesse of God, as that we may haue a care and a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as well to doe as to teach, then as sure as God's in heauen, wee likewise shall be great in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. We shall be installed with Christ and his Apostles, in the throne of glory, when we shall heare him say vnto vs, Come yee blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdome of heauen prepared for you. For ye haue not onely professed, but practised: ye haue not onely taught well, but wrought well: yee haue not onely said well, but done well, therfore now you shall be great in the kingdom of heauen. To the which kingdome of heauen, we beseech thee, O Lord, to bring vs, euen for Iesus Christs sake. Amen.</p>

to Dauids petition; For thy seruant Dauids sake turne not away the face of thine annointed: Gods answer is this; There shall I make the horne of Dauid flourish, I, I haue ordained a light for mine annointed. As for his enemies, I shall cloath them with shame: but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish. As if he should haue said; Turne away the face of mine annointed? Nay, that will I neuer doe, I will indeede turne away the face of the enemies of mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. Their face shall be couered with confusion, and cloathed with shame: But contrariwise, I haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a light for mine annointed. He euer shall haue a light in his face, and a crowne vpon his head. As for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I shall cloth them with shame: but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
                  <p>These words are principally to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Christ. For neuer were any so clothed with shame as his enemies the cursed Iewes which murthered him. There citie was sacked, not one stone of it beeing left vpon another, and they themselues as stubble or chaffe were
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:5306:292"/>
scattered ouer the face of the earth. So that they are the very shame of men, and the out-cast of all people. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as when we would signifie we hate a man deadly, indeede we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vse to say, we hate them worse then a Iewe. On the other side, Christ is so exalted now, that all power is giuen him in heauen and earth, yea God hath giuen him a name aboue all names, that at the most sweete and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> euerie knee and euery heart also might doe obeys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce. And as the Apostle prooueth out of the eight Psalme, the Lord now after all his dolorous paines and torments, hath crowned him with honour and glorie. Neuerthelesse in a secondarie sort, this promise may be applied also to Dauid, who was a notable type of Christ; and so consequently to euery faithfull successor of Dauid, which is Christs vicegerent and lieftenant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. For yee know what was the the ende of all Dauids enemies: Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solon his disobedient sonne hung vp by the goldy lockes of pride. Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel his trayterous Counsellor made
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:5306:292"/>
away himselfe. Shemei, a reuiler of him, and a derractor from him, in his gray haires put to shamefull death. The same may be said of the rest. But holy Dauid himselfe could neuer be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. For though many enemies, specially Antiochus Epiphanes, bent all their force, to the very vttermost, to roote out Dauids posteritie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Gods people; yet maugre their heads and their hearts, Dauids crowne yet flourished and continued in his stocke, till at the length the sonne of Dauid came into the world; of whom the Angel Gabriel spake to the blessed virgin Marie in this sort; <note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 1.32.</note> He shall be great, and shall be called the sonne of the most High; and the Lord God shall giue him the throne of his Father Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, and he shall be ruler ouer the house of Iacob, and of his kingdome shall be no ende. Now if this Scripture be so notably verified in Dauid, bee hauing faithfully serued in his time, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now by the will of God dead: no reason but that we may vnderstand it also generally of euery holy one of God, which treadeth in Dauids steps,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:5306:293"/>
going in and out before Gods people. As for his enemies, I shall cloath them with shame; but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish.</p>
                  <p>Here are two parts. His enemies; himselfe. His enemies, first shall haue shame; secondly shall be cloathed with shame. Himselfe, first shal haue a crown: secondly shal haue a flourishing crown. As for his enemies I shall cloath them with shame; but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish.</p>
                  <p>The shame which the Lord God as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth Dauid shall light vpon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is a very droadfull iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Nicetas saies plainely; No punishment so greiuous as shame. And Nazianzene yet more expressely; Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were a man die right out, then still liue in repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch and shame. This, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse valiant worthies haue shewed to be true, ridding themselues volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily of their life, that so they might be rid of their shame. Aiax beeing readie to dispatch himselfe, vsed these as his last words; No greife doth so cut the very heart of a generous and magnanimous man, as shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:5306:293"/>
What should I speake of any more Grecians, or Romanes, as of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Cassius, Antonius, Cato Vricensis, and such others? In Scripture we haue a plaine proofe. Mighty Sampson, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to pull the whole house vpon his owne head,<note place="margin">Iudg. 16.18.</note> saide thus: O Lord God I pray thee strengthen me at this time onely, that I may be at once auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the Philistims, for my two eies. Hee desired rather once to die vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, then long to liue wretchedly. For as Saint Ambrose writing of Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, saith, <note n="h" place="margin">Viuere &amp; mori naturae functic: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>udibrio esse probro ducitur. Epist. yo.</note> For a man to liue, or die, is naturall: but for a man to liue in shame and contempt, and to be made a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stocke of his Enemies, is such a matter, as no well bred and noble min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man that hath any courage, or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke in him, can euer digest it. Yet the Lord God promiseth Dauid his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, that shame shall be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all his enemies; shame I say which is a great deale worse then death it selfe. As for his enemies, saies he, I shall cloath them with shame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they shall be clothed with shame. To be cloathed is an Hebrewe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:5306:294"/>
phrase, signifying to haue any thing vnseparably cast vpon one. And it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both in the better and in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser part. As a little before; I cloath her Priests with saluation: that is, I will furnish Syons Priests with such indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and graces from aboue, which they shall be as it were inuested into; that both by their life and doctrine, they shal still further the saluation both of themselues; and of them which heare them. Contrariwise, in this place I will cloath them with shame; That is, shame shall so vnseparably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them, that as wheresoeuer a man goeth, he carrieth his cloathes with him; so wheresoeuer they goe, they shall carrie their shame with them. And that which is strangest of all; they which are ashamed, vse to cloath or couer their shame, and then thinke themselues well enough. But Dauids e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies shall be so shamed, that euen the verie couering of their shame, shall be a discouering of it; and the cloathing or cloaking of their ignominie, shall be nothing else but a girding of it more closely and more vnseparably vnto
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5306:294"/>
them. So the Prophet speaketh else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 35.26.</note> Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that reioyce at mine hurt. Let them be cloathed with rebuke and dishonour, that lift vp themselues against me. O Lord God, say Amen to it; let it be euen so, O Lord, Let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour that lift vp themselues against thine annointed. And againe, <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 109.19.</note> Let shame be vnto him as a cloake that he hath vpon him, and as the girdle that he is alwaies girdled withall. And yet againe, <note n="l" place="margin">vers. 19.</note> Let mine aduersaries be cloathed with shame, and let them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themselues with their owne confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as with a cloake.</p>
                  <p>But to leaue the word, and come to the matter. The enemies of Dauid shall be clothed with shame three waies: In their owne conscience; In the world; In the day of iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Touching their owne conscience, S. Austin saies well, <note n="m" place="margin">Omnis in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatus affectus est sibimetipfi poena.</note> All vnordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, as none are more vnordinate then trayterous and rebellious enterprises, carrie in themselues that bane which poysons and punishes them at the last.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5306:295"/>
Whereupon the Prophet saies, <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 57.2.</note> Hide me, O Lord, vnder the shadow of thy wings, vntill iniquitie be ouerpast, as the Septuagint translate it. But wee read it, Vntill this tyrannie be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past. And others transla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e it, Vntill this Calamitie, or this Miserie be ouerpast. Which indifferent acceptation of the Hebrew word, sheweth that nothing doth so tyrannize ouer the conscience, nothing is such a calamitie and misery to the minde, as iniquity and sinne. Iudas after he had betraied his Lord and Master, was so confounded in his owne conscience, that he cryed out and said, <note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 27.4.</note> I haue sinned, in betraying inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood. <hi>Proditer Casca,</hi> vile tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: if his blood be innocent, then thy conscience is guilty. And if thou canst confesse thou hast sinned, when it is too late, why diddest thou not take heede of sinning when t'was time? I haue sinned saies he, sinned in betraying innocent blood. A thousand hells could not haue more tormented him, then this desperate sorrowe, and extreame shame wherewith his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was cloathed, tearing his bowels
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5306:295"/>
whilst he was aliue, and powring them out when he died.</p>
                  <p>Now as for shame in the world, we reade <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 4.5.</note> that God did set a marke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cain the murtherer of the iust Habel; and so consequently the ring-leader of all Dauids enemies. Therefore as when men see a wolfe or a foxe, or any such h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtfull beast in the forest, they set all their dogs vpon him; so the enemies of the Lords annointed, beeing burnt as it were and branded with the markes of shame, are howted and hunted where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they goe. One example at this time shall suffice. Maxentius a wicked rebell against his own Lord the famous Emperour Constantine the great, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue a bridge made with cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tes chained together ouer a riuer neere Rome, thinking to traine the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that way, and there to drowne them in the riuer. But God so wrought for his chosen seruant, that the enemie himselfe beeing compelled to flie that way, was taken in that pit which he dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for others. And so as Pharaoh was cloathed with shame in the open viewe and fight of all the world, when he and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:5306:296"/>
all his host were drowned in the redde sea, after the same fashion Maxentius was drest,</p>
                  <p>Lastly, touching shame in the day of iudgement, Dauids enemies at that day shall stand before the tribunall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ate of Christ, beeing naked in all respec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>else, but onely couered with their owne shame. Then they shall be vexed with horrible feare<note n="r" place="margin">Sapien. 5.2.</note>, and cloathed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion; whereas the righteous shall bee cloathed with incorruption;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 15.</note> yea though in this life with the rich glutton, <note n="s" place="margin">Luk. 16.19.</note> they haue beene cloathed with purple, and fine linnen, yet then their attire shall be dishonour, and their garment shall bee shame. Thus will the Lord cloath the enemies of his anointed with shame; cloath them in their owne conscience; cloath them in the world, cloath them in the day of iudgement. As for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies I shall cloath them with shame; But vpon himselfe shal his crowne flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
                  <p>The one halfe of this Sermon is now past, the other shall be as soon dispacht. But vpon him shal his crowne flourish.</p>

Hereupon Iupiters Priest <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 14.13.</note> brought buls and crownes to the gates of Listra, and would there haue sacrificed to Paul. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when Gods people the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites would needs haue a King, as other nations had round about them; then their Kings would needs haue crownes also, as other Kings had round about them.

For neither doth Christ himselfe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen weare such a crown as Kings of the earth doe. But the truth is this, that royaltie and maiestie, which is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to God, hee is content to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to his holy ones, and to his anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by participation and grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords anointed, which is as it were his fauourite, may very well do all these three things at once; weare the crowne which God giueth; and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the pride which God abhorreth; and still admire the Maiestie which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth: So that the Lord promising his seruant Dauid a crowne, promiseth him wealth, wisedome, renowne, dignitie, prosperitie; in one word, all royalties belonging to a crowne. But vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shall his crowne flourish.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he shall haue a flourishing crowne. Flourishing is metaphorically attributed to a crowne. As in the next verse before. There shall I make the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:5306:298"/>
horne of Dauid to flourish. A meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from those goodly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as stagges, and such like; whose cheifest beauty and strength consisteth in their hornes, especially when they budde and branch abroad. So in these words, But vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish. A plaine allusion to those flowres which either continually, or else a very long time, keepe fresh and greene. Besids at the first, kings crowns were not made of gold and pearles, as I told you of Dauids crowne, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of greene oken leaues, as that of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters, or else of some other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or flowres, as others. The Lord then meaning that Dauids kingdome should be established for euer, and that his lasting glorie should still growe greene, he maketh this louing promise vnto him; But vpon himselfe shall his crown flourish. How flourishing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull flowers are, consider but the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and you shall soone perceiue. Marke (saies our Sauiour) <note n="z" place="margin">Matth. 5.24.</note> how the lillies of the field doe growe, they labour not, neither doe they spinne, yee doe I say vnto you, that euen Salomon in all his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5306:298"/>
royaltie was not cloathed like one of these. Now if God so cloath the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the field, which growe to day, and to morrow are cast into the ouen, how much more shall he cloath Dauids enemies with shame: but vpon himselfe make his crowne flourish? For euen as in Salomons Temple, fiue candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks at the right side, and fiue at the left standing before the Oracle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for matter of pure gold, for forme with branches and flowers, did well nigh dazil the eyes of any that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Temple <note n="a" place="margin">1 Reg. 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>9.</note>; so the Lord here giues his word, that the Kings crowne shall euer flourish in the house of our God, disparkling and display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those rayes of Maiestie: those beames of beautie, which shall amaze the world, and be a wonder as well to Angels as to men. Wherefore, as I said euen nowe of his enemies shame, that it should be threefold: so here I repeat the same againe of his crownes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing: His crowne shall flourish in his owne conscience: in the world: in the day of iudgement. Touching his owne conscience, the blessed Apostle
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:5306:299"/>
calleth the Philippians his ioy, and a crowne <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 4.1.</note>. And to the Thessalonians hee writeth thus, What <note n="c" place="margin">1. Thes. 2.19.20</note> is our hope, or ioy, or crowne of reioycing? Are not euen you it, in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ at his comming? yes, yee are our glorie and ioy: Now, if this precious vessell of honour reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in nothing so much, as in the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his conscience, that in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and godly purenesse, and not in fleshly wisedome, but by the grace of God, hee had his conuersation in the world, the power of Gods spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still most mightily by his ministerie to the conuersion of the world to Christ: how much more shall the Lords anointed haue his conscience crowned with flourishing ioy, with comfort, with content, with heauenly peace, when he shall remember, that not onely for matters of religion and Gods true seruice, hee hath beene and still is with Saint Paul profitable to the Church; but also is a strong bulwark and a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of defence to maintaine euen the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward felicitie and prosperitie of Gods people; yea the very particular right,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:5306:299"/>
wealth, life of euery one of them; all this I say, and a 100, things more, when he considereth, what a great and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious instrument he hath beene euery way of Gods glory: O Lord God what a heauen shall he haue in his heart? what a sweet paradise of pleasure in his soule? what security? what assurance of Christs loue? what a confident and vndaunted hope of eternall glory? what a flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crowne of reioycing shall he haue men in his very conscience? vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shall his crowne flourish. Touching the world, our holy Prophet speaking to God, though in the third person, yet of himselfe saies, Thou hast preuented him with liberall blessings, and hast set a crown of pure gold vpon his head. His honour is great in thy salvation, glory and great worship hast thou laid vpon him. Now that crowne which is of gold, yea of pure gold, must needes be very flourishing euen in the viewe and face of the world. Neither is this to be vnderstood of Dauids person one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but euen of his posterity in all ages to come. How was he himselfe crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with conquests and victories ouer

For they are not caught to bee kil'd, but to be drawne out of the damnation of this world, and to be translated to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and glorie of the children of God. Wherefore as fishers take most delight in angling, when they see the fish bite quickly and greedily: so if you would put life into your Preachers, which are called fishers of men, that they may preach the word with ioy, not with griefe, you must shewe by your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by your attention, by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, by all your outward behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:5306:306"/>
that you desire n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ng so much as to bite at this sweete baite, that so you may be drawne by the Father to Christ. For they onely are good ground as we haue it here, which with a good, and a very good heart, heare the word, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
                  <p>Here are three properties of good ground set downe. All opposite to the three bad grounds mentioned before. First, they that are good ground, heare the word with a good heart; contrarie to the ground on the high wayes side, which when they haue heard, let the deuil take the word out of their hearts, &amp; so they heare not with a good heart. Secondly, they keepe the word with a very good heart; contrarie to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ground, which for a while receiue the word with ioy, but in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they fall away, and so they keepe not the word with a verie good heart. Thirdly, they bring foorth fruit with patience; contrarie to the thornie ground, which after their departure are choaked with cares, and bring no fruit, and so doe not (as it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5306:307"/>
is said here that the good ground doth) bring forth fruit with patience. But that which fell in good ground are they, which with a good, and a very good heart, heare the word, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
                  <p>The first propertie of the good ground is this, that they heare the word with a good heart. The two Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples going to Emaus,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> when Christ was departed from them, said thus one to another; Did not our hearts burne within vs, when he talked with vs by the way, &amp; opened to vs the Scripture? O Beloued, now you are busied in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, Christ talketh to you, and you are in the right way to heauen. Therefore that wee may heare with a good heart, we must feele in our hearts that burning of which the Disciples say, Did not our hearts burne within vs, when he talked with vs by the way? For so the Spirituall spouse confesseth of her selfe,<note place="margin">Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t. 5.4.</note> My beloued put his hand to the hole of the doore, and my heart was affectioned towards him. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines My soule melted when my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued spake. Now Christ puts his hand to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:5306:307"/>
the hole of the doore, desiring himselfe to enter, and vs to repent: now our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued speaketh to vs out of his word. So that we cannot be good ground, except our heart be affectioned, and our soule melt towards him. When the blessed Virgin saluted her cousin Elizabeth,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.44.</note> she felt the babe spring in her wombe for ioy. Certainely Beloued, you haue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you a babe in your hearts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the child Iesus, which is formed and fashioned in you. This babe we must feele euen to skip &amp; spring in our hearts for ioy, if we would assure our selues that wee be good ground, and heare with a good heart. Neither must we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reioyce, but also feare. Serue the Lord with gladnesse, and reioyce before him with trembling,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> saies the Psalmist. We read that when the Almightie vttered his voice,<note place="margin">Ezek. 5.24.</note> the foure beasts, whereby are meant the Angels, let fall their wings. Where are then our plumes of pride, our feathers whereby wee flie so high in an opinion of our owne knowledge and wisedome? why are they not all let downe, that we may wholly submit our selues to the Lord, to bee
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:5306:308"/>
taught and directed by his word? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I pray you what good Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius said. I know well there was neuer more reuerent hearing of the word in the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then at this day, yet that which is very well alreadie must so be commended, as that which may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better, be euermore enforced. Therefore as I was about to say, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the Captaine Cornelius said to S. Peter, when he was readie to preach vnto him; Now, saies he, are we all here present before the Lord,<note place="margin">Act. 10.33.</note> to heare all things that are commaunded thee of God: O that we had this good heart to consider, when we heare a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that we stand not before a man, but <hi>coram domino,</hi> before the Lord.

Then, we should put a difference between other things which perhaps shortly we shall heare, either to recreate the mind or sharpen the wit, or for state and maiestie, or for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earthly purpose, and betweene this engrafted word, which is able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For though a man cannot heare the word without patience, nor keepe the word without patience, yet pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is neuer so requisite, as in bringing forth fruit according to the word which wee haue heard, and kept. Wherefore the holy Ghost saith;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.36.</note> Ye haue neede of patience, that after yee haue done the will of God, yee may receiue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. He saies not, After ye haue heard it with your eare, or kept it with your memorie: but after yee haue done the will of God, and brought forth the fruit thereof, yee may receiue the promise. For wherefore did not the stony ground bring forth fruite, but onely for want of patience. They receiued the word with ioy, and seemed to haue very good hearts for a time; but in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for want of patience they fel away. Wherefore did not the thornie ground bring forth fruit, but onely for want of patience? After their departure wanting patience to digest their greifes, they were choked with cares, and so brought forth no fruit. Therefore as a good field must endure many a cold frost &amp; snow, and hard weather in the winter time,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:5306:314"/>
before it can yeed a fruitfull croppe in Summer: semblably he that would bee good ground, must possesse his soule in much patience, and continually endure yea euen manfully reiect all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his flesh, all the allurements of the world, all the temptations of the deuill, whereby he may bee hindered from bringing forth the fruit of good life, according to the holy will and word of God. Hee must like a good tree, bring forth good fruite; hee must with Simeon be not onely high as the cypresse, but also fruitfull as the oliue: he must with Noah make him, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a windowe for contemplation, but also a doore for action; hee must with Moses, make him a lauer with a base the must with Esay lift vp his voice like a trumpet; he must with Abraham burie Sarah in a double sepulchre: in one word, he must alwaies bring forth fruit with patience. For they onely are good ground, which with a good, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good heart, heare the word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then, It is not greatly needefull to exhort you with a good

heart to heare the word. Neuer hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such diligent hearing in the Court, as now a dayes. I dare be bold to say it; All the Preachers in England, in very many yeares by all their exhortations, could neuer haue done halfe so much good in this kind, as the onely, holy, and happie example hath done, which we see euery day before our eies.

Kings with their armies. Prayer hath shut vp the windowes of heauen, that it should not raine, and againe hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them that the earth might giue her increase. Prayer hath staied the swift course of the sonne, and caused it to go backward fifteene degrees. Prayer hath held Gods hands that hee could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Prayer hath deuided the sea, that the floods thereof could not come neere the Israelites. In this place it deliuereth the faithfull man from all the dangers of the world. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the flood of many waters they shal not come neere him.</p>
                  <p>The summe is this; That no calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, no troubles of this life, no terrours of death, no guiltinesse of sinne, can be so great, but that a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man by meanes of his faith and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in Christ shall wade out of them well enough, For howsoeuer other things goe, still he shall haue such a solace in his soule, such a comfort in his conscience, such a heauen in his heart,

knowing himselfe reconciled to God, and iustified by faith, that Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.</p>
                  <p>Which, that it may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, I shall desire you to obserue two things. The daunger: the deliuerance. The danger is in these words; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the flood of many waters. Where the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations that the godly man is subiect to in this life, are likened, First to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: then to many waters: thirdly, to a flood of many waters; In the flood of many waters. The deliuerance is in these words; Surely they shall not come neere him. Where the deliuerance of the godly man hath three degrees also. First they shall not come neare: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly him, they shall not come neere him: then Surely, surely they shall not come neere him. Surely in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neere him.</p>
                  <p>First, the afflictions of the faithful are likened to waters. Fire and water haue no mercy we say. But of the two water is the worst. For any fire may be qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whence that the bodie dieth: Because a soule is not in it. Therefore the soule of thy soule is faith. So that if we would know what is a faithfull man, we must define Him, not by his naturall soule, as he is resona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but by the soule of his soule, which is his faith. And when we easily answer the obiection, that a flood may come neere a faithfull mans goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neere his bodie, neere his reasonable soule, but to his faith, that is to Him, it can neuer come neere. For if you speake of the life and essence of him, that it is faith, the Prophet also witnesseth,<note place="margin">Abacuck.</note> The iust shall liue by faith.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> And the Apostle, Now I liue not, but Christ liueth in me, but that I liue, I liue by faith in the sonne of God; who loued mee, and gaue himselfe for me.

for this is all of man. All of man, what's that. All of man which will hold out against all floods of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters: For the goods of man may be gotten away by forged cauillation: the bodie of man may be weakened by sickenesse: the soule of man, and the faculties thereof, as memorie, witte, and such like, may be impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by age, but faith in Christ, the feare of God, a care to keepe his commaundements, is all of man, which no floods, either in life or in death can ouer-whelme. All of man wherein man ought to imploy himselfe while he is aliue, and without which, man is but vanitie when he is dead, but with which, man both in life and death is most blessed. For if this be the summe of all, then of any thing but this there is no reckoning at all to be made.<note place="margin">Matth. 16.18.</note> I haue praied for thee, saith our Sauiour, that thy faith should not faile, and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against thee.

                  <p>In the last place must be considered the asseueration, Surely.

For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as a building made arch-wise, the more waight is laide vpon it, the more strong still it is: so the more force and strength is brought against me, the greater triumph &amp; victorie I shall haue.

The words of Saint Iames are verie plaine:<note place="margin">Iam. 1.2.</note> My brethren, count it exceeding ioy when you fall into diuers temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Tentation of it selfe doth vexe and disquiet a man. But to the godly it is a ioy. As we read els where, That they which are iustified by faith haue peace: nay, haue easie accesse to God, and great ioy in tribulations. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle adding,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> that this ioy is not common or ordinarie, but Surely exceeding ioy, raiseth vp the amplification as high as may be. Whereunto, S. Paul also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth; We are afflicted on euery side,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4 9.</note> yet we are not in distresse: in pouertie, but not ouercome of pouertie; wee are persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but we perish not. Here he prooueth directly, that the flood commeth not neere the faithfull. But where is the Surely? It followeth in the same epistle; As dying, and behold we liue: as chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and yet not killed:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.20.</note> as sorrowing, and yet alwaies reioycing: as poore, and

yet making others rich: as hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet possessing all things. O the securitie and felicitie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full! For his faith maketh life of death; ioy of sorrowe: riches of pouertie. What shall I say more, or what would you haue me say more? then as the Apostle saies? It makes all things of nothing.

For they import, that death is no death, but As it were death, an image, or a shadowe of death: beeing indeede life, and Surely a better life and more immortall then we had here. Therefore he saies, Behold we liue, to shewe that by death the faithfull liue a life wherein there is some great specialty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie worthy indeed to be beholded &amp; regarded.

And Surely euen in the verie warre he hopeth. The flood of waters commeth not neere to drowne the Arke, but lift it vp. And so much the higher Surely the arke still riseth, as the flood riseth. The sea stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Israelites passage. It is a dry land for them to march on. As a wall moreouer to backe them Surely against all their enemies.

Death is no death, but a life, and Surely such a life, as only of it we may say, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we liue. So happie both in life and death is the faithfull man: Surely in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neere him.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then; No calamitie or aduersitie can possibly disseuer that coniunction which faith maketh of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie godly man with Christ. For fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the remission of his sinnes assured and sealed vnto him, hee contemneth not onely the workes of the world, and dismaiments of his conscience, but euen the verie feares and terrours of death. This our deare brother M.

He was appointed to be one of the cheifest tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators. And as soone as it was knowne how farre in this trauaile hee did more then any of the rest, hee was very well prouided for in respect of liuing. For which my L. his Grace of Canterburie now liuing, is much to bee reuerenced and honoured. But beeing so well to passe both for himselfe, and for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, sodainely he fell sicke. He was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an ague and a squinsey both together.

For the squinsey beeing both by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his friends not greatly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, within foure dayes tooke away his life. These were many waters, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse tribulations. Besides a thousand more, which I cannot now stand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate. Yet he carried himselfe so in life and death, as these waters seemed not once to come neere him. He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour of the Hebrewe tongue in this Vniuersitie thirtie yeares.

Which tongue, howsoeuer some account of it, yet ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all the rest. For it is the auncientest, the shortest, the plainest of all. A great part of wisedome, as Plato sheweth,<note place="margin">In Cratylo.</note> is the knowledge of true Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies. These in other tongues are vncertaine, in this taking out of the naturall qualities of euery thing that is named. In so much as when any man hath found out the Hebrewe Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, then he neede seeke no further. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, all the Scripture written before the birth of Christ, except a fewe chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Daniel and Ezra, were written in Hebrewe. And the Rabbins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, though they haue no small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fables and lies in them, yet diuers things they haue notwithstanding fit for the opening of the olde Testament. Therefore though a man cannot reade the Rabbins, yet vnlesse he can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand handsomely well the Hebrewe text; he is compted but a maimed, or as it were but halfe a Diuine, especially in this learned age.

But in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he took greatest pains in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie, which he dedicated to Doctor Iohn Whitgift, the reuerend late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury. This booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is full of hidden learning, and sheweth infinite reading in stories. I asked him within this little while, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee had written no more bookes, He told me he had, but printed no more because hee had no time to peruse and perfect them for other businesse. Now by businesse he meant, I weene espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his studie and care to performe well his taske in the translation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:5306:329"/>
how excellently he was imployed, all they can witnes who were ioyned with him in that labour. For though they be the verie flower of the Vniuersitie for knowledge of the tongues, yet they will not be ashamed to confesse, that no one man of their companie, if not by other respects, yet at least wise for long experience and exercise in this kinde, was to be compared with him. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede he was so desirous that this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse begunne by the commaundement of our most gracious Soueraigne King <hi>Iames,</hi> should bee brought to a happie ende; that oftentimes in many mens hearings, hee protested hee had rather die, then be any way negligent herein, Which as some thinke by all likelihood came indeede so to passe. To wit, that too earnest study and paines about the translation, hastened his death, and brought it on sooner. Now as he liued so, in his profession, in his writings, in his translating, as though all the floods of many waters had neuer comn' neare him: euen so also he died. During the short time of his sickenesse, hee carried himselfe, as alwaies before, humbly,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:5306:330"/>
mildly, quietly, constantly. One of his louing friends standing by his bed, and saying; M. Liuely, I pray God you may haue patience, and hope, and especially faith vnto the ende. He lifting vp his hands said heartily and cheerefully, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Little he vsed to speake, and more he could not say, for the paine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment of his squinsey. Which though it made a speedie ende of him, as the apoplexy did of the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Valentinian, yet how could any death be sodaine to him, whose whole life was nothing els but a meditation of death, and whom the Lord whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he came, might finde doing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Wherefore no reason wee should lament his departure out of this world. He liued blessedly, he died blessedly in the Lord. Rather, you Reuerend and learned Vniuersitie-men, lament for this, that you haue lost so famous a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour, and so worthy a writer. Lament you translatours, beeing now depriued of him, who no lesse by his owne merit and desert, then by the priuiledge of his place, was to order and ouersee all your trauailes.

perswaded Iapheth to dwell in the tents of Shem <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 9 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that those oracles, which before were appropriated to the Iewes <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 3.2.</note>, are now imparted vnto <hi>all</hi> the Gentiles.

Because Christ, who first preached in Nepthalie, is not now any longer in prison among the Iewes; but, as a hind let loose, leaping by the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and skipping by the hills <note n="t" place="margin">Can. 2.8.</note>, so he hath run swiftly ouer <hi>all</hi> the world<note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 147.15.</note>; and
