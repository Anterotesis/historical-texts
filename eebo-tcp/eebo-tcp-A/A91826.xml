            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Faithful Teſtimony againſt Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary <hi>Wiggs.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHereas, the Great and Wiſe God, the Creator of all things, having made Man according to his own good pleaſure, hath beſtowed on many a plentiful Quantity of Hair to keep them Warm, ſome of one Colour and ſome of another, but to Each one of them, hath his Providence afforded ſuch a Colour as will ſatisfie an Humble Mind.</p>
            <p>And if any one hath not a ſufficient quantity of Hair to keep him Warm, or thro' Sickneſs, or by any other Infirmity, or Caſualty looſes his Hair; a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and modeſt ſupply may then be very reaſonable, and no offence to God or Good Men, and ſuch ſupply of Hair being uſed, till Natural Hair grows again, may afterwards be well laid aſide.</p>
            <p>But if for Pride, or without any juſt occaſion, any that have ſufficient Hair to keep them Warm, do cut it off; eſteeming it not Faſhionable or Modiſh, or that it don't curle enough, or is not of ſuch Colour as they would have it be; this is not right in the ſight of God, and is an evident Token, his Divine Wiſdom, Care and Providence is ſlighted and undervalued, by thoſe who are not contented with ſuch Sort, and Colour of Hair, as he hath ſeen fit to beſtow; as if they would alter the Work of Providence, and mend what God hath made.</p>
            <p>I felt a Concern upon my Spirit from the Lord, to give a ſhort Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt Exceſs in theſe things; ſeeing to my Sorrow many, both Old and Young, run into unneceſſary <hi>Wiggs;</hi> and have found that it hath given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence in divers places.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the Love of God, which now flows in my Heart to all my Friends and Brethren, I entreat all to be Careful to ſhun ſuch occaſions, and rather to deny themſelves than to give offence to any.</p>
            <p>This Counſel I have taken my ſelf, and by the helping hand of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, I intend ſo to continue to the end of my days, and not only in that, but in avoiding all <hi>Superfluity of Naughtineſs</hi> whatſoever: for ſo is the Will of God concerning us, whom he hath choſen above all the Families of the Earth, to place his Eternal Name in, and to be the firſt Fruits to his Glory in theſe latter Ages of the World.</p>
            <p>Oh! let us walk circumſpectly, not as Fools whoſe Eyes are abroad, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon the fooliſh Faſhions of the World, which will paſs away and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with the Uſing; but follow him in our Day, whom God hath given for a Covenant of <hi>Light</hi> to us <hi>Gentiles;</hi> who ſtill leads in the way of Self-denial, and in the clean Path of Righteouſneſs, which alone brings to his Kingdom, all who walk in it to the End of their Days.</p>
            <p>So the God of Conſolation be with all his choſen Veſſels, whom he hath ſanctified to do his Will in the Earth, and Preſerve us all to the End of our Days in Faith, Patience and Well-doing; that the Worthy and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name of the Lord, by which we are called, may be renowned by us for evermore,</p>
