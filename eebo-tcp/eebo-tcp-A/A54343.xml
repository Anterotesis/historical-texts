         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny and Intollerable are the Injuries and

I need not run no further to find out Examples that

our Natives run to haſten others and their own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;

            <p>But not to Derrigate too far from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Subject of this Preſent Narrative; I
ſhall give you an Account of the Audacious

Chancellour, the Sixth of <hi>February,</hi> being
Tueſday-Night, One Thouſand Six Hundred
Seventy Six, and the Parties that were Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the Saturday-night following.</p>
            <p>The manner of their Apprehenſion was
thus. Some of the head of the gang had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a Lodging in <hi>Knight-Riders-Street,</hi> neer
<hi>Doctors-commons;</hi> and there in a cloſet they
had lodged the Mace and Purſes.</p>
            <p>The Womans Daughter of the Houſe,
going up in their abſence to make the bed,
faw ſome ſilver Spangles, and ſome odd
ends of Silver ſcattered about the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which ſhe with no ſmall diligence
pickt up, not knowing from whence ſuch
Riches ſhould proceed, in this Admiration
ſhe paus'd a while, and 'twas not long before
her Fancy led her (like the reſt of her Sex) to
pry into, and ſearch the furthermoſt point of
this new and ſtrange Apparition, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her courſe to the Cloſet-Door, ſhe through
the Key-hole could Deſcern ſomething that
was not commonly repreſented to her view;
which was the upper end of the Mace, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55922:3"/>
knew not what it was; however ſhe thought
it could not be amiſs to acquaint her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Mother with what ſhe had beheld; and
with this reſolve ſhe haſtens down Stairs, and
with a voice 'twixt fear and joy, ſhe thus crys
out; <hi>Oh Mother! Mother! Yonders the Kings
Crown in our cloſet! Pray Mother come along
with me and ſee it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The admiring Mother being ſomething
ſurprized at her Daughters Relation, as alſo
having no good opinion of her new Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
makes haſt (good VVoman) and goes to
the Cloſet-door, and opening the Lock with
a Knife, ſhe enter'd into the Cloſet, where ſhe
ſoon diſcern'd that it was not a Crown, but a
Mace; and having heard that ſuch a thing
was loſt, ſends immediately away to acquaint
my Lord Chancellour that the Mace was in
her Houſe; upon which information, a
Warrant was ſoon granted, and Officers ſent
to Mr. <hi>Thomas Northy,</hi> Conſtable of Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hive-Ward,
who with a ſufficient aſſiſtance
went into <hi>Knight-Riders-street</hi> to their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and very luckily found them, being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55922:4"/>
Five in Number, and of both Sexes, <hi>Viz.</hi>
Three Men, and Two Women; whom they
carried before the Right Worſhipful, Sir
<hi>William Turner,</hi> who after Examination (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Juſtice) committed them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Goal of <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Seſſions held in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Seventh day of this Inſtant <hi>March.</hi> The
Five Priſoners aforeſaid were firſt call'd to the
Barr, where according to the cuſtome of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
they were bid to hold up their hands, and
ask'd whether Guilty or not Guilty, they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
ſeverally, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> After that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
were Sworn and Examined, who very
manifeſtly proved the fact, the Woman and her
Daughter where they lodg'd being two great
Evidences againſt them.</p>
            <p>After this the principle of thoſe Malefactors,
a perſon very well known in court, having <hi>been</hi>
Arraign'd at the ſame Barr five or ſix ſeveral
times before, very confidently ſpeaks to the
Bench in this manner: <hi>My Lord, I own the fact,
'twas I, and this Man</hi> (pointing to one that ſtood
by him at the Barr) <hi>that rob'd my Lord Chancellor,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55922:4"/>
and the other three are clear of the fact, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay but they were Confederates with us in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
of the Prize after it was taken. This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>to the Honourable Bench, that I may
be clear of the blood of theſe other three Perſons.</hi> The
Bench and all Spectators elſe admir'd to hear
him thus confidently declare himſelf guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Examination, knowing that the Fact was
of ſo high a Nature, and without all doubt
would prove capital; However the Court went
on in a legal way, and another Witneſs begun
to demonſtrate in what manner he was taken;
to whom the Priſoner anſwer'd in this manner.
<hi>Prithee Fellow do not make ſuch a long Narration of
my being taken, thou ſeeſt I am here, and I own that
I and this Man</hi> (as aforeſaid) <hi>are Guilty of the
Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With that the other Priſoner whom he thus
impeach'd, endeavour'd to clear himſelf after
this manner: <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>this Man meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me in</hi> Pauls-Church-Yard, <hi>ask'd me to go and
drink, with whom I went, and after we were ſeated, he
told me that he knew of a Booty would make me ſmile,
telling me of the Mace and Purſes; and further ſaying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55922:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that if I would be his aſsiſtant he would give me my
ſhare of the Prize.</hi> To whom the Priſoner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
made this reply in open Court; <hi>Yes, My
Lord, I look like a Fellow that would commit a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
and give him half the Prize.</hi> At this there
was a great ſhoot in the Court, but ſilence was
ſtraight commanded. And the other Man with
the Two Women were examin'd, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to clear themſelves, but ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was produc'd in Court, who did atteſt
that they found ſome of the Plate with them at
the time of their Apprehenſion, ſo they were
put to ſilence, and diſmiſt the Court for that
time.</p>
            <p>It was obſerv'd the Priſoner whom the cheif
Malefactor impeach't to be equally guilty of
the Fact with himſelf, had a great ſenſe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
upon him whilſt he was at the Barr, and
complained to himſelf of Lewd and Laſcivious
Women, ſaying that they were the cauſe of his
and many other Mens ruine; which is certainly
true that they are the ruine of many a hopeful
Young-man. <hi>From ſuch vile Women that brings
many a Man to ſudden Death, Good Lord Deliver us
all.</hi>
