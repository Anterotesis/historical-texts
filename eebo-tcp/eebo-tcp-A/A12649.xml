            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

brightnesse of notable
rules of spirituall life: euery
one of which, may be as it
were a Lanterne vnto thy
feete, and a continuall Light

            <p>This therefore doe I nowe
(deuout Reader) present vnto
thy sight, affirming vnto thee,
that which thou thy selfe
wilt not denie, as being both
true and manifest: that, Haec
<hi>est via qua dilectus Domino
N. caelum intrauit,</hi> This is
the way by which the wel-beloued
seruant of God N.
went vp into heauen.</p>
            <p>For in what estate soeuer
he liued in this worlde, hee
ranne the way of Christian
perfection, in an ordinarie
course of a secular life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:6634:5"/>
from his very infancie he was
a spectacle to all that knewe
him in the state of Religion,
the which he imbraced from
his childehood; he was a rare
example of religious perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and discipline: and finally
in his manie seueral and most
cruell conflicts with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Christ, he sheweth
how stronge and vnconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the loue of God is, whose
burning heate neuer so manie
waters or gustes of moste
mayne floudes, may either
quench or smother: and whose
power the most power-able
thing of all, which is Death,
can not ouercome.</p>
            <p>Thou therefore (my deare
brother) heholding, according
to the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

imitate his faith. Fashion thy
life and manners according to
these deuoute rules, which are
a most perfect mirour of his
godlie life: &amp; in so doing, thou
mayest hapilie attaine thy self
to the like crowne of glorie.</p>
            <p>For though Martirdome be a
most speciall gifte of God, and
he freelie bestoweth it where
hee liketh, neyther is it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
rewarde due vnto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so great merites of neuer
so holie personages, and it is to
his excellent power a moste
easie thinge, <hi>subitò honestare
pauperem,</hi> euen from the
middest of a sinnefull life, to
exalt vnto Martirdome: yet
is there a certaine disposition
in those which are chosen to
so high a dignitie ordinarilie
required of God, which is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6634:6"/>
first to haue killed their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
before they be killed by
persecutors; first to haue
beene exercised in a spirituall
conflict of mortification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be tried in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of Christian confession;
first to haue become the towne,
butchers, before they be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
to the hangmans sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Otherwise (as our Sauiour
saieth) <hi>Qui amat animam
suam perdet eam:</hi> Who so
loueth his life or soule disordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
shall loose it, and neuer
be able to stand in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batte,
wherein not flesh and
bloud, not pride, ambition, and

rancour; but a mortified

into Gods handes, obtaineth
the victory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:6634:6"/>Which disposition and
ready preparation for this so
happy a crowne, was most
perfectly found in this our
Authour: whereupon iusued,
that he might truely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

My soule bath made
choice of hanging, and my
bones of death. I am become
desperate, I will now liue no
longer: because long before he
had hanged vp his soule by
perfect estranging of it from
earthly affections, and keeping
it fixed and ioyned to God;
thence did it pooceed, that his
earthly bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that death which was to be

his hopes from the base desires

               </gap>e
contemne this life for the loue
of this heauenlie life, and he
thought he had liued long
enough, when he might die to
liue for euer.</p>
            <p>Enioy therefore these rules
deuout Reader, and ioyfullie
treade the pathes of this most
pleasant way to heauen: and
if by the compendious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie

thy iorney toward thy euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

giue glorie vnto God, and

and assiste with thy

               </gap>es: first, that
whereas in these Rules thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalt
sometimes reade, that
thou must doe this or that;
thou must not vnderstand
that worde (<hi>must</hi>) as though
thou wert bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of any thinge there
expressed, but onely that those
actions doe belong vnto the
exercise of perfection without

the lawe of God, or holie
church do impose.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, that before thou

thou acquaint thy

then mine owne, I must be
a fraid to vse them in any
such thing wherein I might
offend him: but rather seeke
to doe all things so that they
be worthy of his presence,
helpe, and assistance in them.
And if I can get a custome or

God (as by vse easely I may)

Perfect resignation of

                  <p>To attaine this resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

that there may be nothing

whom I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

a farre better part then the
body. First I must procure
that my choice be of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
graue, and mortified
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hauing their owne
passions well subdued, may
the better teach me how to

is the chiefe helpe and most
profitable, if my choise bee

choise with greate aduise
and deliberation, vsing the
counsaile of some other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

               <p>First, I must procure to

as dutifully (not onely in

               <p>To conclude, my obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

Stoutly without despaire or

perseuerance to the end.
Humbly without pride.</p>

will put such things in his

therefore must I resolue to
laie my soule in his handes,
and to frame my iudgement
to his in all thinges, that hee
shall thinke fitte for me to

               <p>My speech ought not to
be so much, as to make me
be noted for talkatiue, yea it
is good to be rather sparing
in wordes, and readier to
heare, then to speake. But
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forceth to much
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6634:29"/>
talke, I must speake delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
without rashenesse or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity,
auoiding ouer-many
iests, especially bitter taunts
and sharpe words. I must also
take heed of affected speach
and impertinent ceremonies,
and vse such affability and
conuenient complements, as
common ciuility and vsuall
curtesie requireth.</p>
               <p>Mine apparel must be free
from lightnesse, or more
gawdines the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fitteth my age,

much as may bee without
singularity, that therein
the staiednes and seemely

perceiued.</p>
               <p>Alwaies when I am to goe
to any company, either of

I ought to forecast their

               <head>Of my duety towardes my
selfe.</head>
               <head>THE FIFTH
Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe last point is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
my duty towards
my selfe, &amp; the care I ought
to haue of mine owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>First I must procure that
which before is mentioned,
in all my actions to haue the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6634:32"/>
badge of christianity: that is
a pure and sincere affection
and intention, not seeking
in any thinge my owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
pleasure, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
more then may stand
with the honour &amp; glory of
God, remembring that I am
to serue him and not my
selfe, more then is necessary
to inable me for his better
seruice, I being his more then
mine owne.</p>
               <p>Secondly I must procure to
foresee in euery action, at the
lest in al the principal, to fore
arme my selfe against those
occasions of sinne which shal
be offered in them: &amp; where
it lieth not in my power to
auoide the occasion of any
greate sinne, the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
there is, and the greater
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6634:32"/>
the sinne is that I am in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of, so much the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
must I vse to resist
it, and the more earnestly
aske for Gods grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I must haue care
of my sences, as the meanes
and entrance of temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
To which it is a principall
helpe, not to bee easely
drawen with euery noise or
phansy to mooue my head
or eyes, excepte there be
good cause: nor to be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
in motion, or going
hither and thither, without
deliberation. I must also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
well, that the eie is
neuer satisfied with seeing,
nor the eares with hearing
nouelties, and therfore must
I needs bridle the vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
appetite of both these
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6634:33"/>
senses, by breaking of mine
owne desires in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly because confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and an vnsetled kind of
life, is the cause of many
sinnes, and an enemy to all
vertue, I must set downe
with my selfe some certaine
order in spendinge my time,
alotting to euery hower in
the day, some certaine thing
to bee done in the same, so
neere as possibly I may, or at
the least to haue sometimes
in the morning, euening, &amp;
afternoone, certainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted
to some good ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
which I must (though
not by vow) after a sort
binde my selfe vnto, when
things of greater weight do
not call me from them. Also
to keepe due times of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6634:33"/>
meales, and going to
bed, and all other ordinary ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes:
the obseruation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is most necessary for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
&amp; vertuous order of lif.</p>
               <p>Fithly it is a moste neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
rule of good life, not
onely to keepe order in my
temporall and spirituall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but also to perseuer and
continue in one order, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
once set it downe with
sound aduise. For the nature
of man being apt to change,
we are giuen still to nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
seeking newe waies to
perfection, and confirming
or habituating our selues in
none: wherefore (except ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
charity, or greater
spirituall good doe require) I
must not flit from one exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
to another, from one
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6634:34"/>
ghostly father to another,
from on forme of behauiour
to another, but first plante a
good plat-forme with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
aduise, and then resolue
and fully determine to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the same.</p>
               <p>Sixtlie I must not cumber
my mind with many spiritual
or externall exercises at once,
nor labour my selfe to much
at the first, for my force being
distracted to many offices, is
the lesse able to performe
any of them, and is easily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-labored
without profit:
wherfor I must not thinke
to get all vertues at once, or
cut off all imperfections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but hauing a generall
resolution to gette vertue,
and leaue all vice, begin with
some one, endeuouring to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6634:34"/>
endeuouring to breake my
self of some one fault, which
I am most inclined vnto, and
procuring to get the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie
vertue: for the care of auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one offence, will make
me take heed of all the rest.</p>
               <p>Seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nature beeing
so corrupted, that without
continuall violence &amp; force,
it cannot attaine to vertu, or
leaue vice, wherunto it is
much inclined, I must assure
myself that care &amp; watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is euer necessary: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am apte to fall, I must
often renue my good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which for that it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
point, it will be good
to sette downe with my selfe
these rules.</p>
               <p>First to appoint and set
downe with my selfe, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6634:35"/>
euery morning one of my
first thoughts shal bee of the
good purposes I haue made,
which must not be many,
but some one or two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and principall points that
I see most necessary for me,
and to set downe also in the
morning, at what times in
the day I will remember the
same, as at seruice, at dinner,
at euensong, or such like ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
for the care to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them at some certaine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
wil make me stilmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of them, and so readier
to performe them.</p>
               <p>Secondly to examine my
selfe twice in a day, whether
I haue broken them since the
morning or no: and if I haue,
then to be so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e for it, and
begin againe to fortify my
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6634:35"/>
selfe better against the next
occasion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly because I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
goe on in vertu without
falling, I must euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or at least euery holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
thinke with my selfe
that hitherto I haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and that, by Gods
grace, that day I will beginne
a freshe, as though it were
the first day that euer I began
to do any good thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly to celebrate the
daie of my conuersion euery
yeare as a solemne day, and
as the day of my birth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was brought forth and
dedicated to God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and in some other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es in the yeare, to
to calle to minde the first fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
deuotion, and zeale,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6634:36"/>
that God did then giue mee,
and this I ought to doe very
often a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> other times also.</p>
               <p>Eightly, I must not make
smale account of little sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
not bee careles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alwaies carry
that minde, that I would not
offende God willingly, euen
in the least veniall sinnes for
any thing: and I must neuer
thinke any thing little, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
so high a maiesty is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
For one that careth
not to committ little sinnes,
giueth the diuell a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
to drawe him into
greater.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, as I must take heed
of pampering my body too
much, &amp; ought to take some
ordinarie corporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
as of fasting, discipline,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6634:36"/>
haire-cloth, or the like: fo on
the other side, I must haue
care of my health, &amp; so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
all my spirituall exercises
and bodily afflictions with
discretion, that I maie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in them stil, &amp; not make
my selfe vnable to perseuer
long, by the vndiscreet gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
of a short time, and to
vse discretion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
will auaile.</p>
               <p>First, before God to thinke
whether dooing this or that,
I may be able to continue my
vndertaken course in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
my body, force, health,
and other cares, comber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, or
businesses considered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to aske counsaile
of spiritual men, long practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in spirituall affaires.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to reade spirituall
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6634:37"/>
bookes, intreating of that
which I designe to doe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to pray that God
with his light and grace,
would lighten my hart, to
knowe and performe that
which is fittest for me, and
most to his glory.</p>

It is good sometime to omitt

of some part of Christes
passion, or of his life, or of

                     </gap>
to be addressed: for therein
our manage is about the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of our soule, our chief
iewell and treasure: of which
if in the short passage of
our brittle and vncertaine
life, we take not that due
care that we ought, for a
whole eternity after, we
shall euermore repent and be
sory for it, and yet neuer haue
the like opportunity againe
to help it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the better to
conceiue the moment and
weight of this busines, let
vs consider what men vse to
doe for their bodily health.
For we see they make so
principall a reckning of it,
that they spare no cost nor
toile, nor leaue any thing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6634:65"/>
vnattempted that may auaile
them to attaine it. They suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them selues to be laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
wounded, pined, burnt
with red hoat irons, besides
diuers other extreame to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
onely for this end.
How much greater miseries
ought we to endure? How
much greater paine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
ought we to imploy
for this health of our soule?
which is to suruiue when the
body is dead, rotten, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
with wormes: and to
suruiue in such sort, that it
must be perpetually tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in hell with intollerable
torments, or enioy endles
felicity in heauen. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of howe much greater
worth and weight wee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the soule, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6634:66"/>
saluation or damnation
therof, then the momentary
health or sickenes of our
body, so much greater accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and esteeme ought we to
make of the busines of our
soule, then of any other
worldly or bodily affaire
whatsoeuer.</p>
                  <p>For what auaileth it a
man (saith Christ) to gaine
the whole worlde and make
wracke of his owne soule? If
therefore we keepe diue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se
men for diuers offices about
our body, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
to liue by seruing and
prouiding things for euery
part therof: If we spend so
much time in feeding, refres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing,
and reposing of the
same If the greatest portion
of our reuenewes, (be they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6634:66"/>
neuer so large) be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
in the meates, pompe,
sportes and pleasures thereof:
How much more ought we
to seeke as many helpes, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,
and purueiers for our
soule, for who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e only sake
our body was giuen, and of
whose good the welfare of
the body only proceedeth?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the necessity and
poise of this care of our
soule, may be gathered of
this, that all other matters
are in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed with men, or
some other creatures: but this
busines of our soule is with
God him selfe, who by how
much he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s nobler and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
than any of his creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
so much more is the
weight of this matter, that
can not be dealt with any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6634:67"/>
without him, and so much
more diligence ought there
to be imployed therein, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in this time, wherein
God is still ready to farther
our endeuours in this behalfe,
where as when time is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
condemne he may for
our negligence, or reward
vs for our carefulnes, but
not helpe vs any more to
alter the estate of our soule,
be it neuer so badde, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we may gather
how material and important
this matter is, by the life of
Christ and his Saintes, who
withdrawing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues from
all other worldly affaires,
thought it worke enough to
attend to this businesse of
their soule; and whosoeuer
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6634:67"/>
are now solemnized and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in Gods Church, they
are honored only in this that
they haue with a glorious
Conclusion, happily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
accomplished this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines
to Gods glory, and
their owne saluation. And
who so considers the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
torments of Martyres,
the extreame austerity, shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
life, and penance of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
the painefull ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and conflicts of Virgins,
the rough stormes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of all Gods Saintes, and
doth remember withall that
they vndertook them for no
other respect, but onely for
the better bringing this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
of their soule to an
end, it wil soone apeare how
weighty a thinge, and how
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6634:68"/>
pretious the saluation of the
soule is, which they did think
not too deere bought with
all the miseries, sorrowes,
and paines, that this worlde
coulde afford. Let vs also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that what soeuer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to such care and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnes
in this behalfe, hath
no lesse place doubtlesse in vs
than in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeing that our
soule is as deere bought, as
much worth, created to as
great glory as theirs: the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of our saluation rather
more than any way lesse than
theirs. God hath as much
right in vs as in them, and we
as many titles of bond and
duetie to serue him as they.
Finally we are assaulted by
the same ennemies, enuiron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the like hazzardes,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6634:68"/>
and subiect to as many, yea
more occasions of sinne, and
allurements to damnation
than they. Who therefore
see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h not that we ar in euery
respect to account the care of
our soules as important and
necessary to vs, as euer it hath
beene to any: <hi>Wherefore, let
not the wise man glorie in his
wisedome, nor the strong man
in his might, nor the rich man
in his riches,</hi> saith God by his
Prophet Hiere 9. <hi>But let him
that glorieth, glorie in this,
that he knoweth me, for I am

as who woulde say, it is folie
and vanitie to glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
in any other thinge,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6634:69"/>
then in the knowledge and
seruice of God, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
mercie and milde iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our soule.</p>

vnto temptation.</hi> Wherefore
he that entereth into the way
of life, must remember that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6634:70"/>
he is not come to a play, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime,
or pleasure, but to a
continuall rough battell and
fight, against most vnplaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and spightfull enemies;
and let him resolue him self,
neuer in this worlde to look
for quiet and peace, no not
so much as for any truce for
a time, but arme him self for
a perpetual combate, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think of a multitude of
happie victories (which by
Gods grace he may obtaine)
then of any repose or quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
from the rage &amp; assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of his ennemies. Let him
see and peruse the paterne of
his capitains course, who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his birth to his death, was in
a restlesse battell, persecuted
in his swadling clowtes by
Herod, annoied the rest of his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6634:71"/>
infancy by banishment, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
and neede In the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his age slaundered, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
pursued, whipped cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
and most barbarously
misused: In the same sort
were all his Apostles, and all
his principall souldiers hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
for whom he loueth he
chastiseth, and prooueth like
golde in the fornace. And
therefore no man must think
it a new thing to be tempted
and troubled, when hee once
runneth a vertuous course,
contrarie to the liking of his
enemies. For the disciple is
not aboue his master, nor the
seruant aboue his Lorde,
who as we see had the same
intreaty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, lest we should
be agast and discouraged at
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6634:71"/>
the expectation and feare of
so many discomfortes; and
the incessant malice of so
spitefull ennemies, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the wordes of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus:
that more stand with
vs, then against vs. Against
the corruption of nature we
haue grace. Against the diuel
wee haue God, who will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
suffer vs to be tempted
aboue our force: Against the
power of hell we haue the
prayers of Saintes: Against
the miseries of the body, the
spiritual comfort of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
which God allotteth in
such measure as our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
requireth: and if there
were nothing else, this were
enough to make troubles
welcome in this case, for that
therby we purchase an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6634:72"/>
glory for a short and
passing combate, the comfort
wherof nether eie hath seen,
nor eare heard, nor heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.
And on the other side
by the same, wee auoid other
intolerable and externall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Hel, the least wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
passeth all those that can
be suffered in this worlde.
And therfore is our chaunge
most happy, that by the paine
of a short life, auoide the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of an eternall death, and
deserue the vnspeakable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of the life euerlasting.
For this cause saith Saint Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes;
<hi>Thinke you it all ioy (my

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6634:73"/>
a Legate that is to deliuer his
embassage befor a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Peers and Nobles,
hath not only regarde to his
matter, but also to his words,
voyce &amp; actions, that all be
sutable to the weight of his
message: So we hauing to
worke this exploite of our
soule befor the eyes of those
that lay waite to take vs in
any trippe, ought to bee very
warye, euen in our least
thoughts &amp; deedes, for feare
that we offend the presence
of God, and giue occasion of
triumphe and vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

saieth the scripture, <hi>keepe thy
selfe very watchfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to attaine this
diligent and attentiue care
to all our actions, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6634:73"/>
what men vse to doe,
that carry great treasure by
places haunted by theeues,
how warily they see to their
way, how often they looke
about them, how many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
they prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
some times to fight, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles
to runne away:
Likwise how warily he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
and how carefull he is
neuer to stumble nor fall,
that carieth in each hande a
thinne glasse of liquor verie
pretious, through stony and
rough places: And when
wee haue marked these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
carefulnes in these inferiour
matters, let vs reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that
much more respect is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in vs, whose treasure
is more pretious then any
worldlie iewelles, &amp; yet doe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6634:74"/>
we carry it in earthen and
fraile vessels, in the middest
of so many theeues, as there
are passions, and disordered
appetites in vs, as there are
Diuels in waire for vs, and as
there are stumbling stones, &amp;
occasions of sinne sette round
about vs. To procure this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
the most effectuall
helpes are these.</p>
                  <p>First, to thinke how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
we should be to doe all
thinges wel, if this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t day
were the last that euer we
should liue in this worlde (as
peraduenture it may be) and
that at the end thereof, we
were to bee conuented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a most seuere and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
iudge, who according
to the deserts of that daies
actions, should passe the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6634:74"/>
of life or death vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that
God is in his owne substance,
power, and true presence, in
euery place, and seeth both
our outward and inward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
more then we our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and therfore let vs seeke
in euery thing so to behaue
our selues, that we feare
not to haue God a witnesse
and behoulder of all that
wee doe, thinke, or say, and
let vs aske him grace to doe
nothing vnworthy his sight.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must consider
the carlesnes of our life past,
remembring how often we
haue fought against God,
with his owne weapons, and
abused the force that he hath
afforded, in euery part of our
body and mind, &amp; therefore
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6634:75"/>
as S. Paul Warneth, <hi>as we haue
exhibited our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers to serue
vncleanes and iniquity, to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:
So now let vs exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
our members to serue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
vnto sanctification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to procure this
attention, it is good oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
in the day when we are
about our ordinarie actions,
to vse some shorte praiers or
some one verse of a Psalme,
or any other shorte petition
of Gods grace, aide, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance:
for these short pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
are fewell of deuotion,
causes of attention, foode of
the soule, preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
temptations, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
helpes to attaine anie
vertues: therefore it is good
to vse them in lieu of sighes,
&amp; in the beginning of euerie
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6634:75"/>
chiefe action, directing therin
our intention and action, to
Gods glory and seruice, and
our good.</p>

may preuaile.</p>
                  <p>First, to consider by who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
instinct and motion I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to take speciall care
of my soule, and I shall find
that being a thing contrary
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6634:76"/>
to the inclination of flesh &amp;
bloud, and aboue the reach
of nature, to resolue vpon so
painfull and wary a course,
in hope of a reward and ioy
that faith doth promise, that

                  <p>Secondly, the ende of this

                     </gap>ion of mine owne

vpon these meanes, I was in

a state free from passion, and
as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vseth he to alter our

mindes but only from euil to
good, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good to better:
therefore vnles I meane to
yeeld wittingly vnto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
and to follow mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
counsaile vnto mine
owne perdition, I must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer
vnto the end: For with
what pretext soeuer the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
seeketh to couer his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sure it is, that his drifte
is, to drawe me from God
and goodnesse, and to damne
my soule for how can he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any thing to my good,
that beareth me such a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
malice, that hee careth
not to encrease his owne
paine, so that he may worke
me any spiritual, yea or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
harme?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I must print that
saying of Christ in my mind,
<hi>He that perseuereth vnto the

end shalbe saued.</hi> For not he
that beginneth, nor he that
continueth for a moneth, or

the very end of his life, shall
be saued W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erfore the same
cause that mooued me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne,
ought also to mooue
me to continue, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and crowne of my good
resolution be not cut off by
any want of perseuerance.
Let not the cries of mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
moue me: let me
with S. Paul say, <hi>the world
is crucified to me, and I to the
world:</hi> and with Dauid, <hi>it is
good for me to cleaue vnto
God.</hi> Finally let me imitat the
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Christ that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cross vnto death
for my sake, though ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6634:78"/>
vpon to come downe.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, I must consider that
in what state soeuer of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
or merit of damnation, I
begin the next life, I must &amp;
shall vndoubtedly perseuere
in it, according to the word
of Salomon; <hi>whersoeuer the

south or north, that is,

both the paine of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth

of the other after it is once
begunne (for it may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

of purgatory,) is also
euerlasting.</p>
                  <p>If therefore I will perseuer
in heauen, let me perseuer in

perseuer in pursuing vanities
&amp; following the world, yea
and that with most seruile

not without many bodily,

much more ought a true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant

He may be a father to

True it is, that a theefe may

But well saieth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,
that though it be
possible, yet is it scarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
that his death should
find fauour, whose whole
life hath earned wrath: and
that his repentance should
be accepted, that more for
feare of heil, and loue of him
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:6634:105"/>
selfe, then for loue of God
or lothsomnes of sinn, crieth
for mercy. Wherefore good
Sir, make no longer delaies,
but being so neere the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp of your mortal hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
take time before extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to satisfie Gods Iustice.
Though you suffered the
bud to the blasted, and the
flower to fade: though you
permitted the fruit to perish,
and the leaues to drie vp: yea
though you let the boughes
wither, and the body of your
tree growe to decaie, yet
alas keepe life in the roote,
for feare least the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
fuell for hell fire. For
surely where soeuer the tree
falleth, there shall it be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be to south or north,
heauen or hell: and such sap
as it bringeth, such fruite
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:6634:106"/>
shal it euer beare. Death hath
already filed from you, the
better part of your naturall
fores, and hath left you now
to the lees and remissailes of
your wearish &amp; dying daies:
the remainder whereof, as it
cannot be long, so doth it
warne you speedilie to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
your former losses. For
what is age but the calendes
of death? &amp; what importeth
your present weaknes, but an
earnest of your aproaching
dissolution? You are now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathed
in your finall voiage,
and not far of from the stint
and period of your course: &amp;
therfore be not dispurueied
of such appartenances as are
behoofull in so perplexed &amp;
perillous a iorney. Death in
it selfe is very fearefull, but
much more terrible in regard
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6634:106"/>
of the iudgement that it so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth

burdened with the heauy

and pricke of a frestred cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience:
If you felt the cramp

And is our soule so vaine a

in the tragedy of his passion
so bloodily inflicted, and so
patiently accepted, hee made
his body as a cloud, to resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

bloud, and suffered the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
veines of his hart to be
launced, to giue full issue to

Or if Christ did

when it pleased him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme

which is in it self so gracious

should by sinne be fashioned

Disblame me good sir,

to raise it from the lapse, and
to fortifie it from recidiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
no number of helpes
can be more than needfull,
nor any perswasions more
vehement then necessary.
