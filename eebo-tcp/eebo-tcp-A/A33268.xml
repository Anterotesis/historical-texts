            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF THE
Siege of London-Derry
<hi>A Falſe Libel,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AND indeed is it come out at laſt? Have the zealous Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-men
at length beaten it into ſome ſhape? <hi>Is this the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Journal of the Siege, which by the unanimous Verdict of
the Club,</hi> was <hi>Voted</hi> to be <hi>Publiſhed</hi> in the <hi>Mock-Apology, for the
Failures in Mr.</hi> Walkers <hi>Narrative?</hi> Or, is it a Comment
on Mr. <hi>Boys</hi>'s <hi>Vindication of Mr.</hi> Osborn? In which he pretending Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and a Calmneſs of Spirit, with ſly Inſinuations, detracts from
the Credit of Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and leſſens his Reputation, while he commends
his Care and Fidelity, in over-ſeeing the Stores, and diſtributing the
Proviſions of <hi>Derry,</hi> and being a notable Marks Man, at one ſhot, he
knocks down the ambitious Governour, and the credulous Gentleman,
who writ the Obſervations on the Narrative.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſo, when Dr. <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Peter Mamby</hi> were picqueering, he took
up a Flaile, and threſht them both; and while the Dr. was engaged
in a Duel, with a pernicious Apoſtate from the Proteſtant Religion,
he came behind his back, and ſtab'd him, only becauſe he incidentally
reflected on that Perſwaſion, of which Mr. <hi>Boys</hi> is ambitious to be thought
the celebrated Champion; with the ſame dexterity he manageth the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> that by the Priviledge of that Opportunity, he
may with ingenious Sarcaſms, diſparage Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and vilify his <hi>Friend;</hi>
but if he has no better luck at his Lectures, than he has at writing of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces,</hi>
(for I am perſwaded there was no other part aſſign'd to him in
Mr. <hi>Mackenzyes Farce,</hi> but to ſpeak the <hi>Prologue)</hi> he will have juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to wiſh he had been better inform'd, and not ſuffered his Zeal to
tranſport him beyond the Limits of Truth.</p>
            <p>As for the malicious and ſatyrical Pamphlet, which paſſeth under the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57861:3"/>
Name of Mr. <hi>John Mackenzy,</hi> (but at beſt, can be but a Tranſlation,
ſince he is not capable of writing ſo many Leaves in true and proper
Engliſh) though it pretend to be a true and exact <hi>Diary of the Siege;</hi> it is
really intended for an <hi>Invective againſt</hi> Dr. <hi>Walker.</hi> It would fain be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an impartial Narrative of the particular Actions of thoſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Men, who defended the Place, but it inſenſibly degenerates into a
palpable partiality, and an ungenerous deſign, to magnify a Party, and
exclude the reſt; it is a long-winded Paraphraſe upon a ſhort Text, and
the whole Subſtance of the Book may be reſolved into two Lines, <hi>viz. All
the brave and glorions Actions in that Siege, were performed by the</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
<hi>and Collonel </hi>Murray<hi>at the Head of them; all inglorions Actions
and treacherous Attempts, are to be imputed to the other part of the Garriſon,
and principally to Dr.</hi> Walker.</p>
            <p>I do not intend to ſet out an <hi>Anti-Narrative,</hi> or to trouble my ſelf with
a Confutation of many paſſages in that ſcurrilous Account, wherein the
<hi>Chaplain</hi> takes upon him, the place of a <hi>Field Officer,</hi> and recites the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Proceedings of particular Men in the Management of their Sallies,
directly contrary to what has been related by thoſe very perſons who
were ingaged in them. I ſhall only apply my ſelf to demonſtrate to the
World, what a dangerous Spirit of Lying is in the Mouth of this ſmall
<hi>Prophet,</hi> and how this <hi>Chaplain</hi> in <hi>Quirpo,</hi> does piouſly obtrude upon us
ſuch things, as are evidently and inexcuſably falſe, in point of Fact.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, according to due Method, begin with the <hi>Preface,</hi> and take the
Liberty, under the Protection of Innocence and Truth, poſitively to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the moſt material Points in it, howſoever it be uſhered in, under
a bold Aſſeveration, with a braſſy Impudence: The Penner of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
perſonating Mr. <hi>Mackenzy,</hi> will have the poor Man to ſay, <hi>I have
offered this Part of the Narrative to be reviewed by ſuch of the Officers of</hi>
Derry, <hi>as are now in Town, ſeveral of whom,</hi> as, <hi>Collonel</hi> Crofton, <hi>Collonel</hi>
Murray, <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> Blair, <hi>Captain</hi> Alexander Sanderſon, <hi>&amp;c.
having heard it read,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>freely profeſſed their Aſſent to it:</hi> I admire that
men who pretend to Integrity and ſtrictneſs of Life, can preſume thus
groſly to prevaricate.</p>
            <p>The Word <hi>Such</hi> is commonly uſed by way of <hi>Exception,</hi> but in this
place it muſt be meant by way of <hi>Comprehenſion, Such</hi> of the Officers as
are now in Town, <hi>i. e. the Officers now in Town.</hi> I have ſpoke with them
all but five at moſt, and am fully ſatisfied, that that part of the Preface is a
ſtudyed and deliberate Lye; for as to the four Perſons who are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
named, two of them did ſolemnly aver in my hearing, and in the
hearing of many Credible Perſons, that they did not hear that part of the
Narrative wholly read, and what was read, they did not approve of; and
a third hath ingenuouſly certified under his hand, as follows, and one of
the three has deſcended to Particulars.</p>

            <p>But good Mr. <hi>Mackenzy,</hi> or whoſoever elſe was ſo courteous to Write
that elaborate Preface, did you really <hi>find it neceſſary</hi> to expoſe
Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> at ſuch a rate, by <hi>taking notice of the Articles againſt him?</hi> Did
you find it requiſite ſo bluntly to ſcorn and ridicule him to repreſent
him as a <hi>Jack-a-lent,</hi> a <hi>Sancho Pancha,</hi> or a fabulous <hi>Hero?</hi> This is rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the abſtract, this is a Language that deſerves a more ſevere repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
than the laſh of a Pen.</p>
            <p>As for this latter Part, wherein you ſo Magiſterially degrade him from
his Station of <hi>Governour,</hi> and ſo ſpitefully detract from his Fame and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
I ſhall preſently confront you with the concurrent Teſtimonies of
many of the Officers of the Garriſon, acknowledging and owning him to
be Governour from the very beginning of the Siege, as well as atteſting his
ſingular Prudence and Circumſpection in the management of the Proviſions
and Stores.</p>
            <p>For the other part of the Libel which impeacheth him of <hi>Treachery,</hi> and
aſperſeth him with a <hi>Train</hi> of <hi>Articles,</hi> which never were exhibited but in
Mr. <hi>Mackenzy's</hi> defamatory Narrative, it is a matter of too great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to be anſwered, only with a bare denyal, it toucheth to the quick,
and it will concern Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> to labour in the Juſtification of himſelf,
and I am fully perſwaded that Mr. <hi>Mackenzy</hi> and his Accomplices will
find to their coſt, that tho' Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> do not arrogate to himſelf the
Title of a <hi>Hero,</hi> yet he will not be found ſo tame and inſenſible an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
to ſuffer himſelf to lie under ſuch intollerable Calumnies, but will
uſe all legal means to obtain a Reparation, and a competent Recompence
for the exorbitant damages he ſuſtains by a ſcandal ſo highly injurious.</p>
            <p>I ſay, that tho' Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> do not arrogate to himſelf the Title of an
<hi>Hero,</hi> yet I can tell who they are that would have made him one, when
they adviſed him to enter the City of <hi>London</hi> publickly, that ſo he
might be Huzza'd into Town like a Champion indeed; which he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
declined, ordering the Coach-man to drive him to his Lodgings
by all the private ways he could, which accordingly he did, by going out
of the uſual Road, and ſo diſappointed the expectation of many; for the
Truth of which, I appeal to that worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>
Knight, of the Shire of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in whoſe Coach he was conveyed into Town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57861:4"/>
I can tell further who that Noble Lord was (for I was preſent) who
next Morning after the Dr's coming to <hi>London,</hi> would have made him
a <hi>Hero</hi> indeed, and of his own party, by adviſing him to wait on His
MAJESTY in a Souldiers Habit, and as became the Governour of
<hi>London-derry;</hi> but the Dr. begg'd his Pardon, and quickly crept into the
Black-Coat, which diſappointment has occaſioned all this cry; and ever
ſince, that party have proclaimed open Hoſtility againſt him, and are
not to be reconciled upon any other Terms, than a compliance with
their extravagant Humours, and verifying what they writ from <hi>Scotland</hi> to
their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> upon the Dr's firſt Arrival there from <hi>Derry,</hi> that
Governour <hi>Walker</hi> had laid aſide both his Gown, and his Principles of the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> this was inſerted as well in publick as private Letters.</p>
            <p>I muſt retreat again to the Preface, for there the Venom lies. In the body
of the Narrative; I find no poſitive aſſertion, that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> was not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>London-derry,</hi> he ſeems to be paſt over in ſilence, and we are
to believe him not to have been ſo from the negative Authority of the
Narrator; for ſo <hi>page</hi> 30<hi>th.</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Council met for Electing of a
Governor,</hi> he tells us what Perſons were <hi>Nominated, and Major</hi> Baker <hi>had
the Majority of Votes, and was choſen their Governour,</hi> and this, according to
his Journal, was on the 19<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> beſides a brief inſinuation, <hi>page</hi> 62.
that he was not <hi>Governour, tho' he was wont to crowd in his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhall produce a Certificate under the Hands of Seventeen Officers
actually in ſervice in <hi>London-derry,</hi> during the whole Siege, and now in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
who in all reaſon may be preſumed to know who was the <hi>Governour</hi> of
that Garriſon, wherein they ſo Frankly Adventured their Lives, as well as

<hi>Blayr,</hi> and Captain <hi>Alexander Sanderſon</hi> are two of the four perſons,
who are ſo confidently mentioned in that Religious <hi>Preface,</hi> to have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profeſt their aſſent to the Narrative; and being well known to be
Men of approved Honeſty and Integrity, it can be look't upon as no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Nay, what is very fit to be taken notice of, I can ſhew a Certificate in
favour of Coll. <hi>Hamil,</hi> ſubſcribed by 16. Officers in <hi>London-Derry,</hi> whereof
5. are Collonels, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> 1689. wherein they teſtifie, that the
ſaid <hi>Hamil</hi> was made a Collonel of Foot, by Collonel <hi>Henery Baker,</hi> and
<hi>Collonel</hi> George Walker <hi>then Governours of that City,</hi> and among them,
not only Collonel <hi>Crofton,</hi> and Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Blair,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Saunderſon,</hi> but even Collonel <hi>Adam Murray</hi> himſelf hath Subſcribed
his Name.</p>
            <p>There is no need to ſay any more on this occaſion, but becauſe in that
Libellous Narrative, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. one of the Articles againſt Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi>
is <hi>for ſelling or embezling the Stores,</hi> and that this ſuppoſed Article, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
an Order of Council, that Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> note, ſhould not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Keepers, till Signed by the <hi>Governor,</hi> or Major <hi>Adams,</hi> I ſhall
produce a Certificate under the very Hand of the Keeper of the Stores,
who in a very indifferent Mans Judgment, will be allowed to know, and
preſumed to ſpeak the truth.</p>

                        <p>THeſe are to certifie, that whereas in a late Pamphlet written by Mr.
<hi>J. Makenzy,</hi> intituled <hi>a Narrative of the Siege of</hi> London-Derry; It is
mentioned (amongſt other things) That Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> late Governour of the
ſaid City, did fell and embezle the Stores of the ſaid Garriſon, and that
the ſaid Dr. was ſo inconſiderable there, that his note was not accepted
by the Store-Keepers of Proviſions for delivery of any out, unleſs the
ſame was firſt ſigned by the Governor and Major <hi>Adams,</hi> thereby inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that the ſaid Dr. was not Governour of the ſaid City: I do hereby
declare, that the ſaid Dr. neither did or could fell or embezle any of the
Stores, the ſame being in the Cuſtody of the Store Keepers, and never
delivered out to any, but for the neceſſary uſe of the Garriſon, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Governours; and I do further declare, that I was made
Store Keeper of the Proviſions at the beginning of the Siege, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſo to the end. And did from time to time deliver out Proviſions
upon the ſaid Dr. <hi>Walkers</hi> Order as Governour, in which Station he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in great eſteem among us, until the ſaid City was relieved by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Kirk,</hi> and I never knew his Orders diſputed (as in the ſaid
Pamphlet is expreſſed,) during the whole time of the Siege, and I do
look upon the ſaid Pamphlet, as to what relates to the ſaid Dr. to be not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57861:7"/>
only falſe, but Scandalous and Malicious: And laſtly, I do declare that
ſome perſons (concerned in putting out this Pamphlet, as I preſume)
ſince I came to <hi>London,</hi> did come to me, and would have drawn me
by great promiſes to have beſpattered and abuſed the Reputation of
the ſaid Dr. Witneſs my Hand the 25<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>April.</hi> 1690.</p>

            <p>And now do not your ears tingle? are not your faces covered with a
bluſh, who have Plotted, Caballed, and contrived ſuch a Scandalous
Libel, and a more calumniating Preface? and now to hear that ſome of
you have been tampering to pervert truth, and to add Subornation to
bearing falſe Witneſs?</p>
            <p>To uſe the words of the Narrative for once, <hi>I ſhou'd not take notice of ſo
trivial a thing as Mr.</hi> Walkers <hi>Signing firſt;</hi> but that it is improved into
an <hi>Argument of his forward Temper,</hi> to croud in his Name: And this is
inſtanced in the Caſe of <hi>Robert Lowther, pag.</hi> 62. I cannot tell whether
he crowded in his Name above <hi>Mitchelbourn,</hi> or whether <hi>Mitchelbourn</hi> in
Modeſty left room for him to write over his Name: But this I know, that
<hi>Robert Louther</hi> is one of thoſe who have atteſted Dr. <hi>Walkers</hi> being <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
and ſince Collonel <hi>Baker</hi> dyed, in <hi>June,</hi> I cannot in my ſmall reaſon
apprehend, what ſhould move Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> to expunge the mention of
<hi>Baker being Governour</hi> in <hi>November</hi> following.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid enough to ſatisfie all manner of perſons, but ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
never to be ſatisfyed, that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> was from firſt to laſt one of
the <hi>Governours of</hi> London-Derry, and principal <hi>Overſeer of the Stores and
Magazines:</hi> by the before mentioned Certificate and Letters, it evidently
appears, that he was not a Nominal or Titular Governour, but an Active
and Succeſsful manager of his Truſt; and therefore it can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
wondred at, that Men who profeſs the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> who
pretend Meekneſs and Moderation, who paſs as Teachers of Flocks (as
the Writer of the Preface, and the owner of the Narrative) ſhou'd with
ſo much Bitterneſs, Malice and Scorn, not only taunt and ſatyrize at
random, and by Conjectures, upon a Proteſtant, a Clergy-man and a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of a good Family in <hi>York-Shire;</hi> who cannot be denyed to have
been an Actor and Sufferer in that memorable Siege, but by looſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Suggeſtions, by falſe Aſſeverations, and down-right untruths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade
him from his Station, eclipſe his Reputation, and unchriſtianly
grudge him common Right and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And now if any Man deſire to be farther ſatisfyed in the Reality and
Truth of the Certificates, Teſtimonials, and Letters before mentioned
and Tranſcribed, he may be pleaſed to repair to <hi>Joſeph Wilkinſon</hi> Clerk,
at his Lodging at the Sign of the <hi>Harp</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls-Church-yard,</hi> where
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57861:7"/>
he may view the reſpective Originals, which will ſufficiently vouch for
the truth of what has bin ſaid.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid, was purely deſigned to undeceive ordinary perſons,
and credulous people, who are often impoſed on, by incoherent Cant,
Antick geſtures, a whining tone, and Diſtorted face: As for men of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Judgments, and of the beſt Quality in the Kingdom, I am very well
aſſured, they never believed Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> to be an Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>Can any one of Senſe imagine, that the King and Queens Majeſties
are ſuch eaſie perſons, as to give Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> thanks for his good Service,
and reward him ſo highly as they have done, if he were a Cheat?</p>
            <p>Nay, would the King have again imployed him, as now he has done
within theſe few weeks, in ſending him to <hi>Ireland,</hi> by his poſitive Orders,
to Negotiate publick Affairs? at which happy Juncture, very Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
appears on the Stage, Mr. <hi>John Mackenzy</hi>'s new Farce, when the
Gentleman was not in Town to anſwer for himſelf.</p>
            <p>No, No, never believe it, the King did not ſend him, he is run away,
and abſconds for ſhame, or for fear of a Halter, or the Pillory; which
he, (or ſome body elſe) deſerves.</p>
            <p>But what think you of the Lords of the Privy Council, who gave
him Solemn thanks for his excellent Management of Affairs, as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>London-Derry?</hi> were they likewiſe impoſed on? I never yet heard
that they were called or reputed weak Men.</p>
            <p>But Oh! This Villain <hi>Walker,</hi> he trickt the Honourable Houſe of
Commons, who in a full Aſſembly, returned him thanks by their Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as Governour! will not after Ages ſay, There was not one Wiſe Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them to detect the Fraud?</p>
            <p>But how came the City of <hi>London</hi> to be caught in the Nooſe, how
came they to be thus bubled? Lord-Mayor, Sheriffs, Society of the
Plantation in the County of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> all Congratulate his Arrival,
and Treat him afterwards as Governour of <hi>Derry.</hi>

            <p>AFter the conveighing of theſe Papers to the Preſs, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Certificate relating to that worthy Gentleman, Captain
<hi>James Hamilton,</hi> came to my Hands, a Perſon who thrô
the ſole ſeries of his Life, has manifeſted his Zeal to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Intereſt, and to whoſe excellent Management of Affairs that
importaut place of <hi>London-derry</hi> owes its preſervation in a great
Meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Mackenzy</hi>'s Sincerity and impartial way of handling the
Subject he treats of is very obvious, by his ſetting forth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Paſſage in <hi>its true and native</hi> light; and as he
relates nothing but <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> ſo what he ſays of them
he proves by as <hi>plain Demonſtration</hi> as that is capable of,
and better cannot reaſonably be expected.</q> Thus far Mr. <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzy</hi>
ſpeaks for himſelf in his Preface; and after his having
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57861:9"/>
ſo ſubſtantially barricado'd the Credit of his Book, it ſeems
not to be attacqu'd with any reaſonable Proſpect of Succeſs;
yet this boldly aſſerted impregnable Fortreſs hath an unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Breach, and to which he himſelf is a Guide in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex:</hi>
I mean the Papers referr'd to in his Narrative. It is
true, moſt Readers that peruſe ſuch Pamphlets as his, will
not trouble themſelves with running over ſo long (and little
diverting) a Poſtſcript, as thoſe Papers make, but will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the Abſtract he gives of them, in the ſeries of
his Relation; not thinking it poſſible, a man who profeſſes
himſelf the Champion of <hi>injur'd Truth,</hi> can have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to defie the World to Anſwer what he Writes, and
at the ſame time to refer the Reader to Papers at the end
of his Book that detect his Malice, and confute him of wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(even to Forgery) ſome authentick Teſtimonies to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
or rather to ſupport his ſlanderous Inſinuations; yet
after this indirect manner he hath beſpatter'd Capt. <hi>James
Hamilton,</hi> a Gentleman who in the critical Juncture of the
late Happy Revolution, manifeſted his Zeal to the Proteſtant
Intereſt, by his early and indefatigable Solicitations to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
ſent to the Proteſtants then in Arms in the North of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
And by his working through
the many<note n="*" place="margin">It would have been too tedious to have inſerted here what thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and difficultys were Capt. <hi>Hamilton</hi> met with, the Curious are therefore referr'd to what was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Writing relating thereto, from Capt. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s own mouth, and that before a Committee of the laſt Houſe of Commons, where Capt. <hi>Hamilton</hi> gave an Account of where he was from day to day, and how he employed himſelf towards the diſchargeing himſelf of the truſt repos'd in him, from the very day he received his Inſtructions, to the day of his Arrival with his Charge at <hi>London-derry.</hi>
               </note> Obſtructions and
Difficulties he met with from
ſeveral, who in the then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſlighted the Orders he
obtained for his Diſpatch, as
to that ſupply of Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
and Money, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
entruſted him with to
that effect, according to the
Purport of the Inſtructions
given him the ſaid <hi>James
Hamilton,</hi> a Copy whereof is
inſerted in the 54<hi>th.</hi> Page of
Mr. <hi>Mackenzy</hi>'s Narrative; and
how little the ſaid Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57861:9"/>
agree in the very eſſential Point, with what he ſays they
were in his 19<hi>th</hi> Page, is evident to whoſoever will take the
trouble of comparing them.

<q>The Inſtructions which Capt.
<hi>Hamilton</hi> had, <hi>(Page</hi> the 19<hi>th.</hi> he tells you) were to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Mayor and all other Officers, Civil and Military,
on Board him, and there before them all to give the Oaths
of Fidelity to Coll. <hi>Lundy,</hi> before he ſhould give him any
Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> But <hi>Page</hi> 54. you will really find that Capt.
<hi>Hamilton</hi> was only impower'd to ſummon the Mayor or chief
Civil Magiſtrate to be a Witneſs to his Adminiſtring the
ſaid Oaths to Coll. <hi>Lundy,</hi> without ſo much as mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Officers Civil and Military. This howſoever may ſeem
but a trivial Variation, if the Conſequences are not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which are deducted from thence with an Innuendo, but
Mr. <hi>Mackenzy</hi> did not Prevaricate here to no purpoſe; for
he proceeds <hi>Page</hi> the 19<hi>th.</hi> in theſe words; <q>But inſtead
thereof (that is of Swearing Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> before all Officers
Military and Civil) moſt of the Gentlemen on Board were
deſired to withdraw, on pretence of private Buſineſs; ſo
that if <hi>Lundy</hi> was Sworn, it was very privately.</q> Now if
Capt. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Inſtructions had been to Swear Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi>
before them all, and he had notwithſtanding on pretence of
private Buſineſs deſired them to withdraw, he had certainly
deſerved to be called to an Account, and ſeverely Puniſhed
for ſo doing; but it is apparent, his Inſtructions were not
ſuch: And though it is purpoſely left as dubious, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the Company to withdraw, yet it is notorious, Capt.
<hi>Hamilton,</hi> whom the King was pleaſed to Intruſt, muſt have
been a Mad-man, if after his having ſo publickly devoted
himſelf to King <hi>William</hi>'s Service, he ſhould have been ſo
whimſically ſcrupulous, as to be fond of Swearing Coll. <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
in private, (if at all) as is inſinuated; but that Capt.
<hi>Hamilton</hi> did Adminiſter the ſaid Oaths of Fidelity to Coll.
<hi>Lundy is</hi> Teſtified by the following Certificate, which is At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by two Gentlemen of Good Eſtates in the North of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and of unqueſtionable Reputation; and they are the
only Perſons now in <hi>London</hi> that were preſent when Coll.
<hi>Lundy</hi> was Sworn.</p>

            <p>But it may be Objected, why was not the Mayor or chief
Civil Magiſtate preſent? The Reaſon was, becauſe the ſaid
Mayor was one <hi>Cormock Oneal,</hi> who was then actually a
Collonel in the late King's <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, and one of his Privy
Council, and whoſe Deputation to Mr. <hi>Buchanan,</hi> a ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perſon, was conſequently alſo void, and indeed the entire
Management of all Affairs was by Election devolv'd to Coll.
<hi>Lundy;</hi> ſo that if Capt. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> without conſidering the
Intention of what he was ſent about, had followed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Inſtructions to a Tittle in the particular Objected;
he muſt according to a Clauſe in them (notwithſtanding the
Enemy happened to be upon (as then) an uninterrupted
March to <hi>London-derry)</hi> have return'd to <hi>England</hi> with the
deſign'd Relief he brought? which if he had done, I do not
know how well it would have pleas'd this Caviller. But I
appeal to Men of Reaſon, if ſince Capt. <hi>Hamilton</hi> was under
an impoſſibility of Swearing Coll. <hi>Lundy,</hi> as he was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Inſtructions, before the Mayor or chief Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
he did not anſwer the drift of them in Adminiſtring
the Oaths of Fidelity to Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> before Perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Subſtance, and conſiderable Intereſt in that Country;
and if it was not the beſt expedient could be found in that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57861:10"/>
juncture, which would admit of no delay; to enable Capt.
<hi>Hamilton</hi> to deliver up his Truſt, which was abſolutely neceſſary
ſhould be done, <hi>London-derry</hi> not being able, without the
ſuccour Capt. <hi>Hamilton</hi> brought, to make the leaſt Defence.
Now it is not probable that Mr. <hi>Mackenzy</hi> could be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of all this; for he who ſearched ſo Critically after all
could be turn'd to his Ends, muſt needs have heard that
what hath been here recited relating to Capt. <hi>James Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Swearing of Coll. <hi>Lundy,</hi> and acquitting himſelf of his
Commiſſion, was made appear before a Committee of the
laſt Houſe of Commons; and that ſo clearly, that ſeveral
of the Members, were pleaſed thereupon to expreſs in oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Terms, the ſence they had of Capt. <hi>James Hamilton</hi>'s
Behaviour.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſubjoyn the following Letter from a worthy

                        <p>I Return your Papers, in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Mackenzy,</hi> and am ſorry there is
as you ſay, a neceſſity of publiſhing them. It is ſtrange the World ſhould be
ſo impos'd upon, to believe Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> Governour of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> if he
were not, or that any ſhould now ſo ſoon deny it, if he were; but 'tis more
ſtrange, that they who allow'd and aſſerted it, and then celebrated him as the
Hero of the Age, ſhould now ſo ſoon diſparage him as the greateſt Villain and
Impoſtor; but I remember, it was then alſo reported, with as much confidence,
that he was a Diſſenting Miniſter; but the Scene is chang'd, they that would
have him once what he never was, will not allow him to be what they affirmed
him; but they that were then miſtaken in one of his Characters, may now be
ſo in what they ſay of his other; and that they are ſo, theſe Certificates
will poſſibly prove ſo full a Conviction, that we may no more hear any thing
upon this Subject; but if Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſhould reply, it will be a Juſtice to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
to let him have the laſt word. The Action was great, and allows every
Inſtrument in it a proportion of the Glory, without arrogating it entirely to any
Party, if not ſo great as to deprive them all of any; for the more it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57861:11"/>
the more does a miraculous Providence ſhine in it. It ſeems, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

were not ſo united (even in their danger) as I thought they were; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>
weakly argued, that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> was not Governour, becauſe ſome would have
had the Government out of his hands: Every diſcontented Party in a Kingdom
does not unthrone the King, nor every Mutiny in a Garriſon deprive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of his Authority, and all Attempts of that kind rather add to them
derogate from the Prudence and Steddineſs of his Conduct: And Dr. <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
maintain'd his Authority againſt the Wills of ſome, even for theirs, as well
as the common good of all. But as they will not allow him ever to have been
more than Governour, or rather Imbezeller of the Stores, ſo neither will they
his being Author of his Narrative of the Siege, which ſome would perſwade
the World was written by the A. B. of <hi>T.</hi> to whom they are very kind, in making
the thing paſs for a Lye, and him for the Author of it. I have often heard
him ſay, he could ſafely be Depos'd be never read half of it before it was
Printed, nor the whole ſince, nor ever alter'd one word of what he read, and
that if he had no other reaſon, their miſtake in this would make him doubt
what they ſay of Dr. <hi>W.</hi> in other points.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sir,</hi> I have nothing to add, but my Prayers, that God would give all of us
meek and humble Hearts, and rebuke that ſpirit of bitterneſs and evil ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which expoſes us to the ſcorn of our common Adverſary, and the contempt
