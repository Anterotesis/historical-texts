         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat formerly was in <hi>ſingle Arrows,</hi> is here bound in a Sheaf, I conceive it good that by ſuch conjunction, they might mutually reflect light one on another. Poſterity will probably be pleaſed to look back on ſuch paſſages. Some love to ſee the little coats they then did wear when children. Alas, theſe all were the Eſſayes in the <hi>Infancy</hi> of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, now grown a ſtripling, God ſend it to be a Man! yet they differ rather in <hi>Sound</hi> than in <hi>Senſe,</hi> variouſly expreſſing the ſame matter. So <hi>many men,</hi> and <hi>but one minde,</hi> is admirable; prompted certainly by the Spirit of unity inditing them. Factious Petitions, gave the beginning, and <hi>Loyal Declarations</hi> muſt give the end to our
<pb facs="tcp:119729:3"/>
Miſeries. But here is the difference, the firſt were made by the <hi>Scum,</hi> theſe by the <hi>Cream</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Aeneas</hi> did beg the Boon of the <hi>Sybil,</hi> that ſhe would not write her Oracles (according to her uſual courſe) in leaves of Trees blown away with every wind.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Declarations</hi> formerly were printed in <hi>Leaves</hi> or <hi>ſingle Papers,</hi> which are ſoon loſt, not to ſay, The beſt of Papers ſo printed, are oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the <hi>worſt of uſes.</hi> This is a way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and to propagate them. I remember the Verſe of the Poet,</p>

            <p>Then needs they muſt be beſt, all put together. What (as ſingle Stars) was good, muſt be beſt in a Conſtellation.</p>

We being members in the ſame pollitical Body, cannot but ſympathize with the reſt of our Brethren: and foraſmuch as our endeavours may contribute very much thereto, and the well or ill management of your talents in the diſcharge of your Truſts may now make theſe Nations happy, or elſe make them irrecoverably miſerable. We hold our ſelves obliged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God and our Countrey, both by the Laws of God and the Land, in the behalf of our ſelves, and all good and peaceable People in the Land, and the many thouſands that know not their right hand from their left; and in the behalf of the Children unborn, who in time to come may have cauſe to bleſſe or curſe the day of their birth for your ſakes, do make this humble Addreſſe to you, as the only means under God now left us to redreſſe theſe growing miſchiefs which make us and the three Nations in theſe times of our great trouble cry unto you (as thoſe of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did in the Apoſtles Viſion) <hi>Come and help us.</hi> And we beſeech you, our moſt grave and worthy <hi>Senators,</hi> as you tender the welfare of theſe bleeding Nations, to ſtand in

            <p>Secondly we eſteem and aſſert, as our undoubted birth-right, the Freedom and Priviledges of our Parliaments, as being the great Charter of the people of <hi>England,</hi> which we account equally dear with our lives; in the enjoyment of which we yet

hope, under God, to ſee a happy and laſting ſettlement both in Church and Scate. Therefore we moſt humbly deſire, that a new Election may be made, or elſe that thoſe worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men choſen to ſerve as Members in the late free Parliament, may be reſtored to their priviledges, and ſit without diſturbance or force from the Army, that they may conſider in this evil time, what <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> ought to do, which (with ſubmiſſion to your grave judgements) we humbly conceive to be the moſt probable means under God to eſtabliſh the true Proteſtant Religion, reform the Laws, ſecure our Liberties and preſerve our lives and outward concernments, to promote Learning end encourage Vertue, whereby peace with our neighbour Nations may be renewed and eſtabliſhed, the Army ſatisfied, their Arrears paid, and Trading reſtored. In all which, moſt grave and worthy <hi>Senators,</hi> your own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as well as ours) are ſo deeply engaged, that we perſwade our ſelves you will be inſtumental to further our deſires, by all peaceable and lawfull means, and we hope it will put an end to our Diviſions, which (if God in mercy prevent not) may ſoon break out into another civil War, and render us as a prey to a forreign enemy, For <hi>a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we leave it unto you our moſt grave and worthy Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, duly to conſider, if you part with theſe our great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Bleſſings, whether you will not diſcover a palpable breach of truſt, and leave your names for a reproach to the generations following, who will in the Ages to come riſe up and call you bleſſed, if you be carefull to preſerve them now, and convey them to Poſterity: And now we beſeech the Lord to ſtrengthen both your hearts and hands, and give you wiſdom from on high to direct you in all your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, as may be moſt for the honour of God, the peace of his Church throughout the world, and the ſettlement, ſafety and happineſſe of theſe poor Nations: And by his aſſiſtance we reſolve to ſtand by you and with you, to the utmoſt hazzard of our lives and all that is deare unto us, to promote the ſame.</p>

follow ſo leading Preſidents, not unſeaſonable to joyn their Votes with the general deſires of the whole Nation; to which end it was reſolved to preſent this following draught to the Common <hi>Burghmoote,</hi> and to deſire their concurrence therein. Thus in an orderly manner, without tumult or noiſe, without Arms in their hands or thoughts, or without Anger or Threats in their looks; divers Gentlemen, Miniſters and Citizens went to the Town-hall on <hi>Jan.</hi> 24. the Mayor, Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councel then ſitting, and preſented the Declaration at the door, deſiring that after a ſerious peruſal thereof, they would be pleaſed to joyn with them, in a buſineſs which they judged agreeable, not only to the ſenſe of that Court, but alſo of the whole County and Nation: But when it was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be put to the Vote, whether the paper ſhould be read or not; ſome of the Bench proteſted againſt it, although they knew nothing of its contents; and in concluſion (having a long time rather wrangled than debated) the Diſſenters (being but ſeven of twenty four) quitted the Court, not leaving e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a <hi>Burghmoote Quorum;</hi> whereupon, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (who though rudely treated, had quietly attended) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew <hi>Re infecta,</hi> and returned home with as little tumult as at firſt they came: Thus was there nothing done to ſurpriſe or diſturb the Court, nothing to raiſe a tumult, nothing to cauſe a ſecond Kentiſh Inſurrection, as our Adverſaries give it out: No, the deſign was not Arms, but Peace; not tumult, but ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not to ſurprize and diſturb the Court, but to deſire an amiable correſpondence with the ſame, to the end that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Declaration might be made the more authentick by the formal intervention and aſſent in open Court, of the Magiſtracy of ſo conſiderable a Corporation; and that the Declarers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might not be thought to tread in any oblique Paths, or to proceed in a Clandeſtine manner: But being diſappointed (as you ſee), herein, it was thought fit to ſtrengthen and confirm our <hi>Declaration,</hi> and to make good the Title it bears, by private ſubſcriptions, as well through the whole County as this City; wherein we had, in three dayes time, proceeded ſo far, that many thouſands were then collected; whereupon, ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (from the ſlie inſinuations and falſe repreſentations of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119729:12"/>
our Averſaries) were ſecured in ſeveral priſons, to the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of well-begun, and well-meant undertaking; neither can the Gentlemen underſtand wherein they have offended, or how they ſhould merit impriſonment, ſince there was no order, nor prohibition to the contrary: Although they conceive, that had they proceeded therein, they had not trangreſſed any known Laws of the Land; it being the Subjects Birth-right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly to repreſent their grievances by way of Petition, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance or Declaration. Wherefore leſt (through our ſilence, and the preſent ſuppreſſion of our Declaration) the aſperſions of our Adverſaries might be thought deſervedly caſt upon us; we thought fit to publiſh the ſame, together with this Narrative, deeming that as we have done nothing herein worthy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeverity, ſo the impartial Reader will in his private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, abſolve us from all guilt or demerit. Neither ſhall we anſwer our Adverſaries by way of recrimination, nor (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we can by undoubted teſtimonies ſufficiently prove it) ſay, that the ſame men who now appear ſo zealous aſſertors of the Parliaments intereſts and proceedings, did as eagerly joyn with the Army, crying them up as much, with whom they would live and dye, as they decryed this preſent Power in their late interruption, as not conſiſting with the intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No, though this might ſerve to invalidate their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we ſhall enlarge no further, but refer to the Declaration it ſelf.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119729:31"/>
with the guilt of that force, and ſent to the then General of the Army for the reſtitution of thoſe excluded Members which was denied them, how many and manifold have been the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities under which theſe Nations have laboured, and do ſtil labour, is evident to all equal minded men. The godly Miniſters of the Goſpel deſpiſed: The Miniſtry it ſelf villified: Tythes, and other means of their maintenance (particularly in <hi>Ireland</hi>) taken from them, and miſ-applied; the Proteſtant Religion ſhaken, and almoſt overturned; Anabaptiſts, Quakers, and other Sectaries ſet up and countenanced; Hereſies and Schiſms increaſed; The fundamental Laws of the Land tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon, and an Arbitrary Government endeavoured to be introduced; The Civil Rights, Properties and Liberties of the people in their perſons and eſtates broken in pieces; Impoſitions and Taxes on the people without example laid and increaſed in an exceſſive manner and meaſure, whereby thouſands of Families have been ruined, and enforced to beg their bread; Manufacture at home diſcouraged, publick Trade and Commerce abroad interrupted; The Nations become deeply indebted, and generally impoveriſhed; the reformed Proteſtant Churches abroad expoſed to great danger, wanting the wonted ſupport of <hi>England,</hi> which (under God) was the Bulwark and chief ſtrength of the Proteſtant Religion throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and finally the Engliſh Nation (which was alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly) in ſo high honour and eſtimation at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as it was a bridle and terrour to their Enemies, and a countenance and ſupport to their Friends, and Allies, is now become (we tremble and grieve to have ſo juſt cauſe to ſpeak it) a ſcorn and derſion to all Nations round about us; and all this is brought to paſs to ſatisfie the Avarice, Ambition, Luſts, and fears of a few inconſiderable perſons of Anabaptiſtical and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fanatique ſpirits, who have made it their buſineſs to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſtill one trouble on the neck of another, ſo to imbroil and continue the Nations in Diviſion, War, and bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that ſober men might not have time or leiſure (with maturity of judgement or counſel) to look into the inwards of their deſigns or actings; And after we had beheld all this with bleeding hearts, and calling to minde that when in <hi>December</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:119729:31"/>
1648. the ſaid force was put upon the Parliament, the then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Members ſent ſundry times to the General to know why he impriſoned their Members, and deſired him to ſet them at liberty, which was not done; and we gathering from all this, that if the Houſe were once freed from the force of an Army, and they again reſtored to Freedome and Liberty of ſitting and and acting, they would then upon the firmer grounds (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their duties to God and their Country, and in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their high reſentment of that breach of priviledges of the Parliament, have taken into the Houſe thoſe excluded Members, and filled vacant places by due and orderly Elections of the People (and after ſo many years unhappy interruption unite again in a full and free Parliament, and there aſſert the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the people, which from the very beginning of the War of <hi>England</hi> have been not the leaſt ground of their conteſt with the late King, and ever ſince, and joyn their counſels and endeavours for reſtoring theſe Nations to peace and tranquillity.</p>
            <p>And thence it was, that on the 14. day of <hi>December</hi> 1659. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers of the Army here, on the behalf of themſelves, and thoſe under their Commands, by their joynt Declaration, declared and publiſhed their ſtedfaſt reſolutions to adhere to the Parliament in defence of its Priviledges, and the juſt Rights and Liberties of the people of theſe Nations as Men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; In which Declaration afterwards concurred the whole Army of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but now finding much contrary to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that when the Members of Parliament now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> were in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1659. (by an extraordinary providence) reſtored to their Freedome and Liberty of ſitting and acting as in Parliament; and that divers of thoſe formerly excluded Members of Parliament on the 27. of <hi>Decem.</hi> 1659. (as they had formerly done in <hi>May</hi> 1659.) offered themſelves to diſcharge their Truſts for the ſeveral Counties and places for which they were Elected, and formerly ſerved thoſe their Fellow-members aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> did not onely deny them admittance, but alſo voted and ordered the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all the excluded Members with this further addition, that none of them ſhould be choſen in future Elections to ſit in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119729:32"/>
this Parliament, whereby they have a more unnatural vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence taken away from above the one half of the people of <hi>England,</hi> their Repreſentatives in Parliament, and limited and abridged in a high degree the Liberty and freedome of the people in further Elections, which denial and order of theirs in a time when they were under no force, is ſo much the more ſtrange, in regard that in <hi>December</hi> 1648. when they were under a force, they transferred that guilt for themſelves to the Army, and pretended a willingneſs to re-admit thoſe Members if it were in their power, as is formerly mentioned.</p>
            <p>And whereas Lieut. Gen. <hi>Ludlow</hi> had placed in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſeveral Officers who are Anabaptiſts, and perſons of the like fanatique ſpirits, (many of whom had been very active in the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and actings of the factious part of the Army in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> even againſt thoſe Members of Parliament now ſitting at <hi>Weſtminster;</hi> of which Officers ſo placed by Lieut.

Gen. <hi>Ludlow</hi> ſtood juſtly deſervedly charged with High Treaſon, the ſaid Lieut. Gen. <hi>Ludlow</hi> himſelf, and ſome others of the like prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with him, were by a report from the Councel of State propoſed to be appointed to governe not onely the Army, but alſo the whole Nation of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the aſtoniſhment of the people and Army here, to the unſetling of thoſe perſons ſo well deſerving, to the hazard of the peace of the Nation and Army (and which is above all) to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering even of Religion it ſelfe. And here it is obſervable, that thoſe Members now ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of 23. of <hi>January</hi> 1659. ſince their reſtitution to their preſent liberty of ſitting) have publiſhed that extravagant Councels and actions, have engaged the Nations in a great debt and charge, which it ſeems neceſſitates their laying a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of charge on the Nations, and yet ſo indulgent they are to thoſe perſons, that in a high degree created that neceſſity of ſo unreaſonably charging the people, and whoſe eſtates might well bear a great part of that burden, as without ſo much as any ſuit made to them by thoſe Delinquents, they granted them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119729:32"/>
for their perſons and eſtates, whereby it ſeems the ſaid Members now ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> hold it fit, that thoſe who are of ſober ſpirits, and offended not the Parliament, ſhould out of their eſtates pay for thoſe extravagant mens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency, rather than the Delinquents themſelves. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſaid Lieut. Gen. <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and <hi>Miles Corbet</hi> Eſq. together with Col. <hi>John Jones,</hi> and Col. <hi>Mat. Tomlinſon,</hi> ſtand impeached from hence moſt juſtly of High Treaſon, and that charge againſt them, being known to the Houſe, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maing, yet they have admitted two of thoſe perſons, namely the ſaid Lieut Gen. <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and <hi>Miles Corbet</hi> actually to ſit in the ſaid Houſe.</p>
            <p>And now the greatneſs of thoſe miſeries which have befaln theſe three Nations in General, by ſuch late actings in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and thoſe heightned with many aggravations in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of them (too many and too long to be repeated) as it hath begotten in us, and in all good men in the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deep impreſſion of aſtoniſhment and horror, ſo it is evident, that if it be any longer continued, it will perpetually nouriſh diſhonour to God, grief to all god men, and (we doubt and fear) utter infamy and deſtruction to the three Nations.</p>
            <p>In contemplation whereof, and conſidering how God hath in his juſtice blaſted all attempts that ſince the year 1648. have been made for re-ſetling of theſe Nations in peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and that after all the trials and various changes of Government which we have in all that time with much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering and patience endured, there is no way viſible to us under Heaven whence deliverance may be probably wrought or expected, but from the care and wiſdome of a Free and full Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> which (by the experience of all former ages hath been found the beſt and only expedient for providing remedies to be applied to ſo great and general miſchiefs ariſing in Church or State. And conſidering alſo that the marks of the true Reformed Religion according to the Word of God, and of the fundamental Laws of the Land, and of our now dying Liberties and Freedome, are not yet ſo utterly razed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, but that ſome footſteps of them do yet remain, ſo as (by the wiſdome of a full and Free Parliament) they may be

again renewed and firmly re-eſtabliſhed; and conſidering like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that our hopes of having the ſaid excluded Members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and of new Elections to be made for vacant places, whereby there might be a full and free Parliament, as there was on <hi>Decem.</hi> 5. 1648. and the antient and long conteſted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people might be aſſerted, are much contrary to our expectations, and contrary to the fundamental Laws of the Land, and indeed contrary to all juſtice and become fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated; and conſidering further how unjuſt and unreaſonable a thing it is, that of above five hundred Members, whereof the Commons Houſe of Parliament uſually conſiſted, there were but four and forty or thereabouts, when that fatal Vote paſſed for the keeping out the aforeſaid excluded Members by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of a major part of the ſaid 44. perſons (not much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thoſe who voted then on the contrary ſide) which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to it ſelf the Supreme Authority, not onely of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo of the three Nations, without preſident or example of any former age, there being above two hundred and fifty which ſtand eleven years excluded, without ſo much as the leaſt offer of an Impeachment againſt them in all that time; which unexampled and unparallel'd aſſumption in thoſe men is not poſſible to continue but by the force of an Army poiſoned with Anabaptiſtical and corrupted principles, to the continual grief and unſupportable burden and charge of the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And beſides that act of the aforeſaid perſons chaſing away (for ſo it now appears) about two hundred and fifty Members, of above five hundred choſen by all the ſeveral parts of <hi>England,</hi> according to the known Laws of the Land, to repreſent the whole Nation in Parliament; and after the forcible excluſion of ſo many, that the four and forty perſons remaining (amongſt whom we believe there are ſome worthy Patriots who are not ſo fully concurring in the actings of the reſt of their number, as violently over-voted them, which is a further aggravation of the others guilt) ſhould dare to uſurp to themſelves as is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, contrary to all the Laws, the Supreme power not only of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> is a thing which none but Conquerors or Tyrants would attempt, and in

            <p>And laſtly conſidering, that as in all Ages, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſince the beginning of the late horrid Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> our Brethren in <hi>England</hi> have abundantly manifeſted a tender and compaſſionate ſenſe of the condition in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and were careful to relieve us in our loweſt eſtate, as bone of their bone, and fleſh of their fleſh; which we do, and ſhal ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with humble thankfulneſſe, and (as a debt which we well know to be due from us to them above all people in the world) ſhall be for ever as tender of their happineſſe and welfare, as of our own, which indeed is involved in theirs, and without whom <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot be happy. We therefore remaining conſtant in the reaſons of our ſaid Declaration of <hi>Dec.</hi> 14. 1659. for adhering to the Parliament in defence of its Priviledges, and the juſt Rights and Liberties of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; all which we ſee now are apparently more and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not admiſſion of the ſaid excluded Members, and by not filling the vacant Places, whereby the Houſe might be full; and being freed from force, might uninterrupted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Act according to their Judgements and Conſciences, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards re-ſetling the peace of theſe Nations, which otherwiſe in all humane probability can never be reſtored to Peace and Tranquillity.</p>
            <p>We do therefore declare for a full and free Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> conſiſting not only of thoſe that ſate on <hi>Oct.</hi> 11. 1659. but alſo of all ſuch of the Members of Parliament impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, excluded, or withdrawn in <hi>December</hi> 1648. as are yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, whom we deſire may be reſtored to the freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſitting, and acting according to the Truſt committed to them by the ſeveral Counties and places which did chuſe them, that ſo they may be no longer debarred from diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſaid Truſt, and that vacant places may be ſpeedily ſupplied by free and due Elections of the people, yet ſo as none of the perſons to be Admitted or Elected, be any of thoſe who have been in Arms, or otherwiſe aiding, abetting, or aſſiſting

               <item>2. <hi>Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Taxes:</hi> So that every hour the <hi>Burden</hi> groweth <hi>weightier,</hi> and the <hi>Back</hi> of our Nation weaker to ſupport it.</item>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:119729:36"/>2. 'Tis ſad to ſee, in Cloathing Countreys, what ſwarms there are of poor people, the true objects of Charity; if any were as <hi>able</hi> to <hi>give,</hi> as they worthy to receive <hi>relief:</hi> for they <hi>would</hi> work, and <hi>can</hi> work, yet <hi>cannot</hi> work, becauſe there are none to employ them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for the Sea (which is the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Port-Towns</hi>) it returneth ſmall benefit; for ſince <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was ours (more to the <hi>credit</hi> than <hi>benefit</hi> of our Nation) the fire of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robberies</hi> is removed out of the <hi>Chimney,</hi> and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the <hi>Houſe,</hi> not leſſe <hi>deſtructive,</hi> but more <hi>diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive:</hi> So that our Merchants could better guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt that <hi>Single Staple of Pirates,</hi> than many leſſer ones ſprung ſince every where, the cauſe why rich men will not (as poor cannot) adventure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our ſecond <hi>miſery</hi> is, increaſe, yea, <hi>ſuperfetation</hi> of Taxes, ſo long as ſo numerous an Army is maintained: For though ſome of their Souldiers will preach <hi>gratis</hi> (conſcientious to take nothing for that which they know is worth nothing) yet none will fight at ſo cheap a rate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some will ſay, that what the Souldier receiveth with one hand, he returneth with another, expending his pay in Victuals, Cloaths, &amp;c. whereby Coin, by <hi>circulation,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in our Country. This I deny; for ſome Grandees greatned by the Times, have made their Monies over in <hi>Banks</hi> beyond the Seas, which are put into <hi>MORTMAIN,</hi> or a <hi>Dead hand,</hi> whereby no profit accreweth to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Others having gotten the Eſtates of <hi>Lords,</hi> live after the rate <hi>Yoomen,</hi> whoſe diſcretion therein is to be commended, for proportioning their expences (for fear of <hi>afterclaps</hi>) rather according to their original, than preſent condition.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The increaſe of <hi>Taxes</hi> muſt inevitably cauſe the ruine of our Nation: For though ſtill there be wealthy men left
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119729:37"/>
(as they ſhew it in their <hi>cowardiſe,</hi> and fear to engage for the general good) yet they grow thinner every day whilſt ſuch as are left no root of their own, rather than they will <hi>wither</hi> will turn <hi>Suckers</hi> on the <hi>Stock</hi> of others. So that the greateſt happineſs rich men can promiſe to themſelves, is only to be <hi>laſt</hi> devoured, though the comfort of the lateneſs will not countervail the ſadneſs for the certainty of their deſtruction. Indeed it is miraculous that our Nation hath ſubſiſted ſo long, and few there are that would believe that the whole <hi>Candle</hi> of our Engliſh wealth could laſt ſo long, as we have beheld it <hi>burning</hi> in the <hi>Socket,</hi> but now giving the laſt blaze, if God be not merciful, and men diſcreet to prevent it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Paſs we from the ſad Malady, to the ſole Remedy thereof, I ſay <hi>ſole,</hi> not excluſively of divine miraculous power, but according to humane apprehenſion, this is a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>full Parliament.</hi> Indeed <hi>Free-Parliament</hi> is a <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology,</hi> like a <hi>Reaſonable-man,</hi> who, if not <hi>reaſonable,</hi> is no <hi>man;</hi> as the other, if not <hi>free,</hi> no <hi>Parliament.</hi> But the late frequent forces put on <hi>Parliaments</hi> hath made the needleſs <hi>Epethite</hi> become <hi>neceſſary,</hi> to expreſs what kinde of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we deſire. Not ſuch in which every word muſt be ſpoken under <hi>correction of the Sword,</hi> but wherein every Member, without fear of violence (to interrupt or diſſolve them) may follow the dictates of their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Nor ought a <hi>Parliament</hi> onely bee <hi>free</hi> from Force, but alſo from any <hi>Abjurations,</hi> or previous Engagements. Let them take heed of renouncing any thing, ſave what is ſimply ſinful in it ſelf, as the forſaking of the <hi>World, Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Devil,</hi> as was ſolemnly promiſed for them in their Baptiſm. But it is bad to bee buſie with other <hi>Ab-renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Royal Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:119729:37"/>9. Look backward, and we may ſay with <hi>David, The Vows of the Lord are upon us;</hi> I mean on ſo many of us as are of fifty years of age. The Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> (not to mention the <hi>Covenant</hi>) is the eldeſt Brother, to whom the inheritance of our Conſciences do belong.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Look forwards, it <hi>limiteth Gods Providence,</hi> which is an hainous offence; wee know not what a day, month, year, &amp;c. may bring forth. This Age hath the leaſt reaſon of any to meddle with the edge-tools of ſuch Oathes which in a <hi>ſhort</hi> (but <hi>ſtrict</hi>) time hath ſeen ſo many ſtrange things, that now nothing is ſtrange unto us. Have wee not ſeen <hi>O. Cromwell</hi> from a private Gentleman <hi>gradatim</hi> aſcend to bee Protector of three Nations, and by his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Wiſdome rather than any right) a more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power poſſeſſed by, and larger Tribute paid unto him than to any King in <hi>England.</hi> His Son and Succeſſour (counted bad by many for his goodneſs and milde ſpirit) for eighth months was congratulated by the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Perſons of our Nation. Now if ſome twenty years ſince an Oath had been tendred unto us to abjure the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Cromwels</hi> from ever having the Supream Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey in our Nation; ſuch an Oath would have ſeemed ſafe, but yet it was not lawful to take it, becauſe none knew what was in the <hi>Womb of Teeming</hi> Time, though utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable to our belief.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Beſides, the Impoſers of this Oath may miſs the mark they propound to themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> aſſurance of their own, and diſcovery of the oppoſite Party; for many now paſs not for the taking or breaking of any Oath, and aſſurance of ſuch is hard in keeping, and indeed not worth the having. Other will behold the Oath as temporary, and expiring with the power of the Impoſers. As for the conſcientious indeed, Eſfuſing it out of pure principles of piety, it is a barbarous act for perſons in power, to turn
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119729:38"/>
Executioners to ſtrangle tender Conſciences, whoſe cordial fear of an Oath ſhould be encouraged.</p>
            <p n="12">12. As the <hi>Parliament</hi> muſt be <hi>free,</hi> no <hi>Vaſſal,</hi> but enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed from the Sword, ſo muſt it bee <hi>full,</hi> no <hi>Cripple,</hi> but entire and compleat in all the Members thereof. Our Land hath lately groaned under the moſt grievous <hi>Monopoly</hi> as ever was, or can be, when a handful of men have graſped to themſelves the <hi>repreſenting</hi> of a whole (not to ſay three) Nation, moſt of them being but <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> who though equal in <hi>Votes,</hi> are not equal in their <hi>Repreſentation</hi> with the Knights of the Shires. If they preſume that the reſt <hi>excluded</hi> by them (far more conſiderable for Birth, Eſtates, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Love of the People, and what not?) are vertually <hi>included</hi> in them, it is an intollerable PRESUMPTION. That what pertaineth to all ſhould be handled by all, is a Truth ſo clear and ſtrong, that they muſt offer a <hi>Rape</hi> to their own <hi>Reaſon</hi> that deny it. Such alſo is this Maxim, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrepreſented, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcluded:</hi> So that if ſo few have in them the <hi>notion</hi> of a Parliament, it is a bare <hi>Notion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, eſpecially ſeeing this handful of men were (ſay the Cavaliers) <hi>diſſolved</hi> by the death of the King; <hi>diſſolved</hi> (ſaid <hi>Cromwell</hi>) by his Sword; <hi>diſſolved</hi> (ſay ſome <hi>Great ones</hi>) by an Act of their own (entred into the <hi>Journall</hi> Book of the <hi>Parliament) diſſolved</hi> muſt their own <hi>Conſciences</hi> ſay, by their voluntary accepting of Elections in later <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Now the Members of a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>full Parliament</hi> (the onely Hope of Humane help) ought thus to be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Let them be <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>Well-affected</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and not in the <hi>canting language</hi> of the Times.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:119729:38"/>2. Men of Eſtates, who will be tender in taxing others, as ſtriking them thorough themſelves, whilſt ſuch who <hi>bear</hi> nothing care not how much they burthen others, as if paying were as eaſie as voting, and Money as free as words.</item>
               <item>3. Men of ſpirits, no dull Souls, all the ſparks of whoſe activity are quenched in their own flegm.</item>
               <item>4. No Gainers by the continnance of the Army. <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-ſmith was no fool (what ever elſe he was) ſo ſticking for the ſhrine of <hi>Diana,</hi> by which Craft he got his Gain.</item>
               <item>5. Men of <hi>Moderation,</hi> a quality not oppoſed to <hi>Diligence,</hi> but to <hi>Violence,</hi> not unactiving men, but regulating their Activity.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="14">14. This their Moderation muſt appear in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>Intereſts,</hi> ſeeing there be no two <hi>Intereſts</hi> in the Nation ſo <hi>contemptible,</hi> which if united, and twiſting their diſcontents together, cannot draw trouble on all the reſt: Eſpecially the <hi>Sectarian</hi> (though preſented I beleeve by their party, through a multipling Glaſs) are conſiderable on a politick ſcore of their numbers and pious account of their conſcience; for, though many of them carry the latter in their <hi>Purſes,</hi> who when they finde the <hi>moiſture</hi> of Profit to fail them, will fall off like <hi>leaves in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn;</hi> yet can I not be ſo uncharitable, but to beleeve that many of them (having the <hi>heat</hi> of their <hi>affections</hi> above the <hi>light</hi> of their <hi>judgements</hi>) follow erroneous Conſciences; Beſides, having gone looſe ſo long, they muſt needs <hi>ſwell,</hi> if hardly <hi>girded</hi> on a ſudden.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:119729:39"/>15. This <hi>moderation</hi> alſo muſt be uſed by all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to work themſelves to be (if not <hi>pleaſed</hi>) contented with the deciſions of a <hi>free Parliament.</hi> All muſt ſit down <hi>Loſers</hi> ſave ſuch alone, who can plead, that they have been no <hi>Sinners</hi> in our Nation. The Grand deſign muſt be to have <hi>none,</hi> or, (if that be impoſſible) <hi>as few as may be,</hi> utterly ruined. I confeſs <hi>two hungry meals makes a third a Clutton,</hi> and ſuch who have long <hi>faſted</hi> from their detained Eſtates, will be not onely <hi>greedy</hi> but <hi>ravenous</hi> to recover them. Yea, ſuch will ſhrewdly plead, that they now expect <hi>moderation</hi> from them, who never uſed <hi>moderation</hi> to them. However, in ſuch a general danger, men muſt depoſe their animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, labouring, firſt, to reconcile their <hi>ſpirits,</hi> then, their <hi>perſwaſions,</hi> the <hi>later</hi> being at leſs diſtance than the <hi>former.</hi> And men muſt divide, where they cannot get the whole, ſeeing few will pity his ſtarving who will eat no bread at all, becauſe he can recover but half of his own loaf.</p>
            <p n="16">16. It will be objected that ſuch a <hi>full P.</hi> is ſtill but an <hi>empty Parliament,</hi> having no <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> therein: But know, if both hands of a man be bound, no hope of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from himſelf; but if one be untied, it may do the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly office to unlooſe the other: Let us be content to row in a <hi>Sculler</hi> till we can get a pair of <hi>Oars.</hi> And ſuch ſurely is the Ingenuity and publick ſpiritneſs of the <hi>Peers,</hi> that laying aſide perſonal Intereſt (which upon debate may appear more) they will ſuſpend their <hi>Rights, Immunities,</hi> and <hi>priviledges,</hi> and ſubmit all to the determination of a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> to acquieſce therein.</p>
            <p n="17">17. God give our Nation ſeaſonably to underſtand their own ſtrength, that the Wars begun may be ended amongſt our ſelves before Forreigners become the <hi>Arbitrators</hi> of our differences, who will demand great <hi>wages</hi> for little <hi>work,</hi> yea and turn their owne <hi>Paymaſters</hi> thereof.

            <p n="18">18. Indeed had Providence fixed our Nativities under the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> whoſe <hi>Liſt</hi> is his Subjects <hi>Law,</hi> we would (becauſe we <hi>muſt</hi>) work our ſelves patiently to the obedience of his power.

            <p n="19">19. The Story is well known of the old Woman, who having but a ſmall parcel of Wood, would leaſurably roaſt her Gooſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtick by ſtick, till her wood was all burnt, and her Gooſe ſtill raw. If the ſeveral Counties ſingly engage one after another, all will be overthrown, and nothing effected as to our relief. Let the two and fifty Shires of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> and <hi>WALES</hi> (with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>LONDON,</hi> which eminently is two and fifty more) be all as one, and unanimouſly advance the Work, and not doe as they dealt with poor <hi>CHESHIRE,</hi> uſing it as <hi>Joab</hi> uſed <hi>

            <p>UPon a due conſideration of the dangerous jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies which are promoted; partly, by the <hi>cunning</hi> of a cloſe, and malicious Faction of <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> and partly, by the unwarranted Liberties of an heady and intemperate ſort of People, which falſely tearm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Royalliſts:</hi>—to the great diſſettlement of Sober and well-minded perſons, and ſufficient to blaſt the hopes we have of returning to our Antient Freedomes, without a more than ordinary appearance of Divine aid, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and re-unite us in this our Critical neceſſity.</p>

turbulent Spirits, even of our own Party (by Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at leaſt) that we diſclaim any Society with men of thoſe wilde Principles; and that to all honeſt purpoſes, we will never put any difference, betwixt ſuch as ſhall now unite with us, in Order to the Publick Peace, and thoſe who firſt engaged in the ſame perſwaſion with our ſelves, Submitting all to the Reſolves of Parliament, upon whoſe Determinations we beſeech God to beſtow his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>

            <p>WHereas it hath pleaſed Almighty God, after ſo many Trialls, and ſo long Diſtraction, to raiſe us to large hopes of Reſettlement of this Nation upon Juſt, Known, and laſting Foundations; Wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire from our Hearts to render to God the glory of his Mercies, and a full tribute of Honour to his Excellency the Lord General <hi>Monck,</hi> who hath been ſo eminently In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in theſe beginnings of Deliverance.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION OF THE NOBILITY and GENTRY that adhered to the late KING, in and about the City of LONDON.</head>
            <p>AFter the miſeries of a Civil War, and the many vain and fruitleſs Attempts toward Settlement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral Intereſts and Imaginary Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, It having pleaſed Almighty God by unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and wonderful meanes to give theſe Nations a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hope of being reſtored to thoſe Lawes and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which have been tranſmitted to them from their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>We doe Declare, That we think our ſelves obliged, next to Divine Providence to attribute this Glorious Work to his Excellency the Lord General MONCK, who as he had the Courage to aſſert the Publick Liberty, And the Prudence to carry it on againſt ſo many difficulties, has alſo had the happineſſe to lead us thus far through the Wilderneſs of Confuſion, without Paſſing the Red Sea of Blood.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Enemies of the Publick Peace have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to repreſent thoſe of the KING'S Party as men implacable, and ſuch as would ſacrifice the common Good as their private Paſſions. We doe ſincerely profeſs that we doe reflect upon our paſt Sufferings from the hand of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119729:44"/>
God, and therefore doe not cheriſh any violent Thoughts or Inclinations to have been any way Inſtrumental in them; And if the indiſcretion of any Spirited Perſons tranſports them to Expreſſions contrary to this our Senſe, we utterly diſclaim them, And deſire that the imputation may extend no farther than the folly of the offenders.</p>
            <p>And we farther declare, that we intend by our Quiet and Peaceable behaviour to teſtifie our Submiſſion to the preſent Power, as it now reſides in the Council of State in expectation of the Future Parliament, upon whoſe Wiſedome and Determinations, we truſt God will give ſuch a Bleſſing, as may produce a perfect Settlement both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>And as his Excellency hath not choſen the Sandy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Self-concernment, but the firm Rock of National Intereſt, whereon to frame our Settlement: It is our Hope and Prayer that when the Building comes to be raiſed, it may not like <hi>Rome</hi> have its beginning in the Blood of Brethren, nor like <hi>Babel</hi> be interrupted by the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tongues. but that we may all ſpeak one Language, and be of one name, That all mention of Parties and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and all Rancour and Animoſities may be thrown in and buried like rubbiſh under the Foundation.</p>
