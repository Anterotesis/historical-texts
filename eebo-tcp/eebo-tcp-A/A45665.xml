            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOUGH I was not ſo happy to live under your <hi>Government,</hi> and thereby take ſo near a proſpect of your <hi>Merit</hi> as my <hi>Fellow Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiates</hi> have often told me they do; yet ſome of your worthy acts tending to the good of our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> and beſt eſtabliſhment of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> together, have raiſed you Admirers, even where you may leaſt imagine: And if I ſhould here take occaſion, or preſume to ſpeak of the <hi>Piety</hi> of your <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Solidneſs,</hi> of your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49500:3"/>
               <hi>Judgment,</hi> the <hi>Gravity</hi> of your <hi>Perſon,</hi> or your <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct</hi> in all particulars of your <hi>Government,</hi> I muſt quite lay aſide my intended deſign, and write a Volum on purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore only Congratulating the diſcreet choice of your <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> and <hi>College,</hi> in a <hi>Perſon</hi> ſo fitted for the government of both, and deſiring your favourable conſtruction of what I write, ſhall endeavour to make them both ſome amends for the <hi>ſcandal</hi> I may perhaps have occaſioned by my <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet conduct</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion:</hi> Such as give a <hi>publick Scandal</hi> ſhould do a <hi>publick Penance;</hi> and I'm contented to undergo it, as I am ſure I muſt, in the <hi>Malicious cenſures</hi> of <hi>Roman-Catholicks;</hi> for 'tis very well worth the while to endure that, and much more for the diſcharge of a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> which is all I chiefly aim at in this matter, though indeed 'twill be a confortable addition too, that I ſhall be fully reſtored to the good Opinion of thoſe, among whom I was firſt and beſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled.</p>
            <p>Nor can I at all doubt this laſt good effect, if I either conſider the <hi>real Innocence</hi> of my <hi>actions,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>well-wiſhes</hi> that I have been often told my <hi>Fellow-Collegiates</hi> have all along expreſt towards me.</p>
            <p>My own <hi>Innocence</hi> will, I hope, ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by giving the world a clear and true account of the firſt <hi>motives</hi> of my favouring the <hi>Popiſh</hi> way, my <hi>behaviour</hi> ſince I eſpouſed their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and what <hi>reaſons</hi> have induced my <hi>judgment</hi> to fix again upon the <hi>old foundation:</hi> This I ſhall do with much <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49500:3"/>and <hi>candor,</hi> and ſhall ſpeak the utmoſt truth according to the beſt of my <hi>memory,</hi> and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuleſt information my own <hi>Conſcience</hi> can give me.</p>
            <p>'Twill ſeem very ſtrange that too much <hi>Charity</hi> &amp; <hi>Submiſſion</hi> ſhould happen to drive a man head-long into the moſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable</hi> and <hi>Proudeſt Church</hi> in the World; and yet ſo it was with me. You know, <hi>Sir,</hi> that our <hi>College</hi> has had the fortune to retain greater and more lively <hi>Memorials</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> on the Gates, and in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than any other throughout the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity.</hi> Thoſe ſights did often put me in mind of that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and finding the beſt Divines of the <hi>Church of England</hi> unanimouſly agree that thoſe <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions</hi> with many others, had prevailed over the World at leaſt a thouſand years before the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> it ſtruck my <hi>heart</hi> with a great deal of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi> and made me often wiſh that <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> were in the right, and we in the wrong, that the more People might thereby be <hi>ſaved.</hi> This <hi>Charitable conſideration</hi> did by degrees work further and further; but before ever I ſaw any one of that Perſwaſion, or read any one of their Books, I did long to be Convinced that they were in the right way, for the ſake and general good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: So that by mere chance lighting upon a <hi>Popiſh Book</hi> in one of our Chambers, I opened it with all the haſt and greedineſs in the world, and read it with as much <hi>joy</hi> as if I had found a <hi>Treaſure</hi> beyond value. I was impatient to be drawn from the <hi>Book,</hi> either by Prayers, Meals, Viſits, or any
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49500:4"/>other accident: It over-joy'd me to find that they had ſome <hi>Arguments</hi> on their ſide; and by that time I had got half way in the <hi>Book,</hi> I turn'd a <hi>Zealous Champion</hi> for them, took their part vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly whereſoever I chanced on, or could make an occaſion; and from that time was perfectly deaf to any thing that could be ſaid againſt them, by the beſt <hi>wit</hi> of <hi>judgment</hi> that either <hi>College</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> could oppoſe me with in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Now that which amazes me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, is, that I could poſſibly have ſuch a <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> ſo ſtrong an <hi>impulſe</hi> on my <hi>affections,</hi> notwithſtanding that I had not one <hi>Relation</hi> in the World, not one <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Acquaintance</hi> of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion I ſo ſtrangely <hi>affected.</hi> And conſidering how innocently I was deluded, upon no worſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> than too much <hi>Charity,</hi> I can promiſe my ſelf the eaſier Reconcilement to all ſuch as have been ſcandalized at me upon the account of Religion.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Charity</hi> had this <hi>influence</hi> upon me, ſo I hope I can in ſome ſincerity ſay that a little <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> incident to my natural temper, made me think it <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> to follow the guidance of thoſe <hi>God</hi> had placed over us in matters of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> And for that reaſon was ever very <hi>Zealous</hi> for the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> ſo far that I thought any little breach of the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> to be a kind of <hi>Sacrilege.</hi> This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per made me the fitter to be workt upon by a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Book, called the <hi>The Guide in Controverſies,</hi> eſpecially the 5th, part being a <hi>Vindication of the Council of</hi> Trent. About this time I hapned to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49500:4"/>receive much encouragement to proceed in leaving my <hi>College,</hi> for ſake of the <hi>Religion</hi> I was ſo wholly bent on, from the Diſcourſes and Example of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> of <hi>Magdalen College,</hi> a moſt <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>honeſt Man,</hi> whom I can never but have a <hi>particular reſpect</hi> for, becauſe I know he liad no manner of <hi>temporal motive</hi> to quit his <hi>All,</hi> beſides the <hi>preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a <hi>good Conſcience.</hi> He meant well, I really think, both to me, and in what elſe he gave of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; therefore I ſhall never tax him <hi>unkindly</hi> for what he meant <hi>honeſtly,</hi> but wiſh him <hi>heartily</hi> well, though I imagine him to be gone beyond all reach of hopes of any <hi>return</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> he was born in.</p>
            <p>Whatever was the matter, 'tis very true that I was wound up to ſo high a <hi>Zeal</hi> in thoſe days, that if I can now gueſs at, or remember the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> then of my <hi>mind,</hi> I could have choſen to have beg'd my Bread, or undergone any manner of Afflictions in that Perſwaſion, rather than to have enjoyed the greateſt plenty imaginable (the <hi>Empire of the World,</hi> I did not forbear frequently to ſay) continuing a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Zeal</hi> made me extraordinary deſirous of <hi>Travelling</hi> abroad, that I might the betten ſee the <hi>Church</hi> in its <hi>Glory,</hi> as well as in its <hi>truer colours. France</hi> was the place I ſoon fixt in, and I am very glad I did ſo, becauſe I conceive the <hi>Gallican Church;</hi> to be the beſt <hi>Trincipled</hi> in <hi>Government,</hi> &amp;c the moſt <hi>moderate</hi> of any that are <hi>Roman-Catholick. Janſenius</hi> an exemplary good Man, has there a great many followers, who ſtoutly maintain the cauſe of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49500:5"/>and <hi>good Life,</hi> againſt the powerful contrivances of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and their Faction. As for the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> points in difference between thoſe that are called <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> I never concerned my ſelf about them; only I obſerved the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> to be <hi>Men heartily</hi> diſpoſed to <hi>reform</hi> peoples <hi>lives</hi> to the <hi>antient diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and who thought nothing too much to work a <hi>real Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> to <hi>God</hi> in a virtuous good life; whereas I ever conceived the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to be the moſt ſubtle, ſlie, undermining Generation that ever I ſaw. I don't know what's the matter, but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſaw of <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> me-thought I perceived ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Man-kind different from the reſt; they had a more <hi>Intriguing Countenance</hi> than others; whether it were their <hi>Habit</hi> that conduced to work in me this opinion, or what it was, I can't imagine; but ſo it was, that I often expreſt my ſelf to that purpoſe, even among <hi>R. Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe years I ſpent at <hi>Paris,</hi> I muſt confeſs I had no <hi>ſcruples</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> but went on and did as my Neighbours did, in thoſe matters, wholly bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my mind to <hi>Improvement</hi> in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> with all the induſtry and application I was capable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman Religion</hi> has the greateſt <hi>Charm,</hi> of any thing in Nature; 'twill ſoon cauſe a more than <hi>Stoical inſenſibility</hi> upon the <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and though it were never ſo ſqueamiſh, troubleſome, or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous before, 'twill now turn proof againſt all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doubts, and never ſuſpect it ſelf in the leaſt, let things be in themſelves never ſo <hi>Ridiculous</hi> or <hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49500:5"/>in my ſelf and others, and there's very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it: For when men have wholly ſhut the <hi>eyes</hi> of their <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and leave themſelves to be conducted by others they repoſe an <hi>abſolute Confidence</hi> in, they go on boldly and blindly, and conſider no further whether they are in the r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If it may be good <hi>Logick</hi> to make an <hi>Induction</hi> of a <hi>general Temper</hi> from that of <hi>Particulars;</hi> our <hi>Engliſh Prieſts</hi> will ſerve to give us a very good inſtance of their <hi>worldly Inclinations.</hi> I have heard one of themſelves (one of the <hi>beſt Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>beſt Men,</hi> I had the fortune to meet among them, and no leſs than Dr. of <hi>Divinity</hi>) ſeriouſly tell me he had frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd, that he never in all his life knew a <hi>Religious Man,</hi> who was once become a <hi>Miſſioner</hi> hither, and had here exchang'd his <hi>Religious</hi> into a <hi>Secular Life,</hi> but he fell ſo much in love with it, that he thought it <hi>Death</hi> and Miſery to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his <hi>Monaſtery.</hi> 'Twas my fortune to Dine with one good <hi>Father Jeſuite,</hi> the day before he was bound for St. <hi>Omers,</hi> by <hi>Command</hi> of his <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors;</hi> and poor Man, it pitied me to ſee him look ſo ghaſtly, as if he wanted a <hi>Phyſician</hi> both for Soul and Body; the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. it ſeems, had got too great a dominion over his <hi>Spiritual Intentions</hi> that he had, when he made his <hi>Raſh Vows.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now I am ſpeaking concerning 'em, I ſhall venture to give you my opinion as to their <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Capacity:</hi> I did expect indeed to have met with Men as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally Learned</hi> as they would fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy themſelves <hi>Catholick;</hi> but really they ſeem to me to be generally a very <hi>illiterate</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> people. <hi>Illiterate,</hi> I mean, as to any <hi>true ſolid Learning,</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Hiſtory, Mathematicks,</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi> So <hi>ignorant</hi> they are in thoſe ſubſtantical knowledges, that I ſeldom met with any one of 'em who ſo much as pretended to things of that nature. But we muſt except the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> whoſe <hi>general Learning,</hi> and moſt <hi>politick Arts</hi> have renderd them more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49500:7"/>to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and formidable to <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>great Families,</hi> than all other <hi>Orders</hi> put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They know how to be <hi>uſeſful</hi> in other things beſides <hi>hearing Confeſſions;</hi> nor do they value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mainly for skill in chopping of <hi>Logick,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little <hi>Prieſts</hi> will do. But one thing I can never forgive any of them, and that is their <hi>fond Opinion</hi> of their own way of <hi>Education,</hi> in ſo much that they cannot be perſwaded that a <hi>truly learned Man</hi> can come out of our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> though at this day there's not a Man among 'em but one, that has writ <hi>ſenſe</hi> in <hi>defence</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> beſides ſuch as they have had from us. The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Guide in Cantroverſies</hi> is no doubt an <hi>Oxonian,</hi> and ſo was <hi>good</hi> Mr. <hi>Creſſy,</hi> whom though dead, I ſhall ever honour; Dr. <hi>Godden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> were of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> And who elſe have they now to brag of, beſides <hi>Canes</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who is able to talk and write <hi>Coherently</hi> and <hi>Sophiſtically</hi> of any ſide.</p>
            <p>But 'tis time to take my leave of them, and go on with my firſt intention. The firſt Book that Alarum'd me out of the Lethargy I liv'd in, was put forth by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> called <hi>The Jeſuites Loialty,</hi> which pull'd off the Vizard they generally wore. The <hi>R. Catholick</hi> Gentlemen did always profeſs as much as I could hear, <hi>good Principles</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and would often venture to maintain full as much as is contained in the <hi>Oath of Allegiance.</hi> And this made ſeveral <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuitical Society</hi> fall to work with their <hi>Pen,</hi> to hinder the effects, as much as they were able, of ſuch prevailing <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49500:7"/>For you may be aſſur'd the <hi>good Fathers,</hi> who writ thoſe diſcourſes, as well as the reſt of their Tribe, make little or no diſtinction between thoſe that are called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and thoſe that are not <hi>truly Jeſuitical:</hi> They think, or would perſwade us, that the <hi>Temporal Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their <hi>Party</hi> is of as much concern to mens <hi>Salvation,</hi> as the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal</hi> part of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> For my part, my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ever abhor'd the diſmal Conſequences that muſt enſue from the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Church-mens</hi> invaſion of <hi>Temporal Power. Give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars, <hi>and unto God the things that are Gods,</hi> is very good <hi>Scripture,</hi> and plain ſenſe, let the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> comment as they pleaſe. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> does well in the <hi>Church,</hi> and executes an Office that deſerves <hi>Reverence</hi> from all who pretend to <hi>honour God;</hi> but in the <hi>politick Capacity,</hi> or at the <hi>temporal Tribunal, Gods grace</hi> is apt to leave him, and he becomes the moſt <hi>unmerciful Man</hi> that can be approached. This is too too evident in the Conduct of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> his <hi>Legates,</hi> or other <hi>Court Officers,</hi> who have certainly done the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> more harm by their <hi>Tyranny,</hi> than can be made amends by all the <hi>benefits</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or other pretended conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion why they ought to execute ſuch Power.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible to imagine that <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which was taught with ſuch plaineſs and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> at firſt, by plain, harmleſs, illiterate, innocent Men, ſhould now neceſſarily want all the <hi>art</hi> &amp; <hi>intrigue,</hi> all the <hi>cunning devices</hi> and <hi>politick impoſtures</hi> that the moſt <hi>ſubtle Learning</hi> and working brains of Men is able to invent!

            <p>But here I would not be underſtood to condemn <hi>humane Learning;</hi> if we will but joyn the ſeeming <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to our <hi>Book-acquiſitions,</hi> we ſhall do no harm to either: <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will then ſerve to convince us the better of our own <hi>Ignorance</hi> in moſt things, and not puff us up with empty ſwelling conceits, and we ſhall not deſpiſe our Fellow-creatures, becauſe better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Languages.</hi>

            <p>This <hi>Digreſſion</hi> I hope may be excuſable, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood even by <hi>Scholars</hi> as well as others, and I ſhall now return to my former ſubject, the exorbitant power that <hi>Popes</hi> have gotten into their hands by their ſubtle Policies, and the aſſiſtence of ſawning Paraſites; whether it is conſiſtant with our <hi>Bleſſed Saviours Declaration, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World,</hi> may eaſily be judged.

            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Depoſing Kings,</hi> and <hi>Abſolving Subjects from their Allegiance,</hi> for <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or any thing elſe, it matters not much; for they will call <hi>Hereſie</hi> what they pleaſe, as they do call <hi>Hereticks</hi> whom they pleaſe; this <hi>Doctrine</hi> I ſay, is equally <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> as <hi>prodigious.</hi> 'Twill appear ſufficiently <hi>Senſeleſs</hi> and <hi>Irrational,</hi> if Men will but conſider that they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as well as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and are obliged to follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as the <hi>Pope.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave us the moſt perfect example that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> can pretend to imitate.

When <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed to <hi>humble</hi> himſelf in this manner, and after ſuffering all the Indignities this world was able to beſtow, did chooſe to conclude his moſt <hi>Innocent Life</hi> with the <hi>Ignominious Death</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> can we think he deſigned that any under pretence of being his <hi>Vicar,</hi> ſhould preſently hoiſe above all that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>God,</hi> and enlarge their <hi>Scepter</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to the uttermoſt parts of the <hi>world?</hi>

            <p>How <hi>Prodigious</hi> this <hi>Doctrine</hi> muſt have been too in its effects?

            <p>That the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church of Rome</hi> have proudly arrogated ſuch <hi>intolerable Power</hi> over all <hi>Princes</hi> that come within their reach, all ſuch as deſire, or are capable of being ſatisfied concerning it, may have recourſe to a <hi>Letter</hi> writ lately on the <hi>diſcovery of this Plot,</hi> wherein this ſubject is moſt ſolidly and fully, as well as briefly handled by a moſt <hi>excellent

            <p>And from this Conſideration I ſhall take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to urge one moſt <hi>invincible Argument,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi> rather, againſt the <hi>Pretended Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> 'Tis this:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Church</hi> which <hi>teaches Doctrines</hi> that deſtroy <hi>Morality,</hi> may be fairly <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> (nay, <hi>neceſſarily concluded</hi>) to <hi>teach Errors</hi> in <hi>matters of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has <hi>taught Doctrines</hi> that deſtroy <hi>Morality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it may be <hi>concluded</hi> to <hi>teach Errors</hi> in <hi>matters of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> has as much evidence as <hi>Reaſon</hi> can poſſibly deſire. For ſuppoſing any Man, or Men, <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>notorious Vices,</hi> and <hi>exhorting</hi> us to the ſame <hi>Vices,</hi> can the <hi>reaſon</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> think ſuch a Man, or Men <hi>infallible</hi> in their <hi>Councils</hi> in a ſmall affair, ſo as to repoſe abſolute Confidence in him, or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49500:10"/>them, much leſs in the greateſt concern of this life, the eternal concern of <hi>Heaven?</hi> eſpecially if we conſider that <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> all along the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> does <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Morality,</hi> and put the greateſt eſteem upon it, of any <hi>Religion</hi> in the World. Beſides the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> of <hi>Self-denial</hi> therein urged further than any <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ever thought fit; it teaches us to <hi>love our Neighbours as our ſelves, to live Peaceably with all men, to forgive and do good to our very Enemies,</hi> and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> ſo often, and ſo earneſtly, as if the reſt of <hi>Religion, Faith in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. were things that needed not being exhorted to, they would ſo neceſſarily follow by the ſecret workings of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> where ſo <hi>Loving</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> a <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> takes place in the <hi>heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Minor Propoſition,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> has taught <hi>Doctrines</hi> which deſtroy <hi>Morality,</hi> will eaſily enough appear, if the arrogant allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a <hi>Proud Prelate</hi> to diſpoſe of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> that don't belong to him, to <hi>Proſecute</hi> with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> all ſuch poor innocent Souls as refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their necks to his heavy yoke, to <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſſinate</hi> ſuch <hi>Kings</hi> or Perſons as reſiſt his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Invaſions,</hi> which he calls <hi>Spiritual,</hi> though dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Long-ſuffering</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> In a word, if the <hi>allowance</hi> of <hi>doing Evil that Good may come of it,</hi> doing any thing cruel or barbarous for the promotion of <hi>Religion,</hi> be <hi>Doctrines</hi> that deſtroy <hi>Morality,</hi> as moſt certainly they are; nay, and if thoſe <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now as for the <hi>Promiſes</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> proudly applies to it ſelf for its <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as concerning <hi>God</hi>'s being with his <hi>Church to the end of the world,</hi> &amp;c. I can ſee no reaſon why that <hi>Church</hi> ſhould think it belongs to them more than others. It is becauſe that <hi>Church</hi> has eſcaped thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations and Judgments which the others have ſo ſeverly felt? They have the greater reaſon to ſuſpect themſelves for that; for <hi>God's People,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> did always fall from the <hi>true Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and bow'd down to the <hi>falſe Gods</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when they flouriſhed moſt in <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed to think that nothing would reclaim 'em but fearful <hi>Jugdments,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Plagues, War, Famine,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>Captivities</hi> for many years: And ſtill upon their return to him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd them out of all their Afflictions. But there and ſufficient natural reaſons why <hi>Italy</hi> has leſs felt the Sword and Power of Foreign Enemies than the other <hi>Churches.</hi> Its Situation defends them from Enemies aboard; they have the <hi>Ocean</hi> on one ſide, the <hi>Alps</hi> on another, and <hi>Friends</hi> to ſuſtain the brunt on all parts, by Land: And beſides, the ſame reaſon will plead better for <hi>Mahomets Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> as every Age growing more and more <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> whereas the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Prelate of Rome</hi> has conſiderably decreaſed.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49500:11"/>
            <p>Again, That <hi>Promiſe</hi> before-mentioned was not made to St. <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſo that the other <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Apoſtolical Sees</hi> ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd the ſame <hi>Infallible ſpirit</hi> to their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> as the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> inſolently claims to him and his <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that other <hi>Promiſe, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> makes the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſcorn the reſt of the World, and look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the only <hi>Choſen of God.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> certainly was a <hi>great Apoſtle,</hi> Converted many Countries, and had the honour to be named firſt in the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſo had <hi>Priority of Order,</hi> though in another place he is not numbred for the firſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. But ſurely if this <hi>great Apoſtle</hi> had had a <hi>Superior juriſdiction</hi> over the reſt, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have been more <hi>modeſt</hi> than to have ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely <hi>Rebuked him to his Face,</hi> as he did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. for a ſhrewd miſcarriage in his charge, making the <hi>Chriſtian Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Judaize.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from encroaching on the <hi>Power</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that he thought himſelf <hi>unworthy</hi> of the great <hi>Name</hi> of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. was ſo <hi>Good,</hi> that he could have been contented to have been an <hi>Anatheina,</hi> or Accurſed for ever, for the ſake and happineſs of his Brethren the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 9.3. Beſides, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was more likely to have choſen <hi>Antioch</hi> for the <hi>Seat</hi> of his <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> as being the place where he liv'd moſt part of his Life, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed his <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Charge with honour, benefit, and ſafety, rather than <hi>Rome,</hi> where it is certain he could be but a little while, and many with good
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49500:11"/>reaſon doubt whether ever he was there or no; where likewiſe he was ſo far from being welcome, that it is ſaid he was there very unkindly received, and after much oppoſition, <hi>Crucified</hi> moſt cruelly.</p>
            <p>He that will needs have a <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> I would deſire him to conſider the condition of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the <hi>Choſen People</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who were brought out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> with ſuch a mighty Hand, ſo great an attendanee of <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Favours.</hi> One would think certainly, if it were in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man not to go aſtray, if any were capable of <hi>Worſhipping</hi> the <hi>True God</hi> as they ſhould do, theſe ſhould have been the Men above all others. And yet, though they had a <hi>Cloud</hi> by day, and a <hi>Pillar of Fire</hi> by night to guide them all along; though the <hi>Glory of God</hi> did often fill the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in the ſight of them all; nay, though they were fed with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Manna</hi> and <hi>Quails,</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> ran out of dry <hi>Rocks,</hi> yet theſe ſame People would be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually falling from their <hi>Duty,</hi> they would be long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nay and <hi>making Gods to go before them;</hi> they were not only guilty of the higheſt <hi>Immoralities,</hi> and <hi>Murmurings</hi> at their <hi>good God</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every trivial account, but were contented ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to forſake him, and fall into <hi>groſs Idolatry.</hi> If after all this, ſo ſad a manifeſtation of the proneneſs of poor Man-kind to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Error, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> can ſtill glibly go down to a conſidering Man, I ſhall more wonder at him, than have any thing to ſay to him.</p>
            <p>Nay, if Men can be ſuppoſed to have ſo clear and undoubted underſtanding in <hi>Spiritual Truths,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49500:12"/>how comes it to paſs that all <hi>Natural</hi> things lie ſo his and intricate to the conceptions of the wiſeſt Men. A little <hi>Knowledge</hi> indeed will puff up, and be apt to perſwade People that they know a great deal, but a ſignificant Progreſs will have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, and make them <hi>humbly acknowledge</hi> they <hi>know very little,</hi> if any thing at all. The <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>colours,</hi> the plaineſt things of any, remain ſo <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>unintelligible,</hi> that they ſtill occaſion new <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> and perhaps will do ſo to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak one word with <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to my own <hi>Faculty;</hi> What <hi>certain infallible Methods</hi> has <hi>Phyſick</hi> yet attain'd to? 'tis much to be doubted whether <hi>Beaſts</hi> by the <hi>Inſtinct</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> (ſo much underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by our <hi>Opiniative Reaſon</hi>) do not <hi>Cure</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of moſt <hi>diſtempers</hi> much <hi>ſooner</hi> and <hi>ſafer</hi> than fanciful Men can yet do with all their <hi>Art</hi> and ſo much glorifi'd <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Beſides the <hi>Cure of Agues,</hi> brought now to a kind of <hi>abſolute certainty</hi> by ſome <hi>rightly Educated real Phyſicians,</hi> to my <hi>certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as well, if not better than by the much <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,</hi> though <hi>Illegitimate Son</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> what truly <hi>ſpecifical Cures</hi> can <hi>Phyſicians</hi> yet boaſt of? The <hi>cauſe</hi> of this ſlow advancement, I take to be, that Men will impute the <hi>failures</hi> of their <hi>Remedies</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> rather to <hi>Nature</hi> than their own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</hi> Let never ſo many men dye unhappily of ſuch or ſuch a diſtemper, <hi>long-practiſing Phyſicians</hi> will never ſuſpect themſelves, but think all was done by them as well as it might have been done. whereas, if they took their <hi>Indications</hi> from what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49500:12"/>does <hi>ſenſible good</hi> or <hi>ill,</hi> and from <hi>judicious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> did all their might to correct the <hi>failures</hi> of their <hi>Practice,</hi> and would but once impute theſe <hi>failures</hi> to their own <hi>ignorance,</hi> and want of <hi>ſufficient skill,</hi> there ſeems to me to be hopes <hi>God</hi> would then <hi>bleſs</hi> their endeavours for the <hi>Body,</hi> as he does <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Divines</hi> on behalf of the <hi>Soul.</hi> The <hi>gift of Healing</hi> was once the <hi>gift of God,</hi> as all good things moſt certainly are ſtill; and if Men would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times look up to the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> as as well as into <hi>Books,</hi> we might then expect to find <hi>Learned Ingenious Phyſicians</hi> do as much, if not more than mean <hi>ignorant</hi> People, and <hi>weak Women</hi> are often found to do.</p>
            <p>But there are, God be thanked, ſome <hi>Phyſicians</hi> among us, who have pleaſed to be of this <hi>Chriſtian Opinion,</hi> and do work no few <hi>real Cures</hi> in the moſt <hi>dangerous Diſtempers</hi> by <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> ways, ſuch as will at laſt be acknowledged moſt <hi>agreeable</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> when <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>moderation</hi> ſhall have gainſt the <hi>Victory</hi> over <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One word more, and I paſs from this ſubject. The <hi>Fathers</hi> of the 4th. <hi>General Council</hi> had no ſuch deference then for the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> as he now claims for his inherent right. They did give the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> Can. 28. <hi>Aequalia Privilegia,</hi> equal, or the very ſame privileges as they did to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Their reaſon they ſaid was, <hi>Quod <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rbs illa imperare<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> becauſe that was the <hi>Imperial Seat;</hi> the <hi>Empire</hi> was then divided, and <hi>Old Rome</hi> was the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern Empire,</hi> as <hi>New Rome,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was the <hi>Imperial Seat</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> It
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49500:13"/>was not for any derivation from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but in honour of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that they were pleaſed to allow him <hi>equal privileges.</hi> And this they did not lightly, irregularly, or Uncanonically, but <hi>jure,</hi> they ſaid they did it <hi>juſtly,</hi> what they ought to do, and no more. Then again, the <hi>Legates</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Biſhop</hi> had no Authority allowed them to ſpeak any thing in the <hi>Council,</hi> no more than the reſt, without leave firſt granted them from the <hi>Emperors Officers,</hi> who ſate there in his <hi>place</hi> and ſtead. The <hi>Legates</hi> of <hi>Pope Leo</hi> ſpake to him thus, <hi>Si Imperat Magnificentia veſtra, habemus quoedam referre vobis. Glorioſiſſimi judices dixerunt, Quod vultis edicite. If your Highneſs will give us leave, commands us to ſpeak, we have ſomthing to ſay to you. The moſt noble Judges, anſwered, Speak what you pleaſe.</hi> Now whether the World is not ſtrangely changed ſince thoſe <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> days, whether the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> over <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Kings,</hi> and that very <hi>Biſhop of Conſtantinople</hi> be right and juſt, and whether his calling all <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> If not <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that will not own his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal-ſpreading <hi>Supremacy,</hi> ought to frighten and ſcare people, I leave you and all Men calmly to judge.</p>
            <p>And now to return again to the more immediate deſign of this <hi>Letter,</hi> which is not intended to be an angry Child of <hi>Controverſie,</hi> but mildly and truly to give an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> account for my ſelf, and ſome of my own thoughts, which ſhook and chill'd my <hi>Roman Zeal</hi> a good conſiderable time before the late Helliſh devices made every innocent ſoul to tremble.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49500:13"/>
            <p>The firſt was a ſtrange and propoſterous <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> has on all its <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> wholly to <hi>neglect,</hi> if not <hi>ſlight</hi> the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> Let a Man have uſed himſelf never ſo much to the reading that <hi>Holy Book,</hi> and let him have received never ſo much ſenſible edification from it, yet as ſoon as ever he embraces that <hi>Religion,</hi> he preſently throws the <hi>Book</hi> out of his hands, eaſily parts with it as a thing altogether uſeleſs to any body that will but receive it, and entirely delivers himſelf up to the <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>humane Traditions.</hi> No future <hi>Curioſity</hi> ſhall draw him to <hi>read</hi> in it, nor <hi>Arguments</hi> taken from it, make the leaſt ſignificant impreſſion. Now 'tis a moſt wonderful conſideration to me, how thoſe who profeſs the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and think the <hi>Scriptures</hi> Pen'd by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> ſhould preſently loſe all deference to <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and mind it as little as ſome idle tale.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were of a very different temper. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> Homil. 9. in <hi>Epiſt. ad Coloſſ.</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Audite omnes ſaeculares, comparate vobis Biblia, ſi nihil aliud vultis, vel Novum Teſtamentum acquirite, Apoſtolorum Acta, Evangelia,</hi> &amp;c. Hearken to me all you of the <hi>Laity,</hi> provide your ſelves <hi>Bibles</hi> every one of you, and if you can't reach to procure the <hi>whole Bible,</hi> get the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> at leaſt, the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> &amp;c. for we muſt remember that ſuch <hi>large Manuſcripts</hi> as were the <hi>whole Bible,</hi> were too dear to be purchaſed by every body, before <hi>Printing</hi> was found out. There are abundance of Exhortations in St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, which <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49500:14"/>great a wit as he was, gives but a very poor Childiſh anſwer to.</p>
            <p>Another thing made me ſeriouſly reflect, and that was the <hi>fruitleſs Devotions</hi> that are generally <hi>practiſed</hi> in that <hi>Church.</hi> Men ſhall inſtead of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſpend their time in toſſing a ſtring of <hi>Beads,</hi> and mumbling they conſider not what, a <hi>Devotion</hi> fitter for <hi>Children</hi> to <hi>ſport</hi> with, than <hi>Men</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> with. 'Twas a moſt excellent contrivance to make People think they were ſaying their <hi>Prayers,</hi> when as they were doing nothing; for the <hi>Beads</hi> are of ſuch ſingular uſe, that you may gape and ſtare about as much as you pleaſe, while you ſay 'em; you may talk between whiles, walk about the Streets, think on what you will, and mind what you will, and ſtill go on with your <hi>tale</hi> of <hi>Prayers:</hi> And yet notwithſtanding the <hi>impertinency</hi> of theſe <hi>Knick-knacks,</hi> they are celebrated by the <hi>Church,</hi> as a moſt <hi>extraordinary Devotion.</hi> When the <hi>Roſary</hi> is to be ſaid, that is, theſe <hi>Beads</hi> told over in the <hi>Church,</hi> you muſt kneel down, or elſe be accounted a <hi>Heretick:</hi> For you muſt underſtand the <hi>Services</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> as this, <hi>our Ladies Litany,</hi> and the <hi>Salve Regina,</hi> require much more Reverence, and more neceſſary Obeyſance than any <hi>Services</hi> of our <hi>Lord God.</hi> At <hi>Prayers</hi> to our <hi>Lord,</hi> you may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſit, ſtand, or be as careleſs as you pleaſe, but at <hi>Prayers</hi> to our <hi>Lady,</hi> you muſt learn better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and fall on your Knees, though 'tis never ſo painful to you to kneel. <hi>Bleſſed Soul!</hi> ſhe does not require theſe things at our hands; ſhe was <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>meek</hi> when ſhe was upon Earth, and is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49500:14"/>not to be doubted of the ſame <hi>temper</hi> now in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> God was then her <hi>Saviour</hi> as well as ours, but now ſhe muſt be <hi>Immaculate</hi> and <hi>free</hi> from <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin,</hi> and be ſuppoſed to have had no need at all of the <hi>Saviour her good ſpirit did then rejoyce in.</hi> But 'tis natural to Men to flatter <hi>Ladies,</hi> and ſome muſt be excuſed if they do <hi>Romance</hi> on their account. Hence it was ſhe came to be <hi>Queen of Heaven, Queen of Angels</hi> and <hi>all Saints, the hope</hi> and <hi>refuge of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> &amp;c. and is repreſented with <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> whereas her <hi>Son</hi> muſt never be ſuffered to grow big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a <hi>Baby</hi> in her arms, to ſhew his filial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to her, though the <hi>Scripture</hi> mentions not any thing that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid to her, or of her in his whole life-time, without ſomething as it were on purpoſe to reſtrain Men from that <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> which does now ſo prevail in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to enervate quite the very <hi>deſign</hi> of <hi>true Devotion,</hi> they have found another way to amuſe people with, by inſtructing them to ſay their <hi>Prayers in Latin,</hi> which they don't underſtand. <hi>Women</hi> forſooth ſhall venture to ſay <hi>our Ladys Office</hi> in <hi>Latin;</hi> one would think it were on purpoſe that their <hi>Prayers</hi> might not be a whit <hi>beneficial</hi> to their <hi>Souls,</hi> but they ſay 'tis in <hi>Reverence</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> which does all in <hi>Latin,</hi> which <hi>Baptizes,</hi> nay <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> and plights thoſe Sacred Tyes between ignorant people with a <hi>Volo,</hi> promiſing they know not what or how. And is it not a wiſe buſineſs, that becauſe the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſings his Part in <hi>Latin,</hi> every ignorant Sot muſt needs be chirping the ſame tune,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49500:15"/>in the ſame (unknown) language? This puts me in mind of a <hi>ſtory</hi> in my own knowledge: A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gentlewoman goes to <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> there eaſes her mind in a great many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the <hi>Fryer</hi> that underſtood <hi>Engliſh Confeſſions;</hi> when ſhe had done her ſtory, the good <hi>Father</hi> ſets her for her <hi>Pennance</hi> to ſay our <hi>Ladies Office</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> every day for a year together; a very ſevere task indeed, 'twould have been even for a <hi>Nun</hi> that had little elſe to do. A <hi>Prieſt</hi> of my acquaintance, from whoſe own mouth I had this Relation, gives this Lady a Viſit the next day by chance, and finds her full of tears and trouble: He enquires into the <hi>Cauſe</hi> (for they love dearly to know the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> and to be a medling where they can) and after a few reluctancies were conquer'd, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to him her grief, that ſhe had ſuch a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> ſet her as 'twas impoſſible for her to perform, for ſhe was not <hi>Learned</hi> enough to underſtand a word of <hi>Latin.</hi> He preſently Counſelled her to make the ſame <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to him, and ſhe ſhould have no ſuch reaſon to be troubled (for if a Perſon diſlike his <hi>Pennance,</hi> he may lawfully have a new one ſet him, if he will make the ſame <hi>Confeſſion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to another <hi>Prieſt</hi>). She (good Lady) was very loth to do that, for it ſeems 'twas no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had <hi>confeſt,</hi> and was therefore unwilling to uncover her ſores again. Upon that, he takes his leave, and ſhe blubber'd it out that night; but the next morning upon ſecond thoughts grew wiſer, and came to him with tears and courage together: She then fell upon her Knees, and out
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49500:15"/>came the grievous things ſhe had committed, and this <hi>Indulgent Prieſt</hi> was ſo favourable as to order her only to ſay the <hi>Penitential Pſalms</hi> once over in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Lady became as merry as a Cricket again.</p>
            <p>Hence you ſee what a mighty ſtreſs lies upon <hi>Prayers</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> in the opinion of thoſe <hi>ſenſeleſs Men,</hi> who never ſaw any thing of the World out of a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> and what wiſe <hi>States-men</hi> they're like to prove, when they meddle with publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. This other was a <hi>ſecular Prieſt,</hi> a Man of a good capacity and judgment, and I have ſeldom met with a more underſtanding Man of his Coat.</p>
            <p>A few years agoe there was Printed an excellent <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> called <hi>Devotion by way of Offices;</hi> a <hi>Book</hi> ſo full of the <hi>Divine Spirit, ſolid ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>good Engliſh,</hi> that I can hardly remember to have ſeen the like, unleſs it be the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of our late <hi>Incomparable Soveraign.</hi> 'Twas a work ſo free from exception, that paring a way the <hi>Ave Mary,</hi> a <hi>Hymn</hi> to our <hi>Lady</hi> at the concluſion of the <hi>Office,</hi> and very little or nothing more, it might ſerve as well for the uſe of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as <hi>Papiſts.</hi> 'Twas writ by a <hi>Lay-Gentleman,</hi> a man of a moſt exemplary life, and ſo ingenious, that all who knew him, or heard of him, or had any inward reſpect for true Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Virtue, coveted his acquaintance ſo far, that they made his Houſe the Center of all their meetings. And yet the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> will not beſtow one kind word on this Man, or Book. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man they condemn for a <hi>Blackloiſt,</hi> that is as they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49500:16"/>will have it, a worſe <hi>Heretick</hi> than a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> though he declar'd himſelf with never ſo much ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> The <hi>Book</hi> they diſſwade all People from uſing, for no manner of reaſon, but becauſe it is not ſtufft with thoſe <hi>Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and <hi>Prayers to Saints</hi> the <hi>Manual</hi> abounds with, or that it will do their ſouls too much real good, or becauſe it was written by a <hi>Lay-man</hi> no ways <hi>Jeſuited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's one thing more I can't but obſerve. And that is, that all the <hi>Convents of Nuns,</hi> let them be never ſo <hi>Ignorant,</hi> muſt be forc'd to ſay and ſing the <hi>Office of the Church</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> for <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Prayers,</hi> and the other <hi>Canonical hours.</hi> So it ſeems they ſeparate themſelves from the World to a good purpoſe, and muſt needs make ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements in <hi>Devotion</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> when they thus ſpend their time at <hi>Church,</hi> and in numbring long Catalogues of <hi>Ave Maries.</hi> 'Tis much, if they don't repent their firſt <hi>Zeal,</hi> when they have liv'd long enough there to grow ſober, and conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True Devotion</hi> conſiſts in thoſe means that raiſe the <hi>heart</hi> to the <hi>love of God</hi> above all things, and which conduce to make us live <hi>Honeſtly</hi> and <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably</hi> with all Men, and not in a <hi>toothleſs Lip ſervice,</hi> where the <hi>heart</hi> is not, cannot be concern'd.</p>
            <p>A third thing that muſt touch ſenſibly upon the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of any one that was ever a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> is the <hi>Prayers to Saints,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe continual Supplications that are made in the higheſt manner to the <hi>Ever-bleſſed Virgin.</hi> He may indeed comply a little, following the <hi>general rule</hi> of <hi>Believing</hi> as the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49500:16"/>
               <hi>Church Believes,</hi> and <hi>practiſing</hi> as the <hi>Church practiſes,</hi> but he can never force out of his mind his <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> on <hi>God Almighty,</hi> and <hi>heartily</hi> quit his <hi>natural refuge</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to make Applications to this or that <hi>Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Worſhip of Images,</hi> ſo flat againſt the 2d. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> and the putting out the 2d. <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſo plain againſt the <hi>Worſhip of Images;</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of Reliques, Agnus Dei</hi>'s, and other <hi>Conſecrated Bawbles</hi> will make the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſomtimes, let him do what he will, and declare himſelf never ſo much for that <hi>Church.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Reliques</hi> I obſerved, that when they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on great days to the view of all comers, there was a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to gard'em, who would take it very unkindly, if any body preſumed to <hi>kiſs</hi> the <hi>Caſe</hi> they were kept in, without <hi>depoſiting</hi> ſome <hi>Mite</hi> into the <hi>Diſh</hi> juſt by. So that poor People muſt only look on, and devoutly admire the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and the <hi>rich Caſe</hi> together, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning it with an empty, too near an approach. And again, ſome <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> have a much greater virtue in 'em than others. His <hi>Holineſs</hi> has beſtowed moſt <hi>liberal Indulgences</hi> to ſome above others, that is, he has favoured more particularly ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> and granted them a means to make <hi>Fools</hi> ſtocks thither more abundantly, and confer their <hi>Charity</hi> with a freer hand to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a pack of Covetous Inſatiable Wretches.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis moſt certain and plain that the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> without an <hi>Image</hi> is <hi>lawful</hi> beyond diſpute; with an <hi>Image</hi> 'tis <hi>dangerous</hi> at leaſt, to ſay no worſe.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49500:17"/>To <hi>Pray</hi> to the <hi>God</hi> that made us, is <hi>ſafe</hi> beyond ſcruple: <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> may make God <hi>Jealous</hi> of his Honour. To ſay ſuch <hi>Prayers</hi> as <hi>affect</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> cannot but be very <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, but a dry inſipid <hi>Lip-ſervice</hi> ought much to be <hi>ſuſpected.</hi> To <hi>Receive</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed-Sacrament</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Inſtitute</hi> it, cannot but he <hi>effectual</hi> to a ſoul du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared: but the mincing this great <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the taking it by halfs is not what he intended, if we will follow his own example, or believe his own words. In a word, to <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>three Creeds,</hi> the <hi>foundation of Chriſtianity,</hi> and imitate the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> the beſt &amp; pureſt times, is very <hi>rational</hi> for a <hi>good Chriſtian;</hi> but to take in all the idle <hi>Superſtructures</hi> that <hi>Politick,</hi> or <hi>Zealous,</hi> or <hi>Ignorant</hi> Men have ſince raiſed, either for ſelf-ends, or through weakneſs, or the wilfulneſs of Opiniators, gives too great a Latitude to the Enemy of Man-kind, who watches all opportunities to withdraw us from our duty.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the Title and Name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> which <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> do ſo uncharitably appropriate to themſelves, that ſhould frighten us into a better opinion of them than they deſerve. I know not why an <hi>Engliſh Catholick</hi> ſhould not ſound full as well as a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> but in their ſenſe 'tis a meer <hi>Soleciſm,</hi> as much as a <hi>Particular-general.</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>Name,</hi> but the <hi>Thing</hi> that muſt do our buſineſs hereafter. And a moſt uncharitable excluſion of all Man-kind from <hi>Salvation,</hi> beſides thoſe that are Croſs'd with that Title on their Fore-heads, will help but little to forward our future happineſs, let Zealous fiery <hi>Prieſts</hi> urge it till their hearts ake.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49500:17"/>But that nobody may be ſcar'd from doing their <hi>duty</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> upon the conſideration that no <hi>Salvation</hi> can be had out of the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> I ſhall here declare, that I have often talkt with ſome of the moſt <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>knowing Prieſts</hi> among them concerning this point, and they have ſeriouſly agreed with me, that neither they nor the <hi>Church</hi> do think ſo <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitably.</hi> Paltry <hi>Prieſts</hi> will ſay ſo to frighten Women, and weak perſons, but they do not, cannot in their <hi>Conſcience</hi> think ſo, if they have but the leaſt grain of wit.</p>
            <p>I could add a great many other things to thoſe already ſaid, though for ſeveral years I have not ſo much as lookt into any <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Controverſie,</hi> having had ſomthing elſe to do, and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that <hi>Controverſie</hi> is the <hi>Mother</hi> of far more <hi>Harm</hi> than <hi>Good,</hi> as turning <hi>Practical Religion</hi> out of doors, and ſpending the <hi>true ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>talk</hi> and <hi>noiſe,</hi> which rather conſiſts in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Action.</hi> But I muſt remember I am writing a <hi>Letter,</hi> not a <hi>Treatiſe; Do to others as you would be done unto,</hi> is a greater and more ſubſtantial part of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> than we are commonly aware. And he that would take a few words to guide his life by, let him remember now and then what S. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches him in the 5th. Chapt. to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he reckons up what are the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and what the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Theſe latter he ſays are <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> What a chain of kind, ſoft, tender words does he here put together, as if <hi>Good-nature</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49500:18"/>were all in all, and our <hi>Religion</hi> required no other <hi>qualification</hi> to make the beſt ſort of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> And doubtleſs if this be true, that <hi>Opinion</hi> which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders men <hi>Moroſe, Harſh, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkind, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,</hi> or <hi>Cruel,</hi> ſprings not from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but ſome <hi>evil Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all things <hi>Charity</hi> is the Leſſon that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are obliged to practiſe heartily; ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary 'tis thought in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> that there are infinite repetitions exhorting us to it; and ſo uſeful the <hi>Meditation</hi> of it ſeems to me, that I ſhall venture to adjoyn ſome thoughts on this ſubject, though it be a little beſides my main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity</hi> is almoſt the <hi>whole Duty of Man,</hi> and he that performs this duty as he ſhould do, needs little to be remembred of his duty to God. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> is ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive a Precept, and does ſo fully contain all that can be ſaid, that nothing but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> could have ſum'd up the <hi>Law</hi> in ſo few words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity</hi> does reſpect both our <hi>Opinions</hi> and our <hi>Actions.</hi> Our <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Cenſures</hi> ought to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd always by it, or elſe they'l be found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate very widely from what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> taught us. <hi>Judge not leaſt you be judged,</hi> ſounds very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſeverely, if we conſider the narrow Principles and uncharitable Conſtructions of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every party of Man-kind. How does every Man now think it <hi>Prudence</hi> to think the worſt of one another? How does every little Hot-brain now peeviſhly confine <hi>Salvation</hi> to his own narrow
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49500:18"/>
               <hi>Herd,</hi> though a <hi>number</hi> ſo inconſiderable as hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit to be named in the large <hi>Arithmetick</hi> of <hi>Nature?</hi> I ſhould be glad nevertheleſs if they did not wiſh ill to, as well as think ill of one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there is no Salvation to be had out of the pale of Gods true Catholick Church,</hi> I believe as firmly as the great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did; but in what manner this <hi>myſtery</hi> is to be underſtood, I as little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex my thoughts, as how <hi>Three</hi> can be <hi>One,</hi> how <hi>God</hi> could be <hi>Incarnate</hi> of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> or how we ſhall <hi>Riſe</hi> again with the ſame <hi>numerical Bodies,</hi> that have by long ſucceſſions ſerv'd to <hi>nouriſh</hi> one another, or been <hi>corrupted</hi> into as many <hi>forms</hi> as there are different <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things. I could never conceive how this <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Belief</hi> ſhould render us, <hi>uncharitable</hi> to all that are not of our own <hi>perſuaſion.</hi> We may as ſoon expect to have a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Joys of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>frame</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> or the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of our own <hi>Souls,</hi> as to know what company we ſhall meet with in the other World, or who alone ſhall enter into inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bliſs. Let us but take care of our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and by acts of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſuitable diſpoſitions for a fit Reception there, and we ſhall be found at laſt to have ſpent our time to much better purpoſe than in ſuch <hi>needleſs,</hi> and perhaps <hi>dangerous diſquiſitions.</hi> Men have all <hi>ſouls</hi> of the ſame immenſe value, and the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is over all in general, but what allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Grace</hi> he has made 'em here; or ſhall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49500:19"/>hereafter of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> neither the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſeem to define, nor Apoſtolical Men ſince have preſumed to determine. I ſhould ſin if I ventur'd to ſpeak of this ſubject, either as largely as <hi>Origen</hi> once did, or as narrowly as ſome <hi>Divines</hi> do of a latter date; though I am apt to think that <hi>Errors</hi> ſprung from too much <hi>Charity</hi> (if I may ſo ſay) will be found far more <hi>Innocent</hi> than thoſe from too little.</p>
            <p>Truly it makes my heart ake ſomtimes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how eaſily and willingly people can hurl one another headlong into the <hi>Bottomleſs pit.</hi> Suppoſe but twenty Men were here <hi>Condemn'd</hi> to the <hi>Rack,</hi> and appointed to ſuffer the moſt exquiſite tortures that cruel blood-thirſty Men can tell how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, every day for a month together; would not the hearing on ſeeing ſuch a maſter-piece of cruelty make every good Man ſhiver, knowing not how near his own turn might be, if <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſuffer he furious barbarous diſpoſition of ſome to take place. How much more inhumane and dreadful then is it, to precipitate one another into that <hi>place of torment,</hi> too intolerable to be expreſs'd, if it conſiſts in nothing elſe but confuſion of face and heart, the gnawing remorſes, and continual ſtings of a guilty ſelf-confounded Conſcience. Me-thinks it ſhould rather trouble us that <hi>any</hi> are like to be ſo <hi>unhappy,</hi> than to keep out by our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will all that are not of our own <hi>Opinion. Chriſt</hi> certainly <hi>died</hi> for <hi>all</hi> men, and I <hi>hope</hi> we ſhall find his <hi>death</hi> applied to the eternal benefit of many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49500:19"/>harmleſs, virtuous, invincibly ignorant People, that common Uncharitableneſs will not let us have a kind thought of here. We may lawfully <hi>think</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> the <hi>beſt</hi> of all Men; for though we are <hi>forbidden</hi> to <hi>ſay</hi> too much for 'em, I'm ſure we are not allow'd to <hi>judge</hi> them too <hi>ſeverely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who could imagine that thoſe who have often read St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. ſhould forget the <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> and not be touched with the greateſt concern? 'Tis a <hi>Sermon</hi> that is ſecond to nothing I know extant, unleſs that <hi>Preach'd</hi> upon the <hi>Mount;</hi> and I think it deſerves to be read full as often, as ſome have well conceited that <hi>Pythagora</hi>'s <hi>Golden Verſes</hi> do deſerve; not to take a leaſure-minute now and then, but be the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſubject of our daily Meditations. The <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> there deſcribed, is of ſo <hi>abſolute neceſſity,</hi> that though I had the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> though I had <hi>Faith</hi> ſtrong enough <hi>to remove Mountains, though I gave all my Goods</hi> and Poſſeſſions <hi>to the Poor,</hi> and <hi>my Body to be burned,</hi> upon any other never ſo good account, yet without this; all would ſignifie nothing. That <hi>Charity</hi> is ſuch as <hi>thinks no evil</hi> of any Man, <hi>believeth</hi> and <hi>hopeth</hi> the beſt of <hi>all things,</hi> and peaceably ſubmitteth to all that God pleaſes to inflict. In a word, we are adviſed to abide in <hi>Faith, Hope, and Charity, theſe three, but the greateſt</hi> of all is ſaid to be <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not offer to comment upon this <hi>Divine Chapter,</hi> and compare the <hi>practice</hi> of thoſe that are called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with the extenſiveneſs of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49500:20"/>
               <hi>Deſcription,</hi> for fear I ſhould either <hi>prove</hi> or <hi>become</hi> more <hi>uncharitable</hi> than I deſire. To uncover ſuch foul ſores, without better hopes of healing 'em, would but cauſe a noiſome ſmell, and but offend thoſe who ſuffer them as well as my ſelf; and therefore I ſhall paſs to the next branch of this <hi>duty,</hi> and conſider it as it concerns our <hi>actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity</hi> in the diſtributive ſenſe, as it relates to our <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> is ſo inculcated by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and common <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Man-kind,</hi> that unleſs one puts off all <hi>Humanity</hi> to receive the <hi>Wolf</hi> and <hi>Tygar,</hi> 'twill be extream hard not to have ſome fellow-feeling of the deplorable wants and miſeries of our Fellow-creatures. Thoſe who are <hi>Stewards</hi> of large and ample Fortunes, will have long accounts to make at the <hi>great day.</hi> But Oh what a raviſhing ſight will it then be to ſee <hi>the Hungry we have Fed, and the Naked we have Cloathed!</hi> What a multitude of Sins will they ſtand between and cover! for then 'twill be enquired, not what <hi>Learning</hi> we had gain'd, what Cobwebs we had ſpun, or what nice ſpeculations we had made; but what <hi>good</hi> we have perform'd, and how we employ'd our <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> not our <hi>wits</hi> and <hi>fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Jewiſh Law</hi> was but a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> came not to <hi>abrogate</hi> the <hi>Moral-Law,</hi> but to <hi>fulfil</hi> and raiſe it higher, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, how much then ought we to exceed the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>acts of Charity?</hi> and yet 'tis to be feared we come too ſhort of what their <hi>duty</hi> prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49500:20"/>them to. Beſides their <hi>Annual Tithes</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> they gave another <hi>Tithing</hi> to the <hi>Poor</hi> every third year, by Gods own appointment, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvi. 12, 13. and this comes to the ſame reckoning as an <hi>Annual</hi> 30th. which whether <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Charity</hi> doth reach to, or exceed as far as it ſhould, I leave to every Mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider. For <hi>except our Righteouſneſs,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the very ſame word that in many places of <hi>Scripture</hi> does neceſſarily ſignifie <hi>Legal Alms-giving, except,</hi> I ſay, <hi>our Righteouſneſs does exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, we can in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we conſider but the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Serenity</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> the <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> that is gained from a conſciouſneſs of having done ſome <hi>real good</hi> to others, it would be a thing eligible, if there were no further <hi>motive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, If we will but examine our own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> I mean not only our <hi>Eternal Intereſt</hi> which would certainly move us, if we were but effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſuaded of it, but alſo our dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Temporal Intereſt,</hi> the trueſt way of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our riches, and beſt improvement of our Eſtates, we ſhould readily comply with this <hi>Duty</hi> in all reſpects. What ſays the <hi>Prophet Malachi,</hi> ch. iii. v. 10. <hi>Bring ye all the tithes into the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, that there may be meat in mine houſe, and prove me herewith, ſaith the Lord of Haſts, if I will not open you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it,</hi> and ſee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49500:21"/>again Prov. iii. 10. <hi>So ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty.</hi> And the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are full of paſſages to this purpoſe, inviting us all manner of ways to try the <hi>goodneſs of God</hi> which he pleaſes to offer us in this life, upon one only condition, if we will but believe his <hi>promiſes</hi> to us. And this puts me in mind of an <hi>excellent ſtory</hi> I have read in a good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor concerning a <hi>Jew,</hi> who when he had <hi>peruſed</hi> ſeveral of thoſe places which <hi>promiſe</hi> abundance of <hi>Temporal bleſſings</hi> to <hi>Charitable</hi> perſons, reſolved to try whether <hi>God</hi> would be as good as his word, and ſpared no occaſion of <hi>profuſe Charity,</hi> until he had reduced himſelf to one ſingle piece, the whole remain of all his former riches. Now was he come to the <hi>Criſis</hi> of tryal, a <hi>Criſis</hi> able to ſhake even a <hi>Chriſtian courage,</hi> and it did ſhake his indeed, though he had proceeded boldly hitherto without any fear or diſtruſt. He began then to <hi>murmur</hi> and <hi>repine,</hi> and blamed his <hi>Credulity,</hi> for what he had ſo raſhly, he thought, done; and in this penſive heart-breaking mood, he ſpied two men a quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fighting. Notwithſtanding his own <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> he preſently interpoſed, and demanded the cauſe of their ſo great difference. They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that going along there they had found a <hi>ſtone,</hi> which both laid claim to, but could not agree which was the firſt diſcoverer, ſo that if he would beſtow ſomthing for it, they told him it ſhould be his. He gave them all he had, his one remaining piece, and ſo they went well contented with it. He preſently repairs to a <hi>Jeweller</hi> to know the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49500:21"/>value of his purchaſe, and was informed, that it was the beſt <hi>Jewel</hi> which belonged to the <hi>High-Prieſts, Breaſt-plate,</hi> and that if he would carry it to the right owner, he need not doubt of a ſufficient <hi>recompence.</hi> He goes to the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> acquaints him with what he had found, and the accidental occaſion that brought him to ſuch a Treaſure. The <hi>Man of God</hi> roundly gave him firſt a box of the Ear, for diſtruſting <hi>Providence,</hi> and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him with a <hi>reward</hi> anſwerable to the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. From that fortunate day he thrived in ſuch meaſure, and received the full ſatisfaction of all his former wiſhes, that notwithſtanding the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> continuance of his former good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he ſoon grew to be one of the <hi>richeſt</hi> men in all <hi>Judea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God never forſakes thoſe that will <hi>truſt</hi> in him. He will try them indeed whether they are in earneſt, and how far they will venture to <hi>truſt</hi> in him, but be aſſured he never leaves <hi>man</hi> in his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,</hi> unleſs he leaves his <hi>God</hi> firſt. And I have obſerved ſeveral inſtances of people that have been brought to the very brink of <hi>ruin</hi> and <hi>deſpair,</hi> who have been ſtrangely and ſuddenly <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,</hi> to the amazement of all their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by the <hi>immediate hand of Almighty God.</hi> And if all <hi>good people</hi> in <hi>affliction</hi> do not find the ſame, 'tis their <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>reſign</hi> themſelves up to the <hi>wiſe,</hi> but <hi>unaccountable</hi> ways of <hi>Providence.</hi>

I am very well ſatisfied, that every man who thinks at all of <hi>Religion,</hi> has a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection</hi> for ſome one <hi>Religion</hi> above others, as he has for ſome <hi>particular Perſon,</hi> but if upon ſober thoughts and familiar Converſation he finds the <hi>Lady</hi> he dotes too much upon to be either a <hi>Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> or wretchedly <hi>Painted,</hi> or <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Cruel,</hi> eſpecially if all theſe together, he is not to be blamed if he recalls his <hi>extravagant paſſion,</hi> and ſettles it rationally upon a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unſpotted,</hi> a <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> and deſervedly <hi>amiable</hi> object. There's great variety of tempers in Men, and theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>tempers</hi> make Men <hi>naturally incline</hi> to as great variety in <hi>Religions.</hi> Some take to the <hi>ſowre</hi> and <hi>moroſe,</hi> others are led with an <hi>artificial ſhew,</hi> and with this moſt Men are apt to be inſnar'd; till they find out the <hi>Cheat;</hi> ſome are taken with <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious encouragements,</hi> and others (the feweſt of all) with an <hi>honeſt naked truth.</hi> Now if among theſe various attractions an <hi>innocent well-meaning Man</hi> happens to be a while deluded, there's no ſuch real wonder; but <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> which over-looks Man-kind, and watches inceſſantly for the <hi>good</hi> of us <hi>all,</hi> is not like to paſs by long thoſe who are in no worſe circumſtance than that. How do we know but that theſe many different <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> are moſt agreeable to the <hi>great end</hi> of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49500:22"/>When we cannot poſſibly ſee two <hi>faces</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, no nor any two things exactly ſo in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, muſt we fondly deſire that all <hi>Nations</hi> in the World ſhould be of one and the ſame <hi>Opinion? God</hi> ſays <hi>Hereſies</hi> ſhall come (and no doubt remain too) that the <hi>Faithful</hi> may the better be <hi>tried;</hi> and for that reaſon I ſhould rather ſuſpect <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> where are no <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to <hi>try</hi> their <hi>Faith,</hi> than think <hi>that blind forc'd <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> makes ſo much for 'em. <hi>Chriſtian Goſpel-liberty</hi> cannot avoid <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> the <hi>Enemy</hi> will ſow his <hi>Tares;</hi> but the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> gags the mouths of all who preſume to <hi>examine</hi> any <hi>whys or wherefores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing I ſhall adjoyn, and ſo conclude: When firſt I <hi>return'd</hi> to <hi>Church, God</hi> be <hi>thanked,</hi> I can <hi>truly ſay,</hi> I never did any thing with more <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>aſſurance of mind,</hi> or with more <hi>inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> to my <hi>ſoul,</hi> than that time at <hi>Church,</hi> which really to me is a moſt <hi>comfortable reflection</hi> as oft as it occurs.</p>
            <p>Now may <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> encreaſe among us all, and may the World grow more and more <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> of the <hi>future</hi> and <hi>preſent benefit</hi> of a <hi>juſt, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and <hi>well-diſpoſed Life.</hi> Sir, I am,</p>
