            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Henry Earl of Arundel, and Lord Mowbray.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIs long that I have with great impatience waited
some opportunity to declare my infinite Respect
to your Lordship; coming, I may say, into the
World with a Veneration for your Illustrious
Family, and being brought up with continual Praises of the
Renowned Actions of your glorious Ancestors, both in War
and Peace, so famous over the Christian World for their
Vertue, Piety, and Learning, their elevated Birth, and greatness
of Courage, and of whom all our English History are full of
the Wonders of their Lives: A Family of so ancient Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and from whom so many Hero's have proceeded to bless
and serve their King and Country, that all Ages and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
mention 'em even with Adoration. My self have been
in this our Age an Eye and Ear-witness, with what Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Joy, with what unusual Respect and Ceremony, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
what we pay to Mankind, the very Name of the Great
<hi>Howards</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> have been celebrated on
Forein Shores! And when any one of your Illustrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
have pass'd the Streets, the People throng'd to praise
and bless him, as soon as his Name has been made known to
the glad Croud. This I have seen with a Joy that became a
true English heart, (who truly venerate its brave Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
and joyn'd my dutiful Respects and Praises with the most
devout; but never had the happiness yet of any opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to express particularly that Admiration I have and ever had
for your Lordship and your Great Family. Still, I say, I did
<pb facs="tcp:61241:3"/>
admire you, still I wisht and pray'd for you; 'twas all I cou'd
or durst: But as my Esteem for your Lordship dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
with my Judgment, so nothing cou'd bring it to a more
absolute height and perfection, than to observe in these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
times, this Age of Lying, Peaching, and Swearing,
with what noble Prudence, what steadiness of Mind, what
Loyalty and Conduct you have evaded the Snare, that 'twas
to be fear'd was laid for all the Good, the Brave, and Loyal,
for all that truly lov'd our best of Kings and this distracted
Country. A thousand times I have wept for fear that Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Malice wou'd extend so far as to stain your Noble
and ever-Loyal Family with its unavoidable Imputations; and
as often for joy, to see how undauntedly both the Illustrious
Duke your Father, and your self, stem'd the raging Torrent
that threatned, with yours, the ruine of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
all which had not power to shake your Constancy or
Loyalty: for which, may Heaven and Earth reward and bless
you; the noble Examples to thousands of failing hearts, who
from so great a President of Loyalty, became confirm'd. May
Heaven and Earth bless you for your pious and resolute bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Mind, and heroick Honesty, when you cry'd, <hi>Not guilty;</hi>
that you durst, like your great self, speak Conscientious Truths
in a Juncto so vitious, when Truth and Innocence was crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
and I doubt not but the Soul of that great Sufferer bows
down from Heaven in gratitude for that noble service done it.
All these and a thousand marks you give of dayly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Greatness; every day produces to those like me, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to learn the Story of your Life and Actions, something
that even adds a Lustre to your great Name, which one
wou'd think cou'd be made no more splendid: some new
Goodness, some new act of Loyalty or Courage, comes out
<pb facs="tcp:61241:3"/>
to cheer the World and those that admire you. Nor wou'd
I be the last of those that dayly congratulate and celebrate
your rising Glory; nor durst I any other way approach you
with it, but this humble one, which carries some Excuse along
with it.</p>
            <p>Proud of the opportunity then, I most humbly beg your
Lordships Patronage of a Comedy, which has nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, but the Honour it begs; and nothing to deserve that
Honour, but its being in every part true Tory! Loyal all-over!
except one Knave, which I hope no body will take to
himself; or if he do, I must e'en say, with <hi>Hamlet,</hi>
               <q>—Then let the strucken Deer go weep—</q>
It has the luck to be well receiv'd in the Town; which (not from my
Vanity) pleases me, but that thereby I find Honesty begins to come in
fashion again, when Loyalty is approv'd, and Whigism becomes a Jest
where'er 'tis met with. And no doubt on't, so long as the Royal Cause
has such Patrons as your Lordship, such vigorous and noble Supporters, his
Majesty will be great, secure and quiet, the Nation flourishing and happy,
and seditious Fools and Knaves that have so long disturb'd the Peace and
Tranquility of the World, will become the business and sport of Comedy,
and at last the scorn of that Rabble that fondly and blindly worshipt 'em;
and whom nothing can so well convince as plain Demonstration, which is
ever more powerful and prevailent than Precept, or even Preaching it
self. If this have edifi'd effectual, 'tis all I wish; and that your Lordship
will be pleas'd to accept the humble Offering, is all I beg, and the greatest
Glory I care shou'd be done.</p>

            <l>HOW vain have prov'd the Labours of the Stage,</l>
            <l>In striving to reclaim a vitious Age!</l>
            <l>Poets may write the Mischief to impeach,</l>
            <l>You care as little what the Poets teach,</l>
            <l>As you regard at Church what Parsons preach.</l>
            <l>But where such Follies and such Vices reign,</l>
            <l>What honest Pen has patience to refrain?</l>
            <l>At Church, in Pews, ye most devoutly snore,</l>
            <l>And here, got dully drunk, ye come to roar;</l>
            <l>Ye go to Church to glout, and Ogle there,</l>
            <l>And come to meet more lewd convenient here:</l>
            <l>With equal Zeal ye honour either place,</l>
            <l>And run so very evenly your Race,</l>
            <l>Y' improve in Wit just as you do in Grace.</l>
            <l>It must be so, some Daemon has possest</l>
            <l>Our Land, and we have never since been blest.</l>
            <l>Y' have seen it all, or heard of its Renown,</l>
            <l>In reverend shape it stalk'd about the Town,</l>
            <l>Six Yeomen tall attending on its frown.</l>
            <l>Sometimes with humble note and zealous lore,</l>
            <l>'Twou'd play the Apostolick Function o'er:</l>
            <l>But, Heav'n have mercy on us when it swore.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:61241:4"/>Whene'er it swore, to prove the Oaths were true,</l>
            <l>Out of its mouth at random Halters flew</l>
            <l>Round some unwary neck, by Magick thrown,</l>
            <l>Though still the cunning Devil sav'd its own:</l>
            <l>For when the Inchantment could no longer last,</l>
            <l>The subtile Pug, most dexterously uncast,</l>
            <l>Left awful form for one more seeming pious,</l>
            <l>And in a moment vary'd to defie us:</l>
            <l>From silken Doctor, home-spun <hi>Ananias</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Left the lewd Court, and did in City fix,</l>
            <l>Where still by its old Arts it plays new Tricks,</l>
            <l>And fills the heads of Fools with Politicks.</l>
            <l>This Daemon lately drew in many a Guest,</l>
            <l>To part with zealous Guinny for—no Feast.</l>
            <l>Who, but the most incorrigible Fops,</l>

all,—Very good, Sir; heark ye, I hope she's young and handsome; or if she be
not, amongst the numerous lusty-stomacht Whigs that dayly nose your publick Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
some may be found that either for Money, Charity, or Gratitude, may requite
your Treats. You keep open house to all the Party, not for Mirth, Generosity, or
good Nature, but for Roguery. You cram the Brethren, the pious City-Gluttons,
with good Cheer, good Wine, and Rebellion in abundance, gormandizing all Comers
and Goers, of all Sexes, Sorts, Opinions, and Religions, young half-witted Fops, hot-headed
Fools, and Malecontents: You guttle and fawn on all, and all in hopes of
debauching the Kings Liege-people into Commonwealths-men; and rather than
lose a Convert, you'll pimp for him. These are your nightly Debauches.—Nay,
rather than you shall want it, I'll cuckold you my self in pure Revenge.</p>

Live peaceably, and do not trouble your decrepid Age with business of State.</p>
                  <l>Let all things in their own due order move,</l>
                  <l>Let <hi>Caesar</hi> be the Kingdoms care and love:</l>
                  <l>Let the Hot-headed Mutineers petition,</l>
                  <l>And meddle in the Rights of Just Succession;</l>
                  <l>But may all honest hearts as one agree</l>
                  <l>To bless the King, and Royal <hi>Albanie.</hi>

            <head>EPILOGUE,
Written by a Person of Quality.
SPOKEN by Mrs. BOTELER.</head>
            <l>MY Part, I fear, will take with but a few,</l>
            <l>A rich young Heiress to her first Love true!</l>
            <l>'Tis damn'd unnatural, and past enduring,</l>
            <l>Against the fundamental Laws of Whoring.</l>
            <l>Marrying's the Mask, which Modesty assures,</l>
            <l>Helps to get new, and covers old Amours;</l>
            <l>And Husband sounds so dull to a Town-Bride,</l>
            <l>You now-a-days condemn him ere he's try'd;</l>
            <l>Ere in his Office he's confirm'd Possessor,</l>
            <l>Like Trincaloes you chuse him a Successor,</l>
            <l>In the gay spring of Love, when free from doubts,</l>
            <l>With early shoots his Velvet Forehead sprouts.</l>
            <l>Like a poor Parson bound to hard Indentures,</l>
            <l>You make him pay his First-fruits ere he enters.</l>
            <l>But for short Carnivals of stoln good Cheer,</l>
            <l>You're after forc'd to keep Lent all the Year;</l>
            <l>Till brought at last to a starving Nuns condition,</l>
            <l>You break into our Quarters for Provision:</l>
            <l>Invade Fop-corner with your glaring Beauties,</l>
            <l>And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ice our Loyal Subjects from their Duties.</l>
            <l>Pray, Ladies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave that Province to our care;</l>
            <l>A Fool is the Fee-simple of a Player,</l>
            <l>In which we Women claim a double share.</l>

               </gap> Woodcocks is our proper Trade.</l>
            <l>If by Stage-Fops they a poor Living get,</l>
            <l>We can grow rich, thanks to our Mother Wit,</l>
            <l>By the more natural Blockheads in the Pit.</l>
            <l>Take then the Wits, and all their useless Prattles;</l>
            <l>But as for Fools, they are our Goods and Chattels.</l>
            <l>Return, Ingrates, to your first Haunt the Stage;</l>
            <l>We taught your Youth, and help'd your feeble Age.</l>
            <l>What is't you see in Quality we want?</l>
            <l>What can they give you which we cannot grant?</l>
            <l>We have their Pride, their Frolicks, and their Paint.</l>
            <l>We feel the same Youth dancing in our Blood;</l>
            <l>Our dress as gay—All underneath as good.</l>
            <l>Most men have found us hitherto more true,</l>
            <l>And, if we're not abus'd by some of you,</l>
            <l>We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re full as fair—perhaps as wholesome too.</l>
            <l>But if at best our hopeful Sport and Trade is,</l>
            <l>And nothing now will serve you but great Ladies;</l>
            <l>May question'd Marriages your Fortune be,</l>
            <l>And Lawyers drain your Pockets more than we:</l>
            <l>May Iudges puzzle a clear Case with Laws,</l>
            <l>And Musquetoon at last decide the Cause.</l>
