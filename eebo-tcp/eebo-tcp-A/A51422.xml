            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Very much congratulate this occasion, though
I readily acknowledge, that this poor Present
brings small advantage to any, but him that gives
it; who gains thereby the opportunity of publickly
owning those great respects he shall alwayes pay
your name, and of setting his hand to a paper, as a
voluntary surrendry to you, of all his good Wishes,
and Services. If the Treat he provided be not so
well drest, or serv'd up, as it ought to be, pray let
him beg pardon, with that common, yet necessary
excuse of a young House-keeper, one not well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
and scarce with any thing in readiness. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Garden newly planted, very little, or no
fruit to be expected the first year, and the unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Planter, not as yet well skill'd, in keeping off
the cold winds, and nipping Frosts; howsoever he
intreats you to receive what he has rais'd, and to eat
kindly of his first-fruits, with which the greatest
men have been alwayes pleased, and Heaven claims
them before other off rings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97737:3"/>
Now dear Sir, as I once lov'd you with your
other Brothers, so those hopeful Gentlemen being
dead, I will center my good wishes on you; may you
joyn their virtues and sweetness to your own, may
you be one fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <l>WHo dares be witty now, and with just rage</l>
            <l>Disturb the vice, and follies of the Age?</l>
            <l>With Knaves and Fools, Satyr's a dang'rous fault,</l>
            <l>They will not let you rub their sores with salt.</l>
            <l>Else <hi>Rose-streets</hi> Ambuscade shall break your head,</l>
            <l>And life in Verse, shall lay the Poet dead.</l>
            <l>Since therefore such unequal Iudges sit,</l>
            <l>Who for suspicion punish men of Wit,</l>
            <l>'Twill be self-preservation to be dull,</l>
            <l>It cracks the credit but preserves the skull.</l>
            <l>Henceforth live long and undisturbed lives,</l>
            <l>Your Countrey-Worships, and your tawdry Wives,</l>
            <l>The flaunting Punk and Ladies eldest Son,</l>
            <l>All such who are by mutual crimes undone;</l>
            <l>Like Lakes look green and flourish to the Eye,</l>
            <l>But yet for want of stirring putrifie.</l>
            <l>For I am told that Fop, and eke the Clown,</l>
            <l>Iointly subscribe Petitions in each Town,</l>
            <l>And swear all Satyr with bold truth shall down.</l>
            <l>Why, cry they, What has wit to do with me?</l>
            <l>With this Mans folly, or his knavery,</l>
            <l>It is not fit we lose our property.</l>
            <l>We'll pound the Poet up in small extent,</l>
            <l>Far from his arbitrary Government.</l>
            <l>Birth-right is birth-right, and he shall not rail,</l>
            <l>We are undone, if common sense prevail.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> now shall be the rule,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for the Knave and Fool.</l>
            <l>Therefore the Poet that designs this Treat,</l>
            <l>Ventures to serve up light and innocent meat.</l>
            <l>And since high season'd sauce don't well agree,</l>
            <l>Excuse a strangers plainer Cookery.</l>
            <l>For to extreams you do the Poet drive,</l>
            <l>And make him leave his best prerogative.</l>
            <l>So the poor Beaver lest he prove a prey,</l>
            <l>Bites off his dearest part, and throws away.</l>

though we be never so glorious for birth or parts, like him
alas how soon we set! 'tis pity noble Sir that men of parts—</p>

               <p>—Again Fool brushing up your thredbare phrases<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
your nasty ends of Gold and Silver, your tawdry intellectual
Wardrobe, you had best tell me what's a Clock without your
foolish sentences and morals—Thou everlasting Coxcomb, are

               <p>Most excellent Rogue! flowers? no your weeds rise
thick, and I will root out them or thee, thou gross nauseous
Fool: laughter which first thou tookest as an applause, since it
hath been the cause of thy disease, shall be thy cure, and thou

vow'd to punish his disobedience if he contracted not a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

               <p>But to be serious, the only way to procure your Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
is by keeping off my Father; who to speak dutifully of
him seems in the Autumn of his life to pretend a second
Spring: I will assure you your Rival is very brisk with her;
therefore pray Court your Widow to the purpose, and give her
greater assurance of you, that my Father may be diverted from
clapping me into a Nunnery; and that is the end of my giving
you this trouble. Would to God I could tell him plainly that
I love him.</p>

Behold most noble <hi>Cunophilus,</hi> a Beauty in these Meads, which
<hi>Flora</hi> her self would blush at and be proud of, behold how
Natures pretty Wildness does exceed all the feeble Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

interrupted by the clamorous Importunity of a pretty chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Animal, which by it's Colour did seem to be of the
<hi>Dominican</hi> Order among the Fowl, and was in Brief a <hi>Magpy.</hi>
At first we considered whether Joy or Anger or what Passion
it might be, had surpriz'd the chequer'd Fowl, and caus'd
its sudden Extasie, when lo! hard by we spy'd that garru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and domestick Bird, vulgarly call'd a <hi>Hen,</hi> which soon
became more lowd and sonorous than the other. The Cause
of which we soon perceiv'd to be a sudden Joy it had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for it's safe and happy Delivery of an oviparous Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which no sooner had the unopining Bird deserted;
but its false and chattering Neighbour leaped hastily on the
forsaken Birth. And after making a little Fracture on the
too brittle Defence, (I mean the Shell) the gready immoral
and voracious Fowl did in a Moment absorb all the precious
Liquor it contain'd.</p>
