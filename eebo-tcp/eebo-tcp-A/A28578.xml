            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Revolution of this little Volume, you will encounter se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral intervening Causes of observation, and other accidents of such nature in these times that may move thee even to admiration; as First, That these Papers have layn so long Conceal'd before their appearance in Puqlick they being of such value, so much desired and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, by all Ingenious men of all degrees, Especially, those who had a knowledg of the Author, which scruple thus I answere. First, That the Author Composed many of these


<pb facs="tcp:56336:3"/>
things to gratify the Commands of his Superiours, or the Request of his Friends or Acquaintance, as <hi>Chevy-Chace</hi> for the <hi>R.R.</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and some for other Honoable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp; some for his own humor, or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Friends, and these he distributed according as they were related in the first fair Corrected Copy, and left nothing in his own Custody but indigested, foul, torn, scattering Papers, and those in such disorder, that, after they came to my hands, (though kept together with all the care could be improv'd, yet) of some Songs it may be one <hi>Canton</hi> came to my hand as this day, and peradventure (five Months after) I might be so fortunate as to get the rest, or most part of it together, and some utterly disjointed till reduced as they now are (I hope) not very lamely by my weak Genius. Another obstacle my


<pb facs="tcp:56336:3"/>
unacquainted and stranger Interest with many who were of his Intimacy, so that I could not retrive many whole Copies that I have only heard of, but never get the posession of them, Therefore it is desired of all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who have any of the Authors Latine Songs or Verses which are not found in this Impression, that they will be pleased to bring or send Copies of them to Mr. <hi>John Eglesfield</hi> Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller, at the Sign of the <hi>Marigold</hi> in <hi>Fleet-Street London,</hi> whereby to incourage another Edition, and it shall be received as a great Favour and Civility by the Publisher, and a worthy gratitude to the memory of the Deceased Author. Some again, were very hardly recovered out of the hands of an illiterate welch Cook wench, who had designed to sacrifice them to the hoary Hen on the Spit, in which service two of these (the one begining <hi>Absit

maetus phantasticus,</hi> and another begining, <hi>Schismaticis ex omnibus</hi>) lost all their English Tongue. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother attractive of Admiration is, that you find a thing of this nature and valew, (a work never seen Printed in <hi>England,</hi> or (that I ever heard of) in any part of the World beside before this) should pass the Press without the Patronage of some worthy Maecenas. To which I answer, that among some of the Authors Papers, I found a preparative Dedication (provided he had lived to Print them himself;) to a Person of Quality, who was a most Constant Countenancer of the Authors Muse, while he was living. To this Person I did address my self. And desired, that, for his dead Friends sake he would be pleased to accept it, but he return'd me with this modest Complement, <hi>Detur Digniori,</hi> now since I had no pretentions to Intitle


<pb facs="tcp:56336:4"/>
this Book mine own I sought no farther into the Catologue of mine own Friends: Thus (kind Reader) thou seest it comes to thy hands in a blew Coat without a Badg, I hope thou wilt use it more Favourably then to reject it before thou knowest what it is, but as thou findest it let it suffer, without straining thy Judgement or Censure.</p>

            <l>In <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Bosom, he's not hush, yet dy'd</l>
            <l>Just as he did, at turning of the Tide;</l>

               <hi>Charon</hi> ne're made a quicker pass to Hell.</l>
            <l>Now, as there must be wonder to pretend</l>

            <l>Just as when Hotspurs Grannams Cat (of Yore)</l>

            <l>Then full of this same blustring Sir, he throws</l>
            <l>Down sturdy Oakes and Elms, to kiss his Toes.</l>
            <l>Himself was heart of Oak, so now they strive</l>

            <l>Trees now, as Men, like Trees reverted stood,</l>
            <l>You'd think the Devil had been gon to wood.</l>
