         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Was now arrived at the Meridian of my age, and enjoyed such a plenty of every thing, that I soon forgot the many miseries I had lately suffered, since my banishment from <hi>England.</hi> I governed my Family with a most absolute command, and

               </gap>h by entertaining my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men with necessaries. I kept so punctual a corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the <hi>Banian</hi> Merchants, that I could command any thing; and by their means found the way of Trading, by which I considerably enriched my self so that at the departure of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, I have<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing cast up an account of my Estate, found that I had gained above 2000 Rupees, (which being the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try money, and worth about 2 <hi>s.</hi> a piece, amounted to 200 <hi>l.)</hi> also I had a good parcel of Diamonds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those I had cheated the <hi>Banian</hi> of at my first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; several other Commodities I had by me, which (with my Housholdstuff which was considerable) did in all amount to a great value. The Fleet being depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the chief of our Trading ceased, and now it was vacation time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I (hating idleness, and somewhat weary of my Wives company) being desirous of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, set out to view the Country: to which end tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money with me, and all other necessaries, I hired an <hi>Indian</hi> Coach, which is a kind of a Chariot with two wheels, and will hold about four persons; this Coach was drawn with two Oxen, who will travel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty miles a day: my charge was not much for about eighteen pence a day paid my Coach-man, and kept his Cattel. Thus did I ramble about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, visiting other of my acquaintance, where I had a full enjoyment of every thing the Country afforded: for we had notonly the Country drink called <hi>Toddee</hi> which is made of the juyce of several Trees, and <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch</hi> vvhich is made of Rack-lime, or lime-vva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Brammanes</hi> being first, have their name either of <hi>Brammon,</hi> who was the first of that Tribe; or else from <hi>Breman,</hi> who was the first of the second Age to whom the Law was delivered, of which there are two sorts, the common, and the more special; the common <hi>Brammane</hi> hath eighty two Casts or Tribes, which are distinguished by the names of the places of their first habitations. These discharge the Ministerial function, in praying and reading their Law to the People, in which they use a kind of minical fantastical gesture, and a singing tone. They are first received into that Order at seven years of age, using the ceremony of washing and shaving their heads, only leaving one lock; they are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32749:15"/>
bound to a Pythagorean silence, and prohibited haulking, spitting or coughing, wearing about there loins a girdle of an Antilopes skin, and another thong of the same about their neck, descending under the left arm: At fourteen years of age they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be <hi>Brammanes</hi>; exchanging those leather thongs for four sealing threads that come over the right shoulder, and under the right arm, which they sleep withal, in honour of God and the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; they are, enjoyned to keep all things in the <hi>Brammanes</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>The more special sort of <hi>Brammanes</hi> are of the Cast of the <hi>Shuderys</hi> or <hi>Merchant-man,</hi> who for devotion take this condition; He wears a woollen garment of white, reaching down to the middle of the thigh, the rest is naked: his head is always uncovered; they do not shave, but pluck off all the hair from their heads and beards, leaving only one lock.</p>
            <p>There are several Casts of these, that live more strictly then the rest; for these never marry, are very moderate in their dyet, and drink nothing but water boiled, that so the vapour, which they suppose to be life, may go out; they sweep away and disperse their dung, lest it should generate worms that may hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pray what do rich Farmers and griping Cormorants, but steal when they exact in their prices of Corn, and grind the faces of the poor; and how can Shop-keepers wipe off the aspersion of theft from themselves when they sell a commodity for twice the worth of it, and thereby cozen the buyer; so that we see if things be rightly scanned, there be more thieves in the World than only Taylors, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Weavers: and what I pray you makes Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, Bayliffs, and Catch-poles so to envy us, and persecute as they do, but that one trade still envies, and malignes another, and would by their good wills suffer no other thieves but themselves; this it is that makes them so double diligent in the surprizal of us, though oftentimes our craft forestalls their malice, as I shall instance to you in one memorable example.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>MY mind being thus fully fixt to follow thieving I began my trade in robbing of Orchards, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home with laden thighs, the Trophies and spoil of Cherry-Trees, Pear-trees, and Plumb-trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Mother instead of correcting me for what I had done, encouraged me to proceed on as I had begun; for indeed hunger had pinched us sorely ever since my Brothers death, my Fathers cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit being so eclipsed thereby, that until people saw he would mend his Life scarce any one would employ him to mend their shoes. One Orchard I especially, haunted, it being stor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d with most gallant fruit, whose very looks me thought did cry, <hi>Come eat me</hi>: but so often I frequented the same, especially one tree of more choice fruit than all the rest that the owner of the Orchard (being a rich miserable chuff, and one who knew on which side his bread was butter'd) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mistrust the same, and therefore that his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might not depart away without first taking leave of him, he resolved for the future to prevent the same, and having some little skill in Negromancy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32749:28"/>
against my next coming, he inchanted his Orchard with a Night-spell.</p>
            <p>This he placed at the four corners of his Orchard in the hour of <hi>Mars,</hi> and is of such force being rightly applyed, that whoever comes within the bounds thereof, must be forced to stay there till Sun-rising. Now I that knew not any thing of what was done, according to my accustomed course, having the dark night for my coverture, boldly entred the Orchard, and with winged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32749:28"/>
having for some space of time before eaten nothing but green fruit, had gotten a terrible looseness, which with the fright that I was in, and the smart that I felt, wrought such effects in my belly, that opening my posteriors, I discharged a whole volley of excrements in his face. This action of mine made him at once to shut his eyes, open his mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unloose his hands, so that the charm being broken, and my body at liberty, I quickly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my self out of the Orchard, leaving the old catter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pillar in a very stinking condition, not to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died without the benefit of that cleansing element of water.</p>

            <p>It being then winter time, the Evenings long and dark, we bought a Link for three pence, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our whole estate; with this about ten of the clock in the night we marc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had soon out stripped the Grocer, who returned back, found that the Devil migh dance upon his Counter for there was never a cross to keep him from it. About an hour after we met together at home, where having counted our purchase, we found that it amounted to seven pounds eighteen shillings and six pence So long as this money lasted, the pot, the spit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Pitcher was never idle; but what was thus got over the Devils back was soon spent under his belly, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>One thing I observed of my Master; that if the Reckoning once came to be above three shillings, he would be sure to bring in 6 pence or eight pence more than it was, then when the Company were going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he would say <hi>Nay stay Gentlemen and take my half dozen Cans before you go,</hi> which most commonly produced another reckoning, the Gentlemen know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not how to retalliate his kindness without doing so, by this means getting their money with thanks to boot.

            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:32749:39"/>I seeing my master cozen Gentlemen so frequently thought with my self that I might cozen them al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </q>
            <p>And therefore when he was out of the way, to the reckoning, I would add a groat, six pence, eight pence, or twelve pence, according as it was in bigne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In Summer, when people drank in Cans, if my Master were in company (as oft-times he was invited by Guests to drink with them) we had a Can with a false bottom that held not above a quarter of a pint, which in the delivery of them I always so ordered as that Can came to his hands, which he would drink off leisurely, and then turning the bottom upwards, it past undiscerned, saving thereby much beer in a day keeping himself sober to drink in other companies.</p>
            <p>In Winter for mornings draughts we furnished our Guests with <hi>Gravesend</hi> toasts, which is bread toasted over night, our plenty of Guests not permitting us to do it in the morning; if we put any of them into drink before our Guests (as sometimes we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do) we would be sure to warm the beer or ale before-hand, and in putting in the toast cry siz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Uncle afterwards comes again to visit him, to whom he relates his change of condition,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32749:43"/>
and how God had blest him with a plentiful estate Now Cousin (said the old Priest) let us again visit your Cellar; when they came there, they beheld a thin, lean, meager fac'd fellow, one that seemed more like an Anatomy than a man; his ribbs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared through his Cloathes, his eyes were sunk into his head, his cheeks look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d like to shriveld parchment, and his legs (which were no bigger than cat-sticks that boys use at trap-ball) were so, weak as would hardly support his body. He went to a platter of cold meat, but had not strength enough to lift it up to his head; afterwards he assayed to draw some beer, but could not pul the tap out of the fasset, so that seeing his endeavours were in vain, with a deep sigh he vanisht away. Now Nephew (said the old Priest) you may plainly perceive what it was that hindred you from thriving before and therefore now since you are throughly instructed whereby to be rich, I shall take my leave of you, wishing with all my heart that all of your profession would leave off their cheating and cozening tricks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and take the same course of life whereby to thrive as you have done.</p>
            <p>Now, said he, what think you of this discourse? is this quite besides the matter or no? in truth (quoth) I, <hi>I</hi> think it is very pertinent to the purpose, and I wish all tradesmen would follow the example, for when they have done all they can; they will find in the end that honesty is the best policy, and to deal justly the high-way to grow rich: the best bed-fellow to sleep with is a good conscience, and well doing (were there no reward for it in the world to come) yet were it a sufficient recompence in it self.

It grieved my heart to see him in this condition, but how to remedy it I did not know; some little money I had which was left of that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I told him we had; then (said he) to furnish me, you must at such a time as your house is full of Guests upon their going away convey a silver bowl into a secure place, which you may afterwards deliver for me to one whom I will send for that purpose, for I will not come to your house my self, because there shall be no suspition of me: I promised him to do as he bid me, appointing him the time when he should send the man, which was the next day, accordingly he came and I delivered him a large silver bowl, which he carried cleverly away. At night when my Master came to lock up his plate, the best bowl was missing, which put all the house into disorder, my Master swore, my Mistress scolded the Servants grumbled but who to blame not any one could tell; onely the maid said she saw it in my hand that afternoon for which I wisht her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

seen it that day: indeed my Master had a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of my honesty or else her bawling might have discovered me, for had they charg'd me with it strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I should not have had the impudence to have stood out in the denyal of it, having that within me which strongly checked me for doing it. But after some small inquisition about it, it was generally agreed that some of the Guests had stollen it away; then next was inquiry made what several companies we had that day, and which of them was the most to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; but the more they thought, the worse they were satisfied not one appearing more probable than another; therefore it was agreed by a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that the next morning the maid and I should go to a cunning <hi>Astrologer</hi> about it, one who was cryed up for art to be little inferior to <hi>Fryer Bacon,</hi> for though he could not make a brazen head to speak, yet he had such a brazen face of his own, as could out fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I was not afraid to go, though I knew my own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uilt, because I always judged that Art to be a meer cheat, and though they lay their nets very plausibly to take the people; yet they seldom catch any but owls and wood-cocks. Knocking at the door, Master <hi>Astrologer</hi> came out unto us so wraped up in his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Gown that you could scarcely see ere an honest limb of him; he had on his head a black cap with a white one under it, which was turned up some part over the black one, that it looked like a black Jack tipt with silver. After we had discovered our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto him, he told us the price of his Art vvas a shilling whether he found out the thief or no; we knew it was in vain for us to contend with him, and therefore we very freely gave it him, by which he perceived that the stars were very au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in that hour, or else (for ought I know) he might have gone without his mornings draught. When he had received our money he very formally set himself down in a Chair, having a piece of white-paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and then taking a pen in his hand, he made thereon several Triangles and Quadrangles, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crotchets and Whimsies which he called the twelve Houses.

            <p>In the mean time my father had disposed of the purchased prize, bought him an old suit with some part of the money, and ranted it in the Ale-house with the rest of it, for what is this gotten over the Devils back is for the most part spent under his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

proceeded to blows, where my Father received such a knock on his pate with a flaggon, that though it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him not out-right yet he survived not long after; making his end answerable to his life: for as he led a troublesome life all the days he lived, so he put the Parish to some trouble at his death, who were forced to be at the charge of burying him.</p>
            <p>I was the less grieved for the death of my Father, knowing, if he had lived he would have brought me to the Gallows for he would have been always in want, and urging me to supply him, which I could not do any other ways then by theft; but that now he was dead I resolved q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now I bent all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to please my Master, knowing I had few friends to rely upon; I was up with the first, and down with the last, and refused no work I was set unto, and I found the benefit of my diligence at last, for it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to visit our Family with the Pestilence, which in a weeks space, swept away all the whole Houshold but my Master and I.

            <p>Being rid of these two Harpyes, I was more than double diligent towards my Master, well hoping that Death with his beesom would sweep him away also, which I judged the rather could come to pass; because the thread of his life was spun out to a fair g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

consider vvith my self vvhat I had best to do; novv I knevv conceit vvould do much vvith him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I first begun to tell him, that he looked very ill as of a sudden asking if he felt no alteration in his body? vvhich at first he said, no; but aftervvards upon my persuasions that he must needs be sick, he soon grew conceited that he was so indeed, in so much, that at last I told him, that he had the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect symptomes of a dying man upon him; those words struck him to the very heart, that without further delay he went to the Window, called for a Porter, and sent him for the Shoomaker I spake of before to come to him presently, and bring a Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner along with him. I asked him what he would do with a Scrivener? but when he told me it was to make his Will. I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o, and so hinder my pilfering when he was dead, for I was now fully minded to thieve from him what I could, notwithstanding my resolution but a little before to leave it off, I feared to be known for stealing the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver boul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Scarce had I made an end of praising his good intentions but that the Shoomaker and the Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were come, to whom out of the Window he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his mind for the disposing of his estate, First he commended his Soul unto Heaven, and his Body to Earth, vvhich I vvished had been racked up in it, before the Scrivener came. Next (said he) for the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32749:48"/>
good and faithful service he hath done me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath to my Boy <hi>Gregory</hi> (for that is my name) the sum of twenty pounds, whereof ten pound to be bestowed on him in Schooling, the other ten pound to buy him Cloaths, and put him out to Apprentice to some Handicraft Trade. I hearing my Master to say this, could not but reflect upon my monstrous Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that I should go to kill him that was so kind to me, and had so much care for my future livelyhood; but covetousness cancels all obligations, and therefore is well termed the Spring head of all ungodliness. Next (said he) I bequeath to the poor of the Parish wherein I live, the sum of fiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pounds, three pounds thereof to be laid out on cloaths for them, to make them apparel, and bestowed on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch as my Executor shall see most needful, and the other forty shillings to be laid out in bread for them, and to be distributed the next four Sundays after my decease, each Sunday alike till it be out. The rest of his estate he gave unto the Shoomaker, whom he made his full and sole Executor, giving him a great charge to be careful on me, and so having subscribed, and sealed it, he betook him to his bed, as prepared to die, and free leave he had to go, both of me and the Shoomaker also.</p>
            <p>To hasten him on the more; <hi>I</hi> perswaded him to sweat, which he was willing to do, so I covered him with as many Cloaths, as he was able to bear, and being in a violent sweat, he called for some strong Waters, whereupon I went to the Pump and filled him a pint of such sober liquor as that yeilded, and brought it to him; which having tasted, he asked me what I had brought him? <hi>I</hi> told him it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good <hi>white anny seed,</hi> he said, it tasted like fair water; I told him, that was only the badness
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32749:48"/>
of his Pallet which could not distinguish any thing; truly (said he) it tasteth so small, that I think you may leave the word <hi>Anny seed</hi> out and call it only <hi>white-water.</hi> Yet notwithstanding this he found such fault, his parching thirst caused him to drink it all off, which gave such a sudden chill to his blood, that what with that and some other slops that I gave him, in three days time he turned up his heels and dyed.</p>
            <p>No sooner was his breath out of his body, but I began to put in execution what before I had intended and first I examined his pockets, wherein I found the sum of fourteen shillings and nine pence; eleven shillings whereof I took, leaving some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I might not be suspected to have taken any, but this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to vvhat I thought to find in his Trunck, vvhich I opened with an expectation to have mine eyes blest vvith the sight of store of vvhite and yellovv pieces, but the clouds dropped no such rain, the Trunk cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not me as <hi>Iupiter</hi> did <hi>Diana</hi> vvith a Golden shovvre; some plate vvas in it, some Bonds and other Writings, but no money. This vvas a shrevv'd cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing card to my high hopes; vvhich promised me Mountains and performed not mole-hills; for as for the plate the Executor knevv of each piece in the house, and Bills and Bonds signified no more to me, than meat an hungry man vvhich he might see and not come at; vvherefore seeing it vvould be no better, I armed my self vvith patience, considering I had not lost by his death, he having given me twenty pound for the bringing me up to some learning and putting me out Apprentice, by which I hoped to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently able to live in the World; and therefore have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing secured the eleven shillings in the Coller of my doublet (mistrusting my pockets might be search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32749:49"/>
I called for a messenger, and sent the Executor word of his death, not bidding him to have a care of frighting him in the delivering of his message, for I did not think the sudden news of his death would make him to break his heart with sorrow, there vvas less fear in that, then of a Userer undoing a young Heir, vvhen he once gets him into bonds. He having received the nevvs, he made no long tarriance before he came to me, bringing a couple of old Women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vvith him to search the dead corps, that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count might be given vvhat he dyed of, vvhich is a thing (you knovv) is usual. But before I proceed any further (having occasion here to speak of these searchers) give me leave to mention some abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and cheats vvhich I have observed to be practiced by them.</p>
            <p>They are indeed very necessary, especially in great Cities, that an account may be given of what diseases people dye of, and that men may not have their lives shortned by violence, which appearing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deaths, may be by them discovered; but these women have their cheats too, for notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing they are sworn to give a true information to the Parish Clarks; yet mony can so blind their eyes, that if a man be poysoned, they can bring it in that he died of the <hi>French-Pox</hi>; and though a house be visited with the sickness, yet if the Master thereof be unwilling to be shut up for loosing his trading, if he do but greaze them in the fist with some mony they will make the Pestilence to be surfeit, and the spotted feaver (which is little inferiour to the Plague) the Swine-pox, and sometimes the Measles; nay once I knew two of those Searchers that for money brought it in, that the party who had the spotted feaver, died of nothing else but the tooth-ach: Thus you see that it is an undeniable
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32749:49"/>
maxime, that there is <hi>Knavery in all trades,</hi> people being now grown so villanous in their practices, that they make the very dead to be accessary to their Cheats.</p>
            <p>But to return to my story: The Shoomaker stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the street, whilst the Women came in, called to me, and bid me if any of the Trunks were open, to lock them up; and throw the keys down to him which I accordingly did, the fear of loosing his Mammen making him to dispence with any danger that might accrew to him by taking the keys. That night was my old Master buried, and a fortnight after (the Bedding and Cloaths being aired in the mean time, and I continuing sound) I was removed to his house, where I took special notice of his great care in performing my Masters Will, and first for the three pounds that was given to buy the poor Cloaths, he bestowed the same on two suits for his own Boys, proving it to be the Will of the dead it should be so; for (said he) they are poor who are in want; and his Sons wanting cloaths therefore they were to be reckoned in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the poor, and policy bids us this, always to provide for our own poor first. Then for the bread, he ordered with the Baker so, that for every ten dozen, he would have a twelve penny-loaf, and yet were they made fifteen to the dozen, vvhich over-pluss above twelve, he also took to himself, so that the penny loaves shrunk to the bigness of half penny ones, and only for the name there was no difference. I seeing how he had dealt by the poor, thought with my self that my Legacy would shrink also like Northern Cloath in the wetting, and my twenty pound come to twenty shillings; but vvhilst I had cause for my self, I vvould not complain of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32749:50"/>
his dealing by others, and therefore expected the event with patience.</p>
            <p>Soon after I was set to School with a fellow that went in black Cloathes, and therefore taken for a man of learning becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e so habited; this man and his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were both of one mind, for he cared not how little he taught them for there money, and they cared not how little they learned for it; but I who had friends to rely on for bestowing any thing upon me afterwards, resolved not to neglect opportunity, but to gaine what learning I could thinking it might stand me in great stead another day, and therefore I so plyed my book, that in a short time I could read English very perfectly, and had some skill in writing and casting accounts.</p>
            <p>During this time that I went to school, I plyed not my book so altogether, but that I observed some practices of the shoomaker, both in his trade and in his office; and first for his trade, I saw he used two sorts of leather, whereof was mens leather, which was strong, fast and would last well, the other he called womans leather, which was not half taned, and would not last ten miles going; this last sort of leather (because it was cheap) he used most, especially in womens shooes and the inner soles of mens? and somtimes I observed that if the inner soles were to little he would slit them in the middle to make them appear on both sides, and at other times with his teeth he would strech his leather as for gain he would streach his Consience, Then for his office, for the bread that was given to poor at the Church on Sunday, he had a weekly fee from the Baker for his custom; and for other gifts that were to be distributed (as there was some Quarterly) that poor man that received them,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32749:50"/>
must either do a days vvork grat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Cabbidge of course Cloath was to make dust-cloaths for the legs of Country Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Wollen caps, and mittens for old Women; all was fish that came to net. When a Gentleman bought a Suit and loak of good cloath, if my Master could but perswade four or five more to buy of the same, out of them all he would steal a suit and cloak for himself. Then for Womens cloaths the cabbidge of cloath of silver, branc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now being the Under-Prentice, my chief em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was to run on errands, so that having thereby an opportunity, I often visited the <hi>Dagger</hi> in <hi>Foster-lane</hi> for Pudding-pies, my mouth always either penny-loaf or Pudding-pie fashion.

received a small snip for every Gown he helpt him to custom withall. Now their way of dealing was thus; my Master bought the stuff, then the Mercer was to justifie that it cost him so much a yard, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps eight or ten shillings more in the Gown than it did, for which my master when he brought custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to him, was to perswade them to the stuff, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching there was not such another penny-worth in the Town, and that he was confident that he saved little or nothing by it; but only for to gain their custome; by which you see he who carries a Taylor with him to help him buy cloaths, carries a Thief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Friend, for the mercer and Taylor was both agreed, and what the first says, the other will swear to.

            <p n="7">7 <hi>Palliards,</hi> or otherwise called <hi>Clapperdugeons,</hi> who go always with their <hi>Morts</hi> at their heels, and draw people the more to pitty them, with <hi>Spere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort</hi> or <hi>Arsnick</hi> raise blisters on their legs, which they can cure again at their pleasure. When they come into the streets of a Town or Country village, they divide themselves, and beg one on one side of the street, and the other on the other side; the purchase which they thus get. They sell to poor Tradse-men, or other labouring people, and with the money are merry at the Bowsing-ken.</p>
            <p n="8">8 A <hi>Frater</hi> is one that with a Counterfeit Parent goeth about with a wallet at his back, and a black box at his girdle, to beg for some Hospital or Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-house; he hath always a <hi>Doxy</hi> whom he meets withall at night at some tippling house, where they lewdly spend what was given him in the day by charitable well minded people.</p>

            <p n="13">13 The <hi>Dummerar</hi> is Cousin-German to the <hi>Cranks,</hi> for as the one counterfeits the <hi>falling sickness</hi> so this counterfeits dumbness, making a horrid noise instead of speech by doubling his tongue in his mouth, but if you give him nothing, he can then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth to curse you privately.

            <p n="17">17 A <hi>Swigman</hi> is a degree higher than an <hi>Irish-toyle,</hi> as a Tavern exceeds an Ale-house, for he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a pack behind him instead of a wallet, and is stored with more sorts of ware than the other, yet differs little from him in honesty; they both pay tribute to the <hi>Upright man,</hi> as to their chief.</p>
            <p n="18">18 <hi>Glymmerars</hi> are such as travel up and down with licences to beg because their houses have been consumed with fire, for <hi>Glymer</hi> in the <hi>Canting tongue</hi> signifies fire. They use a very sad tone in their begging, and tell a lamentable story how the fire destroyed their Baros, Stables, &amp;c. by which lying tales they get store of <hi>Loure</hi> to buy <hi>Bub</hi> at the <hi>Bowsingken.</hi>

            <p>Thus have I given you a brief description of the men, by which you may give a shrewd guess of the women; for you cannot imagine if the one were <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> that the other would be <hi>Saints,</hi> take them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their own Character.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of this sort; the first of them are called <hi>Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2 <hi>Dells</hi> are young wenches that have not lost their maiden-heads, but being once deflowred, (which commonly is when they are very young) they then change the name of <hi>Dell</hi> into <hi>Doxy,</hi> even as maids when they come to be married, loose that appellation, and are called women.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Doxys</hi> are such as have been deflowred by the <hi>Upright men,</hi> and are after common to any of the Brother hood. They will if they see convenient for a small piece of money prostitute their bodies to any that will deal with them, and do too often murther those Infants which are so gotten. They have one special badge to be known by, for most of them go working of laces and shirt strings or such
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32749:64"/>
like stuff, only to give colour to their idle wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring.</p>

            <p n="5">5. An <hi>Autem Mort</hi> is another sort of these <hi>she-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> and differs only from a <hi>walking Mort</hi> in that she is married; for <hi>Autem</hi> in the Canting tongue signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a <hi>Church,</hi> although that be a place she seldome comes at. They commonly walk with their Wallets on their shoulders, and <hi>Slates</hi> or sheets at their backs, and will pilser any thing that lies carelesly about houses, which they call in their language <hi>Nilling of the ken.</hi> Their Husbands commonly are <hi>Rufflers, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right men, Wild Rogues, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. The last of this <hi>Ragged Regiment</hi> are called <hi>Bawdy Baskets</hi> which are Women that walks with Baskets or Cap-cases on their arms, wherein they have pins, points, needles, and such like things to sell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> going thus from house to house to sell their ware; buy <hi>Cunny-skins</hi>

But I have dwelt too long upon this filthy subject, I shall only give you a brief Character of a <hi>Canting Rogue,</hi> and so return to the progress of my own life.</p>
            <p>He should seem by his rambling mind to be begot by some Intelligencer under a hedge, for he is wholly addicted to travel, and hath one especial priviledge above most Travellers that he is never out of the way. He is not troubled with making of Joynctures; he can divorce himself without the Fee of a <hi>Proctor,</hi> nor fears he the cruelty of Overseers of his Will; for there is small danger of his Children being cheated of their Estates, by which means he makes not work for the Lawyers after his decease. He leaves his children all the World to <hi>Cant</hi> in, and all the people to be their fathers to provide for them. His language is always one and the same; the Northern speech differs from the South, Welsh from the Cornish, but <hi>Canting</hi> is general, nor never could be altered by Conquest of the <hi>Saxon, Dane,</hi> or <hi>Norman.</hi> He will not beg out of the limit prescribed him by the <hi>Upright-man,</hi> though he starve nor falsifie his oath, if he swear by his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> (which is the <hi>Mass</hi>) though you hang him, and to show himself a true subject of their Common-wealth, he pays his custom as truly to his Grand Rogue as tribute is paid to the Great Turk.</p>

            <p>IT was then the Spring of the year when I took this lazy trade of life upon me; the harmony of the Birds singing and the variety of the Flowers which beautified the verdant Fields, made me the more willing to imbrace this sordid course, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I had forgotten my lameness, but very nimbly ran and took her up, putting her under my patcht Coat, vvhere I had a bag sevved in that vvas a receptacle for all stollen goods.

I finding my self caught, would gladly have given him the slip, but some of his servants, as well as himself stop'd me, without any more ado the <hi>Harman-beck</hi> was sent for, who being a neighbour was quickly come, and by this time I had a great train of Boys and Girls to attend me: I needed not much examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus taken in the manner, but however they were all desirous to see my sore leg; I was forced to let them do what they would with me, knowing there was no remedy but patience, and so I suffered them to unrowl and take off the Clouts and Rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that was upon it, when coming to the skin, that was as whole and as sound as a fish; but though my leg was well and whole, my heart was now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most broken with consideration of what they would do with me; some proposed one punishment, and some another, but at length to the Whipping Post I was led, where my doublet and shirt being stript off, my back was so long laced with a Cart-whip that I Capered and flounced like a Horse in a quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and I was as fast too, being hand-cuffd so that I could not stir. It was well it was the Spring time, for I lost blood enough to purge away the gross humours without the help of a Surgeon, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being supplyed by a Thrasher who took as much pains upon me as would have Thrashed a bushel of Pease; but at length there was a cessation, and a new parley began wherein it was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that further course should be taken with me, and considering that there was a kind of Felony committed upon the Hen; they advised and agreed to lead me to the next Justice of the Peace to have his Judgment in the Case though I thought it unreasonable to suffer punishment first, and then
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:32749:67"/>
to be Judged; yet it was to no purpose to complain, and all I could say would not prevail with them to let me go, but they would conduct me to the Justice, so that I having put on my Cloaths my shirt stuck to my back and made me sensible that I had lost leather; but for all that on I must, and the Justice living a mile off, the Thrasher who had lashed me, and two or three others made holliday to attend me: when we came before the Justice, he hearing that I had been punished already, was content at my importunity to acquit me from any other, and only to make a Pass to send me home to <hi>London,</hi> being the place where I told them I was born: I not having power to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; was forced to consent to what was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that Constable attending me out of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties to another Constable, left me: this new Constable, who now had me in keeping not being willing to go further with me; for that night put me up in the Cage, where I was locked up, but not so safely, but I made shift to break out, and travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all night; by the next morning I was far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough off for them to overtake me, for all that day I concealed my self in a wood, and vvhen night came I proceeded on my Journey; but it so happened that on the second night of my travel, about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night I was over taken by three persons who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded where I was going? I told them any whether: vvhat I was? I replied a wretched person whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had persecuted, and therefore I was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whether I went, or what I did. Hearing me say so, they retired a little to consult about their affairs, and then one of them coming up to me, demanded several questions of me of my late course of life? To all their questions I returned them such
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32749:68"/>
answers as caused them to conclude me to be a Rambler, and therefore fit for their society, and therefore they asked me if I were vvilling to hazard my self in enterprizing somewhat, that though it might be something dangerous, yet it should be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable. To this I answered, that they should soon find my willingness expressed in the boldness of my actions, and if seconded or assisted by them, I should act any thing that they would direct and appoint.</p>
            <p>They hearing my resolution, soon consented to admit me into their society, and acquainted me with their present purpose, which was to rob a house not far from that place: They told me th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t I must be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and bold not in fighting, for they knew they should meet with little occasion to exercise any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, but in entring the House, and performing other such matters as they should instruct me in. I told them I consented to what they should propose, and therefore desired them to tell me what part I was to act in this Enterprize, and as for a part of the purchase, I should leave that to them, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them to give me as I should deserve. Then one of these persons told me, that he was very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in the house, and gave me an account of the several ways and passages into every Room, and who was lodged in such Chambers. In fine, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that there was but two men, and three wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-kind in the house, and he being a Coach-man, had lately brought the Master of the house home with two hundred pound, of which he had a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ire to rob him; and therefore had joyned these two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with him in the Confederacy. Being thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, we proceed and arriving at the house, I was put in at a window, and directed how to open the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32749:68"/>
doors, which I did, the the Coach-man stayed below stairs, and we other three by his directions went up into the Chambers; the doors we soon opened, and coming to the bed side where the Master of the house and his Wife was, we dravving our swords (for I had the Coach-mans delivered to me) opened our dark Lanthorns, and seeing the man and woman, without many words we bound and gagg'd them: and they leaving me to watch them, went into the other Chambers to do the like to the rest: I being left alone in this Room was not idle; but rummaged about, and found a Gold Watch a few Rings, and twenty pieces of Gold, these I secured for my self, and soon after my Companions returned; when taking the Keys out of the Gentlewomans pocket, we soon found what we came for, the two hundred pound, and so marched off without any stay, or the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I (being sensible that I was well enough paid, in regard of the Gold and other things I had concealed) thankfully received it, and so left them, marching on further to the next great To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n, where the next day I understood a great Fair was to be kept, and therefore I thought that place the most fitting to conceal my self in, and be freest from suspition, I got in a Barn and rested my self, taking some sleep; but was much disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being in great fear lest some misfortune might

befall me; And to the end that I might be the freer from suspect, in case of a <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>cry,</hi> I went to a Sales-mans Booth, which was in the Fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished we with a sad coloured Sute and Cloak, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen like, that I might pass for such a one if occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were my old cloaths I left behind me in the Barn where I stripped my self. Thus did I escape all danger, but my Companions fared worse than I, for the covetous Coach-man not having any thing else whereon to exercise himself; stole a Looking-glass which was below stairs, while we were above, and to conceal it from the rest of his Companions, put it in his Codpiece. When they had sufficiently stayed at the house where I left them, and had shared the prize they went to go homewards, but being flustred with the Bottles of Wine they had for joy drank off, they made it so long, that it was seven of the Clock in the morning ere they parted, and then were they overtaken by the <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>cry,</hi> with a Constable who though he knew the Coach-man very well, and did not suspect him; yet seeing him and his two companions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They were all now deeplier surprized than before, which gave so great suspition that occasioned a search, and in the end they found what they sought for, (the Money;) and that which hung out at the coach-mans bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, were some Ribbonds that were fastned to

the Looking Glass. Upon this Discovery they were all Apprehended, carried before a Justice, and upon examination being found directly guilty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Goal This did I hear of at the Fair that Afternoon as I was drinking in a booth: At the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of this story, if any one had observed me, they might have easily conjectured that I was concerned therein; for I was possessed with so much fear, that I looked like one rather dead then alive: but there was no occasion to suspect me, for the three others my companions being taken and with them the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the money, there was no occasion to make any further enquiry. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hen did I bless my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that I had left them so suddenly, and was so much out of danger, and that Evening I proceeded further on in my way towards <hi>London</hi>; but being well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Silver and Gold, I took up my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a very good Inn, where I had a good Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and soft bed: and slept very well, considering the trouble I was in.

I received this satisfaction, that they being Tryed, were all cast for their Lives; the coach-man hanged, and the other two were to be transported.

How now, says she, you have made a fair Ramble! Is it not time to return? Well said I; be silent a little, and let me speak with you in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; and thereupon taking her by the hand, I led her into a private Room; where calling for some dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nk, I enquired of her how all our friends did, and more particular for my Master. Why, said she, you know well enough that he is dead. At this word I was more dead than alive, neither was I for the present able to ask her any more questions.</p>
            <p>The Drink being brought in, she drank to me; Well, said she, however I am glad to see you here; so am not I (thought I:) but recovering my lost senses I demanded of her how long my Master had been dead. She replyed, a fortnight. Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought <hi>I,</hi> then the Case is not so bad as <hi>I</hi> suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore I proceeded in questioning of her how he died, and many other questions. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he died of a Feavour, which kept him not above fourteen days sick; and he being dead, she was now returning into the Country to visit her Friends.</p>
            <p>Now was I fully satisfied that I needed not fear any danger, wherefore I called for a Bottle of Canary, which we drank off, and she related to me that he was not much hurt by the fall that I gave him for he went again to work the next day, and had made much enquiry after me, but as yet in vain. I told her that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32749:70"/>
I indeed doubted that he had been drowned by the fall which he had received into the water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had absented my self ever since from <hi>London,</hi> wandring up and down in several Disguises; But, said I, I will now go to <hi>London</hi> again but never to serve out my Time at that Trade; for if I come upon a Scaffold again, I shall be much frighted with the remembrance of that disaster. She told me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that now indeed I was free to dispose of my self since my Master was dead, and might chuse my Trade and Master.</p>
            <p>Thus did we spin out several hours of that day and night together till it was time to go to Bed, and then we parted; she the next morning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in her Journey into the Country, and I pursuing my resolutions of going to <hi>London,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise went forward. But by the way met with an Adventure, which I shall relate to you.</p>
            <p>I was now resolved nothing should hinder me from proceeding in my Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and that I might get thither the sooner, I endeavoured to borrow a horse, but could not procure one, I being a stranger, every Person was unwilling to trust me: but at noon-day staying for a bait, I happened into the company of a Trooper, who was likewise tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to <hi>London</hi>; we dined together, and he asking whither I was going? I told him he said he should be glad of my company. I said, that would be very pleasing to me if I might enjoy his; but I could not because he was better furnished for a Journey than I, being provided with a Horse, and I on Foot; he told me that inconveniency might be supplyed, for there were Horses in the Stable to be let. I told him that I would give any consideration for the hire of one, and that he, if acquainted, might do me much
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32749:71"/>
kindness in procuring one for me: he seeing me full of Money, quickly procured me a Horse, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging himself that I should leave the beast at his <hi>London</hi> quarters. My Host being well acquainted with him, and he being to ride along with me, was contented: and I paying five shillings for his hire, had the horse delivered to me, and on his back <hi>I</hi> mounted, thinking my self to be some brave fellow: As we rid along together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we overtook a female Creature, young and handsome, in somewhat an antient decayed, but Gentile garb. The Trooper being a notable well experienced blade, soon fell into discourse with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and found her to be a Rambling Baggage, whose journey was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>London,</hi> and would be glad of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, were she accommodated with a horse: to that I offered her my service, and agreed that she should ride behind me; to which she assenting, soon mounted; and now we merrily put on, holding a pleasant discourse with our female companion. I had a great desire to take a better view of her than I could, being thus on Horse-back together, and therefore perswaded the Trooper to make a halt at the next Town which we came to, where we all dismoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I told him he had done me many kindnesses in

            <p>Well, said he, let us be going from hence, and make you your bargain with her as you ride along by the way, and I will take such care in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that you shall be entertained as Man and Wife at my quarters, and there lie together.

And I finding my pocket begin to shrink, bethought me that it was fit to leave off in time, for all my Silver was gone; and ten pound of my twenty pound in Gold: but I selling my Watch and Rings raised ten pound more; with this stock of twenty pound I was resolved to retire, and fit my self for some employment. My three Ladies never offered to return me the five pound I had lent them, neither indeed could I handsomely expect it; for they had been very liberal in their expences, and had de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clined all other company to accommodate me.

               <p> He being new come to <hi>London,</hi> puts himself Prentice to a Taylor; he gets acquaintance with Prentices of all sorts; is with them at their Tavern-frollicks: he is employed by a Scrivener to make Cloaths for a Wench, he goes with him to her, and returning, the Scrivener promises him an account of that trade; the Scrivener recounts the Waggeries he committed the first three years of his Apprenticeship, and his Masters first cheats by counterfeiting a Seal.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BEing now tome to <hi>London,</hi> I was resolved not to be idle, but settle my self to some one Trade, that I might be able to get a living; and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had tryal of several at fitst a <hi>Barber-Surgeon,</hi> then a <hi>Tapster,</hi> a <hi>Cook</hi> a <hi>Lock smith. Taylor, Baker</hi> and <hi>Plaisterer</hi>: and being still forced for some reason or other to leave them all, did now resolve to fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one that should do my business, and vvhereby I might at all times, and in all plaees, be able to live by my hands, for Lands I had none. I considered of all the Trades I had already been a practitioner in, and many others none suited so vvell vvith my humour as that of a Taylor; wherefore I sought for several Masters, but they vvere all unvvilling to take me for less than seven years, it being the custom of <hi>London</hi> that none can be bound for less time, nor be made a Free-man till they have served so long. I vvas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:32749:74"/>
to bind my self on those terms, knowing my temper was variable, and did believe, I should not hold out to serve such a term: but after several enquiries and tryals, I did light upon a Master who was willing to take me for five years, only this I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to do in regard I already had a good hand in working and being industrious in my employment, so that though I was bound for seven years, yet I had a Writing under my Masters hand; that the last two years I should dispose of my self as I pleased, and yet he could make me a Free-man at seven years end.</p>
            <p>My Master was not only a Taylor, but kept a Brokers Shop, wherein he sold all sorts of Cloaths, new and old; He lived in one of the prineipallest Streets of the City, and was in good esteem with his Neighbours, who were all persons of some quality not of the meaner sort but substantial Trades-men, as <hi>Goldsmiths, Grocers, Drugsters, Scriveners, Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners &amp;c</hi> and I (being now well fitted with Cloaths, and having m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

behold, my face all smearen, my cloaths set full with patches upon the whole cloth, a red clout upon my leg, and supporting my body with a staff, as if I had been a meer cripple. Many a mile we rambled, yet keeping still in our own station, for fear of the <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-man</hi>: but my counterfeit Plea for begging was at last discovered, and to all my dainties, I had whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping chear added; for going one day not far off from a Farm house, the stragling Hens invited me to have a throw at them with my staff, and having struck one of them, I had forgotten my lameness, but very nimbly ran and took her up, putting her under my pacht Coat, where I had a bag sewed in that was a receptacle for all stollen goods. It chanced that the Farmer himself was then on the other side of the hedge, who undiscover'd by me, saw my activity in the stealing of his Hen, and was resolved, though I put it up, that he would not. But I dreading no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, thinking my self unseen, went directly to the House, and as soon as I came into the yard, fell to my old trade, leaning on my staff, and drawing my leg after me, as if scarce able to stand, much less to run.

future, and so turning back my Coat, discover'd my bag, where was not only the Hen, but some other provant I had lately purchased. I finding my self caught, would gladly have given him the slip, but some of his servants, as well as himself, stop'd me, without any more ado, the <hi>Harman-beck</hi> was sent for, who being a Neighbour, quickly came, and by this time, I had a great train of Boys and Girls to attend me: I needed not much Examination being thus taken in the manner, but however, they were all desirous to see my sore Leg; I was forced to let them do what they would with me, knowing there was no remedy but patience, suffer'd them to unrowl and take off the Clouts and Rowlers that was upon it, when coming to the skin, that was as whole and as sound as a fish; but though my Leg was well and whole, my Heart was now almost broken with consideration of what they would do with me; some proposed one punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and some another, but at length to the Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Post I was led, where my Doublet and shirt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stript off, my back was so long lac'd with a Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whip, that I caper'd and flownc'd like a Horse in a Quagmire, and I was as fast too, being hand-cuffed so that I could not stir. It was well it was the Spring time, for I lost Blood enough to purge away the gross humours without the help of a Surgeon; that office being supplied by a Thrasher, who took as much pains upon me, as would have Thrash'd a Bushel of Pease; but at length there was a Cessation, and a new Parlee began, wherein it was propounded, that further course should be taken with me, and considering that there was a kind of Felony committed upon the Hen, they advis'd, and agreed to lead me to the next Justice of the Peace to have his Judgment in the Case, tho I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:32749:75"/>
thought it unreasonable to suffer Punishment first, and then to be Judged; yet it was to no purpose to complain, and all I could say, would not prevail with them to let me go, but they would conduct me to the Justice, so that I having put on my Cloaths, my shirt stuck to my back, and made me sensible that I had lost leather, but for all that, on I must, and the Justice living a mile off, the Thrasher who had lash'd me, and two or three others, made Holliday to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me: when we came before the Justice, he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had been punished already, was pleased, at my opportunity, to acquit me from any other, and onely to make a Pass to send me home to <hi>London,</hi> being the place where I told them I was born: I not having power to contradict, was forced to consent to what was commanded, and that Constable attending me out of his Liberties to another Constable, left me: This new Constable, who now had me in keeping, not being willing to go further with me, for that Night put me up in the Cage, where I was lock'd up, but not so safely, but I made shift to break out, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling all Night, by the next morning, I was far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough off for them to o'retake me, for all that day I conceal'd my self in a Wood, and when Night came, I proceeded on my Journey; but it so happened, that on the second Night of my Travel, about Midnight, I was overtaken with three Persons, who demanded where I was going, I told them any whither; they asked me, what I was, I replied, a wretched Person whom Fortune had Persecuted, and therefore I was indifferent whether I went, or what I did. Hearing me say so, they retired to consult about their affairs, and then one of them coming up to me, demanded se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral questions of me concerning my late course of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:32749:76"/>
life; To all these questions I returned them such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, as caused them to conclude me a Rambler, and therefore fit for their Society, and therefore they asked me if I were willing to hazard my self in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising somewhat, that though it might be something dangerous, yet it should be very profitable. To this I answered, that they should soon find my willingness expressed in the boldness of my actions, and if secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or assisted by them, I should act any thing they would direct and appoint.</p>
            <p>They hearing my Reso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I told them I consented to what they should propose, and therefore desired them to tell me what part I was to act in this Enterprize, and as for a part of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, I should leave that to them, which I desired them to give me as I should deserve. Then one of these persons told me, that he was very well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the house, and gave me an account of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways and passages into every Room, and who was lodged in such Chambers. In fine, I discovered that there was but two Men, and three Women-kind in the House, and he being a Coachman, had lately brought the Master of the house home with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, of which he had a desire to Rob him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore had joyned these two persons with him in the confederacy. Being thus instructed, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and being Arrived at the house, I was put in at

a window, and directed how to open the doors, which I did, the Coachman stayed below-stairs, and we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three by his directions went up into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the doors we soon opened, and coming to the Bed-side, where the Master of the house and his Wife was, we drawing our Swords, (for I had the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans delivered to me) opened our dark Lanthorns, and seeing the man and woman, without many words, we bound and gagg'd them; and they leaving me to watch them, went into the other Chambers to do the like by the rest: I being left alone in this Room, was not idle, but rummaged about, and found a Gold Watch, a few Rings, and twenty pieces of Gold, these I secured for my self, and soon after my companions returned, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I (being sensible that I was well enough paid, in regard of the Gold and other things I had conceal'd) thankfully received it, and so left them, marching on further to the next great Town, where the next day I understood a great Fair was to be kept, and therefore I thought that place the most fitting to conceal my self in, and be freest from suspition.

being in great fear lest some mis-fortune might befall me: And to the end that I might be the freer from suspect, in case of a <hi>Hue and Cry,</hi> I went to a Sales mans Booth which was in the Fair, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd me with a sad couloured Sute and Cloak, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen-like, that I might pass for such a one if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion were; my old Cloathes I left behind in the Barn where I stripped my self. Thus did I escape all danger, but my companions fared worse than I, for the covetous Coach man not having any thing else whereon to exercise himself, stole a Looking-glass which was below stairs, while we were above, and to conceal it from the rest of his Companions, put it in his Codpiece. When they had sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stayed at the House where I left them, and had shared the prize, they went to go homewards, but being flustred with the Bottles of Wine they had for joy drank off, they made it so long, that it was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Clock in the Morning ere they parted, and then were they overtaken by the <hi>Hue and Cry,</hi> with a Constable, who thought he knew the Coach-man very well, and did not suspect him, yet seeing him and his two Companions so flustred, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to hang out at the knees of the Coach-man's Breeches, they made some stay, asking whether he had lately been at some Wedding and had Bride-Laces, which he had put in his Breeches. The Coach-man being somewhat blank'd at this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, knew not what answer readily to return: This caused them to examine him who they were that were his Companions, and where they had been? They were all now deeplier surprized than before, which gave such great suspition, that occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Search, and in the end they found what they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32749:77"/>
sought for, (the Money;) and that which hung out at the Coach-mans Breeches, were some Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons that were fastned to the Looking-glass. Upon this Discovery they were all Apprehended, carried before a Justice, and upon examination being found directly Guilty, committed to Goal. This did I hear of at the Fair that afternoon as I was drinking in a Booth: At the recital of this story, if any one had observed me, they might easily have conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I was concerned therein; for I was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with so much fear, that I looked like one ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead then alive: but there was no occasion to suspect me, for the three others my Companions being taken, and with them the greatest part of the money, there was no occasion to make any further enquiry. Then did I bless my good fortune that I had left them so suddenly, and was so much out of danger, and that evening I poceeded further on in my ways towards <hi>London</hi>; but being well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Silver and Gold, I took up my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a very good Inn, where I had a good Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and saft Bed, and slept very well, considering the trouble I was in. At this Inn I stay'd several days to hear what would become of my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the Assizes were then at hand. I received this satisfaction, that they being Tryed, were all cast for their Lives; the Coach-man hang'd, and the other two were to be transported. This was the end of my peice of Thievery, and I did then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve never to hazard my self again in such matters, lest I came off with as bad success as the Coach-man. I stayed so long in this Inn, pretending to wait the coming of a Sister of mine, that one day who should arrive there but the Maid-servant who lived with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32749:78"/>
the Plaisterer I had Served, and as I suppose was the cause of his drowning: now was I in greater fear than before, for I had lately escaped hanging for theft, and now expected it for murther; and I knew that this wench was malicious enough against me, and would rather injure me by her exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than secure me by her silence; I therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give her the go-by, but could not, for she had now cast her Eye upon me, and discovered me, and came straight up to me to speak with me. How now says she, you have made a fair Ramble! Is it not time to return? Well said I, be silent a little, and let me speak with you in private; and thereupon taking her by the hand, I led her into a private room, where calling for some drink, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her how all our Friends did, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for my Master Why said she, you know well enough that he is dead. At this word I was more dead than alive, neither was I for the present able to ask her any more questions.</p>
            <p>The Drink being brought in, she drank to me; Well, said she, however I am glad to see you here; so am not I (thought I:) but recovering my lost senses, I demanded of her how long my Master had been dead, she replyed, a fortnight, nay, thought I, then the Case is not so bad as I suspected, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceeded in questioning of her how he died, and many other questions, she answered, that he died of a Feaver, which kept him not above fourteen days sick, and he being dead, she was now returning into the countrey to visit her Friends.</p>
            <p>Now was I fully satisfied that I needed not fear any danger, wherefore I called for a Bottle of Canary, which we drank off, and she related to me, that he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:32749:78"/>
was not much hurt by the fall that I gave him, for he went again to work the next day, and had made much enquiry after me, but as yet in vain. I told her, that I indeed doubted that he had been drowned by the fall which he had received into the water, and therefore had absented my self ever since from <hi>London,</hi> wandering up and down in several Disguises: But, said I, I will now go to <hi>London</hi> again, but never to serve out my Time at that Trade; for if I come upon a Scaffold again, I shall be much frighted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that Disaster. She told me, that now I was free to dispose of my self since my Master was dead, and might chuse my Trade and Master.</p>
            <p>Thus did we spin out several hours of that day and night together, till it was time to go to Bed, and then we parted; she the next morning proceeded in her Journey into the Country, and I pursuing my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of going to <hi>London,</hi> likewise went forward, but by the way, met with an Adventure, which I shall relate to you in the next Chapter.</p>

            <p>I Was now resolved nothing should hinder me from proceeding in my Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and that I might get thither the sooner, I endeavoured to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Horse, but could not procure one, I being a

stranger, every person was unwilling to trust me: but at noon-day, staying for a bait, I happened into the company of a Trooper, who was likewise travelling to <hi>London,</hi> we dined together, and he asking whither I was going, I told him: he said he should be glad of my company: I said, it would be very pleasing to me, if I might enjoy his, but that I could not, because he was better furnish'd for a Journey than I was, being provided with a horse, and I on foot: he told me, that inconveniency might be supplied, for there were hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the Stable to be let: I told him, that I would give any consideration for the hire of one, and that he, if acquainted, might do me much kindness in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing me a Horse, engaging himself that I should leave the Beast at his <hi>London</hi> quarters. My Host being well acquainted with him, and he being to Ride along with me, was contented: and I paying five shillings for his hire, had the Horse delivered to me, and on his back I mounted, thinking my self to be some brave fellow: As we rid along together, we overtook a Female creature, young and handsome, in somewhat an ancient decayed, but Gentile garb. The Trooper being a notable well experienced blade, soon fell into discourse with her, and found her to be a Rambling Baggage, whose journey was now inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>London,</hi> and would be glad of our company, were she accommodated with a Horse: to that I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her my service, and agreed that she should Ride behind me, to which she assenting, soon moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and now we merrily put on, holding a pleasant discourse with our Female companion: I had a great desire to take a better view of her than I could, being thus on Horse-back together, and therefore perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Trooper to make a halt at the next Town,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:32749:79"/>
which we came to, where we all dismounted, and I saluted my Lady, who kindly received my Courtesie. The Trooper after some discourse, was well enough acquainted with the Lady, having oftentimes been merry with her, and others, at the house where she lodged in <hi>London.</hi> He call'd me on one side, and told me, that she was a person whom he had been formerly acquainted with, and so might I too, if I would, and if I had any desire thereto, he could and would assist me.</p>
            <p>I told him he had done me many kindnesses in the small time of my acquaintance, and now he had offered that which exceeded all; for indeed, I was much taken with her Beauty, and very desirous I was to enjoy her.</p>
            <p>Well, said he, let us be going from hence, and make you your bargain with her as you ride along by the way, and I will take such care in the business, that you shall be entertained as Man and Wife at my quarters, and there lie together. I was infinitely glad of this his kind proffer, and thankfully accepted thereof, and so after some little longer stay, we again mounted our Steeds, an put forwards: according to his instruction, I courted my Mistress, and without much difficulty, obtained her promise to permit me to lie with her, and so we Rid on till we arrived at the Troopers quarters, where he told his Landlady, that he had brought her some Guests, for this young Man and his Wife, (said he) pointing to us, will stay here all night; they shall be welcome said the Hostess, and so a Supper was provided; for as we did eat and drink with a very good appetite, and my Landlady did accompany us, who I found was very well respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and familiar with the Trooper; and Bed-time
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:32749:80"/>
being come, which I much desired, I and my Lady went to Bed, neither did the Trooper lie alone, for our Landlady was his Bed-fellow; how he spent the Night I know not, but I am sure for our parts, we slept but little, for it was the first time that I ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a Woman naked in my Armes all Night, and I was ravished with delight, never having had so much pleasure. My Bed-fellow was well enough contented with the entertainment I gave her; we discoursed of one anothers Fortunes, but whether she told me the truth of hers, I know not, but I disguised mine wholly from her, not thinking it fit to make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my late adventures; she told me, that the occasion of her late Travel was this, That she and two Women more of her acquaintance, had been perswaded by three Gentlemen to a Ramble and had gone down to such a City in a Coach, that they had for some time continued as three Men and Wives at an Inn, and there had enjoyed a full plenty of every thing; but at length the three Gentlemen had basely left them to pay a great Reckoning in a strange place, and all they had, would not make the one half of it; that they had for some time waited in expectation of the return of their friends, but in vain, so that at last it was agreed, that one of us, said she, should go for <hi>London,</hi> and procure money to redeem the rest, and the lot falling on me, I have prosecuted the Journey, and hope to raise money to relieve and redeem my Companions. I hearing this Story, was sensibly troubled thereat, and offered her my assistance, and she so far prevail'd with me, that I lent her five pound to send to her companions, she promising me to continue either there, or at any other place with me, so long as I should please, and at our coming to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:32749:80"/>
her quarters at <hi>London,</hi> to repay me my money with many thanks. To all this I agreed, and the next day she conveyed most part of the money to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions by a Coach that travelled thither: and thus did I enjoy this Lady for many Nights together, and lying at Rack and Manger: The Horse I sent back at the directions of the Trooper, who likewise conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with his Hostess, and only my Purse paid for all, but indeed we lived sparingly enough, the Trooper being one of the honestest Travellers that I ever met with. The Coach-man who carried the money to the afflicted and distressed Damoyselles, returned, and with him the Ladies, very glad of their safe return, and very thankful were they, not only to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions who s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt it, but also to me, of whom she said, she procured it, and now we all thought of removing to <hi>London,</hi> but one night more we lay at our old quarters, where I had the greatest frollick I was ever guilty of, for that Night I kist with all three of the Women, and pleased them round, by giving each of them a tryal of my skill. What now could I desire to enjoy further? I thought my self to be as brave a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellow as the great Turk in his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he having but his choice of Women, which I now enjoyed to my full content. But morning coming, we took leave of our Hostess and the Trooper, and all four taking Coach, soon came to <hi>London,</hi> where I took up my Quarters with my three Damosels, who made very much of me, and indeed they were the honestest Wenches, and I had the best Frollick that I ever had in my life, but in time I was weary of this life, for what Man can last out always? And I finding my Pocket be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to shrink, bethought me that it was fit to leave off in time, for all my Silver was gone, and ten pound
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:32749:81"/>
of my twenty pound in Gold: but I selling my Watch and Rings, raised ten pound more; with this stock of Twenty pound I was resolved to retire, and fit my self for some employment. My three Ladies never offered to return me my five pounds I had lent them, neither indeed could I handsomely expect it; for they had been very liberal in their expences, and had declined all other company to accommodate me. They heard of their three Gentlemen who had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan'd them in the Countrey, and so wisely plaid their Cards, that they gained all their money again, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting them, pretending the man of the House had assigned the money to me. I scorned to Pocket any of it, but gave it amongst them, and so being resolved to take another course of life, I retired my self from them: and to the end that I might be fitted for an employment, I hired one who was well known therein, to teach me to write more perfectly than I could formerly, as also Arithmetick; I likewise hired se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books of a Stationer, for which I gave him so much <hi>per</hi> week; they being chiefly Knight Errantry and Romances, I took much pleasure therein. I had a mind to diversion, and went to visit my Damoysel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and thus did I live the pleasantest life in the world; but I had so much reason as to think, that things would nor last long as they were, and I had no inclination to stealing, more virtuous thoughts had now possessed me, and therefore a Trade being the only thing that would maintain me, I enquired for one, and setled my self, as you shall hear in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p> He being now come to <hi>London,</hi> puts himself Prentice to a Taylor; he gets acquaintance with Prentices of all sorts, is with them at their Tavern-frollicks: he is employed by a Scrivener to make Cloaths for a Wench, he goes with them to her, and returning, promises him an account of that Trade.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BEing now come to <hi>London,</hi> I was resolved not to be idle, but settle my self to some one Trade, that I might be able to get a living; and having already had tryal of several, at first a <hi>Barber-Surgeon,</hi> then a <hi>Tapster,</hi> a <hi>Cook,</hi> a <hi>Lock smith, Taylor, Baker,</hi> and <hi>Plaisterer</hi>; and being still forced for some reason or other to leave them all, did now resolve to fix upon one that should do my business, and whereby I might at all times, and in all places, be able to live by my hands, for Lands I had none. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of all the Trades I had already been a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner in, and many others, none suited so well with my humour, as that of a Taylor, wherefore I sought for several Masters, but they were all unwilling to take me for less than seven years, it being the custom of <hi>London</hi> that none can be bound for less time, nor be made a Free-man till they have served so long. I was unwilling to bind my self on those tearms, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my temper was variable, and did believe, I should not hold out to serve such a tearm: but after several enquiries and tryals, I did light upon a Master, who was willing to take me for five years, only this I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:32749:83"/>
him to do, in regard I already had agood hand in working, and being industrious in my imployment, so that though I was bound for seven years, yet I had a Writing under my Masters hand, that the last two years I should dispose of my self as I pleased, and yet he could make me a Free-man at seven years end.</p>
            <p>My Master was not only a Taylor, but kept a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers shop, wherein he sold all sorts of Cloaths, new and old: He lived in one of the principallest Streets in the City, and was in good esteem with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who were all persons of some quality, not of the meaner sort, but substantial Trades-men, as <hi>Gold-smiths, Grocers, Drugsters, Scriveners, Stationers,</hi> &amp;c. and I (being now well fitted with Cloaths, and having my Pockets pretty well lined with money, which I had kept by me) was a fit and welcome Companion to the best sort of Apprentices, in whose Society I did soon insinuate my self, and having money to spend equal with the best, I came acquainted with a whole Gang of such Blades, that all my former knowledge was nothing in comparison to what I soon experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them; for their Masters being of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest sort of Citizens, and keeping Countrey-houses at <hi>Newington, Hackney, Stepney,</hi> &amp;c. they often had opportunity in their absence to meet, and keep their Club or general Randezvous, which was commonly every other night, at one of the Taverns near adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and my Master (who did well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that I was frequently abroad, and in what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I spent my time) did not in the least oppose, or contradict me therein; for I soon found that these young Jovial Blades, though Apprentices, yet they were my Masters best Customers, for there was none of them but had a Sute or two of Cloaths <hi>A la mode,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:32749:83"/>
which commonly lay at our house, which they put on when they had any Frollick out of Town, either at <hi>Christmas, Easter,</hi> or <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> or at any other time, when they pretending some urgent occasions, would give their Masters the slip.</p>
            <p>Thus was I one of the Gang, and had liberty to be with them so often as I pleased, by the connivance of my Master, whose profit consisted in my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them; for I soon brought him some new Customers, out of whom he could squeez good store of money for making their Cloaths, and sometimes he made three or four Sutes at a time, yet had no money for his pains, but he was satisfyed otherwis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in Commodities, which were more to his profit; for the Mercer paid his Bill in stuffs, the Draper in Cloth, and the rest either in other good Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they had of their Masters, or with which they were furnished by their Companions. When any of them intended a new Sute for himself, Friend, or Mistress, it was but summoning the Brethren of the Club together, and then the Mercer brought his Stuffs or Silks, the Milliner Buttons, Ribbons, and Lynings, for which they had in exchange such other Commodities as the others could produce: there was only two Trades that had little or no commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to exchange, and that was the Scrivener and Book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eller, and therefore I wondred from whence they should get to be so fine as the rest; but I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served what they wanted in Wares, was supplyed in Money, which was a Commodity would command every thing else. How they should get the Money I knew not, for I could not imagine that in making of Bills and Bonds, the Scrivener could cheat his Master of Money, or that the Bookseller could sell many
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:32749:84"/>
books by the by, and put money in his own pockets, for I knew they were not so vendible a Commodity as Cloath, Silk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But one evening we being at our general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, where we had good Wine, and better compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, being attended by two or three Suburbian Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, who were the Doxies of our Comerades. The Scrivener (having the finest outside, being in his private Sute of Apparel, and having his pockets well lined with <hi>Maslin,</hi> of Gold and Silver) took occasion to court one of the Women not only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly but privately; and though she were till then a stranger to him, yet he won her from her other Friend, and to enduce her to be kind to him, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to him, and ordered me to provide her a new gown and peticoat of flowred Tabbee, and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calling to our Mercer who served us all, gave him as much money as the Silk was worth, and all the engagement he desired from the <hi>Bona Roba,</hi> was that he might have the first taking up of the peticoat, and then if she liked her old sweet-heart best, she might afterwards use her pleasure, either admitting him or t'other to her embraces, or either of them as she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, to this they all three agreed, and the Mercer who took about four pound for Silk was ordered (by a general vote) to spend forty shillings of the money for that present reckoning; and all the rest went Scot-free, and after a lusty cup of wine, some dishes of meat, and fidlars; they for that time broke up their meeting. This liberality and rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality of the Scrivener put me into some confusion, and very desirous I was to know how he gained so much money, wherefore I speedily procured the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel to be made, and delivereth it to him to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:32749:84"/>
I so highly pleased him, that he desired me to go with him to the Ladies lodging who was to wear it. I accordingly waited on him thither, and she receiving him with much chearfulness, accepted it; it was soon put on, and it was not long before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired out of the room wherein I was into another; where I suppose she was so curteous as to permit him not only to take up the peticoat, and somewhat else to his liking, but to dispose of her at his pleasure, for they stay'd together near an hour. Neither was I left alone, but had the old Matron of the house, and a young <hi>Bona Roba,</hi> to accompany me, where we were not Idle, but made the bottles of Sack and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pony fly for it: when their business was over (and ours almost done, for we had so ply'd the liquor that our noddles were fuller of wine than wit) they brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entred the room where we were, and without any coyness fell stoutly to drinking; for seeing us neer thirty one, they with full bowls quickly put us out, so that I was enforced to go to sleep, which I supposed was about 3 hours, and waking, I found my Gallants wanting, but I believe they were not at all at that time idle; for upon inquiry and search, I found them in another Chamber together, where I suppose she had fully performed the agreement for her cloaths to the content of the Scrivener, who now after a fresh bottle of wine, and payment of the reckoning which was no small one, hearty farewels given, and taken of his Mistris, her companion, and the Matron, we left that house, and taking Coach ordered the Coach-man to drive to the next Tavern to my Master, where we called for a room, wine and a fire, he gave me an Angel for my days service, and shifting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, put on his ordinary, and gave me his best cloaths
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:32749:85"/>
to lay up at my Masters, wishing him to acquaint him that I had been in his company, and that would be sufficient for my excuse: I thanked him for his kindness, and Civility, and told him that his bounty had so tyed me to him, that I should at all times be joyful if I might serve him: As for my bounty, said he, I shall for the future be more free to you, and for money you shall not want; for I am in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to furnish my friends, having the command of a great deal of cash which I know well enough how to order to my own advantage, and it is but reason that I should dispose of some as well as my Master; for it is in my power to strip him of the greatest part of his estate, and ruine him in his credit. I being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive after secrets, desired him to tell me how that Trade (which I supposed, only consisted in the making a few small writings) could be so profitable: To this he answered, and indeed it was true, they made not many writings, but dealt in much money, and his Master had an extraordinary way; for (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued he) if my Master wants two or three thousand pound, he can quickly command it, though he began with nothing, and indeed, had every Bird her feather, he hath no estate: But he hath such slights, wayes, and confederates, that he can do what he listeth. He hath one peice of Brass hath yielded him two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound: that is much said I, and there must be more in your trade then I can imagine, and I would be very glad to be acquainted with some of your My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and since you have promised me your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, whatever you shall relate to me, shall be surely and safely closeted up in my breast, and shall never by me be offered to your prejudice, and it may be some of your advice in your affairs may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;

               <p>The Scrivener recounts the Waggeries he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the first three years of his Apprenticeship, and his Masters first Cheats, by counterfeiting a Seal.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen I came first to Prentice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Master (by reason of the Wars, which caused a general deadness in Trading) had but little to do: but he being one of the confiding party, did thereby get acquaintance with several Rich men, and in short time, by reason of the pretended Sanctity, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted by a Usurer to put out five hundred pound, which he did to his content; for he had a Lease of a City Companies which cost seven hundred pound, assigned for security. My Master never having dealt in money before, and now finding the sweetness of <hi>Procuration,</hi> and making of Writings, longed to be at it again: but though he had moneys offered him to put out, yet he could not meet with any security to content; for personal security by reason of the casualty of the Wars, was generally disliked, and Land in the Country was for the same reason refused, and only Leases in <hi>London,</hi> or Lands about <hi>London,</hi> was counted sufficient and approved of, wherefore this Companies Lease, on which he had procured mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:32749:86"/>
did run much in his head, wishing for such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther security, and projecting somewhat, which since he had put in Execution, as I will tell you by and by: but I will first acquaint you how I behaved my self for the first three years of my time, whereby my Master took so good a liking to me, as to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his secrets to me. My Master was always good natur'd, and kind to me, but on the contrary, my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss was cross and froward, so that I could seldom get a good word from her, and she would still em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me in several pieces of drudgery, as to carry burthens from <hi>London</hi> to our Countrey-house, and then I must bring back from thence fletten or skim'd Milk, on which we must feed two or three days in the week, when my Master would allow good roast Beef, which she would send for away: but I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>till even with her for her nigardliness, and when I came to the Country House, I would usually get my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hare of the Cream; and being a Lover of the Pies and Puddings, steal some from her. One time I being in the Larder, had a great mind to a bak'd Pudding that was there, but at first durst not meddle with it, because it was with other good cheer to be served up at the Table to Dinner, where were some guess: but for all that, the loveliness of the Pudding made me take my knife, and turning it upside down, cut out one half of it, and so turning it down again, left it to be served hollow to the Table: but I departed for <hi>London</hi> e're Dinner was served, I know not how the Maids came off. At other times when I came to the Countrey-house, if the Fruit of the Orchard were ripe, then the Gate was lock'd, and I was not admitted therein, but I would have my share by day or night; for I once invited some of my confederates
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:32749:86"/>
to Church thither on a Sunday, and in the Sermon time went with them and Rob'd our own Orchard, which no body else durst attempt because of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiff; nay, I went once from <hi>London</hi> at midnight, and having some of my Copesmates with me, I entred the Orchard, and fetcht out the fruit, which I would be sure should be of the best, and choicest of all the ground, and gave it to my companions, and so we returned loaden to <hi>London</hi>; and thus did I vex her for her nigardliness, and although my Master did well enough suspect me, yet he would only laugh at my Mistress when she was most passionately angry, and say, she was but rightly served. But at length my Master had a Son, who when I came first to Prentice was at a Boarding-School; but in time growing up, his Mother had a great desire to have him live at home and be a Clerk; for my Masters employment increasing, I gained moneys, and bought me some fine cloaths, and wore a Watch in my Pocket, at all which she was envious, and desirous that her Son might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy what I did, and therefore Bound he was to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and though this happened three years after I came, yet such was the injustice that I had done me, that he was not only placed before me in a Seat, but I was commanded to make clean his Shoes, and attend him, as if he had not been a Servant. This though I was forced to comply with, yet I was resolved to be revenged of, and therefore set my wits to work; I did clean his Shoos, but in the edges, instead of greazing them, I anointed them with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them on, and going to the further end of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Soles of his Shoos fell from the Upper-leathers, they being so eaten by the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and he fate at the Coblers-stall whilst they were Randed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32749:87"/>
together again. He was of so covetous a disposition (like his Mother) that though he had moneys in his Pocket, yet he would seldom spend any at the Ale-house, and therefore sate at the Coblers-stall two hours, whilst his Shoos were made fit for him to walk with, and then he came home, and was soundly chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by his Father, my Master, for his staying so long, which pleased me very well that he should be blamed for that fault whereof he had been so often guilty. He being of a sneaking peering humour, I could not be quiet for complaints he made of me, and by his applying himself close to his busine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, he would dispatch as much writing as I did, though I could when I listed, do twice as much in the time, and when he had done, he would be mending and making his Pens ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst business came in, but I would spoil all his Pens by cutting one neb of them away somewhat shorter than the other, so that when he came to write, he had his Pens to mend or new make, and so curious he was, that his Ink must be in a particular Standish by its self, whereto I would often put Oyl, so that it would not write; and then for his Parchment, he would choose the best skins, and give me the worst and greasie, but I would in his absence greaze his Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by rubbing it with a Candles end. Many other inventions I had to hinder and cross him, I found two pair of his Gloves one time, and bestowed some Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lich in all the seams on the inside of them, so that he putting them on, his hands quickly fell to itching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he to scratching, till they were all bloudy, and so hot, that he was forced to put them in a pail of water, and then he cut his Gloves in peices, that he might see what was in the inside, which was no small pleasure to me. He being a trouble and vexation to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32749:87"/>
my fellow-servants as well as to me, they assisted me in my wageries and contrivances against him. In his Mothers absence at the Country House, he kept the key of the Cubbord and Buttery, to hinder us from the better sort of Victuals, but I soon got another key, and had my full share of every thing, and when mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any thing, perswaded him, the Rats and Mice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him of it. When my Mistris came to Town she would have her Lodging in the Chamber over the Kitching, because she would hear if we sit up after her: Twas a good while er'e I could think of a way to cause her to remove her Lodging, but understanding that she could not endure Rats and Mice, I got a great dead Rat, and in the day time put it into her bed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the sheets, so that she opening her bed to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and seeing the Rat, was so extreamly affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that she immediately left her Lodging, and went into another Chamber: but she doubting that we would sit up a nights after she was gone to bed, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we often did, in Company of her Daughter, who was somewhat better condition'd than her Brother, and had many Junkets and Collations; she called her Son to watch, and he being willing to catch us, would come down part of the stairs softly in his shirt to list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; but we discerning his practice, strewed the stairs with pease, and nointed the edges with soap, so that one night down he fell backwards, and almost brake his Rib with the fall, and gave us timely notice to shift away for our selves: his Mother hearing the noise, comming down her self to help him, was served in the same kind, I hearing of this, and all being dark, ran in my shirt and Breeches as if newly awaked, and instead of helping them, went to the stairs and wip'd and rub'd them, and conveyed most of the pease, so
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32749:88"/>
that my Master by that time being likewise up, and having a candle, did not distrust how they had been served, but helping them up, and I assisted my young Master to go to his Bed, the next day he concluded the House was haunted by Spirits: By this means we were rid of his watchings, for after he was once in his Chamber of a night, he seldom came out again to watch us. But he would commonly stay in the Kitching till he saw us all going to bed, neither would he permit me to come to the fire, upon which account we had a bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and I gave my Gentleman such a fall, that caused him to remember it a good while after: but his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remembred me the next morning, for he having acquainted her with the matter, she took upon her to revenge it, which she did in this manner. I according to custom coming to the Cistern for water, to water the shop before I swept it, having one finger of one hand in the hole at the bottom of the bottle, and my t'other being employed in holding the bottle, &amp; being stooping at the Cock of the Cistern, my Mistris came near me, and there standing by me in a Tub a parcel of durty clouts wherewith the maids had newly wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down the stairs, she takes them up and flaps them about my face, so that I looked as durty as a Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-sweeper; and not contented therewith, she joul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my head against the Cistern: I thereupon standing upright and feeling my self wet, faced her, who now opening her mouth, made a great noise with her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate exclamation against me for abusing her Son; I let her go on in her discourse, and apprehending a way to be even with her, coming very near her, let my fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger go from the bottom of the bottle, and holding it over her, it ran all upon her, so that she then having a great belly soon felt her self too wet through, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:32749:88"/>
then she would have been at me again, but I shewed her a fair pair of heels, and ran away. Thus was I still even with them both, and my Master would sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do any thing but laugh at what I did, taking much notice of my unhappy wit; for let her and her Son do all they could, I would be sure to have my share of the best sort of the Victuals; and she was of that dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty humor, that at <hi>Christmas</hi> when she made a Feast, and a great deal of good chear was drest for her guests, she would then afford us nothing but a dish of stew'd Turneps, Milk, Pottage, or at the best, a leg of Beef; and though much Victuals were left in Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and on Trenchers, that she bestowed on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bearer or Chair-woman, that they might report what a brave House she kept, and not a bit was given to us his Servants, unless she had kept it so long till it was mouldy or worse. Once I remember she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised us some Plumb Pottage, and at the time she made two pots full, I asking the Maid wherefore so much was made? she informed me, that one pot full was much better than the other; I being told which was the best, when my Master and Mistress were at Dinner, got a good bason full of the best, and set it by for my self, and then mixed the rest, so that we had all alike. But to lay aside all these fooleries, and now to the purpose, my Master perceiveing me of a pretty smart wit, and fit for his purpose, he employed me in getting of a Seal made, the which I did, and it was like unto the Companies, which I told you was to the writing, upon which we lent 500<hi>l.</hi> He did not tell me the use of it at present, but I soon found it out; for not long after a Deed was made, and the Seal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to it, my Master caused one who was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate to bring it to our shop at such a time, as he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:32749:89"/>
had a Usurer in his company who wanted security for Moneys. In comes our Gentleman, and calling my Master aside, asked him if he could procure 500<hi>l.</hi> upon such a Companies Lease; yes replied my Master, if it be a good one; whereupon the Lease was produced, and the Usurer being there present, looked on it, and liked it so well, that he agreed to lend 400 <hi>l.</hi> upon it: This at first would not please the Gentleman, because he pretended he was to pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> but the value of the Lease being counted and reckoned at no more than 600<hi>l.</hi> he was contented at my Masters perswasion to accept of 400 <hi>l.</hi> upon that security, and my Master promised him to furnish him with a 100 <hi>l.</hi> more on his Bond of another person, a Friend of his. Thus this business was made up, and an Assignment or Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage being made of this Lease, the money was paid, and my Master, as I soon after understood, had 350 <hi>l.</hi> thereof, and the Gentleman 50 <hi>l.</hi> and I was likewise rewarded with Twenty shillings, which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave me. Thus said the Scrivener, was my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters first beginnings in Cheating, which indeed was but small in comparison to those many great ones which he soon after acted; of which you shall have an account in the next Chapter.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>WIth this Stock of 350<hi>l.</hi> my Master set up all his <hi>Knaveries,</hi> and being unwilling to venture it all in one bottom, he let 100 <hi>l.</hi> of it in small sums to House-keepers, which they paid again by the week at least
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:32749:89"/>
40 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> for the use of it; for if he lent five pound, they paid it by five shillings <hi>per</hi> week, and had but four pound ten shillings for their money, and my Master making the Bond in another mans name, he had commonly five shillings, and sometimes ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for <hi>Procuration,</hi> and sometimes I had a shilling or two: thus did he dispose of some. Others he lent upon <hi>Commerce,</hi> which was thus: If he lent ten pound, he was to have fifteen pound for it on such a day, or the return of such a ship, which should first happen; and though there was no such ship in the world came home, yet the time would come, and then it must be paid; and this being counted an adventure, he could take what interest he pleased, as it is customary with Merchants to venture upon <hi>Bottomrie</hi>; that is, on the bottom or keel of the ship, and then for security of payment of the money, though the ship should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, they are wont to insure it at the Insurance-Office; but my Master needed no such charge or trouble for insuring any ship, for he was sure the day would come, though the ship never did; and thus did he make forty or fifty pound in the hundred: but he being once bit and sued in equity, afterwards took a more strict course, for he seldom lent any money thus but he would include in the Condition of the Bond a warrant to confess a Judgment upon default of payment: and to be sure when the time came, and the money not paid, he filled his Bond, which was warrant to confess Judgment, and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a <hi>Scieri facias,</hi> to take execution on body or goods of the debtor, who little dreamt thereof, and then he seized all the penalty, to the undoing of some; and he seldom lent unto any, but he had two or three bound for security, and that he might not be blamed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:32749:90"/>
nor sued, he made his Bonds and Judgments in the name of one who was his Confederate, and was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in the Kings-Bench, so that when the penalty was recovered, it was to no purpose to sue him. And by degrees being now in Credit, and having moneys of other persons to dispose of, he would seldom lend any but upon morgages, because under the pretence of being paid for writings (which he would be sure to make large enough) he would sometimes take five pound for procuring a hundred, and say, though indeed six <hi>per Cent</hi> was as much as his friend the Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer would take, yet he was forced every six moneths to present him with somewhat that should be equal to eight pound <hi>per Cent,</hi> and withal, that he was at charge not only to imploy one at the first to enquire of the Security, but he was at the charge of a Coach to go to see the Estate, and then he will reckon so much for his Pains, and so much for loss of Time, and so much for Writings, and so much for Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and so much for Expedition, and all this must be deducted out of the money: when the six months came that the money was due, then he must have the Interest, and so much for <hi>Continuation</hi>; and this was a courtesie if he let them go so: but if the borrower came not, and readily at the time brought the interest and <hi>Continuation</hi>-money, he had several wayes to bring them in, for suddenly a <hi>Declaration</hi> of Ejectment was drawn up and delivered to the Tenant or Tenants in possession of the premisses, who being frighted at the matter, presently goes to the Landlord, who sensible of the matter, hies him to us. If this will no do, then an Officer is feed to enter an Action and Arest the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, who then is forced to come and comply upon extraordinary disadvantageous terms; for after much
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:32749:90"/>
intreaty, my Master may be perswaded to continue it: the Interest money being paid, as also <hi>Continuation</hi>-money, charge of <hi>Declarations</hi> of Ejectment (for which we will reckon five or ten shilling paid to an Attorney, though it were done by my Master, or me by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) it may be twenty shillings, or forty shillings, for the Arrest, though it may be not above half a Crown was paid for it; and then there must be at least twenty shillings, or forty shillings, to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for his pains, and if the borrower be not willing to pay all this charge, then will my Master <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee an Attorney in earnest, and proceed upon the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Ejectment, and in short time get the possession of the Estate: and thus put the poor borrower to ten pound charge, and if he refuse to pay this, he shall fair worse; for although in Equity the Lender of the money can hold the Premises no longer in his hands than till he is paid his Debt, Interest, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges out of the Rent, yet my Master will so order the matter, that the borrower shall never have the Estate again; for (pretending that the Lender wanted his money, and was forced to sell the Estate to raise it) he will pass it away to another, a Confederate, for the bare Money, Interest, and Charges that is due on it, or it may be, five or ten pound more; and this is all the poor borrower can get in equity, which will cost him more the recovering than it is worth. Thus have we often had an Estate worth two hundred pound, for only fifty pound and Interest, and the poor borrower is forced to be quiet, not having any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. When an Estate is Mortgaged to us, we seldom let it go out of our hands, for if the money lent be not brought and paid just on the day, than we put the borrower off till the next six months, refusing to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:32749:91"/>
deliver up the Writings, and then it becomes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, so that we force them to sell it to us, or give extraordinary Fees, to cause us to release our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; especially if we discover it to be sold to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we refuse to shew the Writings, and so weary out the borrower with delays and pretences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this was but small game, to what we after play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I shall presently tell you, for the 350 <hi>l.</hi> being all put out in parcels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though they often returned with profit enough, yet it was very heard to get 400<hi>l.</hi> together to pay the money that was borrowed, for now it had been lent a year, and the Usurer, though he hath never so good security, yet he loves to see his money sometimes, especially when he deals with a stranger, as the man was as borrowed it; and though my Master might have cheated him of his money, yet he was unwilling so to give over, but proceed in his Trade, which had gained him so much; wherefore my Master upon search and inquiry, found that the same Company (whose Seal he had Counterfeited) had a parcel of Land in the Countrey, not far from <hi>London,</hi> which they had let to a wealthy Citizen, who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over Trading for some years, and now lived in the Country: my Master getting the particulars of this Land soon makes a Lease, and with the help of his Counterfeit Seal, makes it an authentick, so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much trouble he procures a thousand pound to be lent upon it by another Usurer who lived private, and the business was ordered, that the Usurer was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough contented without seeing the Land: my Mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gave his old Confederate forty pound to personate the borrower, and then he paid in the four hundred pound that was formerly borrowed, so that only he thereby engaged that the Usurer to him, who now
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:32749:91"/>
had so good an opinion of my Master, that he soon made it up fifteen hundred pound, and desired him to procure him either good security, or a purchase for it: all which was done in a fair way, to the Usurers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and my Masters profit: and thus did our Trade increase, my Master getting much money, and many a Crown, and half-peice came into my pocket; for he knowing that I was privy to the first Cheat, did humor me very much, and took his Son off from abusing me, and caused every body that borrowed money to give me some gratuity for expedition, so that I had money enough, and the keeping of all my Masters Cash is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my charge: My Master had one rare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance lately, which I will tell you of whilst it is in my mind; and thus it was, he had a Kinswoman who had long lived with him, and some moneys he had of hers in his hands, which was a Legacy formerly given her by another. This Maid being Courted by a Shop-keeper in way of Marriage, the match went forwards, and was agreed upon on these terms; the Shop-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Father was to give him a hundred pound in money to put him into Stock, and my Master was to give his Kinswoman fifty pound, this being agreed on, my Master takes the young man aside, and thus discourses him: <hi>Young man, here have I agreed to give fifty pound with my Kinswoman, which gains you a hundred pound of your Father, now I having not ready money by me, must borrow this fifty pound, for which you must be bound with me, and when it becomes due, I will pay it; This I say you must do without acquainting your Father, and so the business shall be done, and I pray be a good Husband, &amp;c.</hi> The young man soon consented, the marriage was consummated, and all things went well for a while, but within twelve months the young couple having
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:32749:92"/>
run out all, my Masters Kinswoman came again to her Uncle to acquaint him with their condition, and desire his advice and assistance; my Master was much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at this chance, for he expected the contrary, and intended to get back the fifty pound for which end he had the young man bound, that he might be forced to pay the money, when in a condition; but seeing it was otherwise, he considered the matter, and wish'd her to send her husband to him, and be patient, and make no words, and all should be well: her Husband according to order came, and after several checks past for his ill husbandry, he asked him if his Father knew any thing of his Condition? no, said the young man, I have kept it from his knowledge, and he thinks I thrive in the world, and is glad of it? well them said my Master, you know I gave you fifty pound, for which you were bound, and indeed it is still unpaid: now if you will be contented to pay that fifty pound in, I will raise you two hundred pound, so that you shall have fifty pound more in ready money, and see how good a Husband you will be. To this the young man glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consented, and my Master soon after took an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to meet and drink with his Father, and after some other discourse, they joyntly talked of the young mans thriving in the world, and were both glad of the match and good husbandry: but said my Master, now I think on it, there is now an opportunity of doing him much good if he had more money, and therefore you would do well to furnish them; I shall not be backward, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Father, upon a good account, therefore I pray tell me the business: My Master thereupon told him, that with two hundred pound more he might be brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly setled and furnished, for the Lease of his House is to be sold, and I can get it for a hundred pound, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:32749:92"/>
that is a rich penny-worth, and the other hundred pound, I would have him to lay out in furnishing his shop more plentifully, than now it is. Truly reply'd the old man, this would do well: but I have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at present, neither if I had should I be willing to part from any more than a hundred pound at a time; Well for that said my Master, if you please, I will mannage the matter: Thus will I procure two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound for the young man, nay, and I have so great a love for him, that I will be bound with him for it, and when it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hall be due, you shall only pay one hundred pond of the money, and your Son the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: To this the old man after some pause, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle consideration consented, the business was done, and and the money paid. My Master indeed being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Landlord of the young mans House, gained a Lease of it for eighty pound, and made the young man allow a 100 <hi>l.</hi> and deducting the fifty pound he had formerly given him, he gave him t'other fifty pound. Thus had my Master his fifty pound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and twenty pound for his pains in the business. When the mony became due, my Masters confederate the Usurer, in whose name the Bond was made, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the money of the young man, where there was none to be had; and the old man was willng to pay only a hundred pound of it according to Contract, where shall I have the rest, said the Usurer? why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said the old man, if my Son cannot pay you, then let his wives Uncle, meaning my Master: But course was soon taken otherwise, and my Master being fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t and principle in the Bond, made no more ado, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Judgment, and thereupon Execution was taken out against them all, but only upon the old man, who was forced to pay all the money. Thus my Master,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32749:93"/>
by being Principle in the Bond saved himself, regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fifty pound he had formerly lent, and gained twenty pound, besides making of Writings, and this, said he, will serve to help my Kinswoman when I see occasion. I have heard him with good attention, and considering with my self my own petty Rogueries, and how inconsiderable they were in comparison of what he had related to me, could not but burst out into admiration, and told him, that I saw the world was an absolute cheat: and now I find that saying to be verified which I had often heard, That the world consisted but of two sorts, <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> and that the one lived by out-witting and cheating the other; and if there were any honest men, they were such as only lived a contemplative life, and dealt not in this world; their whole thoughts being taken up in the Contemplation of another; Truly, reply'd the Scrivener, if you had known so much as I of all sorts of people, (for we deal with people of all qualities and professions) you would conclude so indeed: and as the poor mans ability will not carry him high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Cheat so much at first, so he attempting it, and being discovered, is quite lost: but if a Rich man or any who had success in <hi>Knavery</hi> sets upon it to get an Estate, it is soon compassed, and the folly and easiness of many honest borrowers, enriches the Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish lender. Thus we both concluded, as sufficiently evidenced by the Examples he had given me: and therefore I desired him to proceed, which he did in this manner.</p>

               <p> He proceeds in discovering several considerable Cheats of his Masters, whereby he grows very rich; also some Cheats of his own, and so concludes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MY Master (continued the Scrivener) being now possessed of a thousand pound in ready Money, there fell out an opportunity of good advantage, (and I have observed it, that there is no loss, but profit enough to be gained in keeping five hundred pound always in a readiness in Cash, especially in our Trade, where so many offers for sale of Land and Houses are daily made.) The Landlord of my Masters house was lately dead, and his Son and Heir being a wild blade, soon spent all the ready mony his Father left, and all the Debts he could well get in; and now to selling of some of his Houses he must go, and my Master known to be a moneyed man, and a Scrivener, was thought to be the best Customer: He therefore propounds borrowing of five hundred pound, but my Master being now possessed of a round sum, and hoping to have a good penny-worth, was very willing to buy. The young man and some friends were unwilling, and could not agree upon tearms, and my Master at last consents to lend the money, provided he may have a Mortgage of all that Estate in that place, which amounted to two hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> which was worth three thousand pound, and said he, you shall not need to make me an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute assignment or sale of it, only a Lease at a Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:32749:94"/>
a year for one and twenty years: But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, and for a collateral security, you must give me a Statute Staple, to which our young man and his friends consented. The Lease was made, and a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for a thousand pound entred into it, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney paid and lent for six months only. The noise of this, and my Masters other Trading, brought him into great esteem both with lenders and borrowers, so that his Name being up, he may lie a bed till noon, and yet get money enough. A purchase of Land in the Country was offered, and my Master bought it for a thousand five hundred pound, of which he borrowed upon a Lease of part of it. The six months quickly came about, wherein his young Landlord was to pay the five hundred pound: but (according to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters expectation) he failed, and then it was to be sold, my Master agreed to give two thousand five hundred pound for it, and so they struck up a bargain, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred he had received before, a thousand pound he made a shift to borrow upon the Mortgage of the Land he had lately purchased; (for, though as I told you he had borrowed five hundred pound of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney when he purchased the Land, and gave a mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of part of it for security, yet he keeping the principal Writings in his hands, concealed that mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and now borrowed a thousand pound more of it) five hundred pound more he raised in ready money of his own, which was two thousand pound, and for the other five hundred pound, the remainder of the two thousand five hundred pound: his young Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord took his Bond for the money, not questioning his security for five hundred pound, that could pay two thousand pound ready money, neither indeed had he occasion as yet for it. This being concluded, the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:32749:94"/>
money being paid, and writings Sealed, my master would not remember to give up the Statute he had for a thousand pound, but he had another now for five thousand pound for security of his bargain, and the young man never so much as desired a <hi>Defeazance</hi> upon the Statute, but mark what followed: The youngster in short time, keeping riotous Company, wasting his body as well as purse, died, and his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother seized on his Estate that was unspent: and among other things, on my masters Bond of five hundred pound, and soon after demanded it, though my master at first was nonplus'd, yet he soon bethougt him of a way how to discharge and acquit himself of it, and thereupon returned this answer. It is very true, your Brother and I had much dealing, and I did give him such a Bond, which I am ready to pay to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, which you tell me you are, provided you pay me what he likewise owed unto me; why, replyed the young man, did he owe you any moneys? yea, said my Master; and whereas you produce a Bond, which indeed is a very good specialty, I shall produce somewhat that is higher, and indeed the highest secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that can be given for any Debt, and that is a Statute Staple: and thereupon he produced one Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute first, that was given for a thousand pound upon borrowing of the five hundred pound; nay, but said the young man, I suppose that this was part of the money that was for the purchase of your dwelling house and others; for that, said my Master, I can shew you a particular Receipt for all the money under his hand and Seal, and also a general acknowledgment in the Deed of Conveyance: wherefore this money I must have you pay me first, and afterwards I shall talk with you further; what do you mean by further
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:32749:95"/>
talk said the young man? why, said my Master, I mean to have of you all that your Brother owed me, which is much more than you think for; for he and I had great dealings together for great sums of money than all this, as I shall further shew you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he produced the second Statute, which was for five thousand pound. This demand of my Masters so vexed the young man, that he departed, and soon began his course at Law against my Master, but he took a wrong Sow by the Ear, for he finding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts he intended on his two Statutes, was too quick for this youngster, and gained a <hi>Liberate,</hi> which he delivered to the Sheriff, who served it on all the Estate of the Deceased, so that by this means all that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spent of the Dead young mans Estate (amounted in Land to the value of four thousand pound) came to my Masters hands, and yet he says he is unsatisfied: and the young man the Brother of the Deceased, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it, for by this means he is bere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of his Estate to go to Law: and when money and means is wanting friends are searce; besides, I know not how he can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, his Brother not having taken a <hi>Defeazance,</hi> as he ought to have done. Here was a matter worth playing the <hi>Knave</hi> for, and would induce some men to leave off: but my Master had so good success in his Proceedings, that he is resolv'd to proceed in them. The money that he borrowed on all the Mortgages, both counterfeit Leases and others, he soon paid off, and yet left himself worth above three hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and money in his Purse. Thus having a good Estate, and now being full of employment, both for buying, selling, borrowing, and lending: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keeps a good Bank of money. If any purchase of Land come at twelve or thirteen years purchase, he
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:32749:95"/>
buyes it, because he knows of a Customer that will give fifteen or sixteen. And thus he will gain five hundred pounds in a weeks time. We lately had one business worth all the rest, and which hath now made him weary of getting money: a Knight having a Lordship in the Country worth two thousand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> comes first to borrow money, and grants a Lease and Statute upon the borrowing of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound: this my Master lent himself of his own money, the Knight within a Month or two being to Marry a Daughter, wants two thousand pound more, which was likewise promised on the same security: by this time my Master was somewhat dreined of his ready money, and knowing that the Knight would soon be with him again, he casts about how to raise more: which thus he does, he borrows 1500 <hi>l.</hi> upon a Lease of part of his purchase of his dwelling house and others, and keeps the grand Writings in his hands; he borrows a thousand pound on his Land in the Country, and another party he borrows fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound more upon a Lease of part of his purchase of his dwelling house and others, keeping still the grand Writings in his hands: and thus having eight thousand pound ready money, he goes to the Knight, and upon treaty, agrees to give him thirty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound for his Estate, which price being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, he borrows two thousand pound upon his dwelling house and others, and then parts with the grand Writings, and Covenants that the Estate is free of Incumbrances, though he had twice Mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it in part: and thus having raised ten thousand pound, he borrows twelve thousand pound more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on part of the new purchase, and the Knight is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to take the t'other ten thousand pound in full
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:32749:96"/>
of the purchase, at two six months, and only takes my Masters Bond: this was lately settled and agreed upon, and all Writings made, and I doubt the Knight will come short of his money; for my Master hath so many Statutes which the Knight never dreams of, having still given them without taking <hi>Defeazances,</hi> that I believe he will be cut off from his Debt, and so must the <hi>Vsurer</hi> that lent my Master the twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound upon a mortgage of part of his new Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; for my Master being resolved to make this a piece of wit, and to do his utmost to cheat them all, did the next day after the Purchase was made, and Writings sealed, caused us to sit up all Night, and make an absolute Bargain and Sale of all that his new Purchase to two Friends in trust, for the use of his Children, so that the <hi>Vsurer</hi> who lent his twelve thousand pounds, had not his Writings of Assignments sealed till a week or ten days after, and when the time comes for payment, he may be chous'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of all, and my master being master of an Estate of two thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> may live and laugh at them all for their crudelity; for he hath so ordered it, that the Law cannot touch the Estate, it may only reach his Person, and as for that, we know it is but a <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> matter, and there he may live all his life time, and spend like a Lord, and when he dies, his Debts are paid, and his Estate goes to his children. But if he hath success for two or three more such businesses as this last, he need not do so, but leave the Cheat to the last cast, and grow infinitely rich, as I question not but he will.</p>
            <p>Thus said our Scrivener, have I given you an account of my masters way to get money, and I have not been without mine: he would many times permit me to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:32749:96"/>
Cheat a little, because I assisted him, and was privy to his concerns. I have one way that brings me in twenty or thirty pounds <hi>per annum</hi>; for all Deeds of Bargain and Sale are to be Enrolled in six moneths after the date, either in <hi>Chancery,</hi> if it be Land or Houses out of <hi>London</hi>; or in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> if within <hi>London,</hi> or the Liberties thereof; and I was once forced to trot to <hi>Chancery-lane</hi> four or five times for one Deed, before I could get it done, and when it was done, all that was to be seen on the Deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was, <hi>Inrolled</hi> such a Day and Year in <hi>Chancery, per m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> such a one. I seeing that, learned to write the Hand they use in Endorsing, and for the future only writ it my self on the backside to shew our Clients, and that was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for not one in a thousand is search'd for, and this is only done in case the Deed be lost, so that now I have got the trick on't to write on the backside my self, and put that money the Register should have, into my own Pocket, and that is a pretty quantity, for an indifferent Deed comes to twenty shillings at so much <hi>per</hi> Roll. Forty other ways have I to get moneys, and indeed, I need not invent ways, for our Trade is so great for <hi>Procuration</hi> and <hi>Continuation,</hi> and such like, that I get money enough, more than I can well tell how to spend.</p>
            <p>I will now conclude, only tell you a Story or two, how I have initiated my self in this Art of <hi>Knavery,</hi> for my time being suddenly to expire, I thought it necessary to try some expedients, how I might live hereafter, when I came to be for my self; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that my master could not do any thing at first, without a Confederate, (some body to help and assist him) I procured the like: We had many indigent persons came to borrow money, some Gentlemen, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

decayed and decaying Citizens, amongst the rest a master of a Ship, who had made so many broken Voyages, that he could make no more, for he had wearied all his Friends with holding parts of Ships with him to their great loss; but he holding to the Proverb, <hi>That a Sea-man is never broken till his neck is broken,</hi> was resolved to try his Fortune one bout more, and had now with the help of Friends made a shift to buy an old Barque of near a hundred Tun, in which he was minded to go to Sea, partly as a man of War, and withall, to bring prohibited Goods from <hi>France.</hi> This man was an earnest Suiter to borrow an hundred pounds upon <hi>Bottomry,</hi> or any ways, to victual and fit his Ship; I finding him ingenious, after some conference with him, and he being willing for any undertaking, we concluded to go half snips in the Voyage, and I would furnish him with moneys to his content: I soon perswaded an easie Friend of mine who had more money than wit, to lend our Captain an hundred pounds, promising him great profit, and indeed he was to have fifty in the hundred for that Voyage, which was to be finished in two months, and I told him he might ensure his money at the <hi>Ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Office,</hi> which he did accordingly. Our Captain being furnished with a hundred pound of the Usurer, I made bold with a hundred pound more of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which could not soon be missed out of the Cash, and with this the Ship was so bravely fitted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with all Necessaries, that he was offered Fraights enough. At last he concluded with one to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver some rich Goods, and the times being dangerous at Sea, by reason of men of War at Sea, he ensured five hundred pounds upon the Ship.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:32749:97"/>The Ensurers knowing this, and that the man who had Ensured was a substantial Merchant, mistrusted nothing; but likewise ensured five hundred pounds more to the Captain, because he had laid out much in fitting the Ship, and did it as he pretended for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Owners. All things being thus fitted, our Captain leaving his Policy or Deed of Ensurance with me, put out to Sea, arrived at his Port, received the Goods on Board, but having a parcel of trusty Blades with him, and some who had shares in the purchase, he puts the best part of the Merchandize on Board of a small Barque he had hired for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and that being sent ashore to another Port, he soon after ran his Ship ashore in such a place as he was not likely to come off, and there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he perished, he and his companions getting on shore with some small matter of Goods in the Long-boat: He being arrived on shore, soon writ to me how he had sped, and I being acquainted very well with the Ensurers, perswaded them to pay me the money he had ensured first, upon some small rebate; and he on the other side selling the Merchandize on shore, put it into other commodities and sent them home, and himself came home as a distressed Passenger, and here the Ensurers paid for all: Such bouts as these they sometimes met with, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When our Captain came home, we privately met and shared our profit, and by this I gained two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds for my share, and this was a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and though I hazarded to Sea, yet there was le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:32749:98"/>
he have been discovered, sorrow would have been his sops. I have now and then had five or ten pound given me at a time for altering a Will, and putting in more as a Legacy to one than the Testator intended, and this I would venture on without much hazard, if the Testator were sick to Death. My Master once made a Will, and instead of another, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Executor, and I and one more of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy were witnesses to it, by this means he gained near three hundred pound.</p>
            <p>I have oftentimes had a Piece or two given me to make Writings in favour of one more than another; for in a Lease, if Rent reserved be 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and there be no Covenant for payment of the Rent, when either of the parties die, if any Rent be behind due to the Lessee, it cannot be recovered by the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, Administrators, and Assigns; and it hath been usual in all ancient Leases, to leave that Covenant out as needless, but now people are grown wiser by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>In Arbitration between parties, there is much cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knavery to be used, in drawing up an Award or final End; for the Scrivener, if he be a Friend to, or favour either of the Parties, shall do it so as that it shall be void, or not authentick, or not obliging to one of the parties, and yet the Arbitrators who are commonly honest harmless men, think they have done their business, when as they have only made work for Lawyers.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Counter-Bonds</hi> there may be much partiality used as also in <hi>Letters of Attorney,</hi> only putting in <hi>his use,</hi> for <hi>my use,</hi> entitles the Attorney to receive all to his own use without any account; and such a thing as this is often slipt over, or not understood, and many

               </gap> acquaintance not long since, for he being skilled in counterfeiting of Hands, did very Artificially coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit a Citizens hand (with whom he had some small dealing) to a Bond of 400<hi>l.</hi> to pay 200<hi>l.</hi> with Interest at a day, and when the time came he asked him before some company to pay him that money that he then owed him: Yes, said the Citizen, I shall do it next week, meaning a small summe which he did directly owe him, and did then pay him, but the other then telling him of his Bond of 400<hi>l.</hi> and the Citizen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly denying of it, a Suit was commenced, and the Tryal was had at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> where the Innocent Citizen (seeing the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Witnesses, and indeed his own hand, as he supposed, to the Bond, which he could not deny, but it was so, or very like) and having nothing to say, in a passion cryed out in open Court, <hi>to desire God to revenge his Cause, for he was utterly and absolutely wronged.</hi> This being so solemnly protested, made not only the Judge, but the Jury a little more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive into the matter than ordinary, and called for some papers to compare the hand with other of his hand-writing, but no difference could be found therein. The Bond thus passing about to every one of the Jury, one of them viewing the Bond more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly than ordinary, craved leave of the Judge to be discharged of his place as a Jury-man, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and sworn as a Witness; for my Lord, said he, I can say somewhat to the matter. This his request was assented to, and he being sworn, began in this manner, <hi>My Lord, this Bond here in Court is pretended
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:32749:99"/>
to be made, sealed, and delivered nine months since, when, my Lord, this Paper whereon it is written, hath not been in</hi> England <hi>above four months.</hi> How do you know that? said my Lord. The Jury-man replyed, <hi>My Lord, I am a</hi> Stationer <hi>or</hi> Paper-seller, <hi>and to all Paper there are several Marks, whereby we know and distinguish them; As</hi> Pot, Piller, Crown, Cardinals-Armes, <hi>&amp;c. And my Lord, this being such a sort of Paper, was made by a young Man in</hi> France, <hi>whose mark is here, and none of it came over till within these four Months.</hi> At this the Judge was satisfied, all people wondred, the Defendant rejoyced, and the Plaintiff with his Swearers, were forced to sneak out of the Court, and could not be presently heard of.</p>
            <p>I once was called to make a Will, and the party lying speechless, another there present dictated to me, telling me, that the Sick-man he was sure would consent to what he said, which I believing, proceeded and finished the Will, but when I came to have him sign it, I saw that he was dead: well, said the party that dictated, if you will be ruled by me, this Will shall stand, and yet no body forswear themselves, and said he to me, you shall have a good reward for your consent; whereupon, saith he, read the Will, so I did: well, saith he, you see the party doth not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what is here written, and now he shall set his Hand and Seal thereto, which he did by guiding the dead mans hand: now, saith he, if you be questioned, you may safely swear that you read the Will to him, and he consented, or at leastwise did not contradict, and that you saw him with his own hand, Sign, Seal, and deliver the same. Well Sir, said I, if you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I am, and thereupon he gave me the promised reward, I subscribed as Witness, and left him, who
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:32749:99"/>
soon after by vertue of this Will, possessed himself of the Estate. I had seen this trick of putting a Dead mans hand to Writings, done two or three times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and so this was no new thing, and would not contradict any thing that was to turn to my profit.</p>
            <p>I could tell you thousands of these Cheats, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as one said, there is more mischief done with a dash of the Pen, than with any thing else in the way of Knavery and Cheating. Thus did our Scrivener conclude his Discourse, and we calling for another Pint of Wine and a Faggot, drank and warmed our selves, and so for that time parted.</p>

my forepast life to what I had heard of them, and it was not worth mentioning; so that from that time, I had a more charitable opinion for my self than formerly, and since I had so good success with my Scrivener, I was resolved to be a little more intimate with the rest of the Society, especially the Bookseller, that I might know how he gained his Money, and the next day I had my desire, for meeting him abroad, we went to an Ale-house, and there did I discover my yesterdays actions with the Scrivener, and thereby induced him to make me this following Discourse.</p>
            <p>Truly Brother, (for so we called one another) you have told me wonders, though so admirable, that I could not have thought so much crafty knavery could have been committed by any man breathing, though I did believe that there was more than I understood, having always heard that it was a dangerous thing to squeeze Wax, and that Scriveners in general were cunning fellows, but that any man out of nothing should by tricks and subtile contrivances, gain to himself so great an Estate, and yet not run into the compass of the Law, but now I see the Proverbs verified, <hi>Nothing venture, nothing have,</hi> and that <hi>a blot is no blot till it be hit,</hi> and <hi>give a man luck and throw him into the Sea.</hi> And although I have thought my Master a man cunning and crafty enough, and did believe that he who deals in Books could not be out-witted, yet I see that a piece of Parchment with a Seal to it, is better than a great many Books, nay, then a whole Impression<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that I may give you some satisfaction in what you desire, I shall proceed in my Discourse, and though I cannot tell you so many, nor so profitable contrivances as you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me, yet those of our calling deserve not to go
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:32749:101"/>
much behind, and we do our utmost good will to cheat, though it turns not to so good an account.</p>
            <p>My Master when I came to Prentice, had but a small stock of Books, and those were all in his Shop, with which, together with some Paper, Parchment, Pens, and such like Stationers ware, he made a shift to pick up an indifferent livelihood; but he being of a reaching brain, and seeing there were very rich people, such as gained great Estates, and lived bravely of the same Trade, he made it his business to enquire into their way: the most sorts of Books that we sold were Testaments, Psalters, Grammers, Accidences, and such Books as we call Priviledged ware, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were Printed for the Company in general, and to be had of some of the Stock-keepers, or Masters of the Company, or at the Hall, and though our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in selling these sorts of Books was but small, as not above two pence in the shilling, yet it was a certaine commodity, and the sale sure; whereas other Books, either of Divinity, History, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not so certain, though more profitable, as commonly bringing four pence in the shilling profit, and thus did we continue buying Books of other Booksellers, as we were asked for them, and had occasion; my Master commonly keeping to one man, because he could there be trusted and furnished with any Book he wanted, it fortuned that a new Book being Printed, a small thing of about four or five sheets of paper; it sold so well, that my Master went often for them to his wonted place; one time they had none of them left, but desiring my Master to stay, they would send for some, which my Master did, but the Messenger came back without any, and brought word that he should not have any more of them upon account or exchange, for he now
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:32749:102"/>
held them at ready Money, and that he must have, or he would part from none; well then, said my Master, I will go thither and buy some my self, no, said the Master of the Shop, you shall not need, I'le send for some this once with ready Money, and you shall have them cheaper of me, then of him, and so h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> did, and he received them, and told me, that if he wanted any more, he could be very well furnished with them within three or four days, and the other had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to have served him so; but the Book selling very well, all my Masters were gone that night, and I went my self to the Bookseller who Printed them for some, the which I had; but the next day I went again, he had none, and told me, that I could not have any in a weeks time. I acquainted my Master herewith, who being called upon for some of them, went to his old place to see if they had any, they told him they had none at present, but to morrow he might have what number he pleased; accordingly the next day I went, and brought fifty of them with me; and then my Master (beginning to suspect that which he afterwards found out) sent me to the Booksellers who Printed them, and he had none, wherefore he then concluded, that the Bookseller with whom he was wont to deal, had Printed them, though they were none of his Copy, at which he wondred; for the greater sort of Booksellers did use to inform us, that it was a most heinous and unlawful thing to Print a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans Copy, so that I think, this was the first time that my Master discovered this Mystery, for the Book continuing to sell, we sold in our Shop above five hundred of them; so that my Master beginning to consider with himself, reckoned that he had paid to his Dealer above five pounds for these Pamplets,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:32749:102"/>
and yet got very well by them too: wherefore, not long after coming into the company of a Printer, he asked what it would cost to Print 2000 of a Book of five sheets of Paper, the Printer replyed, 10 pound: by this my Master guessed that his Dealer had gained half in half by him, for he had paid for 500 half what 2000 would cost. My Master holding some fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther discourse with this Printer over a Pot of Ale, he told him, that he did work for such a man, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bookseller with whom my Master dealt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h he, I lately did two sheets for him of a Book he gained well by, for I Printed 5000 for my share; so that at length, after conference together, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it was the same Book my Master sold so many of, and that he had Printed it in three or four places for expedition, and that he could not gain less than 30 <hi>l.</hi> by Printing it: I but says my Master, how will he do to answer it to the other man whose Copy it was? For that, said the Printer, he will do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough, for the other is but a young man, and light upon his Copy by chance; and though the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids such doings, as the Printing one anothers Copies, yet the great ones, commonly devour and eat up the little ones, and will venture on it being but a small thing; and it may be this young man is indebted to the other: and indeed it is a usual thing, and we do such Jobs very frequently, especially for the Grand ones of the Company. But how comes it, said my Master, that some or other do not Print their Copies, as Testaments, Psalters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for that, said the Printer, it is very dangerous, for if they were taken, it belonging to the whole Company, they would be sure to seize on it, and Sue the party so offending; besides, the Books are too big for every one to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:32749:103"/>
on, and will lie too long in hand a doing; but sometimes such things are done, but in another way, as I can tell. Thus ended my Master and the Printer their Discourse of this matter, and my Master desired the Printer to call on him sometimes, and he would drink with him, and it may be have some employment for him, and thus they parted. My Master now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding thus much of his Trade, more than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, was resolved it should not be long ere he were doing somewhat: thus pondering in his mind, he could not tell what design to begin with, for we sold little but Priviledged Ware, and those it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous medling with, neither would my Masters Stock reach to any thing considerable; at last resolving to play at small game rather than stand out, he bethought himself, and resolved to Print the <hi>A B C,</hi> a little Childs book of a sheet of paper: he knew not then what Printer to intrust, for he durst not make use of the former Printer, lest he should acquaint his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but it was not long ere he light upon one fit for his purpose, and to work he went, my Master sending in Paper, and so they were Printed, delivered, and paid for, but when my Master had them, he knew not how to dispose of them, lest he should be caught; but that he might have the better pretence, he went and bought 300 of them of his Dealer, and so laying them by, sold his own, and being acquainted with a Primer-binder, he got him to exchange with him for Primers, and such like small books, he was rid of most of them to his great profit, for he gained, as I have heard him say, above five pounds by that job, which was a great deal of Money, and by this means his Shop was better furnished with small books and paper, and now he had good credit with the Paper-Merchant,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:32749:103"/>
which before he could not have. Not long after, the Printer who Printed the <hi>A B C,</hi> came to him and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him, that if he would venture a matter of ten pounds, he might be concerned in printing of a book that would turn to a very good account, and it may be get twenty pound by the bargain: he having had such good suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p> He proceeds in the Discovery of his Masters ways in cheating, in preferring some Copies, and other ways of getting Copies.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MY Master having now had some experience in this way of Printing, was resolved to play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove board, and get some Copy or Copies to Print, that he might own, which in short time he did, and glad was he to see his name in Print, supposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self now to be somebody: but these things did him but little good, and sold but easily, he not having the way of preferring books, and sending them to some Country Chapmen, and the rest of the booksel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who endeavour to crush any beginner (and will not sell his books, unless they may have them at their own rate) would not sell any of them for him; and besides, now he gave Money for his Copies, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther costing him nothing: and though a book be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so good, they will not sell with some men, for the others will undervalue and spoil it: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If my Master had Printed at that time the best book of Chirurgery, Husbandry, Cookery, or the like in the World, and though the book had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous enough, so that every one desired it, and if as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at any booksellers shop for it, they would have said to their customers, Truly Sir, There is such a book, but in regard it is a foolli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h idle thing, and of no weight, I have not any of them, I will not trouble my shop with them; but Sir, here is another of the same Subject, that is much better, and in great esteem
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:32749:104"/>
with ingenious and knowing men: If the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer replies be would have only that book and no other for that it was recommended to him for an ingenious well-writ piece, then will he reply, Truly Sir, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any of your judgment before, till now I was never asked for them; but sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e you speak so well of it, I will procure you one: and then it may be, for all this Discourse, he will shew you one, as if left by chance, or else send to his Neighbour-bookseller for one. Thus will he disparage other mens books, and prize his own, and many times put off some of his own, the buyer being so civil as to believe him: and this is a general Maxime, That they will not offer, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a book of any mans printing except their own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they have it either in exchange, or at a low rate; and this is the cause that their is some books consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and good as any in <hi>England,</hi> that did not sell at first for little better than wast Paper, till some of the Grand ones of the Company get them all into their hands, and then they sell for three times the price they did. But to leave this Discourse and proceed, my Master having now printed two or three things, did look upon himself as some body; and though he had not such good success in his last undertakings as before yet he made a shift to get what they cost him for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and print, and had many of them still by him to sell when he would, or exchange; but he having but two or three sorts of books, could not do much good upon that: he seeing this, &amp; observing what books sold best, it being at the beginning of these late Wars, found that factious Sermons, and such like things would do the business; he thereupon bestirs himself, and gets acquainied with most of the factious Priests about Town, by often hearing them and frequenting their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:32749:105"/>
Companies, and having learned to write short-hand, took notes of their Sermons, which he Collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and now and then he would get them to revise one of them, and print it; by this means spending much time and mony amongst them, he grew very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and was become the general publisher of most of their Sermons and Controversies. This was that which brought him great gain, in a short time he could vie with the best, what he sold not for mony, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for books: and now he could command any book in all the Company without mony, upon account, as is the Custome. His Shop being well furnished, he gets a Ware House, where he bestowed his books in quires; and being thus furnished, he was first spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to by some Country booksellers, and then writ to by them and others, for several books, so that any thing that he printed he could sell off well enongh; for having good hap to print some very good selling books, they helped away the other that were not so good, and still were thrust into the parcel amongst the rest: and now having some good Authors, he would not accept of every one; and as he formerly had fought for, and courted Authors to write books for him, now they (knowing his way of preferring and selling of books) followed, and courted him to print their books. If a stranger came with a Copy to him, though never so good, he had books enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but however, if they would give him so much mony, he would do it, and they should have two or three, or six books for themselves and friends: many a one did he thus perswade out of their money, being desirous to be in Print. If he had a desire to have any thing writ in History, Poetry, or any other Science or Faculty, he had his several Authors, who for a glass
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:32749:105"/>
of Wine, and now and then a meals Meat and half a Crown, were his humble servants; having no other hire but that, and six or twelve of their books, which they presented to friends or persons of Quality; nay, and when they have had success, if they wanted any more books, they must pay for them: further I have known some of our Trade, that when the poor Author hath written a book, and being acquainted with some Person or Persons of Quality whereto he Dedicates and presents it, the Book-seller will go snips and have half shares of what is so given him.

               </gap> Master be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now gotten to the height of his Trade, was soon called to be one of the Livery of his Company, which though it be somewhat chargeable at first, yet it soon brings in profit, there being many conveniencies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: for they have Liberty to put a sum of money into the publick Stock, and so great is their profit, that they have seldom less than twenty <hi>per cent,</hi> and then, when they come to be Stock-keeper or Warden, they have the disposing of the Stock-books, such as are Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Psalters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and putting them out to print, they often print so many over numbers, that shall serve them as long as they live. In particular, there is no Trade that I ever heard of, that gets so much by their Commodity; for whatever we print, if it sells, we get eight pence in the shilling: and for those that deal with Country Chapmen, they put off the bad well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at one time or at another; and if they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad, then a new Title is printed as if it were a new book; and what with this and changing, they march off in time.</p>
            <p>There was one Preacher in <hi>London</hi> that my Master was much respective to, for he had gained much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by Printing several of his Books (and though my
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:32749:106"/>
Master in outward appearance seems a Saint, yet he hath his freaks, and will be merry with his friends, and be prophane enough.) One <hi>Sunday</hi> my Master having been rambling in the fields, entred the City in the Afternoon just as Sermon was done, and seeing this Parson going before him, he stept forwards, and overtaking him, salutes him thus, Sir, I am glad to see you so well, indeed Sir you have this day taken a great deal of pains, and we are all beholding to you for your Soul-saving Sermon: how say you, said the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, what do you mean? Why Sir, I thank you for your Sermon you Preached this Afternoon: Nay, now Sir, said the Parson, I see you are mistaken, for I have not Preached this day, my Master hearing this, was wonderfully surprized, not knowing what to say, but left the Parson, and came home discontented at his Error. We have several Country-Chapmen, some whereof owed my Master considerable sums of mony, he took occasion to go into the Country, and to be sure, he would make it worth his Journey, for at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very considerable Town he would buy some books, and sell them at the next, or send them up to <hi>London,</hi> and sometimes whole Libraries; and he did take order with all his Chapmen, to acquaint him with all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries or parcels of books that were to be sold, which if worth the buying, he would have. He would also frequent the Schools, and by drinking with the School-masters, and discoursing of books and learned men, he would get their custome to serve them with School books. There was one famous Country-Parson, whom he much desired to be acquainted with, and to him he came, telling him he was troubled in mind, and desired him to satisfie him in a case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, the which he did; and then for his satisfaction
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:32749:106"/>
and to oblige him, he prayed and courted him to see him when he came to <hi>London,</hi> the which he did, and all this was to get the Printing of his books. If a Customer comes into our Shop to buy a book, he hath such ways of preferring and recommending of it, that they seldom go and not buy, for he will open the book, and if it be Divinity, shew them one place or another, out of which he will preach to them, and tell them, that very saying or discourse is worth all the money in the world, and if they do not like it when they have read it over, he will take it again: and so many of our Trade will promise, but you shall hardly ever get your money again; you may by chance get them to exchange it for some other book, which they will the more readily do, if there be money stirring in the case. My Master having had a book written for him by a Poet, the Author (not having the wit to make his bargain, and know what he should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand) when he had finished it, desired payment for his pains: Nay, said my Master, you ought rather to pay me for Printing of it, and making you famous in Print. Well then, said the Author, if you will not give me money, I hope you will give me some books. How, said my Master, give you books, what will you have me forswear my Trade, and be a book-giver? I am a book-seller, and to you I will sell them as soon as to another, if you will give me money, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Print costs money, and this was all the Author could have for his pains. My Master is now one of the Grandees of the Company, and that besides the ordinary way gets him something. Not long since, he and others went a searching, and finding an Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of unlicensed books, seized them, but instead of suppressing and turning them to wast paper, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:32749:107"/>
the greatest part of them amongst themselves, and immediately my Master sent some of them away to all his Chapmen, and the rest we sold in the Shop. It so fell out lately, that a book being to be Printed, my Master repaired to the Author to get the Copy, but another of the same Trade had been there before, to whom it was in part promised; but however, (out of respect to my Master) the other being sent for, it was agreed that they should have the Printing of it between them, whereupon one Printer was employed by them both to do the work. My Master soon after sent for the Printer, and tells him, You must do me a kindness: Yes Sir, said the Printer. It is this, said my Master, I am to give away to the Author some books, wherefore I would have you to Print 200 for me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the number, and do not tell my Partner, and I will pay you: Yes, said the Printer, and so he did, and was paid for them accordingly. But the Printer seeing the knavery of his Imployers, (for the other had been with him, and engaged him to Print the same number of 200 over, pretending some private use he had for them) he likewise Printed 400 over for his own use, and publickly sold them; and neither of them could or would complain of him to the other, because they knew themselves guilty of the same crime.</p>
            <p>One of the greatest pieces of profit the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hath, is the Printing of Almanacks, for by that, I believe they clear above 1000<hi>l. per annum:</hi> but a knavish Printer lately outwitted them, for he Printed a great number of Almanacks, and though he Printed but two sorts, yet they served for all the other sorts, only altering the Title page at the beginning, and the last sheet which we call the <hi>Prog,</hi> or <hi>Prognostication</hi>; and these Almanacks he affording cheaper than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:32749:107"/>
as indeed well he might, he sold off a good number of them, which was to his gain, and their great hindrance; but he is lately discovered, and how they will deal with him I know not.</p>
            <p>In the late times of Liberty, when every one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what they pleased, if one Bookseller Printed a book that sold, another would get it Printed in a lesser Character, and so the Book being less in bulk, though the same in matter, would sell it for a great deal less price, and so undersel one another: and of late there hath been hardly a good book, but it is Epitomized, and for the most part spoiled, only for a little gain: so that few books that are good, are now printed, only Collections and patch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s out of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books; and Booksellers employing the meaner sort of Authors in spoiling anothers Copies by such Epitomies.</p>
            <p>A young man being lately to set up, was a suiter to my Master to speak to the Company to lend him 5 <hi>l.</hi> for a certain time without interest, as is customary: for there are several sums of money left the Company so to be disposed of, for the benefit of young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. My Master knowing his power in general, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly promised to effect his disires, provided that the young man would agree to lay out his money when received with him: telling him, he would use him well therein: but whether he did or no, you may guess, for he kept not open shop above six months before he broke, and is now gone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or a Souldier, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in general likely to loose the Money. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I, is one of the worst acts I have heard of, if it were intentionally done, for it is an abuse of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors will; but I see it not material with some men, if they get money, how they come by it: but I pray,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:32749:108"/>
let me hear the rest of your Story. That you shall, said the Bookseller, but first let us drink; which he having done, and I pledged, he proceeded, as you may hear in this following Chapter.</p>

               <p>The Book-sellers Prentice having discovered his Masters way of Cheating, now discovers his own.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THus said the Bookseller, have I given you a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary account of the most part of my Masters dealing, and the main way how he gained his Estate; for at this time he hath a Shop very well furnished with all sorts of bound Books, and two or three Ware-houses full of Books in Quires: he hath above 1000 <hi>l.</hi> owing him by Country-Chapmen; some Estate he hath in Land and Houses, and a very good Stock in the Hall, and all this is acquired in six years time out of nothing; and in this account of my Masters dealing, I have acquainted you with the greatest my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of our Trade: but, said I to him, I must confess you have told me those things I was not only ignorant of, but what I could not have believed could have been done, and so great an Estate could have been gained by the Bookselling Trade, especially from so small a beginning as an <hi>A B C</hi>: but all this while the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is not disclosed; for though you have told me how your Master gets money, yet I hear nothing of your gains, neither indeed can I as yet conjecture how you should be furnished with money; for I suppose you keep an account of what you receive and pay, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:32749:108"/>
that your Master takes care to look into his accounts, that no great matter can be gained that way. 'Tis very true, replied the Bookseller, he does so; and as he is of a false knavish temper himself, so he is suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of me, and very vigilant and watchful over me: but do you think, that I who have observed all his ways and crafty dealing, cannot find a way to be even with him, and put money into my own pocket? and indeed he does allow of my knavery and craftiness in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching of others; for he in general is accounted the fittest servant of our Trade, that can out-wit and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach his brother bookseller; for it is not so much our keeping Shop, and selling a few Books to Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Parsons, Gentlemen, nor sending to Country-Chapmen, for in that we use a constant price, and there is not much wit or craft to be used therein; but the craftiest part of our pofession consistest in making an Exchange note with other Booksellers to the best advantage; and there is our greatest prize: for if any of our Chapmen send to us for Books, such as we do not print, and such as we are not at present furnished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, then away we go to that Bookseller who is best furnished with them, and desire him to make a Note with him, which he (being desirous to sort himself with some of our Books) willingly consents to; then do we commonly pretend least use for those Books we most want, otherwise we should be sure to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, unless we took many of other sorts, that were little better then wast paper; and so we, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our brother Bookseller that of such a Book they are almost gone, and the like, we put off the greatest number of our worst Books, and the fewest of our best; and being indifferent of taking any quantity of those we most need, we commonly have most put upon us;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:32749:109"/>
and so are furnished with what we desire: and in this way of exchanging Books for Books, we have the most occasion of exercising our wits, and many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive commendations from our Masters for so doing; and when we meet with one another, the busine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s being over, triumph over those we have thus out-witted.</p>
            <p>This business of Exchanging brings us Prentices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with each other more then any thing else, for that this matter is commonly left to our manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and on this acquaintance depends the greatest part of our profit: for though we can sometimes when we take money in the Shop put up half a Crown or a Crown for a Book that our Master knows not of, yet that is but seldome, and little Money is given us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be by the better sort of Customers, whose books we carry home, and then perhaps we may have a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or two bestowed on us; but this is nothing in respect of our other profit, which I shall now tell you of.</p>
            <p>We trading for a great deal to Chapmen into the Country, do Print much, and sometimes one Book is printed very often, and a number of 25 or 50 cannot be so discovered: sometimes we are in fee with the Printer, procure him to print such a number over for us; which he consents to, that he may do as many for himself: and then for the manner of our selling of them, it is by Combination, Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ederacy, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency, which some of us Apprentices have with each other; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or we have our Warehouse as well as our Master, and are furnished with much variety; every one of the Combination bringing some quantity to this joynt Stock, of what his Master printeth; and then as occasion serveth, we furnish each other: but
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:32749:109"/>
the chiefest way of making money of these, is by three or four young Booksellers, who being newly set up, do buy them of us, it may be two pence in the shilling cheaper then they can buy them of our Masters: we have ready Money, or at furthest when they have sold them; and to this end we have commonly one of these Booksellers in every considerable place of Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Town, and sometimes we employ a ramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Bookseller to go a Birding, and offer them at places, and oftentimes our Masters buy some of their own Books of this Ubiquitarian-Bookseller; and one or two being intrusted with management of the Stock gives account to all the rest; and so we divide the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: at other times we being employed by our Masters to get in Books for our Country Chapmen, we inform them that the Book being out of print, we cannot have it without ready money, and then we being ordered to get them, (for our Customers must be served) we have them out of our own Stock, and put the ready money into our Pockets. Sometimes I have gotten fourty or fifty shillings by being partners with one of the young Booksellers in Printing a Pamphlet; and if it be an unlicensed thing, we sell them privately to Customers in the Shop; if a factious thing, we have our factious Customers; if obscene or wanton, we accordingly are provided with those that buy them: and thus with these ways, and some others, which are too long to relate at this time, I can make a shift to spend fourty or fifty pound a year, to keep my suit of private Cloaths, and to allow my Wench eight shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a week, to whom I constantly pay that Portion; and I think my share of the Stock at present may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to fourty pound. And thus you see, that though so many thousands go through the Scriveners
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:32749:110"/>
hands, and so few through mine, yet I can make a shift to get some Money out of our Paper, as well as he out of his Parchment; and I doubt not, but when I come out of my time, to do as well as the best of our Trade; for having learnt so much in this Art, I question not but I shall put it in Practice to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Thus did he put an end to his Discourse; and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pot or two more of Beer, having had some other merry discourse about the Scriveners Wench, and such like other matters, we parted; he, to go meet with some of his brother Booksellers, to take account of their private Stock; and I, to my Masters about my ordinary Imployments, still ruminating in my mind of all the passages that these two Blades the Scrivener and Bookseller had related to me; and from thence did conclude, that I should find all the rest of our Clubbing-Brethren stored with the same Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and now I meditated on nothing more then how I might get money enough, for that was the only thing that made crooked things straight; and if a man have enough of that, he may defie all men. It can make knees bow, and tongues speak against the native geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the groaning heart; it supples more then oyl or fomentations, and can stiffen beyond the Summers Sun, or the Winters white-bearded cold.

               </gap>ound them the best stored with money; and I often accompanied them to their Wenches, where we had extraordinary Treatments, and such Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as exceeded all the rest; for I had my Lass as well as they; and though I paid nothing of the reckoning, yet my Wench was often as well provided for as theirs; for I furnished her with Cloaths equal to any of them, and then the less money served their turn. We three being one night at a Tavern with our Wenches, where we passed a winters evening in their pleasing society,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:32749:111"/>
our spirits being raised with wine, and the harmony of Musick joyned to our Ladies voices, in which they all three were very excellent; It happened that their harmony begot a desire in the people in the next Room to be attentive to our Musick: the Scrivener desiring his Lady to sing a particular new Song alone, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereunto, and performed it very well, with good applause: one person in the next room, who had given attention thereto, and had lately been in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Singer, knowing her Voice, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by one means or other to see and drink with her; and thereupon leaving his Company, he came into our Room, and civilly asking leave, saluted the Ladies, and took acquaintance with the Scriveners Mistress: she being somewhat displeased thereat, in short time took occasion to tell her friend the Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that she was much troubled at this accident, and desired his favourable interpretation of this action, for she assured him, she only knew this person as a retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the house where she lodged, he coming to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Lady there, and not to her; and withal, she desired him, if he thought fit, to affront and chastise him for this his unmannerly intrusion. Her friend the Scrivener being thus informed by his Lady, called me and the Bookseller on one side, and acquainted us with the matter; so that we suddenly resolved to rid our selves of this bold intruder: when we returned to the fire where we left our unwelcome guest and the women, we found him toying with them and a little more bold then they or we were willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and allow of; wherefore we gave him some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry words, which he being a bluff fellow retorted, and we striving to force him out of the Room, he sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle as he was set upon us all, to the great affrighment
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:32749:112"/>
of the Women, who now beginning to squeak out, our noise occasioned the rest of our guests Companions who were in the next Room to come into ours, and there seeing their Friend set on by us three, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being odds, they fell on us to his assistance: many blows were not enterchanged, before the Master of the house and others (being called by the noise we made, and the clamours of the women) entred the Room; but all they could do, could not part us, so eager we were in defending, as we thought, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Ladies; so that the Constable was sent for, and we all seized on; but refusing to be obedient, he forthwith caused us to be conducted to the Justices, who was an Alderman that lived not far off; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought before his Worship, being as yet hot as well with Wine as anger, could not agree in our story, nor the occasion of our quarrel; but glad we were when we saw that our Ladies had slipt away, as indeed it was but time (for had they gone with us, I doubt <hi>Bridewel</hi> would have been their Lodging, and they should have had rapping cheer.) They having thus made their escapes who were the cause of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and we every one contradicting each other in our Discourses, the Alderman made no more ado, but sent us all to the Counter, both Plaintiffs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants: by such time as we were well setled in our Quarters, and had paid our Garnishes, we all considering the matter, and at length conversing with our Adversaries, put our quarrelsome business in a fair way to be ended; for the occasion being a Whore, we all agreed upon one tale to tell the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman next morning; when being brought before him, and he finding then no difference between us, supposing that it was only a drunken quarrel, was at
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:32749:112"/>
length perswaded to release us; but before we went, he forced us to pay our fees, and likewise some money to the Poor for being drunk: all which we made a shift to do, by borrowing of one another, and so we were discharged.</p>
            <p>Thus was this business overpassed: but though we made a shift to hide it from our Masters, pretending some of our wonted excu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This disgrace did stick upon us a great while, for our Companions would often ask us, when we would go to visit Master Alderman again: wherefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my self of a trick how to be revenged of the Alderman, and thereby cause the Discourse to cease: I often going by the Aldermans house saw him stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his door, and he had a common custome every afternoon to stand or sit there three or four hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I waiting my opportunity, went to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman, and asked if his Maid-servant was within: which of them, said he, <hi>Nan</hi> or <hi>Suzan? Suzan,</hi> quoth I: yes, said the Alderman, What is your business with her? May it please your Worship, said I, I was sent hither to take measure of her for some new cloaths What? then thou art a Taylor, said he; I replied, yes, and so he sent me in. I being acquainted with the Maids name (and seeing the Alderman engaged at the door still talking with another Person) asked for <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan</hi>: when she came to me, I told her, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster sent me in to her, and wished me to ask for his Skarlet Gown, to mend it against a Feasting-day then

approaching: she knowing her Master was at the door and believing my story, went for it (I in the mean time watching whether the Alderman still continued at the door (for if I had seen him coming in, I would have my excuses and depart) but as good luck would have it, the Maid came and gave me the Gown, and went about her other business: I wrapping it up under my cloak, went again to the door where Master Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was sitting, who asked me whether I had taken measure of his Maid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; I told him, yes: What already? said he.

            <argument>
               <p> The Relater and several others of the Clubbing-Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices assist the Drugster in putting off of some of his Commodities; he gives them gratuities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates a notable Cheat by his Master put upon an Iron-monger.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN this manner did we spend our time; and though our Masters gained more money, and dayly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Estates, yet we enjoyed the greater pleasure in each others society: and now we being all acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with one anothers ways, assisted each other in all things, and there was no want for our selves or Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who were often at our meetings, and assisted in our mirth.</p>
            <p>I remember one evening, a young man, a Drugster, who was one of our Club, told us that we must all of us assist him in a matter he was about, and he should not only gain a good opinion of his Master, but we should have a Piece or two to spend; we hearing there was convenience and profit, agreed together, soon consented to do our utmost, and therefore desired him to acquaint us with the matter: he thereupon told us, that his Master had lately bought a parcel of Drugs of two or three sorts, which did cost him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in hopes of great gain, for they were at double the price that he would afford his at; but they being too much for one mans sale, he offered to sell good part of them to some of our Trade: but they refused to buy, unless they might have them cheaper
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:32749:114"/>
then he was willing to afford them, pretending that they had no need of that Commodity, being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furnished with the same; although we were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certain that they could have none of it, there being none to be had in all <hi>London,</hi> till of late my Master bought this parcel that came from beyond Sea: Now my Master being desirous to sell his Commodity, hath considered of a way how to make his Brother-Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters come to him, and pray him to sell it to them at his price; that way is thus:</p>
            <p>He hath desired me to get some of my acquaintance to go to most of the Drugsters in and about <hi>London,</hi> and pretending to be Apothecaries and others that need those Commodities, to enquire for them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak quantities thereof; and then he knows, that not being able of themselves to furnish them, they will repair to him, and give him his price. Oh! said the Bookseller, have you learned that trick? I am very well acquainted with this manner of trade, for we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly use this slight to sell our Books: for when we have printed a Book that we doubt will not sell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preferring, and more ado than ordinary, then we not only Title it upon Posts, put it into News-books, and use several other ways to make it Famous; but we sometimes send several of our acquaintance and friends to most Booksellers shops to inquire for this new book; and they coming so one after another, at length Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Bookseller is perswaded to buy some of them; nay sometimes, the more to encourage the Booksellers to buy some quantities, we allow our friends to lay out some moneys with them, and buy several of them; and so the Bookseller will commonly, if he sell one or two, buy six or a dozen; and by this means our moneys comes in again with very great profit. Well, reply'd
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:32749:115"/>
the Drugster, this course must we take with these Drugs, or else they may prove a very Drug to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; for he hath served some of our Trade so many tricks already, that they are very cautious how they deal with him; but this trick of sending friends to ask for a Commodity he hath often used, neither did he learn it of the Bookseller: but there happened an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary chance sometime since, and from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he hath taken this course.</p>
            <p>For there was a Person who used to make Syringes, which Chirurgions and others use to squirt withal in several Distempers; and this man being out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, made a great quantity of them, and laid them by him; but not knowing how to dispose of them, he bethought him of this way of sending some friends to inquire for them: and so well did he mannage his business that by imploying persons to enquire of Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Apothecaries for them, he not only sold all he had made by him, but in less than a quarter of a year, he took above 200 <hi>l.</hi> for this Commodity: and this my Master took notice of, and I suppose made a president of, and now resolves upon the same course to put off his Drugs; wherefore I desire your utmost assistance herein, and I shall when you please spend a Piece or two in a Collation. All our Club-fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty agreed on this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and promised to be active here: and thus resolving on our next time of meeting, we parted.</p>
            <p>I for my part, the next day accoutring my self in a Country Gentile-garb, went to several Drugsters, and asked for several Drugs, whose names I had gotten; but amongst all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I more earnestly desired a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of those that were to be thus put off, telling them I was a Country Apothecary, and should call three or
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:32749:115"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our days after again, and lay out a considerable sum of money with them. I having done this for my part, and the rest of our associates having been as diligent, we meeting three days after together, our Drugster told us that his Master had sold all his Commodities to very great profit; and therefore, said he, This col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and each of you a Crown more to buy Gloves, is my Masters charge, and he desires you to accept thereof; which we accordingly did, being glad we had done so good service to him and his Master.</p>
            <p>I understanding by this, that there were tricks and cheats in this Trade as well as others, was desirous to be acquainted with the manner of their Trading; and he being but a Novice, told me, he could not tell me much of it, but he was very sensible that there was much knavery in that Mystery, in mixing and sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticating their Drugs, and getting the Spirits of some of them away, and renewing it in others, as served to their profit: and pursued he, I have one trick where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by my Master gets some Money in a year; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing customary to give a Pipe of Tobacco to any that comes into the Shop, and desires it, I give them of that which is very good; and they liking thereof, and the price, commonly buy of the same, and sometimes a quantity, desiring still it may be of the same they have tasted; the which I promise to do, and before their Eyes take it out of the same box: but the knack of it is this, it is for all that a different and worser sort of Tobacco; for the Tobacco that I gave them as a taste, is only placed in one corner of the box for that purpose, and so it goes off, as if it were all the same; and sometimes we put off, a whole Roll of Tobacco in the same manner: for the out side roll is of good Spanish right, but all in the inner-part is Mundun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, not worth a great a Cart-load.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:32749:116"/>But this is nothing to what way my Master hath; and he lately exercised his wits to a pretty profitable account, and thus it was: My Master among other sort of Drugs, had bought a quantity of Dragons-bloud, being pieces of wood, dipped, as is supposed, or rather pretended, in Dragons-bloud; and this is good Physick, and for other uses: this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity not proving very good, my Master had a great desire to put it off, but could not get any body to buy of it: he had been not only with Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but also with some Iron mongers to sell it, for they use it about their Locks, and other Iron work, to keep them from rust; but no person was willing to deal with him about it. My Master had a Neigbour that was an Iron monger, whom he had a great desire to deal withal; but he being a wary young man, and hearing that my Master was a snap, refused all deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him: and some words passed which displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my Master, and therefore he resolved to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and thereupon having designed his business, with the help of two Confederates, he thus puts it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
            <p>He gave a small quantity of this Dragons-blood to one of his Confederates, who having full instructions, went to the Iron-Mongers house, and seeing him standing at the door, asked him if he wanted not some of that commodity, shewing the same to him: No, said the Iron-monger. I was informed, said the man, that you sometimes deal in it, and was recommended by a friend to come to you; and if you please to deal with me, I shall use you very kindly. To this the Iron-monger replyed, that he needed not any of it. But, said the other, I suppose you sell of it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sometimes, and may therfore do me a courtesie,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:32749:116"/>
and your self too, for I have not a shop to sell it in, and am a stranger; wherefore, if you please, I shall leave this parcel with you, and you putting it on your stall may happen on a Customer, which if you do, I can furnish you with more; and thus you, without laying out any money, may get some profit. The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron-monger hearing of this, and conceiving the man to be honest and harmless, consented to his desire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the condition and the goods, and enquired further of the price; the man telling him that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it was worth three shillings <hi>per</hi> pound, but he would willingly take two shillings eight pence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he might have profit; and telling him that he would call on him in a weeks time: and they at this time parted.</p>
            <p>And thus the Iron-monger having received the Commodity, put some of it out every day on his stall, till at length a man coming by, and seeing that to lie there, and the Master of the Shop at the door, asked him the price thereof; the Iron-monger told him three shillings <hi>per</hi> pound. The Customer desired to look further into it, desiring to know how much he had of it: Truly said the Iron-monger, I cannot tell, but I suppose, if we agree, I can furnish you with a good quantity. Why, said the Customer, I will give you two shillings eight pence <hi>per</hi> pound for it, if you have 500 <hi>lib.</hi> of it. Well, said the Iron-monger, call here a day or two hence, and I will resolve you, and it is like we may deal together: Thus at present they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But he came again the next day, and the day following, pretending great earnestness to buy the Commodity: in the mean time the Iron-monger wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and watched narrowly to see and speak with the man that left it there, but could not meet with him,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:32749:117"/>
for he stayed away on purpose; and this Customer that came to buy, was likewise the other of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Confederates, and sent by him for that purpose. At length, the Iron-monger standing at his door, he saw the man that left the Dragons bloud passing by his door, and called to him, and then discoursed seriously with him about the matter, as, what would be his lowest price, and what quantity he had? To both these Questions he answered, He would take two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>0 <hi>lib.</hi> The Iron-monger hearing this, and resolvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; but if he would take two shillings four pence, he thought he might buy all his quantity. To this the Seller reply'd, That it was too cheap; but taking all, and paying him ready money, he would do it. The Iron-monger replyed, That ready money was two months: but, said he, If I deal, you shall have half down at the delivery, and the other half at three months: to this they both agreed. But the Iron-monger being cautious, would not at present fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, referring the ending the Bargain to two days, in the mean time resolving to see if his Customer came that was to buy; and then enquiring the name and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the Seller, they parted.</p>
            <p>Long had not the Iron-monger waited, but his buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Customer came, and as earnestly as formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to buy the Commodity; the which now the Iron-monger agreed to sell at two shillings eight pence <hi>per</hi> pound, and to be paid at weighing: and that he might be sure of his Customer, he takes ten shillings in part of payment, and appoints two days thence to finish the bargain Thus did the Iron-monger reckon to gain 500 Groats, which is 8<hi>l.</hi> 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Bes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>des, he
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:32749:117"/>
was resolved to have all ready money, and to pay but half; but he reckoned without his Host, as I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tell you: the Seller of the Dragons-blood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next day, finished his bargain, delivered his Commodity, received his money, and took a bill from the Iron-monger for the moyety of his money to be paid in three months. But now the Iron-monger had the Commodity, he might go look for a Customer; for he that left the ten shillings came no more, and the Commodity lay still on his hands; at which he was fretted, but could not help him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf.</p>
            <p>My Master having thus managed this affair by these two Confederates, received the mony, and had the Bill assigned to him, giving both his Confederates something for their pains.</p>
            <p>He having thus done the Iron mongers business, was not contented with the profit alone, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to vex him; and therefore when he passed by his shop, he asked him if he would buy any Dragons-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ood. No, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aid the other, I can sell you some. I'll buy, said my Master, but when he saw it, and heard the price, he told him, No, he could sell him as good as that for 12 <hi>d. per</hi> pound. At this the Iron-monger was more vexed; but now not knowing how to help himself, was forced to rest contented: at length the three months came, and then my Master was resolved to shew all his anger, and vex the Iron-monger more, and therefore went himself to demand the money that was due: the Iron-monger answered him, that he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him none: Whereupon he produced his bill, and a Letter of Attorney; and then he too late perceived how he had been served. For my Master told him, that now he would be even with him, for refusing to deal with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and abusing him. The other said, it
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:32749:118"/>
was a cheat, and he would make him bring out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that bought it, giving him ten shillings in part of payment. That shall I do quickly, said my Master, but it will be but small to your gain: and then told him the name of the man, and that he was not worth a farthing, and a Prisoner in the Kings-Bench. At this the Iron-monger being much more vexed then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, told my Master that he would not pay him, and bid him take his course; the which he did the next morning, and arresting him, soon brought the case to a tryal, and having an absolute bill of payment of the money, cast the Iron monger; who advising with his Lawyers, went to <hi>Westminster</hi> for a <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> which he gained: but when he came back with it, thinking to stop Execution, he found that he came too late; for my Master doubting such business, never left till he served the Execution, so that when the Poor Iron-monger came back with his <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> he found the Bayliffs and my Master in the shop, in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his goods; and he being out of Moneys <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Many absurdities he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in his Devotion, as praying for the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Family, and pointing out a time when he should or would have a return of his Prayers, at which time he would charge Providence with the fault; he having strictly observed all the Commandements, in Fasting, Praying, relieving the Brethren, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all other Duties which Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> his Ghostly father had imposed on him. He would often recount the particular enormities of his Wife and Family, and how she lay out from him three nights together in a week, and where she was; and would earnestly pray for, either her conversion, or confusion. Many other impertinences would he commit, which would be too tedious to me to recount: but in general, I found his zeal to be a weakness in his brain, and he was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually led about as Sir <hi>Iohn Presbyter</hi> directed.</p>

That she, or any other Sister, might lie with another Brother, was accounted a general maxime amongst them, especially if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I had a great mind to have been of her Religion, because there was so much freedom and enjoyments therein; but my Master kept me in a little too strictly; and my Mistress keeping company with the High-boys, slighted the tender of my service. Thus having failed in this attempt, I made my way to my Mistresses Sister, who was an Anabaptist; she I often waited on by my Mistresses commands, and at length was admitted to be one of the Brethren in the Conventicle, whereof she was a Sister; I professed a great deal of zeal for that way, and my Master often instructed me in Scripture, I soon from a proficient became a Preacher, and was of great eminency amongst them.</p>

Truly, said she, this days action hath resolved me of all doubts, and now I have so good opinion of you, that I shall no longer delay our Marriage then shall stand with your conveniency. To this I returned an answer full of love and kindness. Our Horse by this time felt the effects of my work, for he halted so much,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:32749:122"/>
that we could only go a foot pace, and with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty came to the next Town, where we were forced to alight, and it growing late, and impossible to get to <hi>London</hi> that night, we resolved to take up our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the present.</p>
            <p>I having placed my Mistress in a private Chamber, went into the Stable, and soon removed the obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that hindred our horse from going, so that by the next morning he was well enough able to Travel, I left him to the care of the Hostler, and went up to my Mistress, who expected me to Supper, which I had ordered to be provided for us, and that being ready, I invited our Landlady to be a Guest, though our Commons were but short, being only one Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, yet I made a long Grace, which according to our custome, might amount to a Prayer; and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that among other matters, I prayed that our Horse might be so well recovered, as that he might be so well able to carry us next day to <hi>London:</hi> our Landlady soon understanding what kind of Guests she had, believing that she should get little by our Company, was desirous of leaving it, which she did, by pretending business, and so we had the whole Chicken left us for our own eating, we hardly made or left any bones of it, so hungry we were. Supper being ended, we went to the fire, and I designing my business, call'd for a quart of Claret, which we burn'd, sweetned, and drank off; and by this time my Mistress was so sweet upon me, that we talked very familiarly and pleasantly, and oftentimes I interlaced our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses with Kisses and amorous Sighs, to which I was welcomed, and many times invited: I then called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>r another Quart of Wine, which we likewise drank off, and then I found my Mistress very full of the

Creature, so that she drew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime I gained possession of all my endeavours, she lying as fast asleep all the while; but when I had done, and was again laid by her, she started up, and seemed to be very angry with me: but I supposing that it was because I had so soon done, catched hold of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and attempted to be at her again, but in vain did I endeavour it, for she then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be angry, reproaching me with dishonesty, and using many canting terms, which I omit: I told her, what was done could not be undone, and therefore comforted her, and told her all should be well by our sudden Marriage: thus did I appease her, and we soon agreed upon every thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that though I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed another Chamber, which I pretended to lodge in, yet I lay all night with her. The next morning we arose betime; and mounting our horse, who was now well enough, we soon arrived at <hi>London,</hi> where for the present we parted. I having thus gained my ends of this woman, having part of her Estate in my possession, and by the enjoyment of her person having the command of the rest, was resolved only to abuse her; stript her of what she had, and so leave her: for I found no such sweetness in my nights lodging with her, but what I might expect from another; having before that tasted woman in the enjoyment of two or three of our Sisters, which passages I omit, and tell this to acquaint you how this woman undid her self by her Covetuousness, for had she not distrusted me with her money, I should have married her, but now my mind was otherwise bent.</p>
            <p>I received my Goods, and now my stock being
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:32749:123"/>
much encreased by this fifty pound, and the profit of my bargain, I paid the Seaman, and proceeded in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and though I had little skill in forreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, yet I ventured at all, neither did I want Money, for instead of paying back the fifty pound to my Mistress, I soon after had 100 <hi>l.</hi> more, and yet she could not perswade me to marriage, I still pretending multiplicity of business: at length, all her Portion, being 400 <hi>l.</hi> got into my hands, I only paid her with a nights lodging, which now and then we had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but as to marriage, I still pretended one reason or other to defer it.</p>
            <p>I not only proceeded in my Merchandizing, but continued in my Preaching at our usual Conventicles, where I was become very famous, and a great dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; but at length I finding there was but little to be gotten by them (and my principle being always to gain what I could) I became now almost weary of them, and willing to leave the Congregation for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that courted me, but I was resolved e're I left them, to make some use of them, and get somewhat of them. I thus laid my Plot: I gave a Bond to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate for 100 <hi>l.</hi> pretending that I owed so much to him; I gave out, that I would on such a day not only preach to my Congregation, but also Dispute with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opposer on several Articles. The time being come I had a full Auditory, and performed my Preachment and Disputation to the general satisfaction of all, and then appointed that the next day I would hold forth some other points, that had not as yet been disputed of, inviting all the Congregation and all others that would come, to meet me in a larger room then that was wherein we exercised at present. Thus having finished my Discourse, I dismissed my Auditors; but I

               </gap>he Case being opened, I confessed the Debt, with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l, alleading that I was not at present able to pay it, having lately ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red most of my Estate to Sea. Those of my Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation hearing this (and being much grieved that their Pastor should be thus snatch'd from them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he had deserved so well) sent for some more of their Brethren, who were monied men; and so among them they paid the debt, and I was discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but soon after this, I left them, and they were forced to make a Collection or gathering among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to reinburse themselves their moneys; and my Mistress who had been all this while delayed by me with fairwords, made her complaints to the brethren, but to no purpose, for she received no redress or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I having now quite left them and their faction for another, where by reason of my abillity in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was entertained, and an accord made between me and my quondam Mistress, I only giving her back 50 <hi>l.</hi> of her 400 <hi>l.</hi> we being now absolutely parted from one another, she receiving no other satisfaction of me, either for her many nights lodging or mony, then fifty pound, which she willingly received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving me to be a beggar; my new Congregation voluntarily raising that money for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Thus was I quit of her, and had gained five hundred pound in my pocket, only under the cloak of Religion. and having such success, I in short time discovered my
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:32749:124"/>
self to be rich, by buying many bargains of good value, paying ready mony, and raised my self to so high a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that I won a widdow of an indifferent fortune to be my wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and so settled my self in the World.</p>
            <p>As for my Preaching-trade, I finding that it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done me as much service as I expected from it, I left it, for I had now a wife and money, and for that end, and to get them, I took it up, and being provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with both, I left it, but especially finding that it grew every day into disesteem, it being about the time of his Majesties happy Return; when instead of a preaching Fanatick, I quickly faced about, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my congregational friends, I enquired out, and procured Cavalier acquaintance, so that I who a little before the Kings coming home, was used to wear short Hair, and was modest and precise in my habit) had now a large Perewig, a great Plume of Feathers, and all other accoutrements accordingly, being still dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent on all occasions to associate my self with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and cheif Officers of the Trained-Bands of our Company, into whose acquaintance and Society I soon insinuated my self, by my Gallantry in my habit and expences in Taverns being conformable.</p>
            <p>Thus did I become a Gentleman, and from a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian a Prodigal, nay an Antick, and every thing, what not? that I might please all: for instead of Prayer-book, or some other Fanatical piece of divinity, I now carried in my pocket, either Cards or Dice, and so great a love I had to <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> that all their Tools, <hi>viz.</hi> Box of Counters, Balls, Cups, and other Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets which are made use of in that mysterious functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were all my Companions: having learned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence when I was a Preacher, I was now the better emboldned to stare my Spectators in the face, while I
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:32749:125"/>
cunningly enough performed my feats of activity; and such a readiness I had, that I was an able proficient, I spent so much time in these fooleries, that I almost lost my self; and now having a wife and family to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I found my Estate so far to decrease, that I was forced to look after my business, and fall to Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing: but having lost a considerable part of my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state which I had adventured at Sea, I was resolved, as I said, to trust no more to that Element, and not to let my Estate go out of my sight; wherefore I, still as shipping came in, went on board, either in the <hi>Downs, Portsmouth</hi> or <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and there buying good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, which the Seamen, newly come home, would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for ready Money, I began to prick up again, and have Money at command; I then bought me a small Pinnace or small Pleasure boat; and with that went on board of Ships, bought Goods, and made a shift to stow as much on board privately, that I saved much by the customes and other duties. This Trade I drove a long time, gained much by stealing Duties; neither did I care what goods I dealt in, having Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers of all sorts and Trades, who knowing that I drove this Trade, employed me to buy for them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing the prizes before hand: but I was snap'd one time, and all my goods seized for not paying duties, and an Information put into the Exchequer against me: I finding that it would be but a folly to contend there, agreed with the Informer, and he suffered me to cast him; so that I got off for a sum of money, but I gained much experience thereby, so that I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a new Trade, and would engage many of my Friends to go and buy Goods on board of Ship, and if they got them clear from the Ships side<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; for I would come immediately in another
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:32749:125"/>
Boat, as if a stranger, and seize the Goods as forfeited for want of the payment of duties, and so secure them from any other seizure: and if any other person came to seize on them, I then pretended it to be my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, having made the first seizure, but if we were not met with by another, then we passed clear without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more trouble: nay, so bold and confident was I grown in this kind of Trade, called <hi>Smuckling</hi>; that I have had fifty and an hundred pound at a time given me to go over into <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>France</hi> in a Ship which hath brought much prohibited goods, which I have seized so soon as we came near any Port of <hi>England,</hi> to prevent any other seizure; and then putting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation into the Exchequer, have suffered costs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, and all hath been clear. I gained not only much money by this means, but also the esteem of a cunning subtile fellow, and was employed in many such affairs, and sometimes in Law-suits.</p>
            <p>I remember once I came into Company with a very f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir Lady, who having an old cross-grain'd fellow to her Husband, had not only lived from him some time, but was so foolish as to be married to another person, who was a Gentleman of much worth and merit, The Ladies old Husband (understanding it, and more out of Covetousness of gaining money, which he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Gentleman would on this occasion part from, then any love he bore his Wife) hunted them out from one place to another, and the young Gentleman refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to comply with the old Knights desires, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved now to prosecute her for Life.</p>
            <p>This Story was told me by the Gentleman himself, and the Lady assured me of the truth of the matter, imploring my assistance: Well, Madam, said I, come, be ruled by me, and I will disapoint your old Husband,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:32749:126"/>
and you shall laugh at him: Having considered the matter, I ordered her to go next day into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, above 100 miles from <hi>London,</hi> and there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me, and obey my further orders, this she did; and I soon following her, and the Assizes beginning the next day, I got a Warrant to apprehend and bring her before the Bench, she came, and I charged her with having two Husbands, she denying; and I alledging the matter, she was committed, and an Indictment brought in, but when she was to be try'd, I was not to be found, nor any person else to prosecute her: so that she was quit by proclamation. A Copy of this Process I took out of the Court, and so she and I came to <hi>London</hi> to the Gentleman her friend, who gladly welcomed us, and now they live together in spight of the old Knight, who attempted to trouble them, found it in vain, for she could not be tryed for one fact twice.</p>
            <p>This feat did I meerly out of my own apprehension and fancy, and it succeeding according to my wishes, I had a considerable reward for my pains.</p>

For though I had a wife, and she indifferent handsome, yet was she cold in her embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and still talking of the cares of the World, and propounding ways to get Moneys. But my private Lady was quite different, being wholly composed of Love and sweetness, professing nothing more dear to her, then my Society: and we had no other discourse but pleasure and enjoyments, in the greatest height we could imagine; This, though it were pleasant, was very chargeable, to keep such a Commodity for my own private use, so that I gained not much at the years end, and what I got over the Devils back, I spent under his belly, as the Proverb goes: Wherefore my wife cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on me to stay at home and apply my self to some setled way, but that I could not do, for my Stock was grown low, and my spending as high as ever.</p>
            <p>My Wife had a Father-in-Law who was a Citizen, and a monyed man; him I got into favour with, and by my free entertainment of him, won him to me; for he having left off trading in <hi>London,</hi> lived some miles off, and coming to <hi>London</hi> would often visit me, where I still welcomed him, and attended him abroad when he went to receive Rents, or any Moneys, and assisted him in all such things that I could with much diligence. My stock being very low, I borrowed Moneys of him to trade with, and was very Punctual in my payment, so that he put so much confidence in me, as to lend
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:32749:127"/>
me 100 <hi>l.</hi> and more I might have had, had I requested it: as he and his wife (who was my wives Mother) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten visited me at my house, so at convenient times I was a guest at theirs in the Country, where I associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my self with the best Gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>men of the place, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the affections of all, by my facetious and pleasant converse. I had hopes of raising my fortunes by my wives Mother, who I hoped would out-live her husband, and then at her death be able and willing to give me good part of her estate, but it fell out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, for she fell Sick and died before him, but it was but good luck to be there, and my wife being still near her, she gave her some Rings and other things that were considerable.</p>
            <p>The old man my Father-in-Law being desirous to bury his wife at <hi>London,</hi> according to her request, went up with us, and being somewat sick before, so soon as his wife was buried, was so surprized with a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that he took his bed, and after ten weeks sickness dyed at my house, during his sickness, I be thought my self of what advantage I might make it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to please him in all I might, but he having two Sons, I could not expect much of the estate, but was resolved by hook or by crook to have a considerable share, and to that end, I knew no better way then to divide the two Brothers, and put them at difference. The eldest was a married man, and though of an easie temper, yet I knew was too honest to be wrought on to do any unhansome action, the youngest being a young bluff fellow, was apt to believe any thing I should perswade him to, wherefore at first I possest him with a jealousie against his brother, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud him of his share of the estate, if he did not take heed and follow my directions, which if he did, I
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:32749:127"/>
would put him into a way to command his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in every thing.</p>
            <p>The young man being of a suspicious nature, easily believed me; and then I particularly advised him, that the first thing he ought to do, was to get the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his age altered; for if his father should now dye, and he not truly being twenty years of age, could not expect to have the possession of any part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, unless he were one and twenty. Wherefore to the house of the Parish Register we went, and for the spending of one shilling, and five shillings in Money, we had the Register book delivered to us, where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well skilled in counterfeiting and imitating of hands; soon alter'd the Register, putting his age out in one place, and writing it in another place two years before, so that the young man was now made half a year above full age. Then did we call the Register, who gave us a Certificate out of the book of the young mans age, and this we carried with us as authentick, and to be produced on all occasions. I having done thus much for the young Man, he could not deny me any thing I desired or requested: so that the old sick Gentleman being still weaker, and having his Money in a Trunk by his Beds-side, I perswaded the younger Brother (who had the key) to take some out and lend to me; which he did: and that the old Man might not see the action; I and my wife would stand by the beds-side before him, so that by degrees I got 100 <hi>l.</hi> from thence: and when the old man dyed, though he left a considerable Estate, yet was there not a penny of ready Money. The elder brother know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had foul-play shewed him, began to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, but to no purpose, for he was forced to comply, the younger brother having possession of that Trunk,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:32749:128"/>
and the keys of all others where all the Writings were. The old man being buried (and much excess and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality shewed in the expen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sure, you mistake your self, he is of sufficient age already; and thereupon produced the Certificate, which though it was very punctual, yet the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who was near ten years older then his brother) and several others who were present, knew to be false: and this was the first breach between them, which had like to have grown to a high flame: for the elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applying himself to the Register, upon search of the Book, found the fallacy: and indeed the Register acknowledged the fact; for which he, and the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er brother, and my self had like to have kissed <hi>New-gate,</hi> by order of the Lord Mayor, who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted herewith, was highly incensed against us all, professing before the whole Court of Aldermen, That this act was of high concernment, and might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the whole City. The elder brother was very cautious in prosecuting this affair, being tender of his brothers credit, and therefore endeavoured by fair means to bring h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:32749:128"/>
the Trunk with part of the Writings delivered to him, with promise to put a fair end to the rest of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. When I came home, and found the Trunk gone, I stormed exceedingly; and believing my self disappointed of my purpose, found out the younger Brother, and schoold'd him so foundly, that he by my directions went back to his brothers house, and by a false token, regained the Trunk with the Writings, which he had new sent home. Thus was their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence enlarged, and likely to be worse; but the Elder Brother so moderately complyed with all mine and his demands, though never so unreasonable, that a division and partition was made, not only of the Estate, but some part of the Goods, which being Plate, and Linnen, and Pewter, were delivered into my custody: and all the differences between the brothers being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I demanded of the elder brother satisfaction for his fathers being at my house during the time of his sickness: he little expected this; for his father had given to me and mine an hundred pound, but that was nothing; I owed him so much, and I must have more, and so I told him I would have, or mischeif him: not giving any other reason, but that he had enough, and I would have part. Thus did I hope to huff him out of his money: but he, though he was easie and good-natured (which I accounted next of kin to a fool) yet wholly refused me, affirming that I had no reason for my demands, for I had an hundred pound given me, and that I had not been at any charge, for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had continually given my wife money to provide all necessaries, and that some of that was still in my wives hands.</p>
            <p>Though I knew what he alledged was true, yet I still persisted in my demands, and told him, that so
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:32749:129"/>
much I would have for the trouble of my house: he offered to refer it to two men; I long refused it, but at the length consented, and tampered with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator, promising him a reward, if he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer my exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I bought several parcels and sorts of Goods, which I fetcht away as I paid for them: at last I bought several parcels of Goods to a great value, and fetcht away most of them, which I sold to profit: but one parcel of 500<hi>l.</hi> being a failing and decaying Commodity, I lest in their hands so long, that it was much damaged; and unwilling and indeed unable to pay for them, was Arested, and clapt up into a prison; where I was forc'd to lie a great while, till I had spent and consumed most of what I had; and at length they finding there was nothing to be got by me, released me, I releasing my bargain: which I willingly did, but soon after repented it; for the price of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity

            <p>THis Misfortune of my Imprisonment did sensibly afflict me; especially, when I understood that instead of loss, I might have gained by holding to my bargain; but it now being past, could not be helpt. I was reduced to such necessity, that not only all my Money, but my Plate and best Goods were sold; and not only my Wife, but my Whore parted from their Rings and Jewels to redeem me: for when I was in prison, every body that I owed money to, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little, came upon me; and though I came off with my great Action easily enough, yet many other little ones stuck close to me, which I was forced to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. I had now time enough to consider my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed Actions, and to examine my self what I had done to deserve this affliction; I bethought me of the trick I first served my Mistresses Sister, in cheating her of her Money and Virginity; but that stuck not much upon me, because I thought her to be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough fitted for delaying me, distrusting me, and other bad practices I knew her guilty of: but when I considered the wrong I had lately done the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in first rasing a difference, and then continuing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:32749:130"/>
it between them, and not only prosecuting the elder brother so highly my self, but putting another of my acquaintance (to whom I knew he was indebted) upon him to sue and arrest him, with all the disgrace I could, by causing it to be done on a Sunday as he went to Church, I my self attending: This consideration pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed me with an opinion that this Judgment was just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen upon me for this cause, I being rightly enough fitted, being likewise arrested my self on a Sunday, as I was going to Church, but now being discharged of my Imprisonment, I bethought me what course I was to take, and resolved that since I had suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red disgrace in the City, it were best for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move into the Country, where I was not known; therefore I soon took a house of considerable value, and putting my self in a very good Habit, and in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page every ways suitable, I and my Wife, with most of my family removed from my <hi>London</hi> to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-house; I soon got my self acquainted with the best and wealthiest people of the place, and gave them very handsome Treats and Entertainments at my house, which they answered me with the like civility.</p>
            <p>Though I had been a Prisoner, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et I had play'd my Cards so well in paying my small debts, and told my tale so advantagiously about my great Action, that I had preserved a sufficient credit with some of my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; so that making up about fifty pound out of my Wives and Wenches Rings, Jewels, and some Plate, I was entrusted with a 100 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Commodities, with which I set up another Trade in the Country; this turned to good account: for I seldom ventured on any thing, but it was effectual and to purpose; and if I would wholly have bent my minde to get Money, I might have had a good estate; but I effected plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:32749:130"/>
equal to, and above profit; and though I was thus low in the World, yet I still kept my Wench, whom I had now quartered in the mid-way between my <hi>London</hi> and Country-house, and therefore could lye with her commodiously enough, and tell my wife if at my Country, that I lay at the <hi>London</hi> house; and so on the contrary.</p>
            <p>As I thus enjoyed my pleasure, so I now began to be more wary, and look after profit, which I did to good purpose; but I now wanted a Father-in-Law who was a moneyed man, or some other friend who would furnish me with money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if I could have produced three or four hundred pounds in ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I questioned not but to make extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: for this end I thought on several ways, and at length did hit upon one that did my business. I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the Winter, took an extraordinary cold that forced me to keep my bed for some days, and indeed I did so longer then I needed; for I counterfeiting an extraordinary sickness, and that I was much troubled with the Stone and Collick; and so desperate ill I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my self to be, that my Wife lamenting, and my Children and Family being in much disorder, I was perswaded to make my Will: to this I consented; and the Scrivener of the Town was sent for; I then told him, that by reason of my Childrens childhood, and my Wives incapacity to mannage affairs, I was in a great strait how to dispose of my Estate, which though it was considerable enough, yet if it were not well managed, would soon come to nothing; I now being in a strange Town, distant from <hi>London,</hi> where my acquaintance lived, I knew not well what person to intrust as Executor, unless, said I, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> of this Town would do me the kindness to take that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:32749:131"/>
on him, which I would willingly requite by a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Legacy, and my Wife and Children would be bound to pray for him. Sir, said the Scrivener, I question not but he will do it; and if you please, I will not only ask him, but perswade him thereto. I thank you kindly, said I, and for this offer of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, I shall give you a Legacy as a Remembrance of me; and therefore, I pray, take notice of the heads of my Will, and then go with it to Master <hi>B.</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to him, make this request to him in my behalf: whereupon the Scrivener begun, and I dictated to him, what and to whom I would give; which was 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to my Wife, 300<hi>l.</hi> apiece to my Children, and several other Legacies, amounting in all to near 3000 <hi>l.</hi> and 100 <hi>l.</hi> I gave to my intended Executor, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> to the Scrivener.</p>
            <p>This affair being thus ordered, the Scrivener de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and went to Master <hi>B.</hi> my intended Executor who being a well monyed man, and withal very cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, was very glad of the matter, and willingly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the offer, and within few hours came to me, and told me he was very sorry for my sickness, and wished my recovery; but if he could do me any service living, or to my Wife and Children, if I should die, which he hoped would not happen, he should be ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling both in purse and person to assist me. I then told him what I had done as to my Will, and withal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my Account-books to be produced, where I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and demonstrated how my Estate stood, and in whose hands it was (having prepared false Accompts for that purpose:) he seeing the matter so plain, and hoping to get a fleece out of my Estate, caused the Scrivener to proceed and fini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h the Will, which I sealed; but during his stay with me at that time,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:32749:131"/>
and some other times when he visited me, I so coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited faintings and pain, that he and all others near me, did fully conclude, I was no man for this World.</p>
            <p>After I had managed this affair to the height, I soon recovered, and had now not only gained this old penny-father to be my friend, but by his and the Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners reports of my Estate, had many others, who more then ordinarily respected me, and made me tenders of their service; all which I thankfully refused at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Soon after this, I heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out a place, for which I was to give 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and it being a good penny-worth, I engaged in it: I made a shift to raise two hundred pound of my own moneys, and that was all I was then able to do; but pretending I had of my own five hundred pound in money, I soon perswaded my intended Executor to furnish me with five hundred pound more; and so paying seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound to my Chapmen, he took my word for three hundred pound more. This place put me in very great credit; and now as well my <hi>London</hi> as my Country-acquaintance looked on me with respect, supposing all to be true that had been discoursed of me. I did not long keep this place, but sold it for an 100 <hi>l.</hi> profit, and so became Master of more ready money, then ever, with which I again came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> wholly leaving my Country house, and paying my Country Penney-father part of his moneys; and with that little of my own, and the rest that was left, and what I had gained, I took a house and Shop in the place where I now live, and drive a Trade equal to the best of my Neighbours; onely I have had some deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of late, which have a little puzzled me, as I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told you, when I had my tryal; but he that slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

            <p>THus did the Drugster finish his story.

This being done, the news came quickly to his knowledge; for before we parted, two of his Creditors, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Officers, not onely acquainted him with what they had done, but also secured his person. We were all surprized at this action, especially the Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who now appeared more dead then alive; and though he was asked many Questions, yet he knew not readily how to answer one; and therefore they soon left us, carrying them away to one of their own houses, where they tyrannically kept him for some days, not permitting any person to come at him; for though I attempted it, 'twas in vain. The Scrivener
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:32749:134"/>
and I being together, wondred at the action, and could not tell what should be the occasion of this sudden business, for the Drugster had not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us with the bottom of his designe, onely telling us, that he was to go a two months Voyage to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and so return. I then parted from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener, and attempted to see and to speak with my friend the Drugster, but it could not be at present; but by often importuning, and pretending business of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, in ten days time I was permitted to see and speak with him; when having secured and examined the Chamber where he was, that none might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear our Discourse, he soon acquainted me with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular of his business and designe; nor did he relate to me that his Wench was on board in mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and how he had given a 100 <hi>l.</hi> in silver into her Custody. But, said I, where is the other 500 <hi>l.</hi> for in all I heard you say, you had 600 <hi>l.</hi> in ready money? That said he, I hope is safe, if my Cloaths are so; and therefore, I pray, said he, assist me a little in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and enquire what is become of the Wench and my Clothes, and I doubt not but in few days to put all things right enough again. I not only promised him to do my utmost, but went about it very faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and going on board the Ship, found that all was gone; but upon enquiry, heard that the young man that was to accompany the Drugster in the Voyage, was on shore at a house not far off: thither I went, and upon enquiry found out the party: I desired pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate speech with him, for she went for a man; this was granted, and I discovering my self so plainly to her, in every particular, she made no great difficulty to be as free with me, and told me all was gone, Cloaths, and every thing else, except her own
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:32749:134"/>
Box, where she had secured the 100 <hi>l.</hi> that was given to her; and, continued she, My friend could not have employed any person to me, to whom I would have been so free as I shall to you: for though you do not know me in this Habit, yet I suppose had I my womans dress, you would soon remember me: I then protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, that I could not call her Phisnomy to mind. Well, said she, we have been more inward, and ere now lain together; and thereupon told me, that she was one of those three that I lay with one night, and had redeemed from pawn, as I have formerly told you, at my last coming to <hi>London.</hi> Upon this, though she was in breeches; I made bold to kiss her and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her: Well, said she, proceed no further, there may be time enough for the rest; let us now consult what is necessary for our distressed friend: for, said she, if you and he desire it, I shall be willing to part from all the hundred pound, which I am yet Mistress of. Well, replyed I, you are the most generous and deserving Woman of all your Sex, especially of your Quality, not onely for what you now offer, but what I formerly by experience, and lately by his Relations have understood by you. Truely, replyed she, where I promise fidelity, I perform it; and where I find worth, I will endeavour to deserve and requite it: and though I have lived wantonly, yet since I was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by this Gentleman as his friend, I have been wholly constant, and will persevere so long as he is able or I can otherwise handsomly contrive a way to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. In this you are very obliging, said I, but I hope you will not deny any old friend a courtesie. Well, said she, more of that hereafter. From this discourse we fell to the matter in hand, consulting and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what was necessary to be done for our friends

            <p>This being done, I again repaired to him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with my proceedings; he was glad I had found her and the hundred pound: but when I told him that the Chest with his Clothes were gone a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. We discoursed not much further for the present, but parted; and I returning home to my Masters, asked leave to be absent for that night; to which he consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and indeed, I had so much liberty, that I might stay out so long as I pleased, my Master using me rather like a Companion then a Servant.</p>
            <p>I now went to the Drusters Lady, and my <hi>quondam</hi>-acquaintance, and informing her of my business, she freely delivered me ten pound: But, said I, this is not all, I must have somewhat else before I go; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon called for Wine, and we drank so briskly, that we were both pretty merry: And it being now late, she asked me where I intended to lodge: I said, with her; That must not be, replyed she: and indeed I had somewhat to do to perswade her to it; but at length I did, and we lay together without any suspition, she going for a man. We often interchanged many amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous imbraces, and performed all those dalliances that two longing Lovers could expect, and made many protestations of a farther friendship: I telling her, that I believed her friend the Drugster would not be offended, if he knew of our enjoyments, and would as well impart to me, as he had done his chiefest secrets: Well, said she, if you gain his consent, you command mine, and I therefore leave it to your management; and I suppose if you tell him of our former acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the greatest difficulty will be overcome. This I thought would be a ready way, as indeed it was: and since then we have had an equal enjoyment of her; she
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:32749:136"/>
having lain with one of us every night since, &amp; during our Voyage hither, and is one of those two are in mens apparel, and is called <hi>George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, said I, to return to my matter in hand, I the next morning parted from her, and with ten pound in my pocket, went to my friend, who was going before the Commissioners, whither I attended him; and there he carried himself with so much free<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om and ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he was set at liberty, and promised more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: he then made it his request, that he might have the Chest with his Cloaths: to this some consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but others replyed, all must be appraised, and till then nothing could be disposed of, and therefore they demanded the key of him: this he refused; but they told him, that then they would break it open: he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no other remedy, promised to bring it the next morning, and then desired they might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praised, and delivered to him: and thus they parted; and after he and I had drunk a Pint of Wine, we also parted.</p>
            <p>As I was going home I met with the Scrivener, who being desirous to know how matters went with the Drugster, would enforce a glass of wine on me; when I told him all the matter, and omitting nothing, we judged that his five hundred pound was in that Chest with his Cloaths, and that now he would be stripped of it. But, said the Scrivener, I wish he were Master of that Money, and then I should propound a way to him to leave them, by making him partner in a design which I have lately projected, and is now near execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I needed not use many words to perswade him to acquaint me with his design, wherefore after few words, he opened to me the matter thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:32749:136"/>I have, said he, lived in so full an enjoyment of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing here, that I am weary of it, being tied to one place; and my spirit being of a soaring rambling tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, am desirous of novelty and change; and to that end, I have some time since purposed, and lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a way to leave <hi>England</hi> for some other place, and consulting with the Captain whom you know, have resolved for the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> whither he is now bound: and that I might not go away beggerly, (for I never intend to return, unless very rich) I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a way how to carry good store of money with me, which I am now plentifully provided with. Yes, said I, I know it is no difficulty for you to procure what money you will, having the keeping of so much Cash. You are mistaken, said he, I intend not to wrong my Master of a penny, but have done it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the manner thus:</p>
            <p>My Master hath lately taken a Journey into the Country, and left the sole management of his affairs to me; and resolving now to make use of my time, I have put my Project in Execution. I have been with one of our Money-Masters, and told him, that such a man, whom he knew to be a good man, that is, a rich man, wanted so much Money: this he readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and I had the Money delivered me, only giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a Bond, whereto I have counterfeited the name of him whom I told him was the Borrower, and my self, with one more was a witness: this have I done with two or three, who was confident would trust me; and with two I have pretended they would bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of one another two hundred pound apiece, and given each other a Counterfeit Bond; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but smile, to think in what a case they will both be when the time of payment comes, and instead
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:32749:137"/>
of receiving, they will demand two hundred pounds of each other: it may be they will be so frollick as to go to law; if they do, it will make good sport for the Lawyers. By this means, as I tell you, I have raised fifteen hundred pounds, which I have all ready by me in good Jocobusses, and am ready in ten days to march off with my Captain for the <hi>East Indies,</hi> now if the Drugster had his money in readiness, I should be glad of so good Company. I heard him with much delight, and from that very minute resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make one of the Company, and then offered him my service, which he kindly accepted of, and promised me that I should share all fortunes with him.</p>
            <p>I went back to my Mistress, and provided my self for my Voyage: and the next day the Drugster bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Keys, the Chest where his Clothes were was opened, and all in it were examined, but no Money found: I remember that every parcel of Cloaths they took, his eye was so fixed, that I thought would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remove it; but at length all was pass'd over, and the Clothes prized at Twenty pounds: he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly entreated that he might have them; but they replied, they could not do it without the consent of all, unless they gave so much out of their own poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and they had already lost too much by him. He finding that there was no way but one, took me with him to a Tavern, and conjured me to do him one kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which was, by all means to purchase these cloaths at any rate; and giving me the ten pound, I had brought him, and five pound more, he knew not at present what to do for five or ten pound more, which he advised me to give for the Cloaths rather then fail. It was too far to go to his Ladies Quarters,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:32749:137"/>
wherefore I out of my own stock supplied that want; and then going to the Creditors, with much ado, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them, who had the Keys, to sell me the Cloaths: he would not consent to this, unless I would give him thirty pound, which was ten pound more then they were appraised at: though the demand was unreasonable, yet I was forced to consent, and putting ten pound into his own pockets, willingly delivered the Cloaths to me, charging me not to discover what I gave. I did not much heed what he said, but gladly received the Chest and Key, and carried it to the Drugster, who with much impatience expected me, it being carried up into a private Chamber; and the door fast locked, he unlocked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Chest, and took out the Cloaths, and drawing his Knife, unript the Collar of a Doublet, where were several pieces of Gold: Nay then, said he, we are still safe, and I defie Fortune and all her malice: in less then half an hour, with my assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, we found out 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Gold, which was sewed up in several places about the Cloaths. This being done, I soon acquainted him with the Scriveners Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and my resolution, to this he likewise consented, only, said he, I must not leave my honest Girl behind me. For that, said I, I question not but I shall have some influence to perswade her; and thereupon I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with my former knowledge of her: Well, said he, since it is so, we will continue her a friend to us both, and not entertain any jealousie. In fine, we agreed not only in that particular, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing else; and the Scrivener being acquainted with all our designs, we so ordered the matter, that I, the Drugster, and our Mistress, and the Scrivener, and a Wench of his, whom he had likewise put into mans Apparrel, did all come on board with all our Treasure
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:32749:138"/>
into our Captains Ship which was in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and bound for this place; and so having good Winds, good Company, and every thing to our content, are all safely arrived in this place.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THus did our Relator finish his long story, which was so filled with profit, as well as pleasure, that I accounted the time I had spent in hearing him the best bestowed of any: for I gathered so much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of experien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, that if I had any mind to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute my former course of life in cheating and Roguing, I might now soon profess my self to be my Arts Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, if I did but bravely follow those Examples he had related to me: but if they were any wise impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as I had a Genius fit enough to be highly active, I might then out do all Example.</p>
            <p>These were my first thoughts, but I had not much time to spend in contemplation: but he having put an end of his discourse, I kindly thanked him for his great freedom used in his relation; and told him, that since he had been so generous to me in unbosom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, I in requital did promise him a lasting friendship, and at our first leisure recounted some of my life to him, which I had hitherto concealed, that should give him satisfaction that I intended to use an absolute freedom with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:32749:138"/>Thus did we contract a friendship, and it was now time to eat somewhat, the best part of the day having been spent in his long narrative: such as the house af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded we had, and after a repast, we concluded both to go on board of their Ship to find out his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he resolving to acquaint them with what had passed between us, and to let them know my quality, believing they would be well enough satisfied with what he had done, because they might have great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to make use of me.</p>
            <p>In this resolution we were preparing to go to the Ship, when the Scrivener and Drugster entred the house, enquiring for their Companion, who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to them, they desired him to walk out, that they might confer together: No, said he, let us take a Room here and discourse, which we may do with as much freedom as any where else: he urging it, they consented, and having a private Room and necessaries, after a cup or too of Wine, I left their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, on purpose to give my friend the <hi>Taylor</hi> (who was called <hi>Gregory</hi>) the opportunity of acquainting them with what had passed between us, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he did in very few words; for within half an hour I was called for, and being kindly saluted by the two Gentlemen, was desired to sit down and make one of their Company. After a Cup or two of Wine more had passed, my friend <hi>Gregory Taylor</hi> thus spake to me: Friend, I have acquainted these my two Friends and Companions with our late discourse, and by that they know that all their affairs are known to you also; I have told them what I know of you, and we are all sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:32749:139"/>
hath been spilt of late years. and when I left <hi>England,</hi> there was a discontented party that was ready on all occasions to attempt a publique mischeif for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interest, and only to maintain a private self-will'd fancy, which they term'd Religion.</p>
            <p>I my self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or a long time bewitcht with a Fanatick Zeal; and my Master being a man of the same Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, had instill'd such Principles into me, that I had much ado to have any charity for any person that was in the right: but in time I finding a great deal of strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the precise practice, and that under pretence of much Zeal, there was more Covetousness then in any other perswasion; I quitted that perswasion for another, and shifted so long, that I found my life but one continued Comedy of errors. In the end I went over to the Episcopal party; and one of the most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful reasons that I had to follow the Independant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, was a Woman, my Mistresses Sister, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you have already heard. Yes, said I, this our friend hath given me satisfaction in that particular, and I very well approve of the revenge you had upon her: and as for my own part, I was once a very great Lover of the Ramble my self, but left it, out of a more generous consideration: for being in company with an Orthodox Parson, he told me that I was much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in my opinions; he gave me such a Character of a Libertine Zealot, as I knew to be true, and wholly put me out of conceit with the Faction: they were now all desirous to hear what was said to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and therefore I told them I would recollect my self, and give them the best account that I could, and such a one as I believed they would conclude with me, was not only ingenious, but true: and thereupon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this manner.</p>

               <head>The Character of a Libertine Zealot.</head>
               <p>TO describe him right, is a task like that of the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor who took measure of the Devil; for there is nothing more like him upon Earth then he: He is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Covetousness, and covered with Hypocrisie, the Root and Cloak of all evil. Although at this time he carries a Bible, yet upon occasion he wears a Sword; so that it is hard to say, whether he be of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon</hi> or <hi>Levi.</hi> He swallows contrary Oaths faster then the Eagles in the Tower do gobbets of flesh; for the way to Hell, and the Conscience of a Libertine, are two broad things. He condemns the lawful Rites and Ceremonies of the Church; and is more ravished with the squeaking of a Tythe-pig, then with the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick of Organs.</p>
               <p>He appears at his Preachment (like <hi>Aesops</hi> Crow) in a dress of borrowed feathers; for he preaches the works of other men, which are so much the worse for the coming out of his mouth, as Wares for being of the second hand. But it would grieve your heart to see how he racks the ancient Fathers, when he makes his own confession, and mangles the Modern Divines more barbarously then the Hang-man did the body of <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>: I am sure poor <hi>Priscian</hi> gets many a broken head.</p>
               <p>His Eloquence consists altogether in rayling, as though he had got his education at <hi>Billinsgate.</hi> In his discourse he runs on like a Mad-dog, foaming and open mouth'd, yelping at the Reverend Bishops; and even accounts many of his own Brethren, the Sectaries,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:32749:140"/>
as mad as himself. Yet sometimes he perceives that his stuff is too short for the hour-Glass; and then the wheels of his Rhetorick moove very heavily: he then spends much time in humming and spitting; and with the wiping of his Nose, makes many a filty Parenthesis.</p>
               <p>As for his Text, he handles that as <hi>Moses</hi> did his Rod, when it was turned into a Serpent, he lays it down, and runs away from it: yet his Sermon lies all written before him, for the poor Copy holder in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity can do nothing without his Notes.

               <p>It is confessed, that at the begining of the happy Reformation, he was a little stubborn; perhaps, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a second War; but now (poor heart) he hath
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:32749:141"/>
learned to pray for his Majesty: but (if you could hear the language of his Soul) it is so, as impatient heirs pray for their rich fathers. There are two sorts of men, who having escaped a deserved pair of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, prey for the King very strangly, that is, a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, whilst the Executioner burns his hand; and a Traytor, whilst the Devil sears his Conscience.</p>
               <p>If you would know his name, you may find it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd to an ugly Petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for where <hi>Bradshaw</hi> was a <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemned, he was one of those Jews that cry'd Crucifie. He professes sorrow for the Martry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our late Soveraign; but believe him not, for his hand helped to hale him to the Block. In a word, he is (at best) but a State Crocodile, and one that is Maudlin-drunk with the Kings blood.</p>
               <p>No more, but if you chance to meet with a Hue and Cry, you may tell them that he was lately in a Sequestred Parsonage.</p>
               <p>This Character was hugely pleasing to the Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and indeed, he and his two Companions, the Scrivener and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Taylor, did all conclude that it was very ingeniously true, and gave much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to them in that particular; and they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <hi>That the Dissenters from the Church, were the Murtherers of their Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They all so well approving of what had been said of these Varlets, I told them that I could likewise relate somewhat else of the same Gentlemans composure, who writ the <hi>Character</hi>; and which I did conclude to be altogether as ingenious, and that it was a great novelty, having never as yet been in Print: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earnest in their desires to hear me, I told them it was only the fifth Fable of <hi>Aesop</hi> Moralized; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I began as follows:

                     <l>Each Beast being troubled with their hungry maws,</l>
                     <l>Were urging Clyents to their panting Iaws:</l>

there would now in a short time be some end of these growing Factions; because, said he, that Quakerism is the last that is risen up, and it is now above twelve years since it began to be famous; and though hitherto it encreases, yet they have not found any other novelty from that, as at first there was out of the first Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faction: but there is not one that is produced by the Quaker; so that it is hoped that will be the last of the Factions. I have heard of one small Faction that contradicts the Quakers, and that is one <hi>Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Sect, who together with one <hi>Reeve,</hi> does pretend to be the two last Witnesses that are to come upon earth. <hi>Reeve</hi> is some time since dead, but <hi>Muggleton</hi> surviving him, is a great enemy to the Quakers, and their chief Opponent: for they questioning his Call, he for that cause Damns them; and so absolute he is, that he says, after he hath Damn'd them, they cannot be saved, not by Providence it self. He professes in one of his writings, being an Interpretation of the 11 Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> That he, and he alone can give a true Interpretation of the Scripture, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the whole Counsel of God, concerning himself, the Devil, and all Mankind from the foundation of the world to all Eternity; and this was never revealed by any of the Sons of Men, untill now: Thus subscribing his Papers, By <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> one of the two last Commissionated Witnesses and Prophets of the only High, Immortal, Glorious God, <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We told the Drugster that this Sect of <hi>Mugletons</hi> we had not heard of; and I being very desirous to be further acquainted with this opinion, asked him if he had read his Writings, Yes, said he, and there is as extraordinary matters and opinions handled and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of therein, as any Sect that this last age hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:32749:143"/>
nay, and more absolute he would make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self then all others; but he more especially writes against the Quakers, in a manner condemning them all in general. I desiring to be more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his writings, he granted my request, and proceeded as followeth:</p>
               <p>This Book of his writing, said he, falling into the hands of one <hi>Edward Bourn</hi> a Quaker, is by him despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and cavilled at; for, he said that he had perused it till he was weary with looking into it, for it was one of the dirtiest and confusedest pieces of work that ever he saw: and many other particular cavils had he against it; which <hi>Muggleton</hi> hearing of, is so much offended, that he writes a Letter to him, dated in <hi>August</hi> 1662. and there he concludes: </p>
               <q>
                  <p>I write these Lines unto you <hi>Edward Bourn,</hi> knowing you to be of the seed of the Serpent, and appointed to eternal Damnation before you were born; though you know it not, I do know it, by your speaking evil of that Doctrine which is declared by us the Witnesses of the Spirit, by calling it deceit, confusion and lies, with many more wicked speeches against the purest truth that ever was declared by Prophet or Apostle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the Commission of the Spirit, and the last Witness of God on Earth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore for these your hard sayings against the Doctrine of this Commission of the Spirit; In obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto my Commission, I pronounce you cursed and damned, both Soul and Body, from the presence of God, elect men and Angels, to Eternity: neither shall that light within you, nor any God deliver you from this curse, but according to my word it shall be upon you, because you shall know, that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven power unto Man to curse you to eternity, and

               <p>Soon after the Printing of these Letters, I met with

a Quaker, an acquaintance of mine, and asked of him whether he had seen these Letters of <hi>Muggletons,</hi> which went by the Name of <hi>The Neck of the Quakers broken, or cut in sunder by the two-edged sword of the Spirit, which is put into my mouth.</hi> He replyed, Yea, he had.

                  </gap>t thou, said I, of those of your perswasion in general, and more particularly of those persons whom he hath damn'd? I think him to be a deluded person, said he, for I have known him long, and also his fellow Prophet <hi>Reeve,</hi> who is since dead: and I remember this one passage, that one of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion did calmly discourse with <hi>Reeve</hi> about many principal things of his Judgment and Opinion: and though they did not agree to every thing, yet <hi>Reeve</hi> said he, believed he would be converted, for that he was confident he was of the seed of Faith, and not of that of the Devil; only that his eyes were not yet opened, but in time they would. And thus they parted.</p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Muggleton</hi> (who was always more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant than <hi>Reeve)</hi> being affronted by some Quakers, according to his custome, pronounced the sentance of damnation against them; which the Quaker, who had discoursed with <hi>Reeve</hi> hearing, and meeting with <hi>Muggleton,</hi> told him he had done very ill in being so rash as to damn them: And further, charged him with wandring up and down to make Sects. To this <hi>Muggleton</hi> replyed, It is not I, it is those of the Quakers that wander up and down; as those that went to <hi>New England,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> unto <hi>Rome,</hi> to get the Pope and his Bishops to be Disciples of Christ; and there to be puni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

within him, and was not sent by the voice of God without him: Therefore eternal damnation will be his reward for going without a Commission from God; and so will all the Ministers of the Quakers. And whereas you say that my mouth is full of cursing, and that I shall reap of the same: Likewise you say, that I am out of Christs and the Apostles Doctrine, that said, <hi>Bless, and Curse not</hi>; with many other sayings: As for my Mouth being full of Cursing, that is my Commission; neither do I curse any but Devils, which are appointed for it of God; and there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one that I have cursed, that shall escape that Curse which I have denounced upon them; neither will any God deliver them from it: for I do curse none but the Seed of the Serpent, who had his Curse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon him and his Seed, at the beginning by God himself.</p>
               <p>To this discour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of <hi>Muggletons,</hi> our Brother the Quaker making some angry reply, in contradicting what he had said, <hi>Muggleton</hi> did for that cause pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently pronounce the sentence of Damnation, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was of the Seed of the Devil. Thus, said the <hi>Quaker,</hi> though <hi>Reeve</hi> said he was not of the Seed of the Devil; yet <hi>Muggleton</hi> his fellow Prophet said he was, and therefore proceeded against him to damnation. Now, whether he be damned or saved, judge you: And therefore, said he, I think it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much what he says, because they thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another.</p>
               <p>And thus we parted, and I concluded, that as it was no great matter what <hi>Muggleton</hi> said or did; so there was no great heed to be taken with what was, or should be said or done by the Quakers: I believing and knowing that what <hi>Muggleton</hi> had said of them as

               <p>Thus did the Drugster discourse of the Factions, and we with him did hope and conclude, that since there was no greater a growth in Faction, there hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been no new ones for some years last past, that it was more than probable that they would consume and moulder away of themselves.</p>
               <p>The forenoon being spent wholly in the large Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the Adventures of my now fellow Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Guests, and the most of the Afternoon in this Discourse, it was time now to think of parting; and they being mindful of the Entertainment they were to give me the next day on board of their Ship, being out of my house, furnished with some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary provisions, all parted from me.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>MY Company being thus parted from me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to consider all the passages that had been this day related to me; and after a serious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, I concluded, that I might place this day as the most remarkable in all my life; for I was acquainted with so much variety of experiences, as I had in a manner been hitherto wholy ignorant of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what had happened to me in the former part of my life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been trivial in comparison of what I had now late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard: and I concluded, that if I should have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to all parts of the world to have found out Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions fit for me; I could not have been better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with those that should have been so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to my natural inclination, then those whom fortune had now brought to me. I had made it my resolve, to make my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as comfortable as I could, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old saying amongst those of my quality <hi>Though a short life, yet a merry</hi>: and I saw Providence had put such an opportunity into my hands, that I had all things provided for me, and nothing before their arrival was wanting but such a Society. For I had a plentiful estate, but that gave me little content, being without the usual Society of the Wits; and I
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:32749:147"/>
now was likely not only to enjoy that in a full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but also there was some female Company, the two Lasses in mens apparel, who I understood were good Girl, and such I hoped as would not prove hard-hearted, and deny one of their Country-men the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual civility of their enjoyments: I did not much question it, because indeed I was so much in favour with <hi>Venus,</hi> that I was hardly ever refused that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie by any of her Votaresses.</p>
            <p>I told my wife, there was a great likelihood of much profit to be gained by these Guests, who were resolved to take up my house wholly for their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and therefore I ordered all things to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ample manner for their constant entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for though I was now rich enough, yet I knew not how soon fortune might turn tail upon me, and therefore knowing that my Guests were all well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Moneys, I was resolved to put in with them for a share of it: But I had no thoughts of wronging them, or putting any trick upon them; for it is accounted a very great crime in the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of Roguery, to cozen or cheat his fellow Thief, and a thing seldome done amongst them. I had now some thoughts of leaveing my black wife and that Country; and when these my new acquaintance should leave this place for another, as I suppose they would, then to go with them, for there was nothing there that gave any great invitation to stay in it, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination leading me rather to visit some <hi>European</hi> Country.</p>
            <p>These considerations took me up some time; and night coming on, I betook me to my Cot, where I took my ordinary repose; and the next morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, I apparelled my self the richest that I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>it two of my Country-women, in whose favour I was desirous to get some place. Being thus accoutred, I went to the Sea-side, and with the help of a Boat was soon aboard a Ship: where I was welcomed by the Captain and the rest of the Company, and by them conducted into a great Cabin, where was no other Company but the two Women; who now being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in their Womans habit <hi>Ala mode d' Anglois,</hi> I was very well pleased, not having for a long time seen any thing so acceptable and pleasant: I had not forgotten our English Fashion of saluting them, neither were they backward in rising and meeting me in order thereto: that done, I placed myself between them; I soon began a discourse to them, which I knew would not at all be displeasing, and that was commending their Beauties, telling them, that if the present Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Country, the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> did but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what a treasure he had in his Country by their arrival, that he would quickly secure it to himself, and hinder the prosecution of their Voyage any further. To this they reply'd, that they did not believe he would see any thing in them that should merit such an esteem: but, added one of them, If he should do so, and be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so desirous of my Company, yet I am better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (in the Society that I am at present in possession of) then if I were courted and served by the greatest Prince upon Earth.</p>
            <p>To this so generous speech, I reply'd, that those persons who had the honour to be her servants were in that very happy. These Complements being pass'd drink was brought, and after that Victuals, which we had in great plenty, there being no want of any thing that could he had at the best mans table in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>;

and all the dishes of Meat were dress'd in the English fashion, by a Cook of that Country. After Dinner we fell again to discourse, the Women being very desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Novelties, and to be acquainted with the customs of the Country, especially of those used by Women; but when I told them of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Custom of the better sort of Country-women, how they usually accompanied their Husbands in death, by burning their living with their Husbands dead bodies, they were not very well pleased therewith, accounting it great folly; for, said they, it cannot possibly do their Husbands any good, and why they should so destroy themselves out of a complement, was foolish. To pass through, and accompany a Husband or friend whilst living in all dangers, is what is befitting; but there being no remedy for death, nor no present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment after death, thus to cast away themselves, is ridiculous. We allowed of their Opinions, as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon reason: I asked them how they liked our Men, the Inhabitants; Not at all, said one of them as a Husband or Bed-fellow, but if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to be had, we must be contented with them rather then none, as well as you are with the Native-women. Various were our Discourses in which we entertained one another with much pleasure, having a lusty bowl of Punch still standing by us, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h as we drank off, we renewed, and at some of our frolicks, one of the great Guns were discharged. I had ey'd both these women very curiously, and did imagine, that I had formerly seen them, and had some acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them. I knew one of them more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by the tone of her Voice, but it having been so long a time since I had seen either, I could not call them to mind; I did not at all think it covenient to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:32749:148"/>
ask them any particular questions, referring that to a greater privacy. I being now acquainted with most of their transactions, they asked my advice in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their moneys, and selling their Commodities, and what to buy to turn to the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t advantage: To all these Questions I gave them the best answers I could, to their satisfaction; and now night coming on, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to leave them, and invited them all to my house the next day, they not only concluded on that, but agreed that the Women should constantly take my house for their quarters, it being more convenient then on board of the Ship, they coming in their mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and I providing for them with all privacy; to this I agreed, and after a fresh Cup of Wine, and my ordinary salutes to the women, I left them and went home to my wife, who at my desire provided all things necessary, not only for the next days entertainment, but for the future conveniency of my lodgers who were not to be known to her for other then men.</p>
            <p>The next day they came, and we were again all merry but some occasions calling away the men, the women were left alone with me. I was now resolv'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether they had never known me: they both replied, Not that they at present knew of; but they both said, that certainly they had seen me in <hi>England,</hi> but at present they could not remember where, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prayed me to give them some account of my condition and quality when I lived in <hi>England</hi>: To this I reply'd, that I had indeed been of all conditions, and a very rambler, and it was a great chance, but if they had been in any publique house of Entertainment, that I might have seen them there, to this they both answered, that they had for some time been publique enough in entertaining Gentlemen in their Company

To this she told me, that she knew there was no remedy for what was passed, but that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that first misfortune could not but sensibly afflict her, but she should throw off that sorrow, and make the best of a bad matter; and thank providence, that since it was no better, that it was no worse: and as she had hitherto been well contented with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, so she intended to frame her spirit and mind to be so for the future; and that now she had the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction she had often desired, in seeing that person who first tasted and crop'd her Virgin Flower. Her Companion did likewise say, that it was the greatest satisfaction she had ever received since the loss of my
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:32749:150"/>
company, that she had again found me; for (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my base and abrupt leaving her) she had still preserved a more cordial love for me, then for any person she had ever since then enjoyed. The other said the same, and though I was partly unknown to her when I lay with her, as being disguised in womans apparel, yet she still had me in her memory, and often wished for the sight of me: And from this discourse we all concluded, that though a Woman had many Husbands or Servants, yet she seldom loved any man with so much affection as him with whom she first tryed and tasted the effects of love, and who had her Virginity.</p>
            <p>Well Ladies, (said I) I am so much bound to you for preserving an affection for me, who have so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily deserved it, That I shall dedicate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of my life wholly to obey and serve you. As for that profession of your love now, said the Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Mistress, (who was the youngest, and her, who I had enjoy'd at the Boarding-school) it matters not much, for we have had experience enough in the World to shift for our selves; and neither are we unprovided of those who will take care for us, and save you that trouble. No trouble at all, replyed I, but an honour, which I pray you to bestow on me to serve you in any degree.</p>
            <p>They were very much surpriz'd, and so was I at this adventure: And I thought it was best to talk no more of it at present, wherefore I call'd for some Wine, and such Banqueting cheer as I had, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to participate of it, which they did; and so I at present diverted them from that profound me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly wherein they were brought upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. At length they again reassumed their jovial
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:32749:150"/>
temper; and beginning to be a little frollick, I assisted them in that humour: but I was very earnest to know their adventures, being, as I supposed, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, they being both with Child by me when I left them; I therefore begg'd the satisfaction to know what did become of the Fruit of our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, those Children which I suppose they had by me; for I told them I was not unsensible of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I left them in when I parted from them. Truly reply'd the Drugsters Mistress, who was named <hi>Mary,</hi> I know not at all what became of mine since it was born. And said the other, who was the Scriveners Mistress, and was named <hi>Dorothy,</hi> and had been the Farmers Daughter, I know but little of mine since it was a year old. I was desirous to hear of both of them their several fortunes, or rather misfortunes since I first knew them; and they agreeing to give me that satisfaction, it was concluded that Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> with whom I had first to do, should first relate her story: and therefore she began as followeth.</p>

I remember, I perswaded him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Cloaths with me, and so I escaped; but I would gladly know how be came off. Truly, replied Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> that story was somewhat strange, for the Constable who seized him, had order not to make much noise in the matter, but only to secure him at present in his own house, which he having done, came to our Boarding-School, and acquainted our Mistress that he had secured the party; this being known, my Mistress sent her Son whose Cloathes were stollen to the place; where instead of finding our maid <hi>Iane</hi> (for by that name, I remember you went, when you lived with us) he saw a strange young man in his Cloaths, though he was told before you had his cloaths on, which he yet saw before him, yet he knew you well enough, not to be so mistaken: for the party that was in that habit was nothing like you; he therefore thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat all that had been reported to him was false, till he had made a further enquiry of the young man your friend, who was first asked, where he had those Cloaths: he not knowing any reason he should deny any thing of the truth, freely and fully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he had them in exchange of his own, of a young man his friend; and being asked many other questions, as whether he knew you, and knew you to be a man, and where this Exchange was made? He fully resolved his Examiners of all questions, and proved the Exchange of Cloaths by the people of the house where the exchange was made.</p>
            <p>My Mistresses Son being returned with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Mother, it caused great wonder in all who were not privy to your disguize, but there being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seven or eight of us, who were knowing of that secret, and were known to lie with you, we were all
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:32749:152"/>
privately examined, and some of us having been sick for some time before, and now strictly examined of the cause, and whether we knew any thing of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, and whether you were Man or Woman; we could not hide or deny our knowledge thereof. Upon this discovery, our Mistress (though she was termed a very discreet person) was so outragious, that we thought she would have lost the ordinary use of her Sences; and several revenges she propounded to take of you, not thinking you were escaped her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: but when she understood that you were gone, she caused all privy search and enquiry to be made after you, but to no purpose. The young man, your friend, who had been secured, was discharged, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found wholly innocent of the crime; and neither was he deprived of his cloaths, but had them freely given to him, and a good sum of money promised him if he could find and secure you: but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>h much endeavour was used to find you, yet I could never hear any thing of you, till this late encounter.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in my story, our Mistress upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts resolved to keep this business private for some longer time, to see how many of those seven or eight with whom you had lain, would prove with Child; and it was not long before she found that five of the number were pregnant, whereof I was one. How she ordered the matter with the rest, I know not; but for my own part, my father being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my misfortune, wholly refused to take any care or notice of me; neither have I ever since seen his face; for though I supposed he loved me well enough, yet I had a Mother in Law, who might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to flight me, and made use of this occasion to throw me off: but though I was thus cast off by
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:32749:152"/>
my Father, yet I had an Aunt, who was Sister to my own Mother, who came and visited me; and finding that what was past could not be helpt, took me home with her to her house; where after the usual time of Womens breeding and bearing children, I was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Daughter, which was soon after its birth sent further into the Country to be nursed: and I suppose it was carried thus privately, in hopes to soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up the crack that might be in my reputation, which though it did for the present, yet it soon after brake out again.</p>
            <p>For a young Gentleman who lived in the next Town to that where my Aunt dwelt, having seen me, fell in love with me, and often waited on me at my Aunts, and took many opportunities of meeting me abroad. Though I liked and loved him well enough, and could have been pleased to have entertained his love with liking at the first offer of it, yet I was commanded by my Aunt to stand off, and be coy in my entertaining of him, lest, as she said, he might by my freeness sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me of lightness; for the matter had been so pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately carried in my lying in, that it was not known to him nor any, but some few in the House; and to all others I passed as a Virgin. I taking this advice of my Aunt, gave him but indifferent entertainment; so that he who was passionately in love with me, devised all ways he could to woe, please and win me; and to that end, he not only presented me with many Gifts, as marks of his affection, but also (according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome) and that so largely, that she promised him all her assistance, and gave him notice of all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereby he might wait on me, and please me. All things were now brought to a very good pass, and my Aunt had so prudently mannaged this affair, that my

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:32749:153"/>
he pretending somewhat was amiss in one of his Horses shoes: here we having privacy, he attempted to be more free with me than ever, and prevailed so far with me, that he had the examining of my Placket, with more freedom then modesty would allow of; but though he would have proceeded further, yet I refused it; he seeing this, desisted, and we again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte our Horses, and he conducted me safely to my Aunts: but although it was very late, yet she sat up, and expected me; and expressed her self very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him for keeping me out so unseasonably: he did not well rellish her words, but reply'd somewhat tartly to her again, which encreased her anger, and raised it to some passion, and so in anger they at that time parted, he riding home to his own house. I was likewise suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My Lover was resolved to make use of that dayes experience of my easiness, and my Aunts anger, which he was well enough pleased should continue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forbore coming to visit me; but he sent a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my Maid (who had betray'd me) to give him a meeting: she obeyed his summons, and there, and then was my ruine contrived; for it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them two, that she should perswade me to be ruled by him in every thing, without acquainting my Aunt any more with my proceedings; and a Letter was written, wherein he express<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a continuance of his love, and desires of mine, and for a proof thereof, he desires me to provide my self to meet him at a place appointed, which I did, and there we concluded to go for <hi>London</hi> together, where he promised to Marry me
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:32749:154"/>
without any more delays. I believing him in every thing, (being perswaded thereto by my treacherous servant) took only some few necessaries with me, and so went to him. And thus leaving all, went with him to <hi>London,</hi> where when we were Arrived, he went to some Lodgings, where he had provided, as he said, for himself and wife. I was at first contented with the discourse and name of Wife; but when Bed-time came, I was not fully satisfied to go to Bed with him; which, though I at first opposed, yet in the end, after many protestations of his next days performance of Marriage, I consented to, and thereby agreed to my undoing; for the next day, instead of Marriage, he went out in the Morning, leaving me only with the Landlady of the house, and returned not in two days; and then he pretended he had been in great vexation, for that very morning he left me, he being going to speak with a Priest to Marry us, he was met with by a person, to whom he was a little indebted, who basely trappan'd and Arrested him, and he was forc'd to be in the custody of Bayliffs ever since, till he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded a Friend to lend him some moneys, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with what he had of his own, he said he had paid to his debtor, and so was discharged. And now, said he to me, I have sent home for some more monies, which I know will be brought me in two days time, and then I shall put an end to this business of our Marriage</p>
            <p>Although I seeemed discontented with what he told me, and did begin to believe that he would abuse me; yet I knew it was to no purpose to be very angry, and onely caused him to give me fresh protestations of the honesty of his intentions, and that as soon as ever his money was come, he would fulfil all my desires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:32749:154"/>Thus was I forced to be contented with what he said, and to comply with him in all his desires: for we lay together; but I kept within doors very privately, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to be seen by any body, till such time as our Wedding should be over.</p>
            <p>But though two or three days, and a week was now past since he pretended he had sent into the Country for money, yet there came no returns: at which I was very much discontented, he also seeming dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, I then told him, that I had brought a small sum of money with me, which I supposed would be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pay the charges of that occasion. He asked me how much I had, I told him about 10 <hi>l.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he was somewhat blanck, and at a nonpluss at this proposition: but he soon recovering himself, told me that he expected 100 <hi>l.</hi> to be brought him, and that would be little enough to defray all the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he intended to be at; for he purposed to lay it all out in Cloathes for me and himself, that we might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more splendidly, not only to some friends in <hi>London,</hi> whom he purposed to visit soon after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but also in the Country whither he intended in short time to return to demand my portion, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle all things according to the agreement of our friends and as for the small sum of 10 <hi>l.</hi> he told me I would have occasion to lay it out in trivial things on that occasion.</p>
            <p>Thus was I put off at this time; and indeed so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten afterwards, that I in plain terms told him, that I supposed he intended to abuse me, he being resolved to stand the brunt of all my exclamations at this time, did not endeavour, as formerly to pacifie me, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoked me to say more, and be more angry with him, which I was, and reproached him with the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:32749:155"/>
abuse he had done me. He having heard the utmost of what I could say, in short told me, that he was the abused party; for should he marry me, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he should have a greater charge to maintain then I told him of, for he had u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>derstood that I was Mother of a Child; and so the abuse that I would put on him was double: I was so surprised with what he said, that I was more dead then alive, and could not for a long time speak to him; and when I attempted it, I knew not what to say for my self, for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctly told me, that he was acquainted with every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of that my misfortune: and thus having said, he left me.</p>
            <p>Many and sad were the thoughts that I entertained in my mind, and I perceived my self to be miserable: for to return to my Aunt, I knew it would be to no purpose, I having thus abused her in my last leaving her. Therefore I concluded it was my best course at present to comply with the desires of my first Lover, not knowing whom to flee to for refuge; wherefore at his return home, I began to him in tears to lament my sad condition, begging pardon for what was past, cleerly confessing the truth of all my former misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that I would for the future be very obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and constant to him in all things: he gave me the hearing of what I said, and told me all should be well; but I could never find him after that inclinable to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me, only putting me off with one pretence or other and having a full enjoyment of me already, cared for no more: and now to content and please him, I must not only entertain several of his friends at home at our lodging, but also wait on him abroad; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Wife, I passed for his Couzen.</p>
            <p>Amongst other per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons that came to visit him, there
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:32749:155"/>
was a Gentleman of good quality, who being of his intimate Acquaintance, was frequent at our Lodgings: he taking his opportunity to find me alone, made a tender of his Love and Service to me, and offered me his assistance in every thing I should command him. I finding that he understood somewhat of my condition already, and believing it would be to no purpose to conceal any thing from him, did make him an exact and true narrative of my misfortunes: he was much troubled at the recital of things so strange, but did comfort me the best he could, promising me his best assistance in putting his friend on to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Marriage: for, said he, I know little reason he hath to deny or refuse it. For your misfortune at the Boarding-School, was so subtile a business, that you cannot w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll be blamed for it.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman accordingly did endeavour to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess my hoped for Husband with that opinion, and to perswade him to marry me but all in vain; for he had now all the sweets he could expect from me, having lain with me for above a month together, and in that time I endeavoured with all artifice I could, to give him all possible content: but he was now cloy'd; and therefore told his friend, that for his Mistress he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to keep me, but never to have me for a Wife. I was neer distracted when this answer was told me; but the Gentleman did again comfort me, promising that he hoped in short time to put all things to rights again. I seeing it was to no purpose to be angry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to bear all things with patience, and seem to be frollick, which was to a good height; and this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman seeing me in so merry a humour, was desirous to put in for a share in the pleasure of my enjoyments, and to that end now courted me indeed: he had been
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:32749:156"/>
so civil to me in these late transactions, that I could not hansomely refuse him any thing; but however, I for some time held out against all his loving importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; but he having an absolute freedom in our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so opportunity, that he won me to his embraces, and had a full possession of me. Thus was I enjoyed by two men; but my last Lover was very cautious in keeping this his enjoyment from the knowledge of his friend, and we took opportunities in his absence to renew our pleasures. But at length we grew so bold in these practices, that my first Lover discovered us, and waching his opportunity by hiding himself in the Chamber, he took us in the manner. He discovering himself, used many outragious speeches to me and my Companion, as, that he abused him, in perswading and urging him to marry with one who was his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute: the other flew out in high expressions; and being valorous enough; they drew their weapons, and before I could get any to interpose and hinder their fight, my new Lover was wounded, and that so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately, that he fell; the other seeing that, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him killed, fled, and so left me: and my woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend being visited by Chirurgions, recover'd a little, but desired to be removed to his own Lodgings lest he might be prejudiced by the various reports that would run upon this occasion; I was likewise willing to have it so, as thinking it most covenient.</p>
            <p>Thus was I left alone, and I, who lately had two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Servants, was now left without any; for my old friend came no more after me, and my new Servant who was wounded, was forced for his health-sake to be carried into the Country.</p>
            <p>Now did I find my self truly distressed, for I wholly retired my self, not seeing any man, and was only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:32749:156"/>
by my Landlady, and another ancient woman who frequented her house. In vain did I expect the return of either of my Lovers, and almo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t all my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys was gone, in Diet, and for payment of Lodging. My Landlady proposed several ways and courses for me to take, as to send to my first friend who brought me thither, which I did, but could not hear of him; she would have had me send to my Aunt, but I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refused so to do, being resolved to bear with any necessities, rather then again to apply my self to her.</p>
            <p>The other old woman, who, I told you, frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our house, did then put in some words to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, and my Landlady leaving us together, she told me, that if I would be ruled by her, she would so order matters, that I should want for nothing, and live the most pleasantest life in the world. I who was now miserable enough, was well enough pleased to hear of pleasure, and bid her say on: She thereupon told me, that it was great pity that so delicate a beauty as mine should be closeted up, and that I should spend that time in tears and lamentations, which might not only be a pleasure to my self, but many others who would love me with a great deal of passion; and whereas hitherto I had only been reserved to serve the pleasures of one man, or two at the most, and for that I had only reaped sorrow and trouble; that I might command many, who would, not only please and serve me, but I should command their purses, by having money enough at my own dispose. Many words to this purpose she uttered, and many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments she used. Though at the first I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what she aimed at, yet by several Questions, which she answered me, I found she would have me prostitute my Body for my pleasure, and to gain a
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:32749:157"/>
livelihood; and in fine, should get my living with the hands I sate on.</p>
            <p>Though I had tasted man, as first with you, and afterwards had two at a time, my two late Lovers, and by that was induced to desire more of the same pleasures, yet I was extreamly unwilling to prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute my body to every fellow that should bring mony in his hand; and this I suppose I must do, if once I undertook that course. Thus I reasoned with this old woman, but she told me. No, I should not do so, for I should only have my choice of what and whom I liked, and few of such would be profitable enough to maintain me in a splendid Garb; and to this she gave me so many reasons, that I consenting to leave my Lodgings, went with her to the place where she conducted me.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> She gives an account of her being entred into a Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy house, where she received great profit by the sale of her Maidenhead.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Being now come to the place intended, was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a Grave ancient Matron, in whose face might be seen the ruines of no common beauty; and the defects of that being occasioned by age, was sufficiently supplied in a deportment and garb that was not common, though it were very pleasant. She gave me many welcomes, and told me that she had a very great respect for me, having heard of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and hoping that she might put an end to my
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:32749:157"/>
sorrows, and afford me fresh pleasure: she had to that end employed that antient woman as her Messenger, to perswade me to leave that house of Mourning wherein I was, for hers, which was a Pallace, nay, a Paradice of pleasure, wherein I should be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with all manner of contentment. I told her I should be willingly obedient to her commands, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of those pleasures she promised. Several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Discourses we had, whereby she gave me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions how to behave my self; and, said she, since you intend to make one of my Family, I shall give you an account of my manner and method in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the same.</p>
            <p>My house, continued she, being frequented by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all Qualities, it is therefore necessary that I should be furnished with women, who should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and fit for their respective accommodations, for the Servants and Pages must be sometimes served as well as their Masters; I therefore distinguish those women that belong unto me into three several sorts and distinctions; and because I intend to make use of you only in the first and principal, I shall therefore be more particular in my discourse to you of that.</p>
            <p>You are therefore to know, that as my house is well enough furnished with women to accommodate my ordinary Guests, so I have several who are kept abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who serve for the extraordinary accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my best sort of Guests, and those are such as are so queamish stomached, that will not see one face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two or three times; with these a Maidenhead is a very great dainty, for they lay out with me for one, sometimes a quarter or half a year together.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:32749:158"/>
Now, though I know you have parted from yours already, yet I question not but to make a good Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of yours, and get a good round sum of mony for you and my self; and if you will be ruled by me in everything, I shall so manage the business, that you shall not have to do with above two or three in a twelve months time, and they shall be such, as shall not only maintain you in a brave Garb and equipage, but you shall gain many Jewels, and a good round sum of money. To this Discourse I replied, that I hoped she would perform what she said, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation thereof, I should dispose my self to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed by her.</p>
            <p>This I remember was our first Discourse, or to this purpose, and she presently orderd me a Lodging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few doors of her house, where I had such another as my self for my Companion, and we were very well accommodated with every thing; my habit was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what altered, for I was now put into the most exact mode that was then in best esteem. According to her Directions I carried my self in every thing; and once a day I waited on her, or else she came to me. I had not been there many days be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore she told me that there was an opportunity to begin my business, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she advised me to go the next day to a Play; and set my self out in the best manner that I could; but she advised me by all means to decline drinking, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any Discourse with any person, though I should be importuned thereto, I promising obedience to her commands; and my Companion, who was my Bed-fellow, attended me to the Play-house, where by great attention to the Comedy that was acted, I did not mind those who made it their chief business to gaze on me. The Play being done, I went out, but was
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:32749:158"/>
stayed by two Gentlemen (who by their Habits see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of quality) who offered me their Service to wait on me. I at first answered them with silence; but they seeing I had no other Company but my Bed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, were very importunate to have me accept of theirs. I told them that they were strangers, and therefore durst not admit of their kind offer: Having said thus, I called for a Coach, and though they still importuned me to accept of their Company, yet I absolutely refused it, and so caused the Coachman to drive home. That evening was I visited by our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trona, who told me, I had done well, for she had an account given her of my deportment: for, said she, it is not unknown to me that you were offered the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of two Gentlemen, one of which is a person who is a retainer to my house, an old beaten Souldier, and several such we are forced to keep correspondency withal, that we may have new fresh Guests brought to our house. The other Gentleman, said she, is one who hath a long time laid out for a fresh bit, and he was carried to the Playhouse on purpose to see you; whom I gave my correspondent his companion so just an account of, that he could not miss knowing of you: they both followed your Coach to your Lodgings; and have since been at mine, and my young Coxcomb is very much smitten with your beauty, and offers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that he may enjoy your Company. I have promised him my assistance, but he must come off well first; and I question not but to manage him so, as in few days you shall find the effects of his love in some noble present, therefore said she, fail not to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, and I doubt not but you will reap much pleasure and profit. I having promised a just compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to her desires, she departed leaving me in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:32749:159"/>
of her Bed-fellow, who that night entertained me with a large account of her Adventures.</p>
            <p>I remember she told me, that when she first came acquainted with our Matrona, she was pick'd up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the same manner as I had been; and that in less then two monthes, her Maidenhead was sold six times, for which she had gained in Presents to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of fifty pounds; and I suppose, said she, our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trona gained above as much more in money: since then, said she, my first Customers have but rarely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited me; and she having no more Customers for my Maidenhead, I now pass for a Merchants Wife, and am often sent for in that name; and I seldom miss a day without one or two Customers, who entertain me as such a person. She being thus free with me, I thought good to ask her some more questions, as, how she paid for her Diet and Lodging? and from whence she had Cloaths? To this she answered, that for the first half year her Diet was paid for by the Matrona, who indeed had all the Money that was gained by her; and as for Cloaths, she had them first of all lent, or given by her, and since given her by those who had to deal with her: and now, said she, I pay for my own Diet, and have all the Money that is given me; and all the profit she hath, is in selling her Wine, and other things she vendeth at our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and now and then I suppose she gets half a piece or a piece of a new Customer by procuring me.</p>
            <p>I was somewhat satisfied with this Discourse, and the next day I was visited by the old Woman (who brought me first acquainted with our <hi>Matrona</hi>) who brought me a Letter from my Amorous Gallant; I remember it was stuffed with Complements, and all the happiness he desired, was to see me once more at
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:32749:159"/>
the Play-house. In this affair, I taking advice with our <hi>Matrona,</hi> it was resolved I should return no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; but however, within two days, I again went to the Play-house, where I was no sooner seated, but I was attended by my Gallant, and now I could not decline his Company: during the Play he treated me with all manner of fruits, and such things as could be purchased there; and the Play being done, he offered me a farther treat at some other place; but I refused that, as also any further converse with him; and again (calling for a Coach) I went home, refusing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and being very shie and coy to all his Proposals, which though many, yet prevailed not at all upon me.</p>
            <p>The next day I had another Letter sent me, as also a Diamond-Ring of Twenty pound price as a present: I accepted of both, and then promised within two days to meet him again at the Play-house, where my Gallant came richly accoutred in all his bravery, I then entertained discourse with him, and the Play being ended, I at his earnest opportunity accepted of a Trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he quickly provided for me at the next Tavern. I then told him, that I durst not stay, for I expected my Unckle to come and visit me that Evening at my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who was to bring me news out of the Country about my Father: he being desirous to please me, consented to my departure, I promising to give him another meeting at a place we appointed the next day, and thus we again parted. I was now so far engaged with him, that I the next day again met him, and he then courted me for enjoyment; but I seeming very angry, he to pacifie me, gave me a Gold Watch, and then I permitted him to embrace and kiss me; and though I contradicted his proceeding further with me yet he found by me, that in time he might arrive to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:32749:160"/>
it. In this apprehension he was very prodigal in his promises, and what great things he would do, if I would permit him so great a happiness; he oftentimes wishing himself a single-man (for he was Married) that he might make himself happy in so brave a Wife, as he knew I would be. These Discourses, and others which he used, and those many strict embraces which he gave me with the tittilations of the flesh, and I had much ado to continue inexorable: but remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how I had been deceived formerly, and withall knowing that I had not our Matrona's order as yet for fruition, I therefore contradicted my own thoughts and wanton desires, and refused to let him proceed to any other satisfaction than what he could get by kissing and embracing me, and handling my Breasts and Neck, and so we again parted, I being still attended by my Bed-fellow.</p>
            <p>We were no sooner come home, but she was sent for by our Matrona, to whom she gave an account of our actions; but that was not all her business, for when she returned home, and we were in Bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, she told me she had been at the Sport with a brave Gallant, with whom she had received great pleasure, for he was newly come to Town, and willing enough to have continued the sport longer, but that it was late, and therefore they had referred a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the pleasures to the next day; and that she had not only pleasure but profit, for he had given her three Crowns, and promised to be more beneficial to her during his stay in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This discourse of hers, the remembrance of what she had been at, and what I might have received if I would, did very much fire me, and I then took up a resolve not much longer to delay those pleasures I
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:32749:160"/>
had now so long been without; and thereupon being visited the next day by my Servant, (and having the permission of my Matrona so to do) I entertained him with somewhat more freedom than formerly, and went with him to the house of our Matrona, as if a great stranger there; and now was I doubly courted, not only by him, but her; so that I permitted him enjoyment, and he so well pleased me, that at his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earnest opportunity, I consented to lie with him all Night, where I satisfied him and my self in all those amorous sweets that two willing Lovers could receive or give.</p>
            <p>Whilst I was thus occupied at our <hi>Matrona's</hi> house, my Bedfellow was not idle; for she understanding my place would be void, was resolved to have it supplied, and therefore summoned her Country Gentleman, who very readily attended her, and for that night was so pleased with her Company in the night, that he desired it the next day at a frolick at a Tavern. She accordingly attended him, where a plentiful din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was provided, there being four or five Gentlemen, and two Women besides her self. Dinner being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and some quantity of Wine drank off, they all began to be merry, and therefore a noise of Fidlers were call'd, and they all fell to singing and dancing, in which they spent some time; and the other two women being likewise Ladies of the right stamp, they did by turns leave the rest of the Company, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire by Couples into a private Room, where they had the conveniency of a Bed, and thus they spent most part of the Day. Night drawing on, reckoning was call'd for; but it being a large one, all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were dissatisfied, not being willing to pay so dear for their pleasure, and to have such sour sawce to their
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:32749:161"/>
sweet meat: the Fidlers being paid, they resolv'd to put a trick upon the Vintner for his reckoning. The Fidlers now playing their last Lesson, the Gentlemen one after another made their several <hi>exits,</hi> leaving the three women to pay the Score; who for some time waited the return of the Gentlemen with money, but in vain. The Master of the house understanding how he was likely to be serv'd, came up to the Women, and gave them such a lesson as made them sing <hi>lachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae</hi>: they made many Apologies and excuses, but in vain, money or a sufficient pawn he would have before they went. They considering the neceessity of the business, resolved to leave some of their Rings and such like Moveables for their enlargement. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the manner, they were now considering the matter, what, and how much should be left, when two or three men entred the Room, and bluntly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for the Women, naming them by their several names. Not only they, but the Master of the house was of opinion, that they were come with Mony to redeem them; but their Errand prov'd not so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the Vintner: for these men declar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Bayliffs, and their business was to arrest the three Women at several actions, and to that end produced their Warrant. The women were much troubled, and began to exclaim that they owed no such sums; but the officers who were not to be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, told them they were their Prisoners, and must along with them. The Vintner now put in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded satisfaction, and would have the women leave some pawn for the Reckoning; but the Officers told them, that they had best keep what they had for they might have occasion for it upon the account of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; and for the Reckoning, the Vintner must take
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:32749:161"/>
his course at Law; the Vintner for some time opposed the Officers, and said he would be paid first, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Constable was sent for, yet to no purpose, for the Warrant being produc'd, they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to march off with their Prisoners; and a Coach being call'd for, they all crowded into it, ordering the Coachman to drive towards the Goal.</p>
            <p>The Women used many Arguments to the Bayliffs, who now having done their business, seemed only at the request of the Women, to attend them to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, whither the Coachman had orders to drive, and there they were conducted into a Room, where instead of Bayliffs, and a Prison, they had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of their day Companions, who now kindly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd them, and acquainted them of their frolick, and how all this was only designed to cheat the Vintner of his Reckoning, who had formerly put tricks upon them. All parties being now well pleased, they spent that night in the Tavern together, and my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on coming home the next day, acquainted me with this Story.</p>

            <p>THis continued, Mrs. <hi>Mary</hi> was my beginning or entrance into my publick profession, and indeed, I cannot well call it publick, for I was private and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, not admitting any more servants but this one in one Month; and indeed, in the first half year, I had but three, but they were so beautiful, that I had
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:32749:162"/>
wherewithal to satisfie my self in every thing: having in Jewels and other presents, to the value of 100 <hi>l.</hi> Neither had I any thing to pay for diet or lodging, the charge of that being alwayes born by our <hi>Matrona</hi> who I found had gained above 60 <hi>l.</hi> in money for procuration, and assistance in winning me; besides, a great deal more money spent at her House in Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Entertainments for me, which were very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and costly. The Trade for Maiden-heads fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the price being so great, I was forced to fight under another Banner, and though I did not pass for a Maid, yet I was accounted in the next degree, for I passed as the Mistress, or Lady of Pleasure of a Person of Quality, who kept me as a great rarity for his own diet; and indeed I did not deceive my first customers upon that account; for whereas I went under the notion of belonging to one Person, I did belong to but three: and I was forced to play my game pretty cunningly to please them, and not give them suspition of one another, for they being all introduced into my acquaintance by our <hi>Matrona,</hi> or some of her Agents, she did help to mannage my affairs; and when she knew I was to accompany or lie with one of my sweet-hearts, she would tell the other, (if he or they desired the same, that it could not be for the present, for either I was waiting upon my Uncle, or some other Relation, or otherwise employed, that I must be excused at the present: but against such a time she would endeavour to procure me to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them; and this was her tale or mine, when more than one importun'd me with their visits, and by this means did we both gain the money, and I, Rings, Neck-laces, Watches, and new Gowns, and sometimes Gold to spend or Play away; but in time
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:32749:162"/>
these three growing somewhat weary, or tyred both in their Bodies and Purses, but especially in the last, they by degrees left me, seldom visiting me, and when they did, they would desire their pleasure on free cost, although I could not be so ungrateful as to deny them that which cost me nothing, and which I had equal pleasure in, yet I saw it was time to look out for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better customers; and therefore as I told you, I passed as the Mistress of a Person of Quality, and was sent for to our Madonas house, whether I would pretend I had stollen out, but durst not stay, least my amorous Master should return and want me: several persons I enjoyed at this rate, and much ready money was coming to me; for they with whom I had to do, understanding I was a professed Lady of Pleasure, knew well enough that I would not be contented to pleasure them without a reward; and therefore they gave me money. But now the case was somewhat altered, and I must now pay for my Diet, for our Madona has, as I told you, a certain custome or rule which she walked by, which was this, that at the first she paid for Diet and Lodging as long as the Maiden-head customers lasted, for all that time she took the mony, and the Woman the Presents, very little mony coming to their hands; and indeed it was not by our rules thought honourable or convenient, that a price in money should be given on that account to the party her self; but when they came under the notion of a Lady of Pleasure, and Virginity was gone, then it was accounted reasonable, and indeed necessary, that the Party her self should receive money for her better support, and then she must be at the cost of her own diet; and this was my cause: And my Companion and Bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellow, who had bin in this condition for some
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:32749:163"/>
time, and had passed, as I now did, for a private Lady, a Merchants Wife, and several other Titles and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, was now grown so common, and her face was so well known to all our <hi>Madona</hi>'s own house, and there serve in common for all Gentlemen customers that come. Thus as I was removed one step lower then I was, so was she, and it was not long ere I had a pretty young thing brought to be my companion: and though her Virginity had been parted with above a twelve month before, (as she confessed to me) yet she was to succeed me in my place, and act the part of a Virgin as I had done.</p>
            <p>I now began to bethink my self of what I had bin, and what more I was to be, and run through: I found that I was already at the second degree, and that in short time, I must follow my late companion to the third, and be forced to go home to our <hi>Madona</hi>'s house, and there prostitute my self to every drunken fellow that brought money in his hand; to be slab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, tumbled and tossed as he pleased: this I say went against my stomack, and I was much troubled at it; nay, I saw that some who had bin in as high a place and degree as my self, were in bad condition enough; for there was one who was my late companions Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow before I came, and was at that time called into the house to make room for me, this Woman being very frollick, and withall negligent of our <hi>Madona</hi>'s commands; which were to Sweat, Bath, and Purge, and use other remedies to drive away all distempers; she I say being negligent and wanton, and keeping an open Stable for all Horses, gave entertainment to a running Nag, which so paid her, that she was sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pepper'd, not with a Horse-Pox, but as bad, or a worse disease, which stuck to her so soundly, that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:32749:163"/>
notwithstanding our <hi>Madona</hi>'s diligence, she was fain to go under the Surgeons hands. Nay, and those that did Escape this, were in time put to bad offices, as to attend the rest, and when their money was gone, they served the Grooms and Skip-kennels that attended their Masters to our house.</p>
            <p>These considerations, I say, made me think of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to take in time; and therefore I was resolved to order my matters so, as never to come to our <hi>Madona</hi>'s house, but provide for my self before it should come to that point; and therefore I purposed to accept of the offers of the next best customer that came, that would take me from the condition I was in, and to provide for me; for it was a usual thing, that we had many offers by several persons to take us away; and keep and maintain us privately.</p>
            <p>I had now every day more variety of servants then formerly; for now I had done trafficking for my Maiden-head, I was more free and open, and to be courted and treated at a cheaper rate; and now I was at my own dispose, whereas before I was still watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our <hi>Madona,</hi> or my Companion, who had it in charge from her, to give an account of all my actions; and the same charge had I given me over my new-come Bedfellow. All that was expected from me, was always to be ready at my Lodging, to come when sent for; but I had this in general, and so had all the rest of our Companions, not to permit any man to exceed kissing and feeling, till 3 or 4 Bottles of Wine were first drank.</p>
            <p>These, and many other Maxims we were instructed in, which I shall omit, and only give you an account of two or three frollicks I was a party in whilst I professed this quality, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:32749:164"/>Among other Servants or Sweet-hearts that I had, who were my constant customers, I had one, a young Country Gentleman; who, being Heir of a good Estate, was brought up to <hi>London,</hi> and placed in one of the Inns of Court; but instead of studying Law, he applyed himself to a more soft and effeminate stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: the Art of Love and Courtship; he had read <hi>Ovid's Arte amandi,</hi> at home in the Country, and could repeat many lines out of it; and he had read some other pieces of Poetry; but his fancy was not drawn to the height, till he had not only read some Comedies, but also seen them acted; and then he was so taken with them, that he spent his time commonly every afternoon, in seeing one acted: he being a guest at our house, (being introduced thither by one of our Hectors) and his Pockets being very well lined with crown pieces, our <hi>Matrona</hi> thought me a fit Mistriss for him; and he being a handsome young fellow, I willingly accepted him for my Servant: he being as I told you, well skilled in <hi>Ovids Art of Love,</hi> would often make use of several of his expressions, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me to his imbraces.</p>
            <p>Though he needed not use these arguments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to permit him to enjoy me; yet I was well enough pleased to hear his Poetry; and I being no Novice in the School of Love, did withstand him, knowing that the mind is most eagerly bent on that which is forbidden; and therefore, like a torrent, it overflows, and becomes more impetuous by opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I had read so much Poetry as to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that,
<q>
                  <l>She that is willing to love me,</l>
                  <l>To her unwilling will I be</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He making use of his Poetry, made me think of mine; and therefore I was the more coy to him; but still held him in hand, and gave him certain hopes of an absolute enjoyment: This his vain of Poetry was not only pleasant to me, but profitable; and he fell into one of the finest humors that I have heard of: for I attending him to the Play-houses very frequently, we one day saw a Play called <hi>Philaster,</hi> or, <hi>Love lyes a bleeding</hi>: The Play being done, we went to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and there he highly commended th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ction, but above all things, the womens parts: he was very much pleased with <hi>Arethusa's</hi> constancy and love to <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>: but that which tickled him most was <hi>Mege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> acceptance of <hi>Pharamon's</hi> Court-ship; for though she were a great Court-Lady, yet she accepted his gold which he presented her, and was so kind as to attend his pleasure in his lodging. Now said he to me, though I have tendred you my service, and am willing to make you a present of all I have, yet I cannot induce you to be so kind to me.</p>
            <p>I now hearing him at this point, was resolved to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him and his present, (for, though he had been some days in my company, yet he had bestowed nothing considerable upon me) therefore I told him that it was true, the Lady <hi>Megera</hi> did accommodate Prince <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond</hi>; but he did first present her with somewhat that was considerable, to induce her to it; and though
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:32749:165"/>
I had a very great respect for his love, yet there was some what more then love to be tendred, as he might now very well understand by this late passage.</p>
            <p>My yonker (who I suppose, had never tasted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but with his Mothers Chamber Maids, or some such Creatures, knew not what belonged to Women of my profession) being now awakened, as it were, out of a dead sleep; quickly drew 5 pieces of Gold out of his Pocket, and made a present of them: You may be sure I was not coy nor cautious in receiving them, but quickly put them up; and, for the present, thanks was all I returned, delaying him in his desires, till we came to our <hi>Madona's</hi> quarters; where we had a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Supper: And I having now acquainted her how I had dealt with my Young man; it was thought reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that he should have a nights lodging for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; neither did I refuse it, but agreed to all he asked me, and I so well pleased him, that I perswaded him out of a Diamond Ring worth 5 <hi>l.</hi> more.</p>
            <p>I am the more particular in my relation of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him: and the means of our closing, by seeing a Play, because of the advantage I gained on him afterwards by the same occasion: for the next day we again going to see a Play, it happened, that it was the <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and then he was as much taken with <hi>Roxolana,</hi> as he had formerly been with <hi>Arethusa,</hi> and highly commended that part: I perceiving his fancy, tol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him, that I supposed he would be very glad to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Roxolana</hi> in his Arms; Yes, said he, that I would, though it were at the expence of 20 <hi>l.</hi> well said I, give me the money, and I will so order the matter, that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:32749:165"/>
you shall receive that satisfaction; nay, said he, but I doubt you will be offended thereat, no said I, it will be as much to my content, as yours. He hearing this, without any difficulty, agreed to give me 20 <hi>l.</hi> which was sent me that evening, I told him the next day, that in one weeks time, he should receive the content he expected, and to heighten his expectation: I refused to let him lye with me in the mean time.</p>
            <p>In this weeks time I so ordered the matter, that I got a Taylor, and other persons who were used to make the habits for the Players, to make me a habit in all things like to that of <hi>Roxolona</hi>; this being done, I acquainted my young Gentleman, and told him that for his better satisfaction, he should see the so famed <hi>Princess</hi> at our quarters, where he might have more freedom then at any other place; he was herewith very well contented; he habiting himself in the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est garbs he had, and a Colation was provided to treat his expected Mistris; all things being thus fitted on his part, I put on the provided habit; and instead of his expected <hi>Roxolona,</hi> I entred the Room where he was, attended by two or three, who bore up my train, and had set my self out with so many Jewels, both good, and counterfeit: and was indeed in all things so like the <hi>Roxolana</hi> he had seen, that he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not but I was the very same, and was much surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at the matter: and although my face was as love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as hers, yet I had added somewhat thereto to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more beautiful.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Matrona</hi> seeing him somewhat amazed, went to him, and rouzing him up, asked him, why he did

               </gap>, which I accepted, and at his request I sate down by him. Well said our <hi>Matrona,</hi> hath not Mrs. <hi>Mary</hi> per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ation: and if before I desired this Ladies Company at the first view, I am much more pleased than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and as I have a very great esteem for this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and intend to continue it, yet that shall be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> whose great love and kindness to me in this particular action, I shall always remember, and largely requite; Well Sir, said I, what love you bestow on her, shall be very acceptable to me, and I shall indeavour to retalliat the same.</p>
            <p>My young man had not till now heard me speak, and though he did, he could not distinguish me by my voice, so great a difference was there in my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, from my ordinary dress, that he did not so much as suspect it, but, hearing me speak with so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> ha! replyed he, that since I was so much a friend to her, he was the better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in what he had desired; and he wanted nothing to content him so much, as her presence. Well, said our <hi>Matrona,</hi> if that be all, you may have that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction quickly: nay, and you have it already; for she is in this Room: he hearing her, looked earnestly about; and though he gazed much in my face, yet he could not discover me; but my greatest business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now done, our <hi>Matrona</hi> could no longer forbear, but fell into a very great fit of laughter, and so did
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:32749:166"/>
the rest of the company; neither did this make him sensible of the matter, till our <hi>Madona,</hi> taking him by the hand, caused him to take me by mine; and told him, that if he desired Mrs. <hi>Marys</hi> company there, he had it; for she was the same party with that Lady, and had only put on that habit, to give him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and satisfaction he desired.</p>
            <p>Although at first he could not credit what she said, yet looking again earnestly upon me, he discovered the matter; and then he said, <hi>Ah Madam, I did not imagine that you could be guilty of so pleasing a fallacy; but I am very well satisfied therein, and am now more glad that you have found out this way to please me, than if I enjoyed the very party her self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answered, <hi>That I hoped I should as well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>My friend was very well satisfied in what I had done and said, and now coming more near to me, we fell to our Collation with much freedom. I was attended by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>everal whom I had appointed to that purpose, and demeaned my self so Majestically, that as they told me, I might very well pass for the very person whom I did represent; and my Gentleman was so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:32749:167"/>
well pleased, that I thought he would have lost his Eyes in gazing at me. Our Collation being ended, I and my attendants Danced, and spent much time in such kind of divertisements; but I saw that my friend was impatient till Bed-time came, that he might have me his beloved Princess in his Arms: we were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with all manner of state, and had Musick at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending us, not only at the time we were up, but also when we were in Bed: they being placed in the Chamber adjoyning to our Lodgings, where they played for two hours space after we were retired.</p>
            <p>The Strength of imagination was much, for as my bedfellow imagined that he had a <hi>Princess</hi> in his arms, so I conceited my self to be little less, great was the pleasure I received from, and gave to my bedfellow, for we were both in the flower of our age, he being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty, and I eighteen, we had both equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and thought of nothing but pleasure: we bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed all other passions, to make way for that of love, according to the Poet.

            <p>ALthough I was well enough pleased with my nights lodging, and so was my Bedfellow: yet as the longest day, so will the longest night have an end; and as no pleasure is lasting, neither would ours continue, for the morning being come, we were again called up by Musick, but being glutted with that, we ordered them to retire, and I first arose out of our Bed, and going to dress me in my ordinary habit, my Bedfellow did forbid it, and intreated me to give him the satisfaction and delight to see me again in my Turkish dress. He having pleased me so well, I was contented to pleasure him, in a request that was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; and therefore dressed my self accordingly.</p>
            <p>He was so well pleased with me in every thing, that taking me in his Arms, I remember he sighed, and I demanding the reason of that passion, he told me, it was out of the extremity of the love he bore me, and which he desired above all things to continue; indeed I liked him so well, that I could have been well enough contented to have been his Wife, and have left all the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:32749:168"/>
world for him, for he was of so easie a pliant nature, that I could have wrought him to any thing: and therefore being desirous to make use of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, I desired him not to be melancholy, for all that I could serve him in, I should readily do: he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me so free with him, told me, if that I would wait the death of his Mother, he would make me his wife, and in the mean time would entertain me, and provide for me wholly as if I were so: but he durst not Marry me till his Mother was dead, she having a great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his Estate, his Father who was lately dead, so ordered it; and beside, he was not as yet of Age to demand it. I being desirous to close with him, (not only out of a desire. I had to leave that course of life I then led, but also out of pure Love I bore him) soon agreed to be wholly disposed by him, and desired him therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This frolick being at an end, I and my friend began to be serious, and in short time after, he provided me a private Lodging, and I making up my pack of Cloaths, Jewels, and Money which I had gained, and which was considerable; left our <hi>Madona,</hi> and now retired my self, and resolved to be very honest, and absolutely constant to my friend, who continued his love to me in a very great measure.</p>
            <p>But at length, all the Monies that he brought to Town with him, and all else that he could get or procure, was spent; (for he had not spared any thing I desired to content me,) and which was worse, his Mother came to Town to visit him, and upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he could give little account how he had spent his time and monyes; wherefore it being concluded, that ill company was the cause, his Mother laid out very diligently to discover what company he kept: though he abstained from coming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o often to me, as formerly. Yet, he either sent, or came to me every day, that he might not be absolutely out of favor with his Mother, I furnished him with what ready mony I had, and he in requital, promised me a continuance of his love, and a retalliation of my kindness, and which was more than all, he engaged to Marry me, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:32749:169"/>
all the oppositions his Mother or friends could make) if I would stay till he was of Age, and had his Estate in his hands; I had this promise from him, not onely by word of Mouth, but also by Writing; but all these promises were quickly vacuated and void; for his Mother by her extraordinary diligence, found out his haunts, and discovered his coming to me: and followed the tract of my actions and life: that she found from whence I came, and who I was; and then soon concluded, that I had been the chief occasion of his mispending his time and Moneys; and now she mustred up all her wits, to prevent his ruine, which she supposed would be inevitable, if he continued any longer a correspondency with me.</p>
            <p>To this end she called her Son before her, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him in the presence of all those of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and friends which were then in Town. She laid the business so plain and home to him, that he could not deny the matter, but somewhat of the manner he did; for whereas she reported me an absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, he alledged me virtuous and modest, as indeed well he might, (for I had ere since my first acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, been constant to him) but it being proved from whence I came, and how immodest I had lived, it was a sufficient argument to make out what I was, and that I could not be a fit Wife for him: She was a very discreet Woman, and one who had known the World, and I suppose was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough acquainted with that saying of the <hi>Poet.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>If Modesty and Women once do sever,</l>
                  <l>Farewel their Name, farewel their Fame for ever.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:32749:169"/>And therefore it being evident enough what I had been, she from thence concluded what I would be: In fine, she so scooled her Son, and ordered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he was contented to relinquish my company; and because she would be sure he should do so, she never left till she had got him in the mind to Travel, and so putting him in an equipage befitting his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, she sent him for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, when I thought my self near the greatest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness I ever yet arrived to, (which I earnestly hoped, and expected by being married to this young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) was I stripped of all joy and comfort, in his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and absolute departure from me; his Mother and Freinds, were so strict with him, that they would not permit him to take his farewel of me; I only received a short Letter from him, wherein, he complained of his ill fortune, in being thus forced from me: but more especially at the manner of it; for he had not the opportunity, nor power to be civil to me, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbursing me with the moneys I had lately furnished him with; for his Mother gave him more ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, then he should have present occasion for; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him, to supply him with more by Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, when he should arrive at the place he was designed for; and then he promised that I should hear further from him.</p>
            <p>This was the substance of his letter; and indeed I could not well complain of him: for what moneys he had lately received of me, had formerly been his own; but I was now reduced to a very low condition: having no ready money, so that I was forced to sell

            <p>This put him in Stock and heart, and he gratefully acknowledged my civility, telling me, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it, and talking of thousands he was to receive.

               </gap>ow he was come, I knew not how to put him off, wherefore I indifferently entertained him, and I may very well say indifferently, because I was yet cold in my desires, and had very little appetite, however some bottles of Wine being sent for, we drank them off: and my young Gentleman being warm in his gears, began to talk a little boldly, but it was to no purpose, for I forbid all actions, and at that time he only purchased a kiss, but (that I may draw to a period to my discourse) I did not long continue so cold to him, for he bringing meat in his Mouth, good store of Gold in his Pocket, which he willingly and freely gave me, I permitted him to take all the pleasure he could receive by me.</p>
            <p>Thus did I renue my old trade, and my old friend, who had brought this new acquaintance, finding some benefit and profit in the case; for he had money of his acquaintance, whom he had brought, as also of me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could I at convenient times deny him the pleasure he had formerly tasted with me; he, I say, having both pleasure &amp; profit, turned Broker for me, and brought me several Merchants, who traffiqued with me for
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:32749:172"/>
pleasure, which I commonly afforded them a good pennyworth, though sometimes a dear one, for I would not deal with every ordinary fellow, and therefore was paid the better, by those who were my custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
            <p>But let me do what I could, I saved little or nothing at the months end, (years I will not say, because I was weary of this trade in six months time:) for I now had not only my self, but this my old acquaintance, and new Broker to provide for; for he finding that most of my profit came in by those he brought me, would be very bold in demanding a share with me: and his expences were so high, which he pretended, was only to bring me of the better sort of customers, that I was now poorer than ever, and he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so impudent, that he would not only command my money, but my Rings, and other Jewels, which he would sell or pawn as he lifted; and indeed, it is the fortune or misfortune of all those of our quality, to be troubled with some such fellows, hangers on as we call them, or else we should or might in little time gain sufficient Estates; but as I say, commonly what we get one way, these followers spend the other, so that at length, all that we are likely to purchase, if we have not a great care, is onely a disease, which may stick long enough by us. I being fearful of this, for my Friend or Hector, I may call him both, was now grown so intemperate, that he kept all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and if I refused him money, or a nights Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he would go to any other common Woman, the first he met withal, and so afterwards comming to me, I might be spoiled; to prevent this, I privately left my Lodging, and hearing of two of my own Sex
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:32749:173"/>
and quality, that were going a progress into the Country to take a frollick, I made the third, and had a man as well as they to attend me; and as I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to bear my charges; but we all reckoned without our Host, for we were basely trappand by those who went with us, and left in pawn for a reckoning that was considerable; we were in a strange place many Miles from <hi>London,</hi> and much distressed, but at length a resolution was taken, that one of us should go to <hi>London,</hi> and fetch money to redeem the rest, it fell to the lot of one of my companions, who being on her journey, had the good luck to meet with honest <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> our now companion, and he, very liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved us, by sending money to us, whereby we had the freedom to come to our companion, and him, who attended us. She being come to this part of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I told her, that I heard it already by <hi>Gregory,</hi> who among other passages of his life, acquainted me with that.</p>
            <p>Well then, replied she, if you know that account, I have little more to acquaint you with, for not long after my Arrival at <hi>London,</hi> I fortunately met with my honest friend the <hi>Drugster,</hi> and he liking me for a Mistress, and I him for a Servant or Master, which you please, agreed to obey his pleasures, he providing for me, which he hath hitherto done in a very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </argument>
            <p>I Had given very great attention to Mrs. <hi>Maries</hi> story, and Mrs. <hi>Dorothy,</hi> (who, with me, had been the only Auditor) told her, that she had received a great deal of satisfaction; for, said she, though I have formerly heard many of your particular actions, yet I never received a perfect account till now. Nay, said Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> this account is far from being perfect, and is only such passages as I could at present call to mind; but indeed they are the most remarkable, and by them you may guess at the rest.</p>
            <p>I was very well pleased with what I had heard, and being likewise desirous to be acquainted with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Mrs. <hi>Dorothy,</hi> requested her to relate them to me, which she did as followeth.</p>
            <p>Old friend, said she to me, you have great occasion to love and respect me, for the great love I have born to you and your memory; for after your departure

               </gap>rom my Fathers house, I was very much afflicted for your absence, and I did believe that you intended Marriage to me, as you protested; and though my Father and Mother had often doubted of the reality of your intentions, especially, after you had so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily left me, yet I still perswaded them that you would return. You know well enough, that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not ignorant of our privacy, he having surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed us in the manner, and you then promised to make me amends by marriage; but all the satisfaction I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was a Copy of Verses, and 20 pieces of Gold: In the one you expressed your Wit, in the other your Generosity, for I very well knew that you might have omitted both, and not have sent either; but I suppose, you were more skillful than I, and knew that I was with Child by you, and therefore sent that mony to defray the charge I should be at on that occasion. This piece of civility of yours did put me into good hopes that you would return; and I accordingly perswaded my Father, and Mother; but time convinced me of my error: and also made it more apparent that I had been sporting with you; for my Belly swelled so, that my Mother soon resolved me that I was with Child by you.</p>
            <p>I was very melancholly upon this occasion, but my Mother indeavoured to comfort me (for I being her only Child) she had a great deal of love for me; and knowing what was pass'd could not be helped, she took order to conceal and keep the knowledge of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune from being publiquely known and discoursed of; Wherefore I, at her desire and directions, kept within doors, pretending a sickness, which indeed was not wholly counterfeit, in regard I much grieved for
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:32749:174"/>
your absence. In this condition I spent my time, till the time of my deliverance from Child-bearing came, and then I was brought to Bed of a Boy, which was no soooner Born, but it was taken and carried from me, to a Town three miles off, to be nursed by a Woman, whom my Mother had for that purpose provided; and this was done to conceal the shame that I should or might su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain, if it were known that I had a Child, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing who, or at least, where was the Father.</p>
            <p>So soon as a Month was expired, I went to see the Child, the sight of which put me too much in mind of the Father; and I was then again sensibly afflicted at his absence, methoughts in that infancy there was so much resemblance of my beloved deceiver, that I kis'd the Infant not only for its own, but for the Fathers sake. I then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home agen, and now after so long a time of retirement, I began to recover, not only my strength, but some additions to my beauty; so that I having had 2 or 3 Suiters, when a Maid, who had forborn visiting me by occasion of my il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they now agen renew their suits; but if I had some dislike for them before; now I could not endure them in my company, they were such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Hobbinolls. Though I was was not satisfied in their frequent visits, yet my Father and Mother press'd me, not only to accept them, but also their suit, and make choice of one of them for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, alledging, that you would never return; and it would be not only safe, but necessary in time to bestow my self. This discourse did much
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:32749:175"/>
disturb me, and I was so often troubled with my suiters, and disturbed and vexed by my Father and Mothers importunity, that I resolved to quit both, by leaving them, and therefore purposed to go to <hi>London,</hi> that I might not be troubled with the importunity of my Father and Mother; nor the troublesome visits of my sweet-hearts.</p>
            <p>In persuance of this resolve, I fitted my self with all necessaries; and that I might not wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract my Parents by my thus leaving them, I writ a Letter of excuse, and left it for them; and so walking to the next great Town, attended the coming by of the Passage Coach, and in that got me a place to ride to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I continued for some time in the Inne where the Coachman set me down, and the rest of his Passengers; but knowing it would be impossible for me to continue long there, I gained acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Maid of the house, and told my tale to her as well as I thought convenient. She understanding that I was willing to serve, and wanted a place; and I acquainting her with my abilities, as that I could sew, wash, and starch, and do most necessary things required of a Servant, she soon procured me a Place in a house that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained many Lodgers. I spent a quarter of a years time very privately and honestly in this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but then, our house being full of Lodgers, one of them cast a wanton eye on me, and being well pleased with my face, began to court me very familiarly; although at first I opposed him and gave him nothing but slights and denials, yet he so managed his business by Presents which he
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:32749:175"/>
gave me, and making use of all other opportunities that he gained his will of me, and I again entred the Lists of a Loving Combate. He took many opportunities for enjoyment, not only in the day time, but sometimes we spent whole nights in our amorous sports; and though my Mr. and Mrs. did not discover any thing of the matter, yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentleman, who was also a Lodger, and lay in the next Chamber to my friends, watching me, found out my haunt; and therefore, he (being as amorous as the other) was desirous of sport, became a Suiter to me upon the same account. I absolutely deny'd him, for I thought it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have to do with one man, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to venture my self no further; but he taking the opportunity of the others absence, first trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me with Wine, then presented me with a Ring; but all this would not do, till he in plain terms told me, that he knew very well I was not so hard hearted to every one; for were Mr. such a one, nameing my friend, there, I would not deny him the courtesie: I at first made strange of this story, and deny'd it, but he falling into plain terms with me, and telling me that he had watched me such a night, when I lay with him, I could not then deny it, neither did I long deny or refuse him what he desired; so that he likewise took his pleasure with me; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained his desire at that time, he made bold with me so often as he lifted, when the other was out of the way.</p>
            <p>I had now two Bedfellows, so that I could sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom lie alone, one of them would still bespeak me;

but the first of them did not know of the second, though he knew very well of the other: Though I had sport enough with these two, yet it was not long ere a third man likewise put in for a share with them, and that was my Masters Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was a very pretty young man, and one whom I could well enough love for a Husband; but he looked a little higher than to Marry a Servant maid: but as a Mistress he courted me. Many attempts he made in vain, but time that bringeth every thing to pass, made me flexible, and I likewise gave him possession of the thing he desired; he took much pleasure in my company, and very respectful he was to me, often present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with Linnen and Laces, and sometimes a Crown or an Angel came from his Pocket, as well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from the other two, who well fed me with mony, which I still pocketed up; but as I got money, so again I got somewhat else, a great Belly, and which was the worst of my three friends, I knew not which was the Father, but if I am not mistaken, I believe it was my Masters Brother.</p>
            <p>But I was resolved the other two should help to Father it, or else pay for it; and therefore I soon told them all three, as they had occasion to deal with me, in what condition I was. My first and oldest friend was most troubled at it, being, as he thought, the most concerned, because he knew not of any else that had to do with me; he was somewhat startled at it, lest, as he said, his Wife should come to know it; for, he was a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man: and although his Wife came sometimes to Town, and would lie with him, yet he would
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:32749:176"/>
sometimes before he went to bed to her, take his opportunity to have his pleasure with me: He, I say, was troubled at the News, but that did not hinder us in our purposed Nights lodging, only in the Intervals we considered what course to take; at length it was resolved, that he would provide for me, the time of my lying Inn, and afterwards for the Child; and in earnest of the charge, he soon gave me Twenty pound to provide me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries. I having now done with my first Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomer, was resolved to get something of my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: but he still gave me the hearing, presuming on his knowledge of my having to do with the first: so that he would not on this occasion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any thing, intending to shirk off, because no body knew what trade we did drive together.</p>
            <p>I perceiving his intention, was resolved to be even with him, and it may be out-wit him; and that he might not distrust me, I seemed no ways dissatisfied, but gave him as much freedom with me as ever; but to carry on my design, I thought good to break the business to my Masters Brother, wherefore I likewise acquainted him with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and told him in plain terms, that I was with Child by him: He could not deny the Fact, nor make any excuse; not knowing any thing of my dealings with the other two: but he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very much surprised, but I doubting he might put me off, I took the opportunity of telling him this news, when we were in bed together, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there I should have time, and conveniency to discourse it.</p>
            <p>He knew not what to say, and indeed was very
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:32749:177"/>
cold with me, and I was forced to help him out, for he was then a Suiter to a young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and was fearful that this business would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Fortunes: and though he lov'd me well enough, yet he was unwilling to Marry me; for that would prove so disadvantagious to him: he supposing that nothing but Marriage would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me, was much troubled, and could not tell what answer to give: wherefore I was forced to break silence, and told him, that as I loved him, so I would shew him sufficient proofs of it, for I would not that my love should ruine him, as I knew it would, if the world should know what had passed between us; and though nothing could satisfie me but Marriage, yet I could be content to wave that, and propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e somewhat else of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: nay then, said he, if you will be so kind to me, propose your own terms, and take them: I hearing him thus generous, it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we concluded upon terms, which were these, that he would give me Twenty pound down to bear my charges in the time of my Lying-Inn, and if the Child lived, he would give Fifty pound more to any person whom I would appoint to take the Child, and provide for it; these terms I was well enough satisfied with, only I considering that he would hear of my lying with the other, because I intended to discover that to him, and have his assistance therein, and then I doubted he would suspect me, and it may be refuse to pay the Fifty pound when due; therefore I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have him seal a Bond to me, for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: and I urged him to do it out of this
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:32749:177"/>
consideration, that he was to be Married: and though he now loved me well-enough, yet when he had a Wife, he would happily slight and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me, and so refuse or neglect to pay it. He was content to hear my arguments: and though always protested a continuance of his love to me, notwithstanding all the Wives in the World; yet he consented to give me Bond according to my desire.</p>
            <p>Thus every thing being agreed on, we again renewed our pleasures, and spent that night, as we had done many before, But morning being come, I arose, and so managed my affairs, that I that day had a Bond Sealed to me for payment of Fifty pound to be paid in six month; I also within few dayes received of him the 20 <hi>l.</hi> he had promised me.</p>
            <p>Thus did I order my matters with my first and last Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tomers, and I gave them their wonted satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Lying with me so often as they pleased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so I did to the other my middle Customer, but do what I could, I could not bring him to any considerable Composition; and though he were the best able, yet he offered me the least, and intended to come off with a trifle; however I gave him his wonted freedom with me, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed ere long to be even with him, as I was.</p>
            <p>For one night being in Bed with my Masters Brother; I having very well pleased him, he tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of his little <hi>Hains in Kelder,</hi> the Boy in my Belly, wishing very well to it, not in the least doubting but it was of his own begetting, using many words to that purpose: well Sir, said I,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:32749:178"/>
it is very true, it is yours, but if I would have been as free with others as I have been with you, it might have had more, if not another Father; and thereupon I proceeded, and told how that I had been often importuned by Mr. such a one, his Brothers Lodger, and my Second Bedfellow. Well replyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, I am the more beholding to you, that you have accepted of me rather than him; but though I am not at all dissatisfied in what I have done, I wish he had been the Father for your sake as well as mine, for you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to Marriage, or else get a considerable sum of money from him. As for Marriage, said I, I doubt I should hardly draw him to it, but some momes I might get of him, and would yet, if you will consent to it, and assist me therein. To this he answered, that in any thing I should desire, he would not be wanting, and therefore he bid me propound the way, and he would not fail in his assistance: I then told him, that I knew but one way to do it, and in that I must Play the disloyal wag with him, to do that which I had no mind: for that matter, said he, you shall have my consent, and I think I guess at your meaning, which is, that you must agree to let him lye with you; wherefore since it will be so advantagious to you, let him do it; for I am sure he can do me no great wrong, for notwithstanding what he can do, the Child will be all mine, of my own getting.</p>
            <p>He being so free to it, and agreeing to all things according to my desire, we resolved that I should permit my second Sweet-heart to lye with me; but I should so order the matter, that he should take us in the manner, and then we
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:32749:178"/>
would agree to act the rest very well. I now having laid my plot very well, and orderly, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed my time when I would lye with him, and agreed to leave the Chamber door open, that he, rising early the next morning, might (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending some business) enter the Chamber, and find us in Bed together. Our Plot being thus laid, and my Second Sweet-heart desiring it, I promised to come to Bed to him about midnight, which I did; but my Masters Brother knowing of my design, was resolved to have the first car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of me, and that he should only have a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Bun; and therefore caused me to lye with him all the former part of the night; but mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night being past, he permitted me to proceed in my adventure. I was expected by my Bedfellow, and accordingly entertained; but I minding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign I was about, awaked early in the morning, and so ordered the matter, that my Bedfellow likewise threw of his drowsiness to encounter with me in our nocturnal pastime, which when he had done, I began to discourse him, reasoning the cause with him, and desiring him to resove me what he would do for me in that condition I was, and what provision he would make for me. He gave me indifferent answers, and I grew passionate with him, and on a sudden the Chamber door opened, and my Masters Brother entred the room. I see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, left of speaking, and crouded my self close down into the Bed, as if pretending to hide my self; but he coming boldly on, bid my Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow Good morrow, and asking him a que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion, came nearer the Bed-side, and drawing the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:32749:179"/>
said, what have you a Bedfellow? No said he, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> I; surely said the other you have, for I am mistaken if I did not hear some other tongue than yours, the other deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it, but he knowing well enough what he had to do, soon found out where my Petticoats lay: <hi>How,</hi> said he, <hi>surely you have a Bedfellow, and that a Female one</hi>; the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus surprized, knew not what to say: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Mr. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Dorothys. I finding my self discovered, now appeared, and in the first place beg'd his pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rdon, and that he would not acquaint my Master and Mistress with it. He seeming very angry, soundly ratled me and my Bedfellow, and said he, <hi>This is not the first time that you two have lain together, for I have long suspected you, and have watched you. Truly Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>it is true, this Gentleman hath long knew me, but I pray you make no more words at present, and for modesty sake leave the Chamber, and I will anone satisfie you further in every particular.</hi> My Bedfellow likewise requesting the same, very civilly left us, shutting the door after him. My Bedfellow was much surprized at this sudden accident, and I seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be so; and quickly getting on my cloaths, arose and left him, retiring into my own Chamber, leaving him to consider of it.</p>
            <p>I having now done my business, by having a witness of my lying with him, was bold with him, to know what I should do in the case; <hi>For,</hi> (said I) <hi>my Masters Brother will certainly acquaint my Master and Mistress with our actions, and then
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:32749:179"/>
I must leave the house, and whether to go, I know not, nor who will entertain me.</hi> He argued that the other, my first Sweet-heart, must provide for me; to this I told him, that I believed he would do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for me, but he had a Wife, and could not do what he listed, whereas he on the contrary was a single man, and rich enough; and he still endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to put me off, and lay all upon the first, I in plain terms told him, That if he continued to say so, I would wholly deny my dealings with the other, and though he should avouch it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he would not be believed, he being a party guilty, as could be proved by my Masters Brother; and therefore it would be judged by all, that he, and he alone, was the Father of the Child and would be forced to Marry me, or at least provide for me and the Child. I having told him my resolution, left him to consider of it, and then my M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
