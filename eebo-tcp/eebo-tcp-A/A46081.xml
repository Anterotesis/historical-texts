            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is not perhaps very eaſie to find any one Perſon beneath the degree of a Sovereign Prince, whoſe Name has for this laſt Year at leaſt, made greater noiſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> than my Lord <hi>Torrington</hi>'s, the ſubject of this preſent Hiſtory. We have ſeen Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Gazetts, publick and private Letters, and even ſome whole Books and Pamphlets, fill'd up with little elſe than his Hiſtory, and cenſures upon his Actions, relating to the late Fight at Sea, between the Fleet of the <hi>French, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi>; all which different Nations have given ſome Accounts thereof, and yet they have all been received by the Publick with great ſatisfaction and greedineſs. It may not therefore 'tis hoped, be leſs acceptable to publiſh a Short and Impartial Account of the entire Life and Actions of that Noble Lord, as far as the Memoirs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have come to Hand, which we promiſe to perform with as much Decency and Faithfulneſs as is poſſible, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only meer matter of Fact, grounded for the moſt part on publick Prints, and Authentick Inſtruments; or
<pb facs="tcp:66458:3"/>
at leaſt the Atteſtations of ſuch as have been perſonally preſent in the Actions hereafter mentioned. Indeed a good Hiſtorian ought to be the greateſt Trimmer in the World, as he muſt be if Truth and he are together; for that is generally divided, and one party monopolizes her. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, tho' perhaps never was there yet Writer who did not really lean more to one Party than another; nor would it look other than ridiculous for him, who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this preſent Deſign, to pretend an Exemption from that common Fate of all Mankind: He'll yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thus much, that no Man ſhall by what he here writes, diſcover what Party he favours, he reſolving with as much Juſtice and Calmneſs as poſſible, according to all Reflections and Refinings on matter of Fact, uſual with the moſt of Writers, to relate <hi>that,</hi> bare and naked as he has receiv'd it; and where the Relators differ, truly to repreſent what is pretended on either hand, leaving the Reader upon the whole, to make what Judgement he thinks fit of what is here fairly laid before him,</p>

            <head>THE LIFE of the E. of <hi>TORRINGTON.</hi> The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>NOthing in the whole courſe of Nature, generally ſpeaking, can be more uncertain and variable than the Fortunes of great Men. There was reaſon enough for that ingenious wiſh of a very good Man, <hi>God help poor Kings</hi>; for if ever their ſubordinate Miniſters have ſuch a weight of buſineſs on their Shoulders, and it's ſucceſs ſo doubtful and uncertain; and the Prince too muſt be reflected on for the Misfortunes or Crimes of thoſe he employes; he has ſure ſuch a weary Life on't, that he rather ought to be Pity'd than Envy'd. But the beſt is, ſuppoſing Fortune frowns at one time; ten to one but from her very natural inconſtancy ſhe continues not long in that temper, but ſmiles again as merrily as ever, and then thoſe who are her Favorites are ſo to all the World; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the people think God loves 'em, becauſe they love good Fortune, as a late Philoſopher tells us, 'tis certain they themſelves do ſo; moſt of Mankind having a touch of the Turkiſh Religion, and Policy, if a Man proſpers he's brave, and deſerves Preferment, if he does not he's all the Rogues in the World, and deſerves the Bowſtring. Thus, to bring all to the Point, a few days ſince, we cou'd never hear a certain great Man's name mention'd but with a Curſe or two, or at leaſt a hearty wiſh at the end on't, whereas now he's found innocent of what he has been charg'd with; not a Coffee-houſe but is full of his Compurgators and Defenders, and every one is ready to pay him as much Civility and Compliments as the Ships did in his triumphal return to <hi>London.</hi> Tho' nothing more likely than that, had his Fate been otherwiſe than thus proſperous, ſome of thoſe very Perſons wou'd have been as forward as any to have thrown up their Hats when they ſtood round his Scaffold. Much like the pleaſant account that <hi>Roman-Oldham,</hi> I mean as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinal</hi> gives us of that great Favourite <hi>Sejanus</hi>: when he fell, all the weight and fury of the people fell after him, or rather up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, whereas had he had ſucceſs in his Enterpriſe.
<q>Hac ipſa Sejanum diceret hora Auguſtum.</q>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66458:4"/>
Somewhat like the Reverſe of which we have juſt ſeen practiſed in the caſe before us: Tho' after all, it muſt be confeſt that ſuch mean affections as theſe only touch, at leaſt ſo ſtrongly, the weak and baſe Vulgar (be they the great or ſmall) while a Man of true worth ſtands intrepid and-unmov'd when himſelf is in danger; and after having made a calm and ſober judgment of Perſons and Things, is never alter'd by circumſtances foreign to the Eſſence of the Cauſe which may afterwards happen.</p>
            <p>Had thoſe thoughts been met with in any other place then the Introduction to my Lord <hi>Torrington</hi>'s Life, I yet fancy they are ſo natural on the Subject, any one wou'd have gueſt 'em deſign'd for that purpoſe. But we muſt leave building the Porch, and conduct the Reader into the Houſe; wherein, tho' we ſhant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſhew him what wou'd be neither worth his while nor ours; every Cloſet, Cellar, and particular Corner, yet we'l endeavour to paſs by no conſiderable or beautiful part of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his view, I mean, take care to inform him in all the moſt remarkable and notable tranſactions of My Lord <hi>Torrington</hi>'s Life, tho' omitting ſmaller Circumſtances, not ſo well worthy notice, eſpecially ſince there is matter enough before us of ſuch a nature as will ſcarce fail of giving very good direction and entertainment to the curious Reader.</p>
            <p>The Family from whence he there took his Original, was Genteel, if not Noble; and had ſome Eſtate belonging to it, being related to a Noble Lord of the ſame name. What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune his other Brothers had, is not much to our purpoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, nor ſome unhappy circumſtances which concern'd a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Relation: The actions of his own Life being only our imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Province. Suffice it therefore, that the way he pitch'd upon to enlarge his Fortunes, and make 'em equal to his mind, was Sea-Service, which had rais'd ſo many brave Men to Honours and Eſtates; and to which he it ſeems had a more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination than any other way of Life.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of which Reſolution, by the favour of the then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who profeſs'd a more than ordinary kindneſs to him; till on the Teſt buſineſs he ſerv'd him as he did all the reſt of his Friends. He had his deſire, and after having paſs'd the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that Art under experienc'd Teachers, obtain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Commiſſion. And the firſt he had, if I am not miſtaken in the name, was for the <hi>Pembroke</hi> in the <hi>Streights</hi>; for tis there that I can find the firſt mention of Captain <hi>Herbert</hi> on the publick
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66458:4"/>
ſtage of Action, where he has been ſo long converſant and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſo warmly engaged, that he ſeems to have reaſon in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on his Service more in vindication of his Courage when queſtioned by his Accuſers. 'Twas in or about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> or end of <hi>February, Ann. Dom.</hi> 1667. when he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized himſelf there againſt a <hi>Zelander,</hi> we being then at War <hi>Holland</hi>; the account of which Action take as the publick Prints then gave it, (and the ſame Method for the main, as the moſt fair and impartial, ſhall be as it has been taken in what's writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on ſo tender a Subject; for thus only are we likely to have Actions of this Nature repreſented without Flattery or Envy.)</p>
            <p>Our Letters then from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> dated in <hi>March</hi> gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: <hi>That Captain</hi> Herbert <hi>in the</hi> Pembroke <hi>was then in that Port, being newly returned from a freſh diſpute with a</hi> Zeland <hi>Man of War of</hi> 34 <hi>Guns and</hi> 180 <hi>Men, with whom he fought ſome days before in ſight of that Bay from two in the afternoon till the night put an end to that days work. All that night the</hi> Pembrook <hi>Frigat carrying out a Light for the</hi> Zealander, <hi>and the next morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Windward, fir'd a Gun and bore up to reingage her; but the</hi> Zealander <hi>being the nimbler ſailer bore away once or twice before the wind, declining any further diſpute; which the Frigat perceiving and fearing to be put to Leeward of the Port by a fruitleſs purſuit, the Wind then blowing a ſtrong Levant, came again for the Bay, which the</hi> Zealander <hi>wanted not the confidence to boaſt of as a mark of his Victory. Since this the Frigat being put a ſhore to waſh and tallow, the</hi> Zealander <hi>made ſeveral Challenges, but went out again to Sea before the Frigat could get ready. Yeſterday morning the</hi> Zealander <hi>coming in, the Frigat being ready went out to meet him, and paſſed five times upon him within Piſtol ſhot, until the</hi> Zealander <hi>finding the ſervice too hot, bore in for the Bay, purſued for a long time by the Frigat, who being unable to overtake him, fir'd her Chaſe-Gun and ſtood out again to Sea; the</hi> Zealander <hi>anſwering her Challenge with a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salute of three Guns to Leeward; but yet thought it convenient to put into the Bay, where he triumphantly fired all his Guns, leaving the</hi> Pembrook <hi>at Sea in vain attending him till the next morning. The Captain of the</hi> Zealand <hi>afterwards came aſhore, endeavouring to perſwade the People that his Main-Maſt was diſabled, and that he wanted Shot for his Guns. In this Diſpute the Frigat had ſeven Men killed and five hurt, but none mortally; and her Fore-Maſt ſomewhat diſabled, but will ſpeedily be refitted and made ſerviceable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Rencounter, he continued in the <hi>Streights,</hi> till Rere-Admiral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66458:5"/>
               <hi>Kempthorn</hi> and his Sqadron from <hi>Cadiz</hi> and St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> went towards the <hi>Streights</hi> mouth to meet the <hi>Pembrook,</hi> with ſixteen or ſeventeen ſail of Merchants under his Convoy; and having found them, ſayl'd for <hi>England,</hi> and came all into Port at <hi>Plymouth</hi> about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> only the <hi>Pembrook</hi> had the misfortune off of the Iſland of <hi>Portland,</hi> in the night, to fall foul of the <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and ſunk to rights; but Captain <hi>Herbert,</hi> and all his Men (except a few ſick Perſons who cou'd not ſhift for themſelves, nor in ſuch a hurry be reliev'd by others) were ſav'd, and came with the reſt into <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> But we ſhall agen meet Captain <hi>Herbert</hi> in the <hi>Streights,</hi> and that in a higher Station than now ſome few years ago. In the mean while he was preſent, and vigorouſly engaged in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars here at home.</p>
            <p>Who was the Occaſion of thoſe Wars, by whom Contrived, and to what Ends fomented, <hi>Europe</hi> is not now to learn. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt, the two great Fire-brands of the World were made uſe of too ſucceſsfully to encreaſe and maintain this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Flame kindled between two Proteſtant Nations. The Complement of the Flag, and the Fiſhery of the Britiſh Seas, both of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had pretended to and poſſeſſed for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial Ages; which Poſſeſſion created a Right, and that Right we had ſtill ſecured by Arms. For this the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> now ſtruggled with us; for indeed, whatever Pretences there were on either ſide, the Dominion of the Sea was the thing in Competion, for which the two Nations were now no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Rivals to one another, while the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times joyning with one ſide, and ſometimes with the other, learnt Experience at our coſt, and the way to Beat us both. For while they were little more than Spectators, never were fiercer Fights on the Ocean than thoſe between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who with an unparallell'd Obſtinacy and Valour would not rarely engage each other two or three days ſuceſſively, and many times in the year refit for the ſame Exerciſe; ſometime they beating us in our Harbours, another time we them; they burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking our Ships, and we theirs, as at <hi>Chattam</hi> and the <hi>Vly,</hi> and very commonly both Sides making Bonfires, and giving Thanks for a Victory, when being ſoundly bang'd was all that either had to boaſt of. Neither the Fight of <hi>Solebay,</hi> where the brave Earl of <hi>SANDWICH</hi> was unfortunately loſt, and Sir <hi>Fretchvile Hollis</hi> in the <hi>Cambridge,</hi> nor the next off</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66458:5"/>The Oyſter-Bank will eaſily be forgotten, when the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Ship the <hi>Cambridge,</hi> of which Captain <hi>Herbert</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, after a deſperate Fight, was ſent into Port diſabled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo long, and ſo warmly employ'd, was at laſt by Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> (together with the <hi>Reſolution</hi>) ſent into Port diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, having fought ſo long, until ſhe had not many ſound Men left aboard her; ſeveral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the ſame Engagement, being Sunk down-right, others as they were going into their own Ports, and moſt of them extreamly ſhatter'd and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>By theſe Services and others of that Nature, he began now to be named among thoſe other Great Men, whoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are like to laſt as long as the Sea invirons our <hi>Iſland.</hi>— Sir <hi>John Narborough,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Sprague,</hi> Sir — <hi>Mins,</hi> and others, both Dead and Living; whom even their Enemies could not deny as brave as any living, nor had Captain <hi>Herbert</hi> at that time other than a fair Reputation acquired by the ſame Hazards, which together with the Favour of the Court, ſoon advanced him higher, and the War with the <hi>Dutch</hi> being at laſt happily accommodated, he Commanded a Squadron ſent into the Streights, where he won his greateſt Glory.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion of his going thither, <hi>England</hi> has no reaſon to forget. <hi>Tangier</hi> was thrown in as Vantage, to a hopeful Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain we made with a certain Neighbouring Nation. What a Grave that place was to many Hundred Thouſands, if not Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Money, and many Hundreds, and Thouſands of Brave Men, to be only Demoliſhed after all, is not very much to the Honour of thoſe Councils, which then were at the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Affairs; and well it had been, had it been Demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that very day in which 'twas Delivered to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>— However, it being then thought of great Concern to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reſpect of our Streights Trade, we maintained for that end a ſtrong Garriſon in it, and had at laſt ſomething of Trade, but enlarging our Borders a little further in the Countrey, than the <hi>Moors</hi> were willing to give us leave, we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66458:6"/>
drew down all their Force upon us, who with Numerous Armys inveſted the Place, and aſſiſted by ſome Wicked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negades, preſs'd it very vigorouſly: For the relief whereof, the brave Earl of <hi>Oſſery</hi> deſigning, was taken ſick and Dyed, as much lamented, as 'twas poſſible, juſt as he was entering on the Voyage.</p>
            <p>Hither then was Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> ſent with a Fleet under his Command, to aſſiſt our People there—And action e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough he found both by Sea and Land attending him, by Sea, in a very ſmart Rencounter with ſeveral <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Men of War, moſt (or all of which were there Taken, Burnt, or Stranded, after a Deſperate Reſiſtance. But by Land, the Service was (if poſſible) yet warmers; for upon ſome Sally, and other action between the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the Town, the Admiral not only drew his Ships near the Shoar, firing inceſſantly on the Infidels, and doing thereby very good Service, but alſo I end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good number of Seamen, who Sallied with the Garriſon againſt the Beſiegers, and gave the Black Gentlemen, ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as they never before met with in their Lives, throwing themſelves into and over all their Lines and Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and piercing into the very Heart of their Camp, afterwards Retreating again (though not without loſs) yet with Incomparable Bravery, and much Honour, being favour'd by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, who really ſtood to it to ſome purpoſe, or elſe they had probably been very ill dealt with by the Enemy. After buſineſs there diſpatch'd, the <hi>Admiral</hi>'s returned with his Fleet for <hi>England,</hi> continuing in the ſame Station till King <hi>James</hi> his Reign.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> rung of King <hi>James</hi>'s Famous Declaration for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, about this time publiſhed to the World, and of thoſe methods he uſed in porſuance thereof, to get all thoſe Laws Repeal'd, which were inſeperable Obſtacles to the ſame. Officers Civil and Military, were every where Canvaſs'd, and now was the time when this King, who is Notorious for having never been worſe than his word, was reſolved to requite all the old Faithful Servants to the Crown and him. He was indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66458:6"/>
to have two Strings to his Bow, to alter the Government, as hath been ſaid, both Civil and Military, That if he cou'd not by the Gown, he might by the Sword obtain his Deſires— Nay, ſo fully bent were they on theſe Pernicious Councils, that ſome of the fam'd Regulators themſelves have no Bluſh to ſay (though 'tis hoped they may to read this, ſince they are yet alive) That if the Parliament wou'd not Repeal the Penal Laws, the King had another way, and Forty Thouſand Men ſhould do it without him. To this end Sea-Officers were attackt, as well as thoſe at Land, and among many other great Men, and great Favourites, (for the Truth is, the Court had then ſmall reſpect of Perſons) Vice-Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> loſt his place, and kept his Honour, being proof againſt all the Inſinuations that could be made to oblige him to betray the Nation. And ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter left his Ungrateful Maſter for good and all, and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Court of the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> together with other Nobler Lords, for indeed, that then ſeemed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and <hi>Whitehall</hi> one of the old <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kings <hi>Tendragee,</hi> or ſome of their Forlorn Mountains.</p>
            <p>In whoſe Court at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he remain'd till the happy Fate of <hi>England</hi> required the Princes preſence here, with whom he came into the Quality of an <hi>Admiral.</hi> Whatever has happen'd ſince, 'tis Notorious no man cou'd be better beloved, by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than he was at that time—His Health was drank by Sea and Land, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himſelf was ſeldom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but <hi>Admiral Herbert</hi> was with him, whoſe Letter, after the Princes, to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, may be ſuppoſed to have had no ſmall Influence, on them, both to prevent their Engaging the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and haſten their joyning the Princes, as many of 'em af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did. And indeed, ſo memorable a piece of Hiſtory is that Letter of his, that it ought not to be omitted in a piece of this Nature, and one of the very Original Printed Letters ſent then to ſome Officer in the Fleet, coming to our hands, we ſhall here <hi>verbatim</hi> inſert the ſame.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:66458:8"/>What effect this handſome Letter had upon the Fleet, has been already obſerved, and the Event ſufficiently declared; for had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fallen upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Paſſage hither, they might at leaſt have, in all probability have ruin'd the Expedition, if not the Fleet, there being ſo vaſt a number of Tranſport Veſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moſt of which in a ſharp Fight muſt have been unavoidably Deſtroyed. But Providence had it ſeems, deſign'd better things for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: For at this time, the then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Embark'd with his Army for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, on a vaſt number of Veſſels, Men of War, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Tranſport Ships and all, no leſs than Seven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sail, Commanded by Vice Admiral <hi>Herbert.</hi> Not to mention what relates not immediatly to his Life, as the Storm which diſordered 'em at their firſt ſetting out, and the conſequences thereof known to all <hi>Europe,</hi> two things only may deſerve a particular remark in this Affair.</p>
            <p>On the happy miſtake of the Princes Fleet, as we find it related in the Account given of that Expedition— Which tells us, that the ſecond Night after their ſetting out, in the middle of the Night, an Advice-Boat brought an Account, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet conſiſting of Thirty Three Sail, lay to the Weſtward of Theirs— Upon which the Prince Fired a Gun, which caus'd a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation in the whole Fleet, they having then a brisk Eaſterly Wind, concluding themſelves in great danger— But the ſmall Advice Boats Cruſing for a more certain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſoon brought VVord, that inſtead of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, which the former Advices had Allarmed them with, it was only <hi>Admiral-Herbert,</hi> with part of their own Fleet, which had been Sailing, ſeperated ſome hours from their main Body, on whoſe Arrival any one may gueſs whether they were pleas'd; a Signal of Joy being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately given on Board, the General, who ſoon after ordered Admiral <hi>Herbet</hi> and the other Admirals a Board
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66458:8"/>
him to Council — And now indeed 'twas time, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet were never no farther from 'em, than the <hi>Buoy</hi> in the <hi>Nore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhere the other conſiderable Remarks in this Voyage, relating to <hi>Herbert,</hi> comes in — That thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he uſed with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, wrought ſo much with them, that not the leaſt attempt was made by the Fleet on the Prince, as it paſſed by them, tho' in more places than one, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callis</hi> he drew it in a Line, making, as is ſaid by thoſe who ſaw it, one of the moſt Glorious Sights that ever was beheld from the Cliffs of <hi>Callis</hi> or <hi>Dover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence they ſtood away to the VVeſtward, and upon the never to be forgotten, and now doubly memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> in the as memorable Year <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> Landed at <hi>Torbay</hi> in <hi>Devonſheire,</hi> without the leaſt Oppoſition, appearance of any Enemy, where we leave the Prince to that glorious Fate attending him, and which ſoon after fixed on his Head one of the brighteſt Crowns in <hi>Europe,</hi> and return to the Vice-Admiral, the more eſpecial Subject of the preſent Hiſtory, and the Marrine Affairs, with the Fate of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intermixed with his Life, that they cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</p>
            <p>Among whom, as has been already mentioned, their Love to their Country, and eſteem for the Prince and his Admiarls wrought ſo ſtrongly, that the honeſt Seamen were ſo far from oppoſing their great deſign, that as ſoon as opportunity was given, they came in by whole Squadrons, to aſiſt in it, Reading the Princes Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, on Board moſt of their Ships, the firſt that did it, to their eternal Honour, being the New — Then in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Road, Captain <hi>Churchil,</hi> Cammander,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66458:9"/>
afterwards of the <hi>Pendenis,</hi> unhappily loſt on the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Knock</hi> about a Twelve month ſince.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſo Unanimous were the Seamen, that if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the Revolution was perform'd with more eaſe and leſs Blood among them then with us at <hi>Land,</hi> there having not been, that ever cou'd be heard of, one Gun fired on the behalf of King <hi>James,</hi> nor I think one Ship which ſtuck to his Party; and but a very few Infamous Apoſtates and Renegades, from their Country and Religion, not many even of Private Perſons, which were not honeſt and firm to that Cauſe, which all <hi>Europe</hi> was Embarkt in.</p>
            <p>And over ſuch a Fleet, and ſuch Men as theſe, my <hi>Lord Dartmouth</hi> either laying down his Commiſſion, or being removed, was <hi>Mr. Herbert</hi> then appointed <hi>Admiral.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'twas now high time our Fleet ſhould be abroad; for, <hi>Ireland</hi> being wholly in the Enemys hand, 'twas not otherwiſe to be expected, then that the <hi>French</hi> ſhou'd uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Effects to give us there the ſtrongeſt Diverſion poſſible, and to aſſiſt the Rebels with all their power.</p>
            <p>Accordingly they ſet out from <hi>Breſt,</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1688. with a Fleet of upward of Thirty Sail, beſides Fire-Ships and Tenders, loaden with Arms, Money, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Proviſion, and ſome few Men, moſt of 'em Voluntiers, and ſome ſtragling <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refugees, reſolved to be cruſh'd with their Maſters deſperate Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Theſe, (ours being not abroad ſoon enough to attend 'em) they Landed at a place called <hi>Bantry-Bay</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which lies upon the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and takes its Name from a little Town ſo call'd, ſcituated in the bottom of it. The Bay it ſelf is large and capacious, and had room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in it for the greateſt Fleets, either to Fight, or run away; the latter of which, as the event ſtood, the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:66458:9"/>
were the moſt inclined to, though they will pretend we have ſince that followed their example. The Admiral him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was embarqued on the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and had with him the <hi>Pendenis,</hi> the <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the <hi>Advice,</hi> the St. <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> the <hi>Antelope,</hi> and the <hi>Portland,</hi> with others, to the number of — in all. The <hi>Dread-nought</hi> having been ſent away, and the <hi>Ruby,</hi> Captain <hi>Froude</hi> Commander, gone with a Prize to <hi>Milford-haven,</hi> which by the Admiral's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he took out of <hi>Cork-haven.</hi> The publick account of the <hi>Bantre-bay</hi> Action, dated the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> 1689. from on board the <hi>Admiral,</hi> is to this purpoſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> having refitted at <hi>Milford-haven</hi> the Damages which ſome of his Ships had ſuſtained by ill weather on the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> intended to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for <hi>Brest,</hi> but the Wind coming Eaſterly, which might bring the <hi>French</hi> Fleet out, he ſtood on the 24<hi>th.</hi> paſt over to <hi>Kinſale,</hi> which he judg'd the likelieſt way to meet them.</p>
               <p>That accordingly on the 29<hi>th.</hi> our Scouts made ſignal that they diſcovered a Fleet keeping their Wind, which made us likeiſe wkeep ours all night to hinder them from getting into <hi>Kinſale.</hi> The 30<hi>th.</hi> they heard the Enemy was gone into <hi>Baltimore,</hi> being 44 Sail; whereupon ours bore away to that place, but found there was no ſign of them. That in the Evening our Scouts got ſight of them again, to the Weſtward of <hi>Copeclear.</hi> We ſteer'd after them, and found they were got into the <hi>Bantre,</hi> we lay off the Bay all night, and the next morning by break of day ſtood in, where we found them at Anchor. That they got preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sail, and bore down upon our Fleet in a Line com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of 28 Men of War, and 5 Fireſhips. That when they came within Muſquet-ſhot of the <hi>Defiance,</hi> the head-moſt of our Ships, the French Admiral put out the Signal of Battel. which was begun by them, they firing their great and ſmall Shot very furiouſly on the <hi>Defiance</hi> and the reſt, as we came in our Line. That then we made
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66458:10"/>
ſeveral boards to gain the Wind, or at leaſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them cloſer, but finding that way of working very diſadvantageous, Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> ſtood off to Sea, as well to have got our Ships into a Line, as to have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Wind of the Enemy; but found them ſo cautious in bearing down, that we could never get an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing it; and in this poſture continued battering upon a Stretch, until five in the Afternoon, when the French Admiral tacked from us and ſtood away farther into the Bay.</p>
               <p>That Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Ship, and ſome of the reſt, being diſabled in their Rigging, we could not follow 'em, but we continued ſome time after before the Bay, and our Admiral gave him a Gun at parting. In this Action Captain <hi>Aylmer</hi> in the <hi>Portland,</hi> (who came in ſoon enough for the Battel, with others of the Squadron men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) and 94 Seamen were killed, and about 250 wounded; as appears by a Survey taken after the Fight, and our Ships received little damage, except in their Sails and Rigging.</p>
               <p>That as for our Officers and Seamen, that Right muſt be done them; That they behaved themſelves with all the Courage and Cheerfulneſs that could be expected from the Braveſt Men; and that on the other ſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leſſening the Enemy, it may be ſaid, That they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted Courage or Skill to make uſe of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Place, the VVind, their Fireſhips, and their number being, at leaſt, double our Force, they having 18 Ships, the leaſt of which was as big as the <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and it ſo happened, at the time of the Engagement, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Herbert</hi> had with him but 8 Third rates, 10 Fourth rates, 1 Fifth rate, and 2 Tenders. And that the Fleet deſigned to rendezvous and refit at <hi>Scilly.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:66458:10"/>This is the Subſtance of what the publick account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, in relation to that Action. VVe have further, to the ſame purpoſe, from thoſe actually preſent in it, that never was greater Cheerfulneſs expreſt by Men, than was by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> notwithſtanding the inequality of the number; they ſhouting inceſſantly, not only at the ſight of the <hi>French,</hi> but during all the Engagement. That the Admiral had for his own ſhare ſeven or eight of the <hi>French</hi> battering againſt him for the moſt part of the fight, and thoſe preſent in that very Ship, ſay, he was above Deck during the <hi>hotteſt</hi> Service, encouraging his Souldiers, and expoſing himſelf as much as poſſible, though others have repreſented things otherwiſe. They add, That had all the reſt behaved themſelves as well, and come up to the Fleet, we had in all probability given a better account of the <hi>French</hi> than we did: for which neglect ſeveral Officers were ſome time after tryed, and ſome puniſh'd with being caſheer'd from their Places and Employments.</p>
            <p>'Twas on the 7<hi>th.</hi> of the ſame Month, when the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arrived with his Fleet at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and the 12<hi>th.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Spithead,</hi> on the fifteenth of which Month His Majeſty our Gracious KING <hi>WILLIAM</hi> arrived there from Collonel <hi>Norton</hi>'s Houſe, where he lay the night before. The Principal Inhabitants of the Town, to the number of above an hundred, went out on Horſe-back to meet him on the way, and drawing up in a line, expreſſed their Duty and Affection to His Majeſty with repeated Acclamations.</p>
            <p>But to omit the univerſal Joy expreſſed by all Loyal Perſons there, at the ſight of His Majeſty, the ingenious and elegant Speech made by Mr. Recorder, and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of Mr. Mayor and Corporation, we ſhall only inſiſt on what paſt between His Majeſty and the <hi>Fleet</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66458:11"/>
under Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> and the gracious marks of his Favour then ſhown to the Admiral and Seamen.</p>
            <p>The Regiments in Garriſon being drawn out, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Street, Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> with the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Fleet, met His Majeſty near the main Guard, and attended him on board the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (the Mayor and Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> waiting upon him to the water-ſide) where he entertained His Majeſty at a very ſplendid Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which ended, the King was placed, as a particular Mark of his Favour towards the Admiral, and great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in his Conduct and good Services, to declare his Royal Intentions, of conferring upon him the Title and Dignity of an Earl of his Kingdom, (as he had before made him one of the Commiſſioners of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.)</p>
            <p>At the ſame time His Majeſty was alſo pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the Honour of Knighthood upon Captain <hi>John Aſhby</hi> Commander of the <hi>Defiance,</hi> the firſt Ship which engaged with the <hi>French</hi> at the <hi>Bantry,</hi> and ſince one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for exerciſing the Office of the Admiralty after the Admiral's Digreſs: And on Captain <hi>Cloudeſly Shovel,</hi> who had ſo often ſignalized his perſonal Valour in his Countries Service; particularly at <hi>Tripoly</hi> formerly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sir <hi>J. Narborough,</hi> and lately in the Haven of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this, to encourage and reward the brave Seamen, he diſtributed among thoſe engaged in the late Bruſh with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, a Donative of Ten ſhillings a man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to Two thouſand ſix hundred pound.</p>
            <p>Nor can any imagine, unleſs they know the Seamen well, and have been preſent at occaſions of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with what Joy and Acclamations both the Officers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66458:11"/>
and all the Seamen received ſo great an Honour from His Majeſty, whom they entertained with loud Shouts and Huzza's, and with all the Demonſtrations of a true reſoution to employ their Lives in His Majeſties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who ſoon after went aſhore and returned to the place where he formerly Lodged. Nor was he in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, any more than the reſt of his Life, worſe than his word; for ſome ſmall time after he was pleaſed to create him Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> (one of the Titles of the Late Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi>) and Baron <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Torbay,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> the Place where he firſt Landed. Add to this the Thanks of the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> to his Lordſhip for the Service he did the Natian in <hi>Bantry Bay</hi>; and it's hardly poſſible to immagine a man in the Admiral's Station Greater or Happier than he at that time was, Favour'd by his Prince, Honour'd by his Country, by all men either Admir'd or Envy'd. And indeed his good Fortunes ſeem now arrived to a kind of <hi>Plethora,</hi> for it was almoſt impoſſible they could proceed any higher without Breaking. This was the Pinacle the higheſt point of his Honour; and ſome will ſay of him as it formerly was of the <hi>Roman,</hi> whom his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful country men afterwards dealt ſo ill with for all his Services- that it had been happy for him if he had juſt then Dy'd, and ſunk into an honouruble Tomb, preſs'd to Death with all his Lawrels, as <hi>Tarpeia</hi> with the Spoils of her Countrys Enemies. But he was reſerved for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinder Fortune, if any thing can be ſo to thoſe whom a long and frequent Experience commonly prepares for the moſt cruel Accidents. However for a while that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Goddeſs Flatter'd him as formerly, and all things ran ſmooth, and even like that flattering Element whereon he had ſo long been in purſuit of Fame and Glory, which one hour Smiles on the induſtrious Merchant, and the very next perhaps, as ſoon as he has Embarked all he is worth, and truſting to its deceitful Promiſes, goes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66458:12"/>
himſelf a Board after it, Frowns again more ſeverely than ever, and in a few Moments daſhes all his hopes on the Rocks and Sands, or Devours it within its own unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Whirlpools.</p>
            <p>He went on, I ſay, in the ſame tract of Happineſs for ſome Months ofter his being thus advanced to ſo high a Dignity, remaining for the moſt part at Court, at the King's Hand and Ear, or in the Houſe of Lords, Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Settling the great Affairs of the Nation, living Magnificently and generouſly, as all the World knew he was wont to do, whenever his Fortunes permitted him; and hardly having another thing to wiſh, to create or increaſe his worldly Felicity. But long he continu'd not in the calms of Peace, for the loud voice of VVar began now to call him forth to accuſtomed Danger and Glory. For our Magnanimous Prince being reſolved in Perſon to attempt the Reduction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> both becauſe other Generals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded more prudentially and dared not hazard as much to win all, and becauſe the glory of the Conqueſt ſeemed reſerved only for his Arms, the <hi>French King</hi> thought that now or never was the time to recover his loſt Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>England,</hi> and be as much King there as he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the late King <hi>James</hi> being more properly the Deputy of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> and a kind of <hi>Intendant,</hi> than <hi>Tyrnonnel</hi> was his. Nor could that potent Tyrant ever propoſe to himſelf a more favourable Juncture than this ſeem'd, to accompliſh his Deſires, to <hi>purſue, overtake, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Spoil, and ſatisfie his Luſt on his,</hi> (as he thought) <hi>Defenceleſs</hi> Neighbours: Almoſt all our Forces being drawn off for <hi>Ireland</hi>; our King the Soul of the Nation gone with them; a VVoman in the Adminiſtration of the Government. (He had forgot Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who gave the <hi>French</hi> as well as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> reaſon enough to remember her:) And beſides all this, a very conſiderable party in our own Bowels Diſcontented and angry, and at leaſt wiſhing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66458:12"/>
a return to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and only wanting a Captain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct 'em thither.</p>
            <p>Nay, yet worſe, if publick Fames, and ſtrong Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as Oaths and undoubted Evidence do not all deceive us, too many here having actually invited the <hi>French</hi> over, as well as correſponded with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they came, (for which there have been ſome who have ſince ſuffer'd condign puniſhment.)</p>
            <p>Nor is the Famed <hi>Memorial</hi> without great probability of Truth; it being hardly to be imagined that ſo VViſe a Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> would have been at ſo vaſt Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to equip a Navy and appeared on our Coaſts with Land-men on Board, and all preparations to make a Deſcent on the Iſland, had they not been both Invited hither, and pretty well aſſured of ſtrong Aſſiſtance on their Landing.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they were no doubt but too well acquainted with the condition of our Fleet, and the number of it, and the place where they lay, and that the Dutch had not yet Joyned us by their Faithleſs correſpondence here, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly their firſt attempt was to Demoliſh thoſe wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den VValls, the Defence of our Common-wealth as well as the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that we might be left naked and open to the ſudden inſults of every Invading Enemy. In proſecution of which Deſign, tho we had advice that after their firſt ſetting out from <hi>Brest,</hi> they were gone into port again; on the 20. of <hi>June</hi> their whole Fleet was diſcovered off of <hi>Plimouth</hi>; on the the 21<hi>ſt.</hi> from <hi>Waymouth,</hi> and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes accordingly diſpatched to the Queen at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and the Admiral then Riding in St. <hi>Hellen</hi>'s Road.</p>
            <p>The French came up with a very freſh Gale of Wind as far as <hi>Freſhwater</hi> Bay, where the Wind immediately ſlackt and turned Northerly, and prevented their fireing our Ships, which tis ſuppoſed was their deſign. That night the Admiral (who with the reſt of the Officers having received the Sacrament at <hi>Deal,</hi> had ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left the <hi>Downs</hi> and brought the Fleet thither) ordered
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66458:13"/>
to unmoor, and the next morning weighted and ſtood out to Sea, coming to an Anchor againſt <hi>Dunnor.</hi> The day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Dutch joyned us with ſeventeen Sail. The 25th. our Fleet diſcovered the French between them and the ſhore. The 26th. a Council of Flag-Officers was called on board the Admiral, where twas agreed (not to fight the French, ſuppoſing them too ſtrong for us,) but to plye to the Eaſt as far as the Flats of the Foreland, and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle them in the Sands. From that time our Fleet ſtill kept turning to the Eaſt till Sunday Evening, when after a Council twas agreed to engage the French the next day, and accordingly the ſignal was given for a Line of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which the Seamen received with all the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Joy imaginable.</p>
            <p>This was off the <hi>Beachy-Head,</hi> the Dutch in the Van, the Red in the Body, the Blew in the Rear. The Dutch and part of the blew preſs'd the French ſo hard, they gave way before them all the former part of the Fight, but few of the red came up, on which the Body of the French Fleet made up to the Dutch, and handled them very ſeverely. Yet about five of the Clock, the French bore away and ſeem'd to think, they had enough of to warm an Entertainment.</p>
            <p>We loſt not one Ship in the Fight, and the Dutch but one, tho ſeveral diſabled, and afterwards burnt by our own men to hinder them from falling into the hands of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The Account the Engliſh Gazet gives us of this Action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſhort, we ſhall here alſo add. It ſays, only this, 
<q>that on the 30. of <hi>June,</hi> we engaged the French-Fleet, conſiſting of 82 Men of War, on Monday about nine in the morning, off of <hi>Beochy</hi>; the Dutch Squadrons leading the Van, and behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves very bravely: The fight laſted till towards evening, when the French bore away and came afterwards to an Anchor, haveing received conſiderable damage. The Officers killed on the Dutch ſide. Rear-Admiral <hi>Jan Dick,</hi> Rear-Admiral <hi>Brackel,</hi> and Captain,

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66458:13"/>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">Captain <hi>Nordea,</hi> and of ours Captain <hi>Pumroy,</hi> with two Captains of the Marine Regiment. The <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Ship, commanded by Captain <hi>Goeſs,</hi> who having his main Maſt brought by the Bord, and neglecting to Anchor as the Fleet did to ſtop the Tide, fell into the Enemies Hand; but the <hi>French</hi> were forced to burn her after they had taken her.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Account the Enemies themſelves give of this Action, is, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> behaved themſelves extreamly well: As to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral, they ſay, never was better Ship nor worſe commanded.—But they are Enemies, and we are not bound to believe all they ſay. We have indeed an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Letter from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court to my Lord <hi>Durſeley</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> which ſays, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron behav'd themſelves with ſo much Bravery, that had —(others)— done their Duty, we ſhould in all probability had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Victory.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, all acknowledge, that a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Engagement begun by the Van-guard of our Fleet, 'twas abſolutely impoſſible for the reſt to get up and joyn with them, the Wind failing, or being as they call it, beaten down with the violence of the Fight.</p>
            <p>However, ſo great was the Diſatisfaction which the <hi>Dutch</hi> receiv'd by the heavieſt part of the Battle falling upon them, and the loſs of ſo many of their Commanders, Ships and Men, that Complaints were immediately made at the Engliſh Court, as well as Tumults in <hi>Holland,</hi> with Threats to pull down my Lord <hi>Durſeley</hi>'s Houſe; the blame was all laid on my Lord <hi>Torrington,</hi> and he accordingly ſent for by the Council, and after Examination, confined; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Commiſſioners being ſent down to make an Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into matters on Bord our Fleet: And not long after, my Lord was committed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch matters as ſhould be alledged againſt him.</p>
            <p>At the return of His Majeſty from <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the Parliament met, in His Speech to them he expreſſed a great Concern for this matter; and purſuant to His Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then ſignified to 'em, Ordered all things to be put
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66458:14"/>
in a way for his Tryal; which how it ſhould be, whether by Impeachment, Common Law, Court of Admiralty, or Court Marſhal, was a long time debated. On the Petition of my Lord <hi>Torrington,</hi> the Houſe of Lords firſt took the matter into Conſideration, but after ſome Debates, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons known to themſelves, were pleaſed to drop any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cognizance of the matter. On this, his Lordſhip ſome time after Addreſſed himſelf to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, before whom he had leave to bring his Caſe, as appears by the Votes of the Houſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nov.</hi> 11. 1690. When the Houſe being inform'd, by a Member of the Houſe, that the Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> now in Cuſtody of the Marſhal of the Admiralty, did deſire to be heard before the Houſe, touching the matter for which he was in Cuſtody. It was accordingly Ordered, That the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> (according to his deſire) ſhould by the Marſhal of the Admiralty be brought before the Houſe the Morning after, to be heard accordingly; and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Arms were to give notice of the ſame to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of the Admiralty, by delivering him the Order of the Houſe, which being done, the next day,— <q>The Houſe being informed that the Earl of <hi>Torrington</hi> was in the Lobby, accoording to the Order of yeſterday, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was call'd into the Houſe within the Bar, and heard before the Houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far the publick Votes; and if in his appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Honourable and Auguſt Aſſembly, his Lordſhip found not ſo great a readineſs of Expreſſion, 'tis what has not rarely happen'd to other great Men before him. This he excuſed, it being more his buſineſs to act than ſpeak, and further deſired he might have liberty to bring the ſame in Writing; which being accordingly granted him. The Sum of what he inſiſted on there in his Defence, 'tis ſaid, was much to this purpoſe: — His former Services to his Country, his loſs of Blood and an Eye in their Quarrel; his ſuffering for the Proteſtant Religion and Laws of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66458:14"/>
Land under King <hi>James.</hi>—And for his not fighting, the want of Intelligence, want of Ammunition, ſhortneſs of the Wind, Inequality of Number, and as 'tis ſaid, ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the contrary from great Perſons, which he there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.—All which the Commons heard and conſidered, but after all remitted him to that way of Tryal now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him, made more clear and feaſible by a new Act concerning the Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, veſting in 'em ſuch Powers as were ſufficient for that and other ſuch ends.</p>
            <p>Accordingly his Tryal was now expedited with all the haſt poſſible, His Majeſty reſolving to have it over before His Paſſage to <hi>Holland</hi>; to which end, Commiſſioners were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the chief of whom was Sir <hi>Ralph Delavall</hi>; a Jury was ſummon'd conſiſting of a ſelect number of Sea Captains then in the Thames and Medway; and after many falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports about Town, he was at laſt carried down in the— Yacht, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 6th of <hi>December, Anno. Dom.</hi> 1690, to <hi>Sheerneſs,</hi> on Board the <hi>Kent,</hi> where his Judges, Jury, and Accuſers were preſent, with the Witneſſes for and againſt him.</p>
            <p>Let's leave him there for a little while, and return to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> whence he Departed; and certainly one cannot eaſily imagin a more pleaſant Scene than this great Hive at that time repreſented; not a Street, nor Shop, nor Houſe, nor Tavern, nor ſcarce a Church it ſelf but was full of <hi>Torring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; the very Merchants upon the Change ſeem'd to have forgot both their Gains and their Loſſes, and all other Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nay left enquiring after their Ships, to ask what News from <hi>Torrington</hi>: The Wagers concerning him were almoſt infinite, and he was Try'd, Accquitted and Condemn'd at a hundred thouſand Tribunals, as many times in an hour, as the fancy or inclinations of the Perſons ſway'd 'em, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the Condition was ſo much as open'd at <hi>Sheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For on <hi>Tueſday</hi> News came that little or nothing was done on <hi>Monday</hi> but reading Commiſſions, and what elſe was preliminary to the grand Affair, the main of the Tryal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66458:15"/>
Adjourn'd till <hi>Wedneſday</hi>; leaving ſtill more room for hopes and fears and wiſhes and cares and wagers. <hi>Wedneſday</hi> alſo paſt without any News here what became of him, for the Tryal not being finiſh'd till the afternoon, 'twas impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any Advice ſhould come hither thereof till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after; many wiſe wagers being yet made of both ſides after it was already decided; for by <hi>Thurſday</hi> early, 'twas all over Town that he was acquitted; by ſome eſteem'd and call'd <hi>ſurpriſing News,</hi> to the vexation of one ſide, and joy of the other, juſt as their Affections lead 'em.</p>
            <p>The manner of his Tryal is thus repreſented: That after all the requiſite Formalities, the Witneſſes were call'd, who appeared againſt him, both <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> none of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of any quality, except Capt. <hi>D</hi>— ſeveral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders being there alſo preſent.</p>
            <p>That upon his Tryal, very little which could any ways af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him, or touch his Life or Honour, was made to appear againſt him: So that after a full and fair hearing of all the Witneſſes, and my Lord's Defence, he was finally Acquitted by the Judges, <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> not ſo much as one of 'em, that we can hear of heſitating on the matter: After which, he was treated with a great deal of reſpect by the Judges themſelves, and others there preſent, only Reer-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Sk</hi>— of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as the Tryal already Printed in that Language tells us, expreſſing his Diſſatisfaction in terms ſomething warm and paſſionate: How the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will reſent it, is not yet known, but muſt be left to time to unravel: This is certain that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſader imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent an account of the whole to his Maſters.</p>
            <p>However, it is certain an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man can only be Tryed by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, and though there may be many, even of our own Nation as well as theirs; who might be ſo reaſonable as to think it fit he ſhould Die, whether or no he deſerved it; and others may be diſpleaſed with what has happen'd, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they are reſolved they will be ſo with all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Government; yet we cannot ſay things have been otherwiſe than fairly managed, when they have been brought on a fair Tryal; nor is the Government ſo weak.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66458:15"/>
God be praiſed, as to be put to the ſad neceſſity of making State-Sacrifices of innocent men, on account of ſome poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Maxim, contrary perhaps both to Honour, Juſtice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon. And for our Forreign Neighbours, it is certain the beſt and wiſeſt of them are not very great favourers of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting</hi> way of Execution, nor can we think they would be willing any man, eſpecially a perſon of Honour in ſo high a Station, ſhould be condemn'd, when it did not in the leaſt appear by the Evidence that he deſerved it. But whatever this preſent reſentment may be, it is not much queſtion'd but the appearance of His <hi>Britanick</hi> Majeſty among them, in that Splender and Glory which is deſigned at that <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Congreſs</hi> there, which already all Europe have their Hearts and Eyes upon, but that it will effectually all cauſeleſs heats and diſcontents, if any ſuch ſhould there ariſe from what has happened; and that the Preſence of ſuch a Prince as has more than once ſaved their Liberties, and whatever they had dear or valuable, will break through greater obſtacles than theſe mentioned, and cement much more cloſely than ever the Union both between all the Confederates, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly between the States and <hi>England,</hi> by whoſe conjoynt care its not much to be doubted, that early this next Spring we may have a Fleet at Sea more Formidable than ever, to regain that Honour which the late unfortunate Summer, we may in ſome meaſure, have ſeem'd to have loſt; for really we cann't be ſaid to have done it, our unhappy Retreat doing us much more injury than all the <hi>French</hi> Cannon, being the cauſe of the loſs of moſt, if not all the Ships which Periſh'd in the late Engagement: Nor in the mean time can I ſee what great reaſon the <hi>French</hi> have to boaſt their own Fortune or Victory, ſince 'twas ſufficiently viſible they could hardly ſuſtain the leaſt part of our Fleet with all their own, and beſides the Ships they had ſunk or diſabled, loſt ſo many men by their own Confuſion in the very Fight, and afterwards while upon our Coaſt, ſo many more by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with no greater Atchievements to boaſt of at home, than Conquering half-a-dozen Boats and Hoys with no man to defend 'em, and Burning a few Fiſhers Huts at <hi>Tin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:66458:16"/>
though as their Cuſtom is, running away again before our Forces could come to Engage 'em, whereof they make ſo glorious a buſineſs in their own Gazettes; not carrying home ſo much as one Man of War, nor Merchant from our Channel, as Trophies of their Valour; nor daring abide us when our Fleet was Re-fitted, and would ſo willingly have ſpoke with them once more before they parted. And 'tis as pleaſant, that their Admiral <hi>Tourville</hi> ſhould be in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace as well as ours, for the ſame Action, it being a long time queſtioned, whether he ſhould have had his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continued, or taken from him, his King being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry that he did not beat us any more, when we our ſelves fought him with one Hand ty'd behind us: And yet he was himſelf in ſo fair a way of being ſoundly beaten.</p>
            <p>To return from this Digreſſion; on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the day after the Lord <hi>Torrington</hi>'s Tryal, he came up the River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a Yatcht, and paſſing through Bridge, went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to his own Houſe; and in a few days after, took his uſual place in the Houſe of Lords; but we do not hear that he has yet been at Court, or ſeen His Majeſty, only his Commiſſion is ſuperſeeded, and he no longer Admiral.</p>
            <p>And now, let every man make what Reflections he pleaſes on what paſſages we have there preſented him, in the Life of this Noble Lord. In the mean time thoughts are free, and I know what I'll think, let others think what they will.—That Fortune's a Jade, if ſhe's any thing at all; that ſhe's as deceitful as her Sex, and as ſlippery as her Wheel. That the moſt powting Lip ſhe can make, is not enough to fright a brave Man, and that the very beſt of her Ogelings and Smiles, are not worth whiſtling after.</p>
