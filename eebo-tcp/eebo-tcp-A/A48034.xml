            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from a Scholar in OXFORD,
to his friend in the Countrey.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Writ to you yesterday by your good friend Master <hi>P.</hi> but in
such haste, and so abruptly, that it cannot in any measure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
either your expectation or my desires of satisfying you.</p>
            <p>I know you must needs long to heare what Progresse is made
in our Visitation: Truly so little, that I cannot well tell whether
it be begun. Friday <hi>Iune</hi> 4. was designed for the day; and the
Visitors from <hi>London</hi> had peremptorily resolved to be here, and
were as confidently expected. But they were diverted by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
newes of the Armies rebelling against the two Houses,
together with a high Mutiny of the Garrison here (two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Visitors should have come downe) who not only refused
to disband, but detained the 3500. l. which was sent downe to
pay them upon their disbanding. The Parliament, while the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was upon the way hither, being informed that they meant
not to disband, sent Post after the money, to have it brought
back: but their menssenger was too slow; for it was got into <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
before he overtooke it: and the Garrison notwithstanding
the Parliaments command, were resolved not to part with it.
Whereupon the Convoy of Dragoones, who had guarded it from
<hi>London</hi> hither, attempting to have it back againe, the Garrison-Souldiers
fell upon them in the high street (the money standing
loaden betwixt them) wounded many of them, and quickly beat
them out of the Towne, leaving their money and their waggon &amp;
teeme of horses behind them.</p>
            <p>This, with the high demands of the Army (which fell out very
opportunely at the same time) made Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> and
those other gentlemen which should have accompanied him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102423:3"/>
begin to look about them, and to be think themselves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were not better to keep in <hi>London</hi> then to adventure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at <hi>Oxford</hi> amongst a company of Malignant Scholars, and an
Independent Garrison that had already put such an affront
upon the Parliament especially there being a great party of Horse
then lying quartered about <hi>Ox.</hi> sent from the Army to secure the
Traine of Artillery here, upon an information that there was a
designe to seize upon it, and remove it to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The result was, that (though on the Thursday following, <hi>Iune
3. Merton</hi> Colledge great gates were set wide open to receive
them and great preparations made for their entertainment there;
and the poore Scholars generally quaking at the approach of
their Doomesday, the rather in regard they had declared but three
days before against the Covenant, yet) the Gentlemen came not.
Onely a Packet of letters was brought from them to the Ministers
here, to let them know that they should not expect them till the
long Vacation.</p>
            <p>Hereupon we conceived (and we thought we had some reason
for it) that the Visitation would be adjourned till that time:
never imagining that the Ministers (especially considering the
present Posture of Affaires) would have had the courage to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it themselves. Though by the way let me tell you, that
had the rest all of them come, yet the University had before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
resolved not to appear or submit to their Visitation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then with a [<hi>Salvis nobis &amp; Academiae omnibus juribus, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegiis,
immunitatibus, &amp;c.]</hi> to be delivered to them in writing
by the Proctors and Heads of Houses. Nay it was put to the
question (but waved) whether we should appeare at all: upon
this supposed ground that they had no lawfull authority to
visit us.</p>
            <p>But the next morning, contrary to every bodies expectation,
we understood that the<note n="*" place="margin">M. Rogers. M. Harris. M. Reynolds. M. Wilkinson. M. Cheynell.</note> Ministers (forsooth) assisted by one
Master <hi>Dunce</hi> of <hi>Pizzy,</hi> Master <hi>Draper</hi> (a new-made justice, and
a Committee-man for this County) and another of the <hi>Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
which three were come to towne for that purpose, supposing
the rest would have done the like (and indeed some others there
were in Towne; one, I am certaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he thought it more
prudence not to be seene among them) intended to proceed in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102423:3"/>
the businesse. To be short (for I perceive I am already become
tedious in my Relation) the bell rung out for the Visitation-Sermon;
M. <hi>Harris</hi> preached it; the greatest part of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
were present.</p>
            <p>Sermon ended (but it was very long first; for which we doe
freely forgive him) we hasted away (the Visitors following after
more gravely &amp; leisurely) to the Schooles: where the Vicechancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
the Doctors and Proctors, with diverse other members of
the University had attended (according to the Citation) from
nine of the clock. No sooner were we come thither but the
clock struck eleven: and I can assure you there was no foul play in
it; for to prevent all cavill, the Vicechancellour, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it to draw towards eleven sent a command to the Sexton that
he should be carefull to observe the Sun, and see that his clock
kept pace with it exactly.</p>
            <p>This faire advantage being thus unexpectedly offered us (for
which we have none to thank but the Preacher, one of themselves)
we thought we had no reason but to embrace it: and therefore,
upon the striking of the clock, we enter'd immediately into the
Convocation-House, and there declared (by the mouth of the
Proctor; whereunto we have the attestation of a Publike Notary)
that whereas by vertue of an Ordinance of the two Houses we
had beene cited to appeare there this day between the houres of
nine and eleven in the forenoone, we had obeyed: and because
the time limited was now expired, we held our selves not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to any further attendance. Whereupon the Vicechancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
gave command that we should every man forthwith repaire
home to our severall Colledges.</p>
            <p>In our returne (the Vicechancellour and Doctors marching in
a full body, with the Bedells before them) we met the Visitors just
in the <hi>Proscholium;</hi> where the passage (you know) being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
narrow, one of the Bedells called to them [<hi>roome for M.
Vicechancellour</hi>] whereupon they were pleased to deny <hi>Selfe,</hi> and
gave the way. The Vicechancellour (very civilly) moved his cap
to them, saying [<hi>good morrow gentlemen; tis past eleven a clock</hi>]
and so passed on without taking any further notice of them. Upon
this, there followed a great Humme, and so we parted; they

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lding on to their Visitation-House, and we home to dinner.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102423:4"/>
They sate about an houre that day (looking one upon another)
and have met severall times since (M. Principall <hi>Roger<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

they put off the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not able to informe you: for, to tell
you the plaine truth, we never heed them.</p>
            <p>This carriage of ours they take very ill, and looke upon it as a
high contempt. We, on the other side, thinke we are very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to justifie what we have done; and are of opinion that they
are quite out, and must begin again, if they mean to doe any thing:
conceiving that we are not bound to make any further appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
unlesse we have a new Citation; the former being rendered
null through their default.</p>
            <p>Sir, let me crave your Opinion of the Case, and your favourable
acceptance of this impertinent Paper, that presumes thus to break
in upon you, and disturb your thoughts, which (doubtlesse) are now
fixed upon a businesse of much greater concernment, the present
contestation between the two Houses and the Army. However,
I doe not at all doubt but you will pardon this injury, when you
shall finde that it is done you by</p>
