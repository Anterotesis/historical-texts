            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOW long the <hi>Scots</hi> have coin'd Gold is very uncrtain; tho', I think, we may (in the Groſs) venture to affirm that they hardly did it before the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And we have elſewhere aſcrib'd the Beginning of the Matter there to K. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third.

The five laſt Chapters in the <hi>Regiam Majeſtatem</hi> are obſerv'd to be of a ſuſpected Authority; or, otherwiſe, we might ſeem to have a pretty good Evidence of K. <hi>David</hi> the Firſts coining of Gold: For thus runs one of the Laws, <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Reg.

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35010:3"/>Before we enter upon the Times wherein we have better Light, it will be convenient to to obſerve two Things to the Reader: 1. That the Proportion betwixt Gold and Silver, in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> has uſually been as One to Twelve; ſo that when the Ounce of Gold was at three Pounds, the Ounce of Silver went at five Shillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is more particularly clear'd in a Manuſcript Note of <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Penes D. <hi>Rob. Sibbald.</hi>
               </note> Sir <hi>James Balfour</hi>'s, which he had call'd <hi>Pryſſes of the Cunzie in the hail tyme of Ja.</hi> 1. <hi>Ja.</hi> 2. <hi>Ja.</hi> 3. <hi>Ja</hi> 4. <hi>Ja.</hi> 5. <hi>and Queine Marey.</hi> A. D. 1437. (ſays that Note) K. <hi>James</hi> the Firſt at his Death, had a Standard equal to that of <hi>England</hi>: Silver was at 5 <hi>s. (Scots)</hi> the Ounce, and Gold at 3 <hi>l. A.</hi> D. 1440. K. <hi>James</hi> the Second rais'd Silver to 8 <hi>s.</hi> the Ounce; and Gold to 4 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s. A.</hi> D. 1466. <hi>James</hi> the Third rais'd the Silver (firſt) to 10 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and the Gold to 5 <hi>l.</hi> 12 <hi>s.</hi> afterwards he again mounted the Ounce of Silver to 12 <hi>s.</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> 1475. but (in <hi>February</hi> 1483.) he reduced it to 11 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> The Gold he advanc'd to 6 <hi>l.</hi> A. D. 1489. <hi>James</hi> the Fourth kept both at the laſt mention'd Value. There are no remaining Acts of Council, concerning Coinage, in K. <hi>James</hi> the Fifth's Time; tho' great Alterations were made in that Reign. The <hi>Douglas</hi>-Groats (of 10 <hi>d.</hi> fine) and <hi>Babies</hi> (of 3 <hi>d.</hi> fine) were then brought in uſe; as were likewiſe the Bonnet-pieces of Gold. He left the Ounce of Silver at 19 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> and Gold at 12 <hi>l. A.</hi> D. 1542. In Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time the Ounce of Silver roſe to 30 <hi>s.</hi> and ſhe coin'd <hi>Placks</hi> (of only 2 <hi>d.</hi> fine) at 4 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> the Ounce 2. Another Thing whereof I am to admoniſh the Reader is, that he will find the Weight of the Gold and Silver (in the following Account of the Coins of both Metals) computed by different Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards. In the former is obſerv'd that of the Goldſmiths of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35010:3"/>
               <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; who divide their Ounce into ſixteen <hi>Drops,</hi> and their <hi>Drop</hi> into 36 <hi>Grains,</hi> 27 of their <hi>Grains</hi> making our <hi>Penny-weight.</hi> In weighing of the Silver Coins, I have kept to our common <hi>Engliſh</hi> Weights; by Ounces, Penny-weights and Grains. The Reaſon of this Difference, is, becauſe all the Golden Coins are now in the Poſſeſſion of (my worthy and communicative Friend) Mr. <hi>James Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; who was pleas'd nicely to examine their ſeveral Weights by the Standard of his own Country. Moſt of the Silver-pieces are in the Hands of the moſt Reverend Father in GOD, the preſent Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi>; and his Grace, among the many generous Acts of Favour which I have had from him, has kindly obliged me with his own moſt learned and curious Remarks upon 'em. Theſe two Things premis'd, I begin the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Coins in Gold.</p>
            <p>Theſe, as I take it,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Rob.</hi> II.</note> cannot be carry'd higher than the Sovereignty of the Royal Family of the <hi>Stewarts</hi>; the eldeſt Golden Coin of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſeeming to be no older than the Reign of K. <hi>Robert</hi> the Second.

Beginning of this King's Reign, a golden Baſin (of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarts) was preſented by the Regent <hi>Morton</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, fill'd with coin'd Pieces of Gold call'd <hi>Unicorns</hi>; both the Money and the Veſſel being made of the native Gold of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Such Pieces I never ſaw.</p>
            <p>To one that conſiders how few <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coins we have of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Half a Score of our Kings next after the Conqueſt, it.<note place="margin">Silver.</note> will not look ſtrange that the Silver-money of our neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Kingdom (of the like Age) is not now very plentiful The oldeſt that even Mr. <hi>Sutherland</hi> himſelf has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to able to diſcover, is a Penny of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Firſt's; which yet (he is not very ſure, but it) may belong to one of the other two Princes of that Name. For the better and more skilful diſtinguiſhing the ancient Silver Coins of <hi>Scotland,</hi> theſe Preliminary Cautions (which I have from a very <note n="(d)" place="bottom">RR. D, D. Archiep. Ebor.</note> great Hand) will be found to be of mighty Uſe. 1. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Weights in <hi>Scotland</hi> are different from ours, ſixteen Pounds <hi>Troy</hi> (as ſeveral Acts of Parliament have provided) going to the Stone, and every ſuch Pound being divided into ſixteen Ounces: But their Silver-weights are the ſame, their Ounce-pieces exactly agreeing with ours. How their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard (or the Fineneſs of the Metal) has vary'd from ours, or agreed with it, will be obſerved in the ſeveral Reigns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 2. The Sums by which the <hi>Scots</hi> always computed, and do ſtill compute, are the ſame with ours, they reckoning by Farthings, Half-pence, Pence, Shillings, Merks and Pounds, as we do; and all thoſe Sums bearing the ſame Proportion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35010:9"/>
to one another, as ours do; That is, a Shilling contains twelve Pennies, a Merk thirteen Shillings and four Pence, a Pound twenty Shilling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there has been a great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the two Nations (at ſeveral Seaſons as to the value of thoſe Sums. At firſt, perhaps, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pieces being of the ſame Weight and Denomination with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>) might alſo be current at the ſame Rate with ours: But from the Beginning of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's Reign (which is as high as their printed Statutes will carry us) it was otherwiſe; and the Difference increas'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reigns, as will appear preſently. 3. There's no doubt but that, for a long Time, the coin'd Pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in <hi>Scotland</hi> (as well as <hi>England</hi>) were only Pence and Half-pence: After which came in Groats and Half-groats; and, by Degrees, larger Pieces of even an Ounce, two Thirds of an Ounce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
