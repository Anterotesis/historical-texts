            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which are wont to molest the soule, wheras, through the more plentiful light of Gods good grace, we see now the imperfections and defectes of our former confessions, which perhaps were not vailable, either for want of contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or for hauing left some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and deadly sinne, or necessary circumstance vntolde: whether it were through shamefastnes, or blame worthie negligence, or some suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like default, which we were not in the darke time of our former daies aware of: and now through the grace and heauenly light we haue since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receaued, doo plainly and manifestly perceaue them. Ioyning therfore due diligence to this heauenly light, we are nowe to supply al former wantes, that our soule mai be set at rest, and ridde of suche remorse which els wold continually gnaw &amp; wouud it.</p>
            <p>This general confession shal profit muche in this wise to, to moue and prouoke God thorough the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Nowe to make this confession rightly, and as it ought to be, we must, first craue of God in al humilitie his grace and fauour, <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 31. b Psal. 37. d.</note> to haue due know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of those greeuous sinnes which we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against his diuine Maiestie throughout all our former life, and that it may plese him to geue vs sincere and <note n="b" place="margin">Psa. 50. d</note> hartie sorowe for the same.

maundementes of God, and those of his Churche, the seuen deadly sinnes, the senses of the body, and powers of the soule. Al the which thou mayest doo much better, and with more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie a great deale, if thou reade ouer some briefe and learned Confessiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye (as there be many) or if so thou canst not reade thy self, to cause some other to reade it to thee. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at any time thou shalt be put in minde of any crime whatsoeuer it be, thou haste committed, force thy selfe to haue a particuler griefe and sorowful repentaunce, as wel of it, as al other, whereof thy conscience may pleade thee giltie.</p>
            <p>Hauing vsed this diligence, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeke then the best learned and most vertuous confessor thou maiest possibly find out, to who I wish thee, aswel now, as hereafter, to make thy confession to, and by his counsail, to gouerne the whole course of thy life, and al thine actions: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:7405:11"/>
no doubt but thou shalt find a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table helpe for the better seruing of God, and more secure walking in his waie, as I shal hereafter more at large let thee vnderstand in the. Xij. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this litle Treatise.) When thou hast thus made choise of such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour, then shalt thou with al humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, shamefastnes, and sinceritie, ope al thy sins vnto him, declaring what is necessarie, and omitting that is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, <note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 31. b</note> accusing thy self, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, of the sinnes thou hast co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: neither excusing thee, as some doo very naughtily, attributing <note n="b" place="margin">Psa. 141.</note> the cause of their sinnes to the deuil, the frailtie of their fleshe, or to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, or at least alleaging cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine excuses to cloake and shadowe their sinnes withal, that by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they may either seeme none at al, or the lesse greeuous a great deale. Al which kinde of scuses, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, true, and contrite penitent, must
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7405:11"/>
in any wise eschewe. And therfore is it muche better (as S. Iohn Climacus saieth) to discouer the wounds of thy soule nakedly and plainly to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour, he being appointed thy phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to cure and heale the same, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this maner: I confesse that I haue sinned through mine own fault, and no other bodies, neither hath the deuil prouoked me therto, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, neither my body, not anye other creature, but onely is it through mine owne fault and wickednes that I haue offended. If thou both thinke and say thus, thou shalt do according to that the prophete Dauid saieth: <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 31. b</note> 
               <hi>I wil confesse mine vnrighteousnes against me.</hi> And if by thus doing thou suffer more confusion and shame, beleeue verily, that for this temporal shame thou shalt escape eternal and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting shame. Thus hauing in this maner made thy confession, accept the penaunce and satisfaction which
<pb facs="tcp:7405:12"/>
which shalbe laide vpon thee, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to fulfil the same so soone as thou maiest conueniently. And if it should so fal out that thou were bound to make restitution of goodes or of good name, doo it, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, before confession, or so soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as thou canst. The like doo I also say of other penance and satisfaction that shalbe enioyned thee, that thou perfourme the same without delaye.</p>

            <p>DESCENDING nowe to more particularitie, for that such things as be wel and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly disposed, be both more durable and profitable too: I haue therefore thought good to aduertise thee, what course and order thou oughtest euery day to keepe. Which let be this: first, to rise in the morning so earlye as thou mayest, hauing before taken conuenient rest and sleepe, which is had betwixt sixe and seuen howres,
<pb facs="tcp:7405:16"/>
litle more or lesse, according to the diuersitie of complexions. So soone as thou art awake, it is a good &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye deuotion, before thou settle thy minde to any other thing, to offer vp to God the first fruits of al thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and powers of thy whole body: as for example, thy heart, thinking of thy Creatour, and sighing after him: thine eyes, casting them vpon some godly picture, or vp to heauen: thy legges, kneeling humbly before his presence: thy handes, lifting them vp to adore and thanke him: thy mouth, saying some short prayers, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster, Aue Mary, and the Crede: and then mayest thou afterwards, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as thy deuotion shal teache thee, briefly geue him thankes for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing preserued thee the night past, desiring him likewise to defend thee that presont day from al sinne; and to geue thee grace to spende it better in his diuine seruice.</p>
            <p>After this, if so thou be at leysure,

and haue no great busines, reade a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of some deuout Treatise, or make a litle me ditation, whereof I shal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate hereafter. Doing thus, thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est as our Sauiour him selfe aduised thee, saying: <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 6. d</note> 
               <hi>Seeke first the kingdome of God, and his iustice, and al other thinges shall be geuen vnto you.</hi> It were very good also, after thou hast done thus, to go to the Churche, if thou mightest conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and there to heare Masse, or at least to see and adore thy Sauiour in his moste holy Sacrament: but if thy neede and pouertie can not wel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde thee such leaue as to go thither, it shal then suffice on working dayes to do the same with heart and good desire.</p>
            <p>Hauing nowe recommended thy selfe to God in maner aforesaid, thou maiest with his holy blessing attende to thine occupation or temporal bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, referring al thinges, yea, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral also, to his diuine seruice, choosing rather to doo them for his loue, then

            <p>At euening it should be very good, (if thou couldest conucniently) to say

some few deuotions before supper, or to reade a litle, as I shal hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thee, that by this meanes thy soule might receaue some refreshing before thy body: howbeit, if thy trade and busines would not geue thee leue to doo so then maiest thou get thee to supper on Gods name, behauing thy self therin as is said at diner time.</p>

if thou coldest conueniently vse it, to go and instruct others in the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, or learne thy self, if thou vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande it not wel, at suche Churches where thei haue this exercise, wherby euery way doth insue great gaine: for if thou teache others that be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, thou <note n="a" place="margin">Iac. 5. d.</note> exercisest one of the seuen spiritual works of mercy: and if thou learne thy self of others, thou winnest that which it behoued thee to know, and that is more pretious then be mountains of worldly wealth.</p>
            <p>After this exercise thou maiest goe and hear euensong, compline, &amp; some good lesson, if ther be any, gouerning thy selfe in althinges, as is abouesaide in the morning.</p>
            <p>This being done, imploie the spare time til night in doing some deede of mercy, as in <note n="b" place="margin">Iac. 1. d.</note> visiting some hospital or prison, comforting &amp; performing some charitable office to those weake &amp; comfortles creatures, or otherwise thou maiest associate thy selfe with some vertuous companions to re|

to report or heare some spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, or reade some godly booke, or finde thee occupied in some suche like honest exercise: And if so be thou thinkest it otherwhile expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to walke abroade for recreation, let it be in some secrete and solitarie place, where other seculer persons come not to disturbe thee, and with their prophane conuersation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe thy minde from God.</p>
            <p>It is also a very good exercise vpon suche Saintes daies as be kept holye, to reade or meditate vpon their liues, and to animate thy selfe thereby to imitate them in some one vertue or spiritual worke, such as pertain moste to thine owne estate. Finally thou oughtest euer after diner on these daies to occupie thy selfe in some suche exercise, as thy soule may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reape some spiritual profite, and growe more zealous and feruent in the loue of God, with newe purposes and inflamed desires to go continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

            <p>Thus be the holy dayes sanctified conformably to Gods wil, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of holy Churche.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes both in thy meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before supper (hauing the meanes to make it) and in the examination of thy conscience before thou go to bed; thou shalt both in these &amp; ech other thing of night, doo as is abouesaid in the former Chapter; noting this by the way, that on these daies al is to be done with so much more leisure, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, and diligence, as the highnes of the day shal more require it.</p>
            <p>And here let euery man that hath childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or familie learne, that he is as a guide and gouernour to such as be vnder him, and therefore is he bound so much as in him lieth, to draw them to the seruice of God, causing them

            <p>NOWE that I haue alreadie intreated of the order that suche as desire to liue like good Christians ought to kepe both on working and holy daies; it resteth, that I intreate of another kinde of dailye exercise verye necessarye for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7405:25"/>
eche one to obteine this their desired ende withal; chiefly yet for suche as minde to dedicate them selues more sincerely to diuine seruice. And this is the exercise of holy praier, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vocal, which is common to eche one, and more frequented of al; but also mental, which very fewe wot of, and so consequently very fewe doo practise; being neuerthelesse the more excellent kinde a great deale. And therefore is it to be noted, that albeit vocal praier, to wit, that which is made with the mouth and voice, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sundry offices, psalmes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, is a verye profitable thing, instituted, approued, and practised in al religions and cathedral Churches; yet is not this, but that which we cal mental the more worthy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent kind a great deale, and wherof the holy doctors do chiefli mean, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they speak of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of praier, &amp; the singuler fruits which proceede thereof. The which mental kinde of
<pb facs="tcp:7405:26"/>
praier doth so farre passe and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the vocal, as doth the soule or spirite, in dignitie, passe and excel the body. Wherfore, such as minde to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise them selues throughly in Gods seruice, and to batten &amp; grow strong in spirite, ought not to content them selues only with vocal praier, but (as S. Paule saith) <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cot. 14 c</note> to praye with mouth and minde together, hauing receaued at Gods handes both thone and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Howbeit, let vs chiefly praye with spirite: for (as our Sauiour saide <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 4. c 2. Cor. 3. d</note> to the Samaritane) <hi>God is spirite, and those which adore him, must in spirite and truth adore him.</hi> Wherevpon we know right wel, that the holy Saintes of old time, and the moste spiritual men of our daies exercise them selues most chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and commonly in this kinde of praier, as hauing by experience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, how much more profite and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comfort the soule receaueth by this mental praier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by that of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. This thing also alone, declareth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7405:26"/>
sufficiently, of what importance they deemed this exercise, and how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarye for al good Christians, in that they are not afraide to cal the same omnipotent: for so muche as being made as it ought to be, we thereby obteine euery thing, like as Christe our redeemer hath promised, saying: <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 21. b Mar. 11 c. Ioh. 15 b.</note> 
               <hi>Verily I say vnto you, that what soeuer you shal aske by praier, beleeue it shalbe geuen you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This praier, wherof we now speake, is a lifting vp of our minde to God, which is rather done with inflamed desires of the hart, then with varietie of outward words, and so are we lesse pained therein then in vocal praier: yea, looke howe much the longer we continue in this kind of exercise, and so much doo we finde it the more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie and fruitful for our soule; for that eche time a man frequenteth this holy exercise, he stil sucketh out newe sap of graces and spiritual trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: yea, suche as at some times the soule doeth, as it were, palpate and
<pb facs="tcp:7405:27"/>
feele it moste apparantly. For like as Moises had his face lightned &amp; made glittering, through his often conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with God, in suche wise, as the children of Israel (according as holye <note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 34. d Cor. 3. c</note> scripture telleth) could not abide to looke vpon him; euen so the soule through perseuerance in praier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth more lightned and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the newe graces it recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: we know moreouer, how Christ our redeemer (as the holy Euangelist S. <note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 9. d Mat. 17. a.

Pet. 1. c.</note> Luke reporteth) being in praier, was transfigured, and his face visiblye changed into as beautiful a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as the Sunne, his garmentes also became as white as snowe; euen so is the soule of man in praier transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and chaunged into God, and the darkenes thereof turned into light, frailty into force, feare into hope, sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes into solace, with other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable commodities too many to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse, which trial testifieth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede out of this holy praier.</p>

            <p>THIS moste holy sacrament of the Aultar (wherin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the very real body &amp; bloud of our Sauiour Iesus Christe, and by the same his passion and dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death represented vnto vs) is of such vertue and excellencie, that it not onely profiteth such, as with due preparation doo really receaue the same; but extendeth also the vertue thereof to those, that with fayth and inward zeale desire to receaue, albeit sacramentally they doo it not.

               <p>In this Church-yard there is one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and chiefe waie, of breadth and height sufficient, in the wals whereof are on either side sepulchres cutt out, one aboue an-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like to cophins and litle chestes, in the fronts wherof were stones that had inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions grauen in them, both in the Latine and greeke tongues. How-beit the moste part of these stones are either taken away, hewed out, or broken, as of the bones there are likewise very many missing. Yet, for al
