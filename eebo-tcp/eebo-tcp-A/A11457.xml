            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we <hi>giue</hi> a scandall, if we iudge; notwithstanding he
that is iudged <hi>take</hi> it not as a scandall. For, that
<hi>iudging</hi> is in it selfe a <hi>scandall,</hi> is cleare from vers. 13.
of this Chapter; <hi>Let vs not therefore,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,
iudge one another any more, but iudge this rather, that
no man put a stumbling blocke, or an occasion to fall in

is <hi>vsurpation.</hi> 2. We may erre in our iudgements;

cateth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 17. Application to the case in our Church.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And so I haue done with my Text in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vse of it: wherein we haue seene the two faults


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12502:17"/>
of <hi>despising,</hi> and of <hi>iudging</hi> our <hi>brethren</hi> layd open;
and the vglinesse of both discouered. I now des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to make such Application, as I promised,
both of the <hi>case</hi> and <hi>rules;</hi> vnto some differences,
and to some offences giuen and taken in our
Church in point of <hi>Ceremony.</hi> The Case ruled in
my Text was of <hi>eating,</hi> and not <hi>eating:</hi> the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
which some maintaine in our Church, are
many in the particular; (as of <hi>kneeling,</hi> and not
<hi>kneeling; wearing,</hi> and not <hi>wearing; crossing,</hi> and not
<hi>crossing,</hi> &amp;c.) but all these, and most of the rest of
them, may be comprehended in grosse vnder the
tearmes of <hi>conforming,</hi> and not <hi>conforming.</hi> Let vs
first compare the cases; that hauing found wherein
they agree, or disagree, we may therby iudge how
farre Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> aduice in my Text ought to rule
vs, for not <hi>despising,</hi> for not <hi>iudging</hi> one another.
There are foure speciall things, wherein if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this our Case with the Apostles; in euery of
the foure we shall find some agreement, and some
disparity also; 1. The nature of the <hi>matter:</hi> 2. The
abilities of the <hi>persons:</hi> 3. Their seuerall <hi>Practice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the things: and 4. Their mutuall <hi>carriage</hi> one
towards another. And first, let vs consider how
the two cases agree in each of these.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§ 18. Agreement betwixt the two Cases.</note> the <hi>matter</hi> whereabout the <hi>eater</hi> and the
<hi>not-eater</hi> differed in the Case of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> was in
the nature of it <hi>indifferent:</hi> so it is betweene the
<hi>conformer,</hi> and <hi>not-conformer</hi> in our Case. As there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>fish,</hi> and <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>herbes</hi> were meerely indifferent;
such as might be eaten, or not eaten without sinne:


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12502:17"/>
so here <hi>Cap,</hi> and <hi>Surplis, Crosse,</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> and the
rest, are things meerely indifferent; such as (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their owne nature) may be vsed or not vsed
without sinne; as being neither expresly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
nor expresly forbidden in the Word of
God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>persons</hi> agree. For as there, so here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
also; some are <hi>strong in faith,</hi> some <hi>weake.</hi> There
are many, whose iudgements are vpon certaine
and infallible grounds assured and resolued, and
that <hi>certitudine Fidei,</hi> that <hi>Cappe,</hi> and <hi>Surplis,</hi> and
<hi>Crosse,</hi> and the rest, are things lawfull, and such as
may be vsed with a good Conscience. There are
some others againe, who through <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi>
or <hi>preiudice,</hi> or otherwise weakned in their
iudgements; cannot (or will not) bee perswaded,
that these things are altogether free form supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Idolatry: nor consequently, the vse of
them from sinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>practice</hi> of the persons are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
As there, the <hi>strong</hi> did vse his liberty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the assurance of his knowledge, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and did eate freely without scruple; and the <hi>weake</hi>
did forbeare to eate, because of his doubting and
irresolution: So here, most of vs in assured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that we may <hi>weare,</hi> and <hi>crosse,</hi> and <hi>kneele,</hi>
and vse the other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Customes</hi> of our
Church, doe willingly, and <hi>ex animo</hi> conforme
our selues thereunto; yet some there are, who out
of I know not what nicenesse and scruplositie
make dainty of them, and either vtterly refuse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12502:18"/>
or at leastwise desire respite, till they can
better informe themselues.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
            <p>Lastly, there is some correspondence also in the
fauie <hi>Carriage</hi> of the parties one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For as there the <hi>eater</hi> despised the <hi>not-eater;</hi>
and the <hi>not eater</hi> iudged the <hi>eater:</hi> so here, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but that some <hi>Conformers</hi> (although
I hope farre the lesser, I am sure farre the worser
sort,) doe despise and scandalize the <hi>non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
more then they haue reason to do, or any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
honest man will allow. But is it not most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
also, that the <hi>non-Conformers</hi> (but too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
yea, and the better sort of them too, but too
often and much) do passe their censures with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
great freedome; and spend their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
liberally vpon, and against the <hi>Conformers?</hi>
Hitherto the Cases seeme to agree. One would
thinke, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> the Apostles rule would
as well fit our Church and Case, as the <hi>Romane;</hi> and
should as well free the <hi>non-Conformers</hi> from our
<hi>Contempt,</hi> as vs from their <hi>Censures. Let not him
that</hi> conformeth, <hi>despise him that</hi> conformeth not:
<hi>and let not him that</hi> conformeth not, <hi>iudge him that</hi>
conformeth.</p>
            <p>But if you will please to take a second surview of
the foure seuerall particulars,<note place="margin">§ 19. Difference betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, l. in the Matter.</note> wherein the Cases
seemed to agree; you shall find very much dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and disproportion betwixt the two Cases in
each of the foure respects. In the case of my Text,
the <hi>matter</hi> of difference among them, was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indifferent in the nature of it; but it was also left


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12502:18"/>
as indifferent for the vse: the Church <hi>(perhaps)</hi> not
hauing determined any thing positiuely therein;
at least no publike authoritie hauing either enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

But in the Case of our Church it is farre otherwise.

If the Church had beene silent, if Authoritie had

and <hi>Obedientiall</hi> Necessitie, well weighed, and

And such men should not be <hi>weakelings.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
ours are such as take themselues to haue

lamentable enough; though not comparable

want of knowledge, and the vnsufficiency of some

vanity for these men (or their friends in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe)

an ignorance at the best in some degree of <hi>wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>

such ingenuous satisfaction, as they might

<hi>damnation</hi> is most <hi>iust.</hi>

yet allow it any in the least degree, and with the

sentence standeth good: Without repentance
their <hi>damnation is iust.</hi> Admit the <hi>Truth</hi> be darke

the irregularitie of the Will to the Iudgement.
And of such a man there is good hope, that both
in time he may see his errour, and repent <hi>expresly</hi>
and particularly for it; and that in the meane time
he doth repent for it <hi>implicitè,</hi> and inclusiuely in his

generally heareth some <hi>errour</hi> in iudgement, or
outragious <hi>sinne</hi> in practice to bee continued in
with too publique allowance: Hee hath <hi>libertie</hi> to
make choyce of his <hi>Text</hi> and theame, and leisure

to prouide in some measure for it; and his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
telleth him, he cannot <hi>pro hîc &amp; nunc</hi> direct
his speech with greater seruice to Gods Church,
then against those <hi>errours</hi> or <hi>sinnes.</hi> Hee seeth on
the other side some withdrawments: his <hi>discretion</hi>
may perhaps bee called in question, for meddling
where he needed not; hee shall possibly lose the
<hi>good opinion</hi> of some, with whom he hath held faire
correspondence hitherto; he shall preserue his own
<hi>peace</hi> the better, if he turne his speech another way.
This is the <hi>Case.</hi> The <hi>Question</hi> is, whether these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
considerations, and the good that may come
thereby, bee sufficient to warrant vnto him the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of that necessary duty?</p>
            <p>The <hi>rule</hi> of my Text resolueth it <hi>negatiuely:</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 32. A Minister, in what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he may conceale some diuine truths from his auditory;</note> they
are <hi>not</hi> sufficient. The Duty being necessary, <hi>pro

it may not be omitted for any other good. I
deny not, but a Minister may with good discretion
conceale many truths from his flocke; at least the
