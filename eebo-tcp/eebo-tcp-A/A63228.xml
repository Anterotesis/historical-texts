            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the perſons here before you ſtand indicted for High Treaſon, they are five in number, three of them are <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> one is a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> the fifth is a Layman, perſons fitly prepared for the work in hand.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is not unknown to moſt perſons, nay to every one amongſt us, that hath the leaſt obſerved the former times, how that ever ſince the Reformation there hath been a deſign carried on to ſubvert the Government, and deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed here in <hi>England,</hi> for during all the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall attempts were made by ſeveral <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that came from beyond the Seas, (though the Laws were then ſevere againſt them) to deſtroy the Queen, and alter the Religion eſtabliſhed here in <hi>England,</hi> and to introduce Popery and the Superſtition of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Conſpirators from time to time, during all the Queens Reign, were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as <hi>Edmond Camtion</hi> and ſeveral other Jeſuits, who came over in that time, and were executed &amp; did ſuffer for their Treaſons according to Law: at length about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>And ſoon after the Queens death, in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons came over into <hi>England</hi> from this very Seminary, who, together with one <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> Superior of the Jeſuits then in <hi>England,</hi> and divers other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, hatched that helliſh Gunpowder-plot; whereby what was deſigned you all know, but as it fell out, theſe perſons, as well as thoſe in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, were likewiſe diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their execrable Treaſons, in the third year of King <hi>James,</hi> were executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> and otherplaces.</p>
               <p>This is evident by the very Act of Parliament in 30. <hi>Jacobi</hi> in the preamble whereof mention is made that <hi>Creſwel</hi> and <hi>Teſmond</hi> Jeſuits, came from <hi>Validolid</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Gunpowder-Treaſon with the Poplſh party here in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Gentlemen, after this Treaſon, ſo miraculouſly diſcovered, was puniſhed, one would not have thought that any future age would have been guilty of the like Conſpiracy; but it ſo falls out, that the Myſtery of Iniquity and Jeſuitism ſtill worketh, for there hath of late been a ſort of cruel bloody minded perſons, who, in hopes to have better ſucceſs than they had in fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>mer times, during the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> have ſet on foot as horrid a Deſign as that of the Gunpowder-Treaſon; I can reſemble it to no other Plot, or Deſign, or Treaſon in any other time, and truely it does reſemble that, in many particulars: I may ſay, it doth at leaſt equal it, if not exceed it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall mention two or three particulars, in which this Plot doth reſemble that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100180:5"/>Firſt, that horrid Deſign was to take away the Life of the then King, to ſubvert the Government, to introduce the Popiſh Religion, and to deſtroy the eſtabliſhed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo Gentlemen, we think our prooff will make it out, that in each of theſe particulars this deſign is the ſame that that was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the great Actors in that deſign were Preiſts and Jeſuits that came from <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> and other places beyond the Seas. And the great Actors in this Plot are Prieſts and Jeſuits, that are come from <hi>St. Omers,</hi> and other places beyond the Seas nearer home then <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That plott was chiefly Guided and mannaged by <hi>Henry Garnett,</hi> Superiour and provincial of the Jeſuits then in <hi>England;</hi> and the great Actor in this deſign, is Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> Superiour and provincial of the Jeſuits now in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that I ſay in the ſeveral particulars it does reſemble the Gun Powder plot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> In this plot of which the Priſoners now ſtand Indicted ſeveral Perſons have ſeveral parts, ſome of theſe perſons are imployed to keep Correſpondence beyond the Seas, (of which more hath been ſaid in another place, and ſo I ſhall not ſpeak of it here Others were to procure and prepare Aid and Aſſiſtance here in <hi>England,</hi> who were to be ready when there ſhould be Occaſion to uſe it. But the great part theſe perſons (the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoners at the Bar,) were to Act in this conſpiracy, was, to take away the life of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Lord the King, on whoſe preſervation the ſafety and welfare of three nations (and Millions of men) does depend. Now the facts for which the five priſoners ſtand Indicted, I ſhall open thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> they are here Indicted for <hi>Conſpireing the Death of his ſacred Majeſty:</hi> They did agree to take away the Kings life, and entring into ſuch an agreement; They hired ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt them to doe it; and this Agreement was made the 24th. of <hi>April,</hi> laſt, 1678.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is another fact they likewiſe ſtand Indicted for: That they did <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and contrive to change and alter the Religion Eſtabliſhed in the Nation, and introduce P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in tho room of it.</hi> The manner how to Effect this, was thus, if my information be right; you ſhall hear that from the Evidence, Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> being reſident here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſuperiour of the Jeſuits, did in <hi>February</hi> laſt think fit, (being impowred by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from <hi>Rome</hi>) to give ſummons to the Jeſuits abroade, at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and other places beyond the Seas, That they ſhould come over here into <hi>England,</hi> to be ready at <hi>London,</hi> on the 24th. of <hi>April,</hi> the day laid in the Indictment and which is the day after St. <hi>Georges</hi> day; and their deſign was (as will appear by the proof) to contrive how they may <hi>take away the life of the</hi> King: for, if that were once done, they thought, in all other things, their deſign would eaſily be accompliſhed, after the ſummons were out, they were ſo Officious for the Accompliſhing of this great end, that between 40. and 50. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits did appear here at <hi>London</hi> at the time, (for thither they were ſummoned) and there the meeting was appointed to be at the <hi>White-horſe Taverne</hi> in the <hi>ſtrand</hi> they were to meet firſt; but being ſo great a number, that they were likely to be taken notice of, if they came all together, it was ſo Ordered, they ſhould come but a few at a time, and go off in ſmall numbers; and others ſhould ſucceed them, till the whole number had been there. And there were directions given, and a Courſe taken, that there ſhould be ſome perſon, to tell them whither they ſhould go from thence. After they had met there at ſeveral times in the ſame day, they were appointed, and adjourned to be at ſeveral other places, ſome of them were appointed to be at Mr. <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Lodging, and that was in <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> at one Mr. <hi>Sanders</hi> houſe: Others were appointed, to go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>When they came there, they all agreed to the general deſign of the firſt meeting, which was, <hi>To kill the King.</hi> Then there was a paper; or ſome inſtrument to be ſubſcribed.

Thouſand Maſſes ſaid for his Soul: Mr. <hi>Whitebread, Mr. Ireland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> (were all privy to this deſign, &amp; this was the 24th. of <hi>April.</hi> In <hi>Auguſt</hi> after) they being appointed to <hi>kill the King,</hi> but it not taking effect, either their Hearts miſgave them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they wanted opportunity) there was another meeting at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> where the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will tell you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>our <hi>Iriſh</hi> perſons were hired for to <hi>Kill the King.</hi> And this was ordered, in caſe the other deſign took not Effect. There was fourſcore pounds ſent down to them to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where they were to have done the fact. After this, other perſons were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to do the Execution, and they were to take the <hi>King</hi> at his Mornning Walk a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Theſe perſons are all diſappointed in their deſign: But you ſhall hear what was the Agreement, how it was carried on, and what rewards were given to carry it on. We ſhal acquaint you likewiſe, that for the bottom of this deſign (when ſo many Jeſuits ſhould come over, when they ſhould have ſo many Conſultations, and when they ſhould reſolve to <hi>Kill the King</hi>) there could be no leſs then the altering of Religion, and introduction of Popery here in <hi>England.</hi> And that time, at the firſt meeting, they had Ordered, that Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> a Jeſuit as their Procurator and Agent, ſhould go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to Act their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern there. All which things and more, will be made out to you by Witneſses produced. There are likewiſe, ſome other Circumſtances that will be material to confirm thoſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. We ſhall produce to you a letter written in <hi>February</hi> laſt, about that time that Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> ſent over his ſummons for the Jeſuits to appear here. This letter was written by one Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> a Jeſuit now in Cuſtody; and tis Written to one <hi>Tunſtall</hi> a Jeſuit, to give him notice, that he ſhould be in <hi>London</hi> about the 21th. of <hi>April.,</hi> and be ready on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Mr, <hi>Finch</hi> opened the Evidence thus.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Finch,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lord ſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, before we call our witneſſes, I would beg leave once more to remind you, of what hath already been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd unto you, the Quality of the Offenders themſelves and the nature of the offence they ſtand indicted of.</p>
               <p>For the Offenders, they are moſt of them, Prieſts and Jeſuits; three of them at the leaſt, are ſo; the other two, are the accurſed Inſtruments of this Deſign: for the offence it ſelf, 'tis high Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And though it be High Treaſon by the Statute of 27, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for men of that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come into <hi>England,</hi> yet theſe men are not Indicted upon that Law, nor for that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100180:6"/>
Treaſon: This I take notice of to you for the priſoners ſake, that they ſhould not fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to themſelves they ſuffered <hi>Martyrdom</hi> for their <hi>Religion,</hi> as ſome of them have vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagin'd in their caſe; and for your ſakes too, that as at firſt, it was Treaſon, repeated Acts of Treaſon, in theſe men; and thoſe proceeding from a principle of Religion too, that juſtly occaſioned the making that Law: ſo here you might obſerve a pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it in the priſoners at the Bar, That when ever they had an opportunity, as now they thought they had, they have never failed to put thoſe principles into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>So now, Gentlemen, as they are not indicted for being <hi>Prieſts,</hi> I muſt deſire you to lay that quite out of the Caſe, and only conſider that they ſtand here accuſed for Treaſon; ſuch Treaſon, as, were they Lay-men only, they ought to die for it; though I cannot but obſerve, they were the ſooner Traitors for being Prieſts.</p>
               <p>The Treaſon therefore they ſtand indicted of, is of the higheſt nature: it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy <hi>to kill the King,</hi> and that too with Circumſtances ſo aggravating (if any thing can aggravate that Offence which is the higheſt) that nothing leſs than the total Subverſion of the Government, and utter Deſtruction of the Proteſtant Religion, would ſerve their turns. And really, when you conſider the Root from whence this Treaſon ſprings, you will ceaſe wondring that all this ſhould be attempted, and rather wonder that it was not done.</p>
               <p>Miſchiefs have often miſcarried for want of wickedneſs enough; the Horror of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or elſe, the Malice of the Aggreſſor not being equal to the Attempt, has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prevented the Execution of it. Here is no room for any thing of this kind: This Treaſon proceeds from principles of <hi>Religion,</hi> from a ſenſe that it is lawful; nay, that they ought to do theſe things; and every neglect here, is lookt on as a piece of Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, a want of zeal; for which one of the Priſoners did pennance, as in the courſe of our Evidence we ſhall prove unto you.</p>
               <p>And when we conſider too, that this is carried on, not by the Fury of two or three buſie men over zealous in the Cauſe, but by the deliberate, and ſteady Councels of the whole Order, and that too under the Obligations of Secreſie as high as Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can lay on them; you have great reaſon to wonder that it did not ſucceed. And yet after all this they have not been able to prevail. Not that we can brag of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man policy that did prevent it; No, all that the Wit of man could do, theſe men had done: but 'twas the Providence of God, 'twas his Revelation; That Providence that firſt enlightened his Church, and has preſerv'd it againſt all oppoſition heretofore, has once more diſappointed their Councells, and preſerved the King and this Nation in the profeſſion of that true Religion theſe men have vainly attempted to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will not open to you the particulars of our Evidence, that I had rather ſhould come from the Witneſſes themſelves; I ſhall only in general tell you what will be the Courſe of it. We ſhall prove unto you, That there was a Summons for a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be held by theſe men the 24th of <hi>April</hi> laſt, from the Provincial Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread;</hi> That they had a Caution given them not to come too ſoon, nor appear much about the Town, till the Conſultation were over, leſt oacaſion ſhould be given to <hi>ſuſpect the Deſign:</hi> That accordingly a Conſultation was held, as they ſay, to ſend <hi>Cary,</hi> their Procurator to <hi>Rome;</hi> Though we ſhall prove to you, it was for other purpoſes: That they adjourned from their general Aſſembly into leſſer Companies, where ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did attend them to carry Intelligences of their ſeveral Reſolutions: That at theſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100180:7"/>
ſeveral Conſults, they did reſolve, The King was to be killed; that <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould do it; for which the one was to have 30000 Maſſes ſaid for his Soul: the other 1500 <hi>l.</hi> That in proſecution of this Deſign, they made ſeveral attempts to execute it, That they lay in wait for the King ſeveral times in St. <hi>James's Park</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; And that once in particular, it had been done by <hi>Pickering;</hi> if it had not pleaſed God to have prevented it by an Accident unforeſeen; The Flint of his Piſtol being looſe, he durſt not then attempt it, though he had an Opportunity; for which neglect, we ſhall prove unto you, he underwent the pennance of 20 or 30 ſtrokes. That when theſe men had failed, we ſhall prove to you they hired four Ruffians to murther the King at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and after that at <hi>Newmarket.</hi> Thus they way-laid him in all his priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and retirements, wherever they could think it moſt convenient to execute their Deſign.</p>
               <p>And this we ſhall prove by two Witneſſes; who, though they ſhould not ſpeak to the ſame Conſultations, nor the ſame times, yet they are ſtill two Witneſſes in Law: for ſeveral Witneſſes of ſeveral Overt-Acts, are ſo many Witneſſes to the Treaſon; becauſe the Treaſon conſiſts in the Intention of the man, in the Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King. The ſeveral Overt-Acts which declare that intention, are but as ſo many Evidences of the Treaſon; we will call our Witneſſes, and make out what had been open'd to you.</p>

My Lord, in the month of <hi>January,</hi> this Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> did ſend ſeveral Letters to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> in which Letters there was contained Intimation of his Intent to proceed againſt the Kings Perſon to aſſaſſinate Him, which Letters were written to <hi>Richard Asby.</hi> My Lord, in the month of <hi>February,</hi> there comes an Order from him, as Provincial, for ſeveral of the Jeſuits to make their appearance at <hi>London,</hi> to be there at a Conſult to be held the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> Old ſtile.</p>

               <p>He was then in <hi>London,</hi> My Lord, as I ſuppoſe by the dateing of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

My Lord, upon the four and twentieth of <hi>April</hi> Old ſtile we did appear in the Conſult. The Conſult was begun at the <hi>White horſe-Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and there they met in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100180:7"/>
ſeveral Rooms, they came on by degrees, and as the new ones came on, the old ones, thoſe that had been there before them, fell off. And there was one <hi>John Cary</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go Procurator for <hi>Rome,</hi> and he was ſo appointed by the ſuffrages of the three Priſoners at the Bar, <hi>Whitebread, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Fenwick.</hi> It was afterwards adjourned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Colloquies or little meetings; one meeting was at Mrs. <hi>Sanders</hi> houſe that butts upon <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> a ſecond was at <hi>M. Ireland</hi>'s, a third was at <hi>Mr. Harcourt</hi>'s, a fourth was at Mr. <hi>Grove</hi>'s, and other meeting or meetings there were, but I cannot give a good accompt of them. My Lord, after they had thus met, and debated the ſtate of Religion, and the life of the King, they drew up this Reſolve; it was drawn up by one <hi>Mico,</hi> who was Secretary to the Society, and <hi>Socius</hi> or Companion to the Provincial.</p>

My Lord, after this Reſolution was ſigned by <hi>Whitbread,</hi> it was ſigned by <hi>Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by all the four Clubs; I ſaw them ſign it, for I carried the Inſtrument from one to another.</p>

               <p>My Lord, with Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> and ſome other perſons, we came to <hi>London</hi> in a Coach, and ſix miles (as near as I remember it) on this ſide <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at a place called <hi>Bolton,</hi> our Coach was ſtopt by the ſearchers, and there they did examine a Box that was in the Coach, directed for the honourable <hi>Richard Blundel</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> this Box when they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, they found full of Beads, Crucifixes, Images, and other ſorts of Trompery, that I cannot give a good account of; it's he can give the beſt: <hi>Mr. Fenwick</hi> went by the name of one <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and did perſonate one <hi>Thompſon,</hi> as Living near the <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

We came that night to <hi>Sittenburgh,</hi> and lay there on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 26th. new ſtile, as near as I remember; and I think we ſtaid there till the afternoon, We took Coach in the afternoon and came as far as <hi>Dartford.</hi> On <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning we came into <hi>London;</hi> and (my Lord) when we came into <hi>London;</hi> and had continued there ſome dayes.

And the letters were to give an account of the conſultation held in the Gallery at <hi>Sommerſet-houſe:</hi> all tending to the deſtruction of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and killing the King, but I doe not think fit to declare here who were the perſons that were preſent at that conſultation. At <hi>Cambray</hi> they were very joyful that there was ſo good a proceeding in <hi>England.</hi> At <hi>Paris</hi> when the letters were ſhewed, there was a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written in a language which I did not underſtand, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I was told in that letter, they were charged in <hi>Paris</hi> by my Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> that they did not proceed according to their promiſe to them in <hi>England;</hi> But ſaid <hi>Mr. Stapleton</hi> to me, my Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> nor the ſociety in <hi>England</hi> need not to write thus to us, for We are not ſo backward but we can lend men, and money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Armes too, and will upon occaſion. From thence they ſent me to <hi>Spain</hi> with a letter to an Iriſh Father: I did overtake him at <hi>Sa Mora.</hi> From thence I went with another letter to the Rector of a Colledge of Iriſh Jeſuits in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> by their contrivance I was ſent to St. <hi>Jago</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where was another Colledge of Iriſh Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits: There I ſtaid till I had an anſwer to Sir <hi>Willi: Godolphin,</hi> and when I had the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that Letter, <hi>I</hi> went for the letter from the Rector at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> the Jeſuits there told me, they would take care to ſend their own anſwer another way.

Now they do not write in this Letter that they intended to kill the King; but they write to caution them to keep the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign undiſcovered, and by that you may gueſs what they mean.</p>
               <p>What is ſaid to all this by the Priſoners, but Denya's? <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot deny but that he knew Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and had been in his company ſometimes; Five times by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath proved, ſo that they were acquaintance; and it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was a Familiarity between them. <hi>Ireland</hi> objects that <hi>Bedlow</hi> charges him in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when he was out of Town all that time, and that therefore the Teſtimony of one of the Witneſſes cannot be true. And to prove this he calls his Mother, his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and Sir <hi>John Southcot</hi>'s man, and Mr. <hi>Gifford.</hi> His mother and ſiſter ſay expreſly, that he went out of Town the third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the Servant ſays, that he ſaw him at St <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> the fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and continued in his company to the ſixteenth; (ſo that, as to that there is a Teſtimony bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
