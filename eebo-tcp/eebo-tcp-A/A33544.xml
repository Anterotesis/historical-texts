            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is not usual to send single <hi>Sermons</hi> abroad; without the Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a publick Command; nor is it customary to preach at a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which was the Occasion of the following <hi>Sermon.</hi> But as ther<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

been formerly done, and still our Liturgy supposes that it may and will be
done: For the Exhortation after Marriage, is appointed to be used only in
case there should be no Sermon on the Subject.</p>
            <p>Having obtain'd from the most Venerable <hi>Burgomasters</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
amongst other <hi>Privileges,</hi> that of Marrying according to the Manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by our Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I judged my self obliged to preach on the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of doing so. Here is the Discourse I then had, and I yield to the desire
of publishing it, for the same Reasons I first preach'd it; that I may give
my small help towards retrieving the Honour of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which has been
so often burlesqu'd, and run down by the Licenciousness of the <hi>Stage.</hi> The
Impious Railleries and profane Witticisms which have been uttered about
this matter, are regarded as Maxims of undoubted Truth; those are laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at who make <hi>Marriage</hi> their Choice, as they are pity'd who are under
any necessity of engaging into it.</p>
            <p>This Mockery and Contempt of <hi>Marriage,</hi> as it is most prejudicial to the
Civil State; so it has contributed very much to the growth of <hi>Atheism:</hi>
for it has encouraged those unlawful Liberties, which are taken both in
and without Wedlock, which cannot be defended otherwise than by denying
a <hi>God,</hi> or the Authority of Sacred <hi>Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> When Men are byasi'd, weak
Arguments prevail, and any thing is readily received which flatters their
Lusts and vicious Inclinations. Debauchees think it their Interest that
there be no <hi>God,</hi> that Religion be discarded, and so are easily drawn to
deny and disown them. And for this cause it is necessary, as to maintain
the Foundation of Religion, so to vindicate its holy Institutions from the
blasphemous Aspersions cast upon them; which beget a Prejudice both against
them and all Religion in general. I have not that Opinion of my-self, or
of my performances, as to think that they alone can stop the Mouths of Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers:
I only desire to shew my Good-will, and offer my Endeavours. It
is not absolutely necessary that all of an Army be Heroes, a Victory may be,
and is often forwarded by many who cannot pretend to that Character. I
have not said all that might; but what is said, is certain and evident:
Yet I should not be surpris'd if the Truth of it be not admitted; nay, if
many entertain our Attempt with Scorn. The Corruption of this Age is
too deeply rooted, to be plucked up at the very first: But, <hi>Whether they
will hear, or whether they forbear, they should know, that there have
have been Prophets among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <bibl>HEBREWS xiii. 4.</bibl>
               <q>Marriage is Honourable in all.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MARRIAGE being Common and Ordinary, a
Discourse about it may be thought needless, and
to some unpleasing; but I do judge it neither
needless nor improper. For it fares with Marriage
as with most things common and ordinary, that tho' in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very valuable, yet they are but little regarded; so
that the Generality are not sensible of the Good of them,
nor yet suitably thankful for the Benefit of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall lay hold on the present Occasion to discourse of
this Subject, which however common and ordinary, I believe
not well understood; the Dignity and Importance of which
are set forth in the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> I have now read.</p>
            <p>In the Original, it is only <hi>Marriage honourable in, with or
among all:</hi> so that something must be supply'd to make the
Sense clear and perfect, wherefore some render it by way of
an Affirmative Proposition, as in our Translation, whereby
the Dignity of Marriage is asserted; others turn it into a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
requiring all to hold Matrimony honourable, as if it
should be, <hi>Let Marriage be honourable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not material whether it be taken the one or the other
way; for if it be a Duty to hold Marriage honourable, then
it is so, because it is in it self honourable; and if marriage
be by Nature, or by Virtue of its Ends and Uses honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then it is the Duty of all to honour it, and to have it in
great Esteem: So whether the Text be an Affirmative Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
or a Precept, it establisheth the Dignity and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of Marriage; for whatever is or should be esteem'd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
must be suppos'd excellent in its Nature, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
in its Effects and Consequences. In handling this
matter, I shall do Two Things: <hi>First,</hi> I shall give some
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46572:3"/>
Reasons why Marriage should be had in great Honour and
Esteem. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall shew what is incumbent on those
who enter into this state of Life, that they may reap the Good,
Benefit, and Comfort of it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> Of the Reasons why Marriage should be had in
great Honour and Esteem. To mention all, and to enlarge
upon them, would take up too much time; therefore I shall
only name some. And first, Marriage should be held ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
because it is an ancient and universal Custom. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
is venerable, and it is both just and usual, to regard
with Veneration those Things that are of long standing. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Time doth not change the Nature of Things, nor can
it make that which is evil ever to be good; but both good
and innocent Things are deservedly more respected, as they
are the older: Now marriage is as ancient as any thing can
be. 'Twas from the beginning, and commenc'd with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
it self. If the Calculation of some may be believ'd,
Man was married on the very day he was made, and when
he was but some few hours old: And what was so early be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
has ever since continued. Whithersoever Men Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
themselves, they carried the Custom; so that there
never was any Nation or People which did not observe it.
The most Barbarous do not live like Beasts promiscuously;
and even where unlawful Liberties were common and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet Marriage was preferr'd, and accounted honourable.
Where-ever Knowledge, Policy and good Government took
place, and were cultivated, Marriage was distinguish'd with
particular marks of Honour. Among the <hi>Romans;</hi> married
Persons had divers Privileges above others, until the days of
<hi>Constantine,</hi> who abolish'd those Laws, to gratifie some who
betook themselves to a Celibate State, from a mistaken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which then prevail'd, that it was more proper for the
Exercise of Religion, which was the Beginning of that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and Apostacy, foretold by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 1.
The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> held marriage so proper and necessary,
and them who despis'd it so unreasonable and dangerous, that
they appointed a Fine both for them who married not at all,
and for them who were late or long a marrying. How ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46572:3"/>
Marriage was, is evident from the Solemnities eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where used at the entring into it; for this was and is a
publick Declaration that it was an honourable State, and that
they were worthy of Honour who enter'd into it. Hence
came the Saying, That every one had Three Days of chief
Honour; the Day of one's Birth, the Day of Marriage, and
the Day of Death or Burying.</p>
            <p>2. But, <hi>Secondly:</hi> Christians have a better Precedent for
honouring Marriage, than the Example of Men and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
We have the Example of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Eternal Son of
God, whose Example outweighs the Authority and Practice
of all others in the World. Indeed he Himself did not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor could He, because a marriage with any single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
on Earth could not suit with his Dignity, nor the end
of his Coming to the World: But he would be born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
join'd in lawful Wedlock; and He gave the first Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of his Glory at a marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where
he turned Water into Wine; not for the simple Ostentation
of his own Power, but also to contribute to that innocent
Joy, which was suitable to that Occasion. This He would
not have done, if marriage was either unlawful or trivial, and
not worthy of all Honour. And as his shewing Himself thus
first at a Marriage, was not Accidental or Occasional, but
Choice; so he chose to do it, that he might set forth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourableness
of this State; foreseeing that some false Spirits
would arise to discredit and disparage marriage: And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whoever speak against it, whoever represent it as unlawful,
or as mean and unbecoming a good or wise Man, or the aim
or study of Perfection; I say, whoever do so, do thereby shew
that they are not of God. For,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> Marriage is a Divine Institution. God is the
Author of it. 'Twas no Invention of Man; nor were they
led into it by Policy, Necessity or Experience, as into many
other common Customs, but God himself from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
did ordain it. He at the first made Man male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
and joined them together, that <hi>the two might become
one Fl<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh,</hi> for an Example to others that should follow. He
commanded and ordained them to multiply and bring forth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46572:4"/>
their Kind; but only in the State of Wedlock, and by the
Imitation of that Example which he had set them in the first
Man and Woman. If therefore all Divine Ordinances and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
should be honoured for God's sake, so should mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
nor can any speak dishonourably of it, without blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
God, and reflecting on either his Authority or Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Fourthly:</hi> The time when marriage was instituted, adds
to the Honour of it. This was before the Fall, in the State
of Innocence, while Man was in his Uprightness, as he came
from the Hands of God; which proves Marriage to be suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the greatest Perfection and Purity of this present
Life. It came not as a Remedy to After-Corruption; 'twas
not prescribed to avoid greater Inconveniencies, but the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God saw it agreeable to a Paradise, to the purest and
most perfect Condition of humane Life: Therefore they talk
falsly who make this State inconsistent with Religion; and
they are weak and ignorant Persons, who pretend that it is
a clog or hindrance to their Virtue and Devotion; yea, even
to the Perfection of them. Indeed we read of some, who
when they were called to the Divine Feast, excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
because they were married: <hi>I have married a Wife, and
cannot come;</hi> but this was only a Pretext to cover their Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Unwillingness, for if they had valued the mercy of
the Call, and been willing to embrace it, their marriage need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to have hindred them, they would have come and
brought their Wives with them. Turn over the History of
all the Celibates from the beginning, can any be shewed
more just and upright than <hi>Noah,</hi> more constant in his Faith
and Obedience than <hi>Abraham,</hi> more holy and devout than
<hi>Job?</hi> and yet they, as all the other Scripture Worthies, were
married, and some of them but very indifferently too. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there are Temptations and Incumbrances in a married
State, and so there are in a single Life. God may be served
in the one as well as the other; and who excuse themselves on
the account of either, do but declare that they have not a real
mind to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:46572:4"/>Finally, Marriage ought to be held most honourable, for
the important End of it, and the good Effects which were
intended by it, and which will follow those who seek and
study them aright. When God had finished the Creation,
He viewed all his Works, and saw them all very good: Now
Woman was included in these Works, therefore she also was
found good, and consequently marriage is very good and
useful; for the Woman was created for that end. As all
God's Works are good, so are all his Ordinances and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and particularly this of Marriage.
Therefore,<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 22.</note> saith <hi>Solomon, Whosever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Wife, findeth a good thing, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
favour of the Lord;</hi> meaning, as he explains himself
in other places, a prudent, virtuous Wife; one that deserves
that Honour, and answers the Character suitable to it. God
by ordaining marriage, intended the Good both of private
Persons and the Publick; because it was most agreeable to our
Nature, and did naturally tend to further the Happiness of all
in this present Life. Indeed marriage is a Yoke, which once
taken on, cannot be put off till Death; or that which is
worse than Death, I mean the heinous Sin and Guilt of one
or other of the Parties: but it is a profitable Yoke, and it
may be made easie too, if Persons have the Understanding to
use it aright.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>First,</hi> Marriage bringeth great Advantage to private
Persons, by securing them of a constant, intimate and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Friend. Society and Friendship are the Life of Life.
Nothing is more agreeable to our Nature, nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable.
It is as natural for Man to crave them, as for the
Sparks to fly upward. Hence <hi>Aristotle</hi> observed, that what
delighted in solitariness, must be either above or below a
Man; that is, either a God or a Beast: A God, because Self-sufficient;
or a Beast, without Sense or Understanding, and
so unable to communicate it self, as insensible of the Benefit of
mutual Communication: But as most Beasts, except the Savage
Kind, even love to herd together; so if this Philsopher had had
that Light of Revelation which we are bless'd with, he would
have found that the Godhead is not solitary, though Unity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46572:5"/>
be one of its Essential Attributes. Our Religion shews us
Three Persons in the Godhead, which are one in Nature, and
intimately united both in their Counsels and in the Execution
of them, which makes the Felicity of the Godhead equal to the
Perfection of its Nature, both of them Incomprehensible and
Infinite. The more Noble any Being is, the more it affects
Society and Fellowship. Because God is infinitely good, He
created other Beings to partake of Himself, and by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
to declare his Glory. Man was made after the Image
of God, and consequently it must be natural to Man to seek
the Fellowship of others that are after his own likeness.
When God made Man an consider'd him, He saw 'twas not
good for him to be alone, and for that cause proceeded to make
Woman, to be a Help meet for Man. The Dominion of the
World and over all Creatures, would not have given unto
Man full Satisfaction, if he had been left alone without such
a Companion. Let outward Circumstances be never so good,
there is but half Contentment without a Friend and Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
'Tis true, there is and may be a dear, a sweet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Friendship between one Man and another, but the
Pleasure and Benefit of such a Friendship cannot be always
enjoy'd. Duty and Interest often separate them, whereas
marriage, by these very Ties of Duty and Interest, makes one
sure of a faithful, loving and inseparable Friend at all Times,
and in all Circumstances, whether better or worse. A Man
must leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife, and
so must the Wife do to her Husband. Besides, God has so
framed the Nature of Woman, and given her such particular
Endowments, as render her Conversation more grateful and
agreeable. The Friendship of a Man may chance to be
more instructive, and may sometimes have the preference for
Counsel and Advice; but a good Woman has more Charms
to divert the Fancy, to ease the Spirit, and to alleviate the
Mind. It is a true and notable Saying of the Son of <hi>Syrach,
Eccles.</hi> xl. 23. <hi>A Friend and Companion never meet amiss;
but above both is a Wife with her Husband.</hi> The Sweetness
and Delicacy of her Temper is proper to file off that Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is ready to grow upon the Nature of Man.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46572:5"/>
Therefore commonly single Persons are more morose and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and less conversible, than those who are well married
especially if naturally peevish and melancholly; for these
grow upon Men by the lonesomness of a single Life. Indeed
an ill Woman frets the Spirit and crushes the Mind; but an
excellent Wife is to her Husband as <hi>David</hi>'s Harp to <hi>Saul,</hi> she
charms away the evil Spirit of Melancholy, which is apt
to seize men by the Vexation of Business, the Incumbrances of
Affairs, and the Impertinencies of the World.</p>
            <p>Again: Marriage is of great Advantage to private Persons,
because of the mutual help which they give to each other:
God did not intend that the Woman should be a Clog, or
Burden, or Incumbrance to a Man; He did not ordain her
to live idlely or sumptuously on the Sweat of his Face; but he
made her to be a Help unto him; that is, to be both a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
and Assistant, to partake of his Labours, to bear half
of his Burden, as well as to share of his Happiness. He that
has a prudent Wife, has double the Hands, the Eyes, the
Ears and the Feet of a single Person. He can be at Home and
Abroad at once; She can manage the Affairs of the House,
while he is transacting Business Abroad; and so is in a better
way of Thriving, of promoting the end of Life, and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for the Necessities and Comforts of it. Some may
think that all this may be as well done by Servants; but a
little Reflection on Experience shew it a mistake, for though
great Wages may make a Servant faithful, they cannot give
that Concernment which a Wife hath. Wherefore the wise
Author I last quoted, saith, <q>Blessed is the Man that hath a
virtuous Wife, for the number of his Days shall bedouble. A
virtuous Woman rejoyceth her Husband, and he shall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the Years of his Life in peace. A good Wife is a good
portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that
fear the Lord. The Grace of a Wife delighteth her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and her Discretion will fat his Bones. A silent and
loving Woman is a gift of the Lord, and there is nothing
so much worth to a mind well instructed. A modest and
faithful Woman is a double Grace, and her continent mind
cannot be valued. As the Sun when it riseth in the high
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46572:6"/>
Heaven, so is the Beauty of a Wife in the ordering of her
House. <hi>Again he saith,</hi> The Beauty of a Woman chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Countenance, and a Man loveth nothing better; if
there be kindness, meekness and comfort in her Tongue,
then is not her Husband like other Men. He that getteth
a Wife, beginneth a possession, a help like unto himself,
and a pillar of Rest.</q> 
               <hi>Eccles.</hi> xxvi. and xxxvii.</p>
            <p>Thus private Persons have great Advantage by marriage.
In the next place, the Publick receiveth no less Profit by it.
For by this means Children are multiplied, and the People
increased; which is the Strength, Security and Glory of a
State. Unlawful Liberties without Wedlock, add little to
the Increase of People; nor even in those Countries where
pluralities of Wives are allowed, is it common and usual to
have so many Children, as with us by one Man and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
So marriage, according to its first Institution is more
for the multiplication of Mankind, than any other way.</p>
            <p>And as it tendeth to the Increase of People, which is for
the good of the Publick, so it is the best Security of a good
Education to them that are born, which is no less for the
publick Good. If Children were not taken care of, they
could not live to be Men; and if they were not well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
and train'd up to some Art or Profession, they would
be of little use when grown up; both which would be
very much neglected, if Children were not born as now
in lawful Wedlock. Women perhaps might have some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Fruit of their Womb, but Men would take little
thought of those, whom they knew not whether they were
their own. But as it is now, Parents love their Children, and
lay themselves out to provide for them, to educate them well,
and to make them happy; all which turneth to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Publick.</p>
            <p>It was very inadvertently said of a<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his Essays.</note> Great Man, That
<hi>Wives and Children were Impediments to great Enterprises of
either Virtue or Mischief, and that the best Works, and of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46572:6"/>
greatest Merit to the Publick, were perform'd by unmarried
or Childless Men:</hi> For the very contrary may be proved
from History. And who can be thought more concerned
for the Publick, than they who are to leave with it their Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and the Pledges of their Affection? Commonly single
Persons look no further than their own Times, but those who
are married, extend their Thoughts and Care to Posterity.
Nor are they who are married and have Children, more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to Bribery, and perverting of publick Justice; for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
may be worse than a Wife, and do often abuse the Master's
Ear more. Nor are Wife and Children a hindrance to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Works; which is one pretended Reason why marriage
is forbidden the Clergy in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
and Selfishness prevail among them that are not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
as much as with those that are. There are as many of
the one as of the other, stingy, narrow-soul'd, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
both to themselves and others, neither given to
good Works. Indeed, those that have no Children should
give more as they are more able; but those that have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
have yet a greater Obligation to be Charitable, even
that they may secure a Blessing to their Children, which may
and will be more steadable, than a visible Inheritance, which
often slippeth away: For, saith <hi>David, I have been young
and now am old, yet have I not seen the Righteous,</hi> that is,
the merciful Man, <hi>forsaken, not his Seed begging Bread; he
is ever merciful and lendeth, and his Seed is blessed,</hi> Psal.
xxxvii. 25. Thus you see, that there are a great many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
why marriage should be honourable among all, as is
asserted or injoin'd in the Text. I proceed to</p>
            <p>II. The other Thing proposed; which is to shew, What
is Incumbent on those who enter a married State, to the end
that they may reap the Good, Benefit and Comfort of it.</p>
            <p>This is important and necessary, but very little consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that is the reason why those Advantages of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
are not so common. Marriage is not a <hi>Physical</hi> but a
<hi>Moral</hi> Cause of them, they follow not joining of Hands ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
as the Fire burneth; or as Meat nourisheth, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46572:7"/>
happens whether we think of them or not: But how good
soever a married State be, the Benefit and Comfort of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the wise Behaviour of those who enter into it. If
they remember their Obligation, and study their Duty, they
shall be happy; but otherwise, both Shame and Misery will
attend them. There are indeed many unhappy Marriages in
the World; there are very many rendred miserable by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this State of Life, but it is their own Fault, because
they engag'd unadvisedly, nor mind what such Engagements
require of them. They run into this state for some present
Satisfaction or Advantage; and having got that, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
uneasie with the perpetual Tie. They do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Necessity of yielding to one another; but as before,
they continue altogether Selfish and Humoursom, craving to
be pleased, but are at no pains to please those they are join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with. Such were mad to marry; and by marrying, they
have entail'd both Guilt and Misery on themselves for Life.
The Man or Woman that marries, must resolve to deny
themselves, to put off at least something of their own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and to put on a ready Complaisance with others;
otherwise they can never be happy: They must resolve by
all means to seek to please and gratifie, tho with some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
on their personal Inclinations and Constitutions. Nor
on this Account should marriage be reckon'd a Slavery; for
this is no more than what common Conversation, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
into any Society oblige one to: He should be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all Company, and excluded all Society, that requires
every body to humour and yield to him, without suitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns;
they do not understand either Honour, Liberty, or
reasonable Satisfaction, who are uneasie with the Obligation
of pleasing and gratifying others. Certainly a Noble Soul
and a generous Mind, will take more delight in the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Opportunities of doing a Pleasure to others, than in
the Services paid to themselves. Man and Wife may reason
together, but should never scold and rail, nor use contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Speeches. Persons have often occasion of being angry
with themselves, and so there may happen just Occasions for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46572:7"/>
both Man and Wife their shewing some displeasure with each
other; but it can never be just to do it, to the breach of Peace
and Love. They must not divide and quarrel, however
they may reason, except in cases where true Honour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Religion, and the Cause of God do interpose. God
must be pleased above all, He must be preferr'd to Husband
or Wife; but if nothing be requir'd which displeaseth God,
any thing should be done, rather than suffer a Breach; for
better any Inconvenience than that. Husband and Wife
should endeavour all that is possible to make one another easie,
by mutual pleasing: This is both their Duty and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
for it is one end of the Institution. They are neither
wise nor virtuous, who contend and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar for small and trivial
Things, and commonly the Ruptures betwixt married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
are only for such Things: For the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
let their Passions master their Reason, and are so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
fond of their Humours, as for them to quit their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
There is a most remarkable Instance of this in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Peru;</hi> which shews the extravagancy and mischief of
Humour and Passion, when not curbed. There was one
by the misfortune of Shipwreck cast upon a barren desolate
Rock, where there was neither Man nor Beast, nor shelter
against Wind or Weather: In this miserable place he lived
two Years; and then Providence sent thither in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
another. The Comfort of a Companion was certainly
most valuable, and the only mitigation of that miserable
Condition. If they had united heartily, there might be some
abatement of it; but they soon quarrel'd for some small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and their Difference grew to that height, that they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and lived at the distance of the Rock from one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
neither, for the space of Seven Years, if I can remember
right, spoke together, or saw one another: So, out of cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Humour, they derpived themselves of the Comfort
and Advantage which Conversation and mutual Concurrence
and Assistance might have given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is a Parallel of that
Man and Woman, who through Providence are tied for Life
by the Bond of marriage, but so little wise for themselves;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46572:8"/>
that rather than forego their peevish and pettish Humours;
they chuse to throw up their Comforts, and to make their
Condition more miserable.</p>
            <p>As the studying to please to the utmost is incumbent on mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Persons, so for this Cause Love is required and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary. It is hard to study to please those who are not
well liked. Where there is Love, there is a forwardness to
please; but if Love be wanting, it is shifted or awkardly
perform'd; therefore they who enter a married State should
be brought into it by Love. Love should be the principal
motive that brings them together; and while they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it should be their Care to cultivate and improve it,
If Love be wanting, they will be a grief and a burden to
each other; but if Love abound, they have all Joy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
Where there is Love, they part with Reluctancy,
and meet with Pleasure; their Hearts burn with Desires when
absent, and if present they live joyfully together, as <hi>Solomon</hi>
injoins. Love will keep the Woman from gadding Abroad,
and 'twill make the Man impatient to come home. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, That <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> concerning our
Neighbour; and so it may be said of the Duties of Marriage.
Love both teaches them, and prompts to the Observance of
them: For all that is injoin'd Husband and Wife, are only
proper Expressions and Declarations of true Love. He that
loveth his Wife, will be far from abusing her, or treating
her roughly; he will honour her himself, and endeavour to
have her honour'd by others: He will deal tenderly by her,
and cherish her to the utmost of his power; he will not deny
her the Satisfactions that are reasonable and in his power,
but will be active and industrious to provide for her. And if
the Man do this, the Woman must be unnatural, if she be
not gained by it. The Wife must love too; and if she love,
nothing injoined will be grievous. Obedience which sounds so
hard and so harsh to self-willed and unthinking Woman, will
not be unpleasant to her that loves: For Love is obsequious
and observant, and is glad of the Occasions and Opportunities
of testifying it. The Obedience of the Wife is indispensible;
<pb facs="tcp:46572:8"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:46572:9"/>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46572:9"/>
but if there be Love, it will not be complain'd of. By exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Obedience, the Wife is not so hardly dealt with; for it is
easier to obey than to command aright, and the Praise of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
may be due, where there is no Honour in Commanding.
It is an express and often repeated Command of God, that the
Woman be obedient, and it becomes her to be so, even where
the Man does not personally deserve it; and then she shews
her regard for God, which is her Praise; and for which she
shall be surely rewarded.</p>
            <p>Finally: To ensure and compleat the Happiness of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
State, both Husband and Wife must with all care mind
Religion, and keep up the Fear of God between them. This
is the surest way to prevent Miscarriages; to secure against
all Ruptures, and to engage to the right and serious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all Things proper and necessary, to promote the
Peace and Happiness of this State. Religion makes all Things
sure; it ties the Knot harder, and makes both willing to bear
the Yoke. If the true Fear of God possess the Heart of
Man and Wife, neither of them shall go astray, nor be liable
to the Rack of Jealousie: No uneasie Suspicions shall disturb
their Breasts. They will not provoke, but cherish one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
They will be studious to please when out of Sight, as
well as in it; and whether absent or present, will be equally
Faithful. Where the true Fear of God is, there will be no
occasion for Exhortations and Persuasions, for each will be
forward to all Duty. If Persons understood it, true Piety
has the greatest Charms, nor do they fade with Age. And
the greatest Contentment may be expected from a Religious
Husband, and a Pious Wife. This is more to be valued,
than all those Things which are now the common Motives
to Marriage. This is better than Houses or Possessions, than
Bags of Money, or Tuns of Gold. <hi>Favour,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, is
deceitful, and Beauty is vain; but a Woman that feareth the
Lord, she shall be praised,</hi> Prov. xxxi. 30. Besides, the Fear of
God bringeth his Blessing, which contributes more to Peace
and Happiness, than all our own Endeavours, or any outward
or visible Means. <hi>Except the Lord build the House, they labour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46572:10"/>
in vain that build it.</hi> And as He buildeth the House, so <hi>He
maketh them that are in it to be of one Mind.</hi> All Blessings are
promised to them that fear the Lord, and particularly those of
a married State, as you may see <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxi. Thus I have
run through the Chief Things incumbent on Man and Wife,
that they may reap the Good and Comfort of a married State.
pray God that all concern'd may remember, consider and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
these Things, which would make the Church Glorious,
the State Prosperous, and increase the Peace of Families:
This would make the present Generation happy, and would
draw down and entail a Blessing on Posterity.</p>
            <p>Now unto God, who is the Author of all Good, the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost, be all Glory, Honour and Praise,
now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
