            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WEE have during this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> fallen upon the debate of the greatest, and most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affaires concerning our owne good and welfaire at home, that ever were agitated, and discussed at one meeting in the house of Commons. And we are at this present, by the gratious invitation of his Royall Ma<hi rend="sup">je.</hi> expressed in his most just <hi>Manifest</hi> read unto us, resolved to take into consideration, the most sublime, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111784:3"/>
most difficult busines of the Christian World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: which hath for the space of above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares last past, drawen all the Kingdomes, and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> into an immediate or mediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement: In which, there have beene twenty pitch't Battles fought, a Million of Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children destroyed by the Sword, by the Flames, by Famine, and by Pestilence; and that sometimes populous and fertile Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> reduced to a most extreame and calumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous desolation. I have in those few spare-houres I could borrow yesterday, from the publike ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the House, recollected some particulars, which may conduce to the clearing of this great cause, being drawn out of the Autographs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or out of our Records at home, or out of the Writings of our very Adversaries, and others abroad. I shall therefore beginne at the Originall it selfe, of the never enough to be lamented losse of the <hi>Prince Palatines</hi> Domino<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and <hi>Electorall</hi> dignity: that so wee may take along with us, in our intended disputes; not onely our affections, but our consciences. It is therefore very manifest, to all that are but meanly verst in the Cabinet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of Christendom; that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted for many yeares last past, as well before, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111784:3"/>
since the furious Warres of <hi>Germany,</hi> by what meanes to ruine the Evangelicall Princes and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie there. Their cheife aime hath beene, so to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Protestant Princes amongst themselves, as they might be made vse of each against other, for the ruine each of other. The first occasion that offered it selfe within our memories, was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of severall competitors to the Dukedomes of <hi>Cleve</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and they sailed but a very little to have executed th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir intended designe upon that occasion. But their hopes failing in it, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves integrally to <hi>Ferd<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nand</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gratz,</hi> a Prince not long since so poore, and of so meane a consideration to adde the waight of but one graine, to the down-ballanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the affaires of Christendome, as his name was scarce heard off.</p>
            <p>They find him a fit subject for them to worke upon, having from his Cradle been bredd up in an extreame hatred of the Protestant par<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, who professed the truth. They resound nothing into the eares of the old Emperour <hi>Matthias,</hi> but his Cousin <hi>Ferdinands</hi> high merits, so as hee passing by his owne naturall brothers, and the head of his house, the <hi>Spanish</hi> King adopts <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Gratz</hi> for his sonne, so to prepare a way to make
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111784:4"/>
him the successor of his Scepter, Crown, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Then were the sacred Dyets of the Empire, the ancient meanes to reconcile differences, and prevent jealousies, as often dissolved abortively as called insincerely. Rumours were spread of practices and designes against the Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Citties. And that those rumours might not vanish in smoake, the Liberties of the great and ancient Citie of <hi>Stratsburgh</hi> were opprest. The Protestant Princes seeing materials and engins on every side, prepared for their ruine; were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to meete at <hi>Heilburn,</hi> and there to conclud an union amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>This gave the <hi>Iesuites</hi> an assured hope, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Germany</hi> speedily miserable by a calamitous Warre; for not onely the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Princes, tooke the opportunitie to settle a Catholike league, as they call'd it amongst themselves: but also, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> like a true <hi>Pseudo-Lutheran,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Protesttant nor Papist, shewes as good an affection to the Catholike league, as the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like union. The old Emperour <hi>Matthias</hi> begins now to act his part, and the <hi>Iesuites</hi> spurre on their ready Scholler <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Gratz,</hi> to ascend the bloody Theator they had so long designed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111784:4"/>
him. Through the old Emperours intercession, abusing the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Protestants credulity, with Sugred flatteries and large promises, he is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Crown of that rich Kingdome; which soone after made way for him unto the Crowne of <hi>Hungary</hi> also. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did now onely want a faire occasion to begin a Warre in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Matthias</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with the Protestant Princes, to dissolve their Vnion; which not taking effect, the Bishop of <hi>Spiers</hi> is encouraged under hand to pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the Prince <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> and to build a strong Fortresse upon his nighbours Territories, pretending hee had right to that plott of ground, upon which the said Fortresse was raised: but an higher providence did not suffer this Sparke to set <hi>Germany</hi> on fire, though it had been kindled at the Prince <hi>Electors</hi> own doore (to affront and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him) for he by an incredible celerity, did cause the said Fortresse to be demolished before the Enemy could sit and furnish it for his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded use, which made him sit still, and studie for a new occasion, which that it might not be long wanting; the Liberties and Priviledges of the Protestants in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> contrarie to their new King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> oath, were temerated; and by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111784:5"/>
that meanes in the Yeare 1619. the greater part of the Estates of that Kingdome were necessitated after mature deliberation to abdicate him, and to elect, <hi>Frederick Prince Elector Palatine</hi> for their King.</p>
            <p>And thus are wee arrived at that sadd period of time, upon which so many fatalities have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, in which we may see evidentlie; that the <hi>Prince Elector Palatine</hi> was not causallie guilty of any part of that Ocean of bloud, that hath beene since spilt in <hi>Germany,</hi> as the Pontifician side pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he was. The Scene was long before prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the enemies of the Truth; and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was filled with armes and hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities diverse monthes, before his accepting of that Crowne, when himselfe laboured by an earnest Mediation, to have given a peaceable issue to those bloudie beginnings. It was the Honour, and greatnesse of that matchlesse Princesse that he gained heere, and the considerable succours they expected from hence, that especially drew the <hi>Bohemians</hi> to that choice. It therefore concernes us now at length, to provide that the <hi>Prince Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> himselfe, and the other <hi>Princelie Branches of that great Familie</hi> (being the second without question, if not the first, and most Ancient of the Empire)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111784:5"/>
extracted by their last match, from the Royall line of <hi>Great-Britaine,</hi> should not under couler of their Fathers accepting that Crown, to which they now pretend no title, be for ever despoiled of their ancient inheritance Electorall dignitie: to which calamitie they had never been reduced, had not the <hi>French</hi> King at that time forgotten the old Maxime of his Predecessors, which was to keepe even the ballance of <hi>Germanie,</hi> to which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so did most fatallie concurre, the <hi>Duke of Bavarias</hi> ambition betraying his own bloud, and the <hi>Duke of Saxonies</hi> taking of Armes against the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call partie. By this meanes and the advancing of <hi>Spinola</hi> with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Armie out of the <hi>Nether-Lands,</hi> was not onely the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia</hi> lost in a few monthes, but the <hi>Palatinate</hi> also, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting some few places of strength invested by the Enemie, and that poore people left to slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, calamitie, and desolation. The correspondence of some ill Ministers of this State abroad, with those of Porraine states heere, assisted by some fatall instruments at home, furthered all this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife at the instant putting this state in hope of a Match when supplies should rather have been sent from hence, to have preserved at least the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectorall</hi> Territories from an invading power. It
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111784:6"/>
is true, that the <hi>Spanish Match</hi> had been generally treated off, some five or six yeares before this fatall fire kindled in <hi>Germany,</hi> being first set on foote by the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> under <hi>Philip of Austria</hi> the late King of <hi>Spaine</hi>: but now it was effectually advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and fortified with a conjoyned treatie of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating the <hi>Palatine</hi> cause without effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bloud. This and much more appeares in the Originall journall bookes of the two houses of Parliament in <hi>Anno.</hi> 21. <hi>Iacobi Regis,</hi> which I have so far perused, as so short a time would give leave; and though that matters are there set downe at large, especially in the Records of the House of Peers, yet I have abstracted it into so narrow a compasse, as may well sort with the little spare time of this House to heare it. The relation was first made at White-hall during that Parliament, in the presence of the greater part of both the said houses, on <hi>Tuesday Febr.</hi> 24. and it was afterwards Reported upon <hi>Friday</hi> the 27. day of the same moneth next ensuing, in the Lords house, by the then Lord-keeper, and in the house of Commons, by S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Richard Weston,</hi> at that time Chancellour of the Exchequer. It is ther at large set forth, that his M<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> Royall Father, having had severall faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises from the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of a peaceable restitution of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111784:6"/>
the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> caused not onely such considerable forces, as were then remaining in <hi>Germanie</hi> under the Prince <hi>Electors ensignes</hi> to disband; but procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red also, some places of strength in the <hi>Palatinate it selfe,</hi> to be surrendered and consigned over in trust to the late <hi>Infanta of Spaine.</hi> But in the yeare 1622. our late Royall Soveraigne King <hi>Iames,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Ambassadors returne from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> having discovered the Emperours intentions to be full of insinceritie and deceit, wrote his Princelie Letters bearing date at <hi>Hampton Court October.</hi> 3. 1622. to the (then &amp; still) Earle of <hi>Bristow</hi> his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie Ambassador in <hi>Spaine</hi>; to let him know that he now perceived little sincerity in all the <hi>Spanish Kings</hi> promises, for the peaceable restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> by whose onely meanes he had suffered the same to be lost to the Emperour, and that therefore he should presently presse that King, either to give a full and direct answer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand and seale, for the restitution thereof; or else to joyne his Armes with his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> against the Emperour for the recoverie of the same: But this matter as it further appeares by the Originall Iournall-bookes of the Lords house, being either not throughly pressed, or notably dissembled. So many delaies ensued one upon the necke of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in the issue it drew his Royall Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> then <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> to undertake that dangerous and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111784:7"/>

breake off the said two treaties touching the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no lesse, then their persons and purses, for the recovery of the then <hi>Prince Electors ancient and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie Dominions.</hi> It appeares also in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iournall-booke of this house, <hi>De a<hi rend="sup">no.</hi> I<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Caroll,</hi> that this great busines was againe taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, but was finally incombed with other matters of great moment, by the fatall and abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive disolution of that Parliament. If therefore this great Counsell of the Kingdome, did in those two former Parliaments, account the restitution of this Illustrious and Princely family to bee of such great necesitie for the preserving of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion broad, and securing our selves at home, as to ingage themselves for an assistance therin; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely wee may vpon much better grounds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the same now, when I assure my selfe we may goe as farre with a thousand pounds for the present as we could have done with ten thousand at that time, for let vs but take a short view of thee state of Christendome, what it was then, and what it is now, and wee shall easily perseive a great alteration in the ballance thereof.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> were then involued in severall warres or iealousies with the <hi>Pole</hi> and enforced to keepe at home to defend their owne, but now have a strong Armie and possesse divers peices of important consequence within the very bowells of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The Episcopall Electors with the other Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician Princes and Prelates the sworne enemies the Protestant Religion, were then rich and potent, but since most of their Countries and Territories have tasted of the same calamities of Warre which they had formerly brought vpon their neighbours so as now they are most of them scarce able to defend their owne, much lesse to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any other.</p>
