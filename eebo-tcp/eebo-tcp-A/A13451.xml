            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Who did in <hi>Eighty eight</hi> this Kingdome saue;</l>
               <l>Then is the totall told, and seruice best,</l>
               <l>Wherewith this little Land was euer blest.</l>

                  <hi>Cales</hi> likewise the Sea-fight we did win</l>
               <l>By his direction and graue disciplin.</l>
               <l>The Spanish ships soone from his force retir'd,</l>
               <l>Some torne, some sunke, some taken, and some fir'd,</l>
               <l>And whensoere he gaue the ouerthrow,</l>
               <l>He nere insulted ore his conquerd foe,</l>
               <l>But like a Noble <hi>Lyon,</hi> euery way</l>
               <l>He scorn'd to prey vpon a yeelding prey:</l>
               <l>With pity, piety, and true remorce,</l>
               <l>His clemency was mixt with manly force.</l>
               <l>Vnto his foes a noble care he had,</l>
               <l>Nor would affliction to affliction adde:</l>
               <l>So that his enemies much cause did find</l>
               <l>To loue and honour his true noble mind.</l>
               <l>Yet gainst offenders he was sharply bent,</l>
               <l>Seuere in threats, and milde in punishment,</l>
               <l>His iustice would condemne, and in a breath</l>
               <l>His mercy sau'd whom iustice doom'd to death.</l>
               <l>His aduersaries he did oft relieue,</l>
               <l>And his reuenge was onely to forgiue.</l>
               <l>He knew that well got <hi>honour</hi> nere shall die,</l>
               <l>But make men liue vnto eternitie:</l>
               <l>It as his greatest riches he esteem'd,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Infamy</hi> he basest begg'ry deem'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23548:6"/>He knew, though worthy spirits may be crost,</l>
               <l>Yet if they lose no <hi>honour</hi> nothing's lost.</l>
               <l>And those that haue afraid of <hi>enuy</hi> bin,</l>
               <l>True <hi>honour</hi> or good fame did neuer win.</l>
               <l>If he an auaritious mind had bore,</l>
               <l>Of wealth no subiect then had had such store:</l>
               <l>So many yeares <hi>Englands high Admirall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Fees, offices, and prizes that did fall,</l>
               <l>With gifts and fauours from the Queene and State,</l>
               <l>And other things, amounting to a rate:</l>
               <l>That had he beene a mizer, close of hand,</l>
               <l>No subiect had been richer in this Land,</l>
               <l>In deeds of pity, and true charity,</l>
               <l>Good house-keeping, and hospitality,</l>
               <l>Bounty, and courteous affability,</l>
               <l>He was the Brooch of true Nobility:</l>
               <l>And for these vertues men shall scarcely find,</l>
               <l>That he a fellow here hath left behind.</l>
               <l>He knew that Auarice and Honor be</l>
               <l>Two contraries that neuer will agree:</l>
               <l>And that the Spender shall haue true renowne,</l>
               <l>When infamy the Mizers fame shall drowne.</l>
               <l>He euery way most nobly was enclin'd,</l>
               <l>And lou'd no wealth but riches of the mind:</l>
               <l>His pleasure was, that those that did retaine</l>
               <l>To him, and serue, should by him thriue and gaine:</l>
               <l>And he thought t'was enough for him to haue,</l>
               <l>When as his seruants did both get and saue.</l>
               <l>So amongst <hi>Nobles</hi> I thinke few are such,</l>
               <l>That keepes so little, giues away so much.</l>
               <l>His latest <hi>Will</hi> did make it plaine appeare,</l>
               <l>The loue which to his seruants he did beare.</l>
               <l>To great and small amongst them, more or lesse,</l>
               <l>His bounty did expresse his worthinesse:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23548:6"/>We know that God to man hath life but lent,</l>
               <l>And plac'd it in his bodies tenement,</l>
               <l>And when for it againe the Landlord cals,</l>
               <l>The Tenant must depart, the Cottage fals.</l>
               <l>God is most iust, and he will haue it knowne,</l>
               <l>That he in taking life, takes but his owne:</l>
               <l>Life is a debt which must to God be rendred,</l>
               <l>And Natures retribution must be tendred.</l>
               <l>Some pay in youth, and some in age doe pay,</l>
               <l>But tis a charge that all men must defray,</l>
               <l>For tis the lot of all mortality,</l>
               <l>When they begin to liue, begin to dye.</l>
               <l>And as from sin to sin we wander in,</l>
               <l>So death at last is wages for our sin.</l>
               <l>He neither hath respect to sex or yeares,</l>
               <l>Or hath compassion of our sighes nor teares,</l>
               <l>He'll enter (spight of bars, or bolts, or locks)</l>
               <l>And like a bold intruder neuer knockes.</l>
               <l>To Kings and Caitiffes, rich, poore, great and small,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Death</hi> playes the tyrant, and destroyes them all.</l>
               <l>He calls all creatures to account most strict,</l>
               <l>And no mans power his force can contradict.</l>
               <l>We must perforce be pleas'd with what he leaues vs,</l>
               <l>And not repine at ought which he bereaues vs.</l>
               <l>Hee's lawlesse, and tis folly to demand</l>
               <l>Amends, or restitution at his hand.</l>
               <l>He doth deride the griefe of those that mourne,</l>
               <l>And all our fraile afflictions laugh to scorne.</l>
               <l>For hee condemnes, and neuer heares the cause,</l>
               <l>He takes away despight the power of Lawes.</l>
               <l>Yet hee our vassall euer doth remaine,</l>
               <l>From our first birth vnto our graue againe:</l>
               <l>And God doth in his seruice him employ,</l>
               <l>To be the bad mans terrour, good mans ioy.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23548:7"/>Death is the narrow doore to life eternall,</l>
               <l>Or else the broad gate vnto death infernall:</l>
               <l>But our Redeemer in his spotlesse offering,</l>
               <l>Did lead the way for vs to heauen by suffering.</l>
               <l>He was the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> when he did die</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Death was swallow'd vp in victory,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And by his rising blessed soules shall rise,</l>
               <l>And dwell in the celestiall <hi>Paradise.</hi>

               <l>For these respects, you whose affinity,</l>

               <l>Whose blood or whose alliance challenge can</l>
               <l>A part in this deceased Nobleman,</l>
               <l>The law of Nature and affection moues,</l>
               <l>That griefe and sorrow should expresse your loues,</l>
               <l>He was your secondary maker, and</l>
               <l>Your authors earthly being, and you stand</l>
