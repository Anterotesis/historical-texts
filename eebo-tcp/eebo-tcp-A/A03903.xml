            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

These are the ioyes which

And therefore let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye Christian bee readie and willing, in ioy of spirit to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, &amp; in token thereof learne to crie out with Paule: Oh wretch that I am, who shal deliuer me from this bodye of sinne?</p>
               <p>Lette vs account our selues wretched, as long as we carry this weede of earth aboute vs, vntill our soules bee vncased, and wee deliuered from this body of sinne.

The causes of corruption are all one with the causes of gene ration: and therefore vnlesse we wil denie nature, and be vn thankful to God for our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may not in anye case feare death, which is mothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon nature our common and generall mother. But if neyther example nor Nature will or can preuaile, yet let the authoritye of our Heauenlie Creatour, and his wisedome compell vs to welcome death,

and to accept willinglye the condition of our bodies.</p>
               <p>Our bodies and soules God created, he made them by the power of his almightie hande, and hath lente them vnto vs but for a time to vse, til mother earth require the bodie, and he our soules. For, as of earth wee came: so into earth wee must returne againe: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnles we will be vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to nature, and rebellious to God, wee must bee willing to paie our debts vnto him, least if we doo it not, he cast vs into prison, til we haue paid the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost farthing.

               <p>Now consider thy soule. As thy bodie is a prison, so is thy

soule during this pilgrimage a prisoner; as it is a body of sin, so is thy soule lodged in a most stinking prison: as it is of earth earthy: so is thy soule an exile from heauen, heauenlie: &amp; ther fore to feare death, it is to feare the deliuery of thy soule from prison, which is meere follie: it is to wish a stinking lodging and a filthie cage to dwell in, and euer to carie it about thee, which is a very harde and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame misery: it is to wish thy continuall banishmente from the ioyefull realme of heauen, thy natural countrey, which is extreame madnes.

Come Lord lesu, come, shorten these latter daies for thine elect sake and saue vs. Saue vs, O Lord saue vs, haue mercie vpon vs, and helpe vs, helpe Lord, and by a blessed death cite vs to appeare before thee.

               <p>Secondly, consider that thy life is vncerteine. For death is like a theefe that commeth at vncertaine houres, he is like a thundercracke, that soundeth on a sudden: yea, this life is so vncerteine, that death may ask his due in the swathcloth, and none be able to resist him.

This iudgement of Iob, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubte was rooted in him and his brother Ieremie. And thereof it came, without

question, that they did cursse, not onlie the daie of birth, but also him that brought the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to their father, that a child was borne. They had fullie considered the degrees of their miserie. Their birth place was but a foule and filthie dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they themselues were but a substance of bloud and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their mothers: their nourishment little better than venom, &amp; their birth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extreme pains of the deere mother, and violent offense of their tender bodies.</p>
               <p>They knewe throughlie that they were conceiued in filth and vncleannes, born in sinne and care, and nourished with paine and labour. They dyd

knowe themselues to haue bin like cralling wormes, and that at their entrie into this worlde they were apparelled with bloud. And therefore conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their miserable condition they curssed the daye of their wretched birth.</p>
               <p>Yea, this made father Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to wishe, that his mothers wombe hadde serued for his tumbe: and father Esaie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile his birth, and to murmur againste the knees that helde him vppe, and also the breasts that gaue him suck. They had fully conceiued, that man was made of the slime of the earth, conceiued in sinne, borne in paine, and at the laste made a prey for wormes. This miserie

            <p>First I would haue you to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:26873:120"/>
learne this lesson, that as sinne, came in by Adam, so by sinne death as a due reward follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore, when you looke vppon mee, remember whence you are falne in adam from grace into sinne, from sin into death: and therevpon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe for your sinnes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your selues to death. For it is the waie of all flesh.</p>
            <p>There is a time to bee borne in sinne, and a time to die for the same: al flesh is grasse, yee muste all wither and fade with the flower. This natural death which foloweth the combat of the Elementes and sinne, shal creep vpon your mortallims: for as the sunne hath an east to rise in, so he hath a West to fal

               </gap>o you shall all dance with me one day, and this day is vncertaine, noe man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when it shall come. For it shall come at vnawares vpon you, and therefore doe good, and eschew euil, sin not, least a woorse thing than this naturall death doe happen vnto you. For if you doo still wallowe in sin, answer me, What if death suddenlye strike you with his dart as hee dooth manie men: howe woulde you bee able to stand in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement of God?</p>
            <p>Therefore leaue off in time, and liue lyke Christyans, that GOD yet at the least, seeing your liues are so wicked, may find a good will and purpose in you towardes a godlie conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:26873:121"/>
Do we not stil hold the same pace like old carthorses, but repent and amend, for the kingdome of God is at hand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when you see mee remember the spirituall death of Adam, wherein you are all wrapped, by nature borne in sin &amp; children of wrath. Dead you are in Adam, starke dead in your sinnes, vntill the Lord do regenerate you anew with his holie spirit, and water your barren nature with the drops of his grace.</p>
            <p>And herein see that you doo acknowledge your weakenes, or rather your miserie: that by sinne you are dead, euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life by nature, and without anye power to attayne vnto

life, as I am and shall be, vntill the Lorde doo knocke at my bed and raise mee from death to life, to liue with him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
            <p>Auoyde sinne therefore, as your deadlie enimie, whiche would rob you of life, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you in bandes of eternall death; and crie vnto the Lord for helpe. For withoute him, against this enimie, you can do nothing. Crie with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid, Create, O Lord, a new heart, and renewe a right spirite within vs, that beeing quickened againe by the dew of his blessing, and strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the armour of grace, you may be able to withstand the furie of Sathan, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:26873:122"/>
to endure the battell of a raging conscience.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, when you looke vpon mee, remember whereof you are, euen of earth: no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than duste and ashes, to the which I nowe returne. And therefore to the loftie minded manne I say; Dust and ashes, why art thou proud? for earth thou art, &amp; to earth thou shalt, and become a prey for knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wormes.</p>
            <p>Decke thy bodye neuer so gloriouslie, tie Iewels aboute thy neck, lade thy fingers with ringes, sit at thine ouerrunning tables and make merrie, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise al men: yet I tell thee, thou art dust, as I am, so shalte thou be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:26873:122"/>
Thy bodie shal stinke, which nowe thou embaulmest: thy lofty looke shal bee humbled, the wormes shall feede vppon thee. Looke vpon me, &amp; thinke vpon thy selfe, be not as thou art: but thinke vpon mee, and what thou shalt be, and folow him that is able of dust to raise thee to life, &amp; crieth vnto thee: Be humble and meeke, as I am</p>
            <p>If thou refuse this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, remember that pride shall haue a fall: that earth is heauy by nature, and falleth: that he that exalteth himselfe shall be humbled, and hee that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himselfe shal be exalted.</p>
            <p>Acknowledge therefore that earth is thy mother, which is the basest of al other elements
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:26873:123"/>
and folowe Christ thy maister, and onlie guide to his father in ioy: that out of earth hee may raise thee to heauen: and after thy resurrection, for thine ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and stinking bodie, giue thee a glorious and immortall bodie that thou mayest shine with him like a starre in the kingdome of glory.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, let all couetous persons looke vpon mee, and amend their euill liues. For as I came naked into this world, so did they: and as I carrye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge with mee but my win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sheete, euen so shall they. Their riches, the pelfe of this world shall they leaue behind them, which they haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in paine, and hourded vp

            <p>Oh you hungrie lions! you are alwaies gaping for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prey, you are euer hungrie, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer satisfied: get you neuer so much by hooke or by crook, by violent iniurie, or biting vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But looke you vpon me. For an eln of earth now shall serue mee, and so must it serue you, whom nothing may suffice in this world.</p>
            <p>Sorrowe therefore, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende in time. For you were not borne to gather worldelye substance: but to serue poore Iesus, who of God made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe poore to enrich you. You were not borne to continue in this world.</p>
            <p>No, you haue no continuing

citie heere, but you must looke for another, euen Heauen, whence you are nowe exiled: and therefore you must seeke the things that be aboue. Your conuersation must be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>You must not tie your harts to the earth, and hourd vp the pelfe of this world, lest the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie moths and rust of your tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure cry for a plague vpon and against you in the daie of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.

            <p>For their broydered hayre, their faced and defaced appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, theyr superfluous lasings, their sumptuous Veluetes and silks, their golden caules, their wrought clothes, their ringed fingers, and their costlie fare in this worlde, which Lazarus wanteth, they are all vanitie,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:26873:125"/>
neither shal they redeem them but to earth they shall, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish with the vapour.</p>
            <p>They shal al sleepe with me, and they shall be one daye no better than I am: worms meat, stinking carcases, duste and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes they shall be, whatsoeuer they doo appeare to the foolish world.</p>
            <p>Kinges and princes, magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and subiects, schollers and maisters, rich and poore, al may looke vpon me. For I am able to teache them a lesson, which they forget dailie: That earth they are, and vnto earth they must with mee one daie, and noe man knoweth howe soone. Disdaine not to learne this at me: for I teach you the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:26873:126"/>
truth, which one day you your selues shal approue to be very true.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, let all mourning mothers &amp; sorrowing friends, lette them giue ouer weeping and vnchrystian wailinge. For that cannot helpe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it grudgeth and complai neth againste the will of God: but rather let them bee merrie and reioise.</p>
            <p>For behold, this life is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, euen a continual warfare, as Iob calleth it, and death is a sleepe, a sweete sleepe, so that by it I rest from my labours, I am deliuered from daunger to safetye, from labour to ioye, from trauel to rest, from paine to pleasure, and lie in the earth
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:26873:126"/>
as it were in a bed, till I must rise to iudgement.</p>
            <p>This is the lucky estate of them that are dead in the lord. And therfore did father Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on desire to departe in peace: and Paule counted hymselfe a wretch because hee was not deliuered from this bodye of sinne.</p>
            <p>So that you haue no cause to mourne for your friends, whoe by deathe are passed beyonde death: euen to life, to liue with GOD, and to see him face to face, euen as hee is. But rather you haue cause to reioyse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by death they are taken into ioye, to be where Christe Iesus is.</p>
            <p>The dead man is but a sleepe,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:26873:127"/>
hee is not dead but for a time, and at length he shall awake, euen by the sounde of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and crie of an Archangell, to see his redeemer in heauen, where he with thee and thou with him, and the Heauenlye armie of Angels &amp; saints mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue for euer.</p>
            <p>Looke vpon me, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, al you that mourne for the death of your friendes. For blessed am I, and thrise blessed. This worlde is an exile, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen my naturall countrey: and so by death I am deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exile, and heerein I am verie happie.</p>
            <p>This present worlde is euill, in heauen are ioyes that passe sense and conceit. And so by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:26873:127"/>
death in the Lorde I am freed from euil, and placed in ioye: and heerin I am happie.</p>
            <p>This world is no continuing citie, but another, that is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which when I liued, in faith I looked for: so that by death I am set in a permanent place, and heerein am I happy.</p>
            <p>This life is a pilgrimage, hea uen my home: and so by death of a pilgrim, I am made a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and heerein I am happy.</p>
            <p>To conclude, by death, from earth to heauen, from men to Angels, from warre to peace, from paine to pleasure, from griefe to euerlasting gladnes, from vanitie &amp; miserie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall felicitie I haue passed in peace: &amp; herin I am happie.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:26873:128"/>
So that death is not to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor yet to bee lamented: but rather welcome in ioye of spirit whensoeuer it commeth.</p>
            <p>And for this are al Christians bound to render hartie thanks vnto the Lorde, that hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the cursse into a blessinge, and by his pretious death vpon the crosse made death no deth but an entrie to life, a passage to ioy, a deliuery from miserie. For this blessing, blessed be the name of the Lorde, and let al people say, Amen.</p>

bones, we haue nothing in this world.</p>
            <p>We post from place to place, &amp; run from towne to towne, wee goe from house to house, we cry for releefe in thy name, we aske it for thy sake: but alas good Lorde, wee can get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. If we be strong though wee haue charge of children, we are whipped, we are stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, wee are imprisoned, and howe not abused? if wee bee lame, dum, deafe, sicke or sore, we may cry: but alas, charity is frozen, where one heareth hundreds doo stop their eares, and are deafe at our sutes.</p>
            <p>O Lord, charitie is drowned, the best friend which we shuld haue: hard hearts doo reigne,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:26873:131"/>
the stoutest enimy that we can haue: with this enimie we are assaulted almost in euery place alas for pitty! pitty, sweet lord is our request, haue mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. Looke vppon Lazarus our king and capteine: behold Lord, he commeth to the rich mans gate, there he lieth, there he crieth; Crums, crummes he craueth to ease his hunger, but he cannot get them, dogs haue them, but Lazarus ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue them.</p>
            <p>The dogs come to Lazarus and licke his sores: but Diues hath no feete to carrie him, no tongue to laie the playster of comfort to his earnest sute, no hand to helpe him, not a crum to feede him. Beholde Lorde,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:26873:132"/>
doggs are better vnto vs than Diues: nay, they are in better case than we are; for they haue the crums that falles from their maisters table: but alas! Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus cannot come by them.</p>
            <p>O Lorde, now where is thy wonted mercie? shall Lazarus want? shal he want the crums of breade to ease his hunger? what? shal he crie for them, &amp; shal hee not haue them? shall he shout, but shall hee not bee heard? what good Lorde? shal hee die for hunger, and Diues walowe in pleasure?</p>
            <p>What Lord? hast thou loste thy name god, which soundeth as much as good? thou art cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Deus, quasi Dans,</hi> and yet shall Lazarus wante bread to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:26873:132"/>
refresh him? This complaint of the poore man dooth gnawe him: nay, sometimes it quyte deuoureth him.</p>
            <p>But to lay a salue of comfort to this sore of Lazarus: O La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, why doest thou weepe? why doest thou crie out? whie doest thou seeme to blame the Lorde, he hath appointed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as a father to regard thee.</p>
            <p>But what, dooest thou come to his gate, dooest thou craue charitie, art thou denied it? the Lord commanded it, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Lord instified, when he is iudged. But Diues hath abused his benefits, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shal he answer for it.</p>
            <p>Let this be thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mfort: let this be thy lodge to reste in,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:26873:133"/>
from all complaints, that one daie God, who is charitie, shal iudge the worlde, the greatest scourge that Diues shall haue. Then shall hee say, as accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that not doone vnto him, which was not doon vnto you. when I was hungrye, thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest me no meate, noe not the crums that fell from thy table: when I was thirstie, thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest me no drink: when I was naked, thou didst not cloath me; when I was in prison thou didst not comfort me; when I was harbourles, thou didst not lodge mee; giue an accoumpt of thy stewardship. Then shal he crie out, that hee neuer saw him hungrie or thirstie, or else he would haue refreshed him:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:26873:133"/>
not imprisoned, or else hee would haue visited him: not lodgles, or else he would haue harboured him.</p>
            <p>But this is all lies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will he say vnto him: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scio,</hi> I know thee not: Departe as cursed into euerlasting fire, where shall bee weeping and gnashing ofteeth.</p>
            <p>Come hither crieng Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, thou that criest and show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test out vppon the Lorde, and vpon the tyrannie of worlde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: art thou sicke? art thou sore? art thou deafe? art thou dumbe? art thou naked? what? hast thou no place to laie thy head in? come hither, for here are pallaces of pleasure to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime in, excellente turrets of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:26873:134"/>
ioy to banket in, and lodgelesse of infinit comfort to harbor in. For what? haue you not hadd meate, when you haue craued it? or drinke when you haue asked it? haue you beene in prison, and not visited? sicke &amp; not comforted? sore &amp; not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? naked and not cloathed? wanderers and not succored?</p>
            <p>Behold, in your behalf Christ will iudge the rich and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse gluttons of this worlde: and in the daye of reuelation, you to your ioyous conquest, and to their vtter shame shall testifie &amp; beare witnes against them. This is the first lodge of comfort.</p>
            <p>But yet there is another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this: enter into that. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:26873:134"/>
when you asked reliefe, it was Christ that asked and was denied, so that in this worlde you beare an image of Christ, who came vnto his owne, and yet was not receiued, noe not knowne: who had not his nest, as the birdes of the aire haue: nor his den to flie vnto, as the foxes haue: no not so much as a place to lay his hed on.</p>
            <p>Hee sought once to harbour in Peters ship vpon a pillowe: but marke, how the waues the winds disquieted the shippe, it frighteth Peter, poore Iesus is pinched at and awakened, so that hee could not haue a good nap to comfort his wearinesse in his harbouring place. Was this the estate of the mayster?
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:26873:135"/>
then rest in peace, and harbor in ioye. For the scholler is not aboue his maister.</p>
            <p>Naie, dooth the tyrannie of Diues pinch him, when it pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth you? dooth hee hunger, when you hunger? dooth hee thirst, when you thirst? is he na ked, when you are naked? is he sicke when you are sicke? is he sore when you are sore? is he harbourlesse when you bee lodgles? what? dooth he smart when you smart, dooth he crie for almes, when you craue: is it he that made you, he that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued you, he that spent his life and shedde his owne pretious bloud to redeeme you from sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, &amp; yet wil you complaine? let it not be so, but in patience
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:26873:135"/>
leane vnto the louing Lorde, and let him be a pallace of ioy to lodge and rest in.</p>
            <p>There is a thirde lodge of comfort for al Lazars. For the vncharitable dealing of Diues shal be his vtter ruine. If Diues haue shut his eare against thy cry, and denied to relieue thee in time of needie extreamity: if he haue not opened his hart to pitie thee, nor stretched out his arme to rayse thee, when thou art faln into mysery: hen woe, woe: a rod is at hande to beate him: O foole, this night the diuel shall fetche thy soule from thee. Heere is a glorious lodge of comfort for al Lazers</p>
            <p>If Diues haue his barnes fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with corne, his chests with
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:26873:136"/>
treasure, his table furnished with plenty of meat, if he haue al things at will: yet shall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing redeeme him from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, if he will not attend the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous crie of Lazarus in tyme of extreame necessitie. For hee that will not heare the poore when he dooth crie: when hee crieth himselfe, the Lorde will him denie.</p>
            <p>Hath Diues now denied you almes? then wil the Lorde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him mercie: wil the Lorde denie him mercie, because he hath not pitied your myserie? hath the Lorde such care ouer your estate, that hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge it sharpely if you be not cherished: and will you yet complaine? Fie, no, for shame,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:26873:136"/>
but let this be a lodge for you to rest in.</p>
            <p>God is your gard, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it go with you: you are his little ones, his dearlinges, and deerely beloued. If Diues doo abuse you, if he doo not cherish you: beholde howe he loueth you, for Diues for your sake shall suffer paines for euer.</p>
            <p>You want foode on earth: but he shall want the bread of life in hell. You want drinke, but he shal want euen a drop of water in hel to coole his fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming toong. You wante in this world cloth to couer your nakednes: but hee shall want the white raiment of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and therefore wallowe in myserie for euer: You wante
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:26873:137"/>
lodging here, but he shal want the lodge of ioyes else-where. You cannot be his ghest, but a worme for your sakes shall bee his ghest euerlastingly.</p>
            <p>Hee had store of all thinges: what wanted hee? neyther sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nor golde to haue enriched you, nor meate to haue fedde you, nor drinke to haue eased you: he had cloth to haue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered you, crums of his table that would haue releeued you, he hadde lodges wherein hee might haue graunted you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>But see the iudgementes of God for your sakes. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues is not worth a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hel: for al his pleasure he reapeth lasting paine, for his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:26873:137"/>
melodious harmonie, he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth howling &amp; weeping, and gnashing of teeth. This is the wo that they shal swim in, that with Diues neglect the crie of seely Lazarus.</p>
            <p>But yet view a fourth lodge of comfort, a princelie lodge, you band of beggers: approch and looke vp, what? was La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus clothed in sores? did no man visit or comfort him? had he no physitian either by word or by worke to cure him? had he noe surgerie, but onelye by dogs?</p>
            <p>Nay, what? was he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sore in bodie, but pinched in stomach? did he want food? naye, did he so hunger, that he desired crummes of breade to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:26873:138"/>
please the crie of his greedye stomach, and yet could he not get it?</p>
            <p>What? are any of you in the same case? beholde a lodge of comfort: looke vppe, and there you shal see Abrahams bosom and Lazarus therein lodged. See, he that wallowed in sores &amp; might haue washed in tears such was his miserie to the eye of the world.</p>
            <p>Beholde, hee that was not worth a crum of breade in this worlde, hee that had no lodge place to rest in, nowe lodgeth in Abrahams bosome, an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough of rest.</p>
            <p>What nowe you beggers, you that wander from place to place, and haue no resting
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:26873:138"/>
place to staie in: nay, you that wander, and for want of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doo alwaies hunger: be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, blesse God in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, and reste in the lodge of Lazarus.</p>
            <p>Diues was aboue Lazarus in this world: Diues waded in plentie, but Lazarus in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Diues sate at his table, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus at the gates: Diues heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Lazarus sick; Diues with a fulbellye, but Lazarus lyued with an hungrie stomach: and yet looke vp, and now you shal see Diues below, and Lazarus aboue him.</p>
            <p>Diues in this world had rich men for his comates, gentiles and potentates for his ghestes: but now he kepeth companie
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:26873:139"/>
with the diuell and his angels. Lazarus in this worlde had no companie to comfort him: nay, he had none that alwaies tarried with him, but sicknesse and pouertie: they were from time to time his two ghests, &amp; at Diues his gates the dogs too did visit and licke him.</p>
            <p>But now behold, Diues by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the bread of misery in hel: but Lazarus lodgeth in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams bosom, and now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen banketteth at the table of euerduring ioye, with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, Prophets, Apostles Martyres, and holie ones of God.</p>
            <p>Oh! wil the impatient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus saie: this is a heauie case, to be alwaies beaten with pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:26873:139"/>
pouertie, alwaies to bite of sorrowe, and neuer to liue at ease.</p>
            <p>Surelie if this be thy case, as thou monest: yet I saie, looke vp to the lodge of reste, euen Abrahams bosom: for though thou doo swim in seas of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, yet thou dooest banquet with Lazarus, who euen in this worlde did suffer pinching ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, and yet now he dooth rest in peace.</p>
            <p>But thou art beaten, thou sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est: thou art buffeted: so was Lazarus. Oh! but thou art bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sore, so was he. But yet thou singest on the same song: thou art beaten.</p>
            <p>Art thou beaten? then lodge in comfort. For better it is to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:26873:140"/>
be beaten with Lazarus, than damned with Diues: it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be crossed, than not crow ned: it is better to bee beaten, than neuer to be chastised. For God receiueth no childe, but whom he scourgeth.</p>
            <p>But yet thou criest: Oh my life is miserable! is it mysera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: then lodge in comforte. For miserie is the high waie to felicity.</p>
            <p>Thou muste bee buffeted, if thou wilt be saued: for he that will liue godlie in Christ Iesus must suffer persecutions. I am the waie sayth hee. But what was his waie to Heauen? A crosse was his waie vnto the crowne, and thus woulde hee lead thee to immortal glorie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:26873:140"/>
What saiest thou nowe, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus? hast thou anie thing to complaine of? I hope these lodges of comforte doo please thee. But if they doo not, yet harken a little.</p>
            <p>Is thy life a castle of misery, because thou art wrapt in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie? art thou a wretch of this world, because thou art cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in sores? dooest thou sing of nothing but calamitye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause health faileth thee, or store of temporall blessinges? why then reason with me.</p>
            <p>What if thou hadst the riches of Diues, his health, his wealth his garners, his treasure, hys lands, his cattell? yet vanitie of vanites, crieth the Preacher, and al is vanitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:26873:141"/>
Vanitie? what, Vanitie of vanities? nay, what? is all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie? ritches, health, treasure, pleasure, wealth: is all woe? nay, is al vanitie? vanitie, what? worth a nit? naye, worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and yet art thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled?</p>
            <p>The rich men of this world doe fall into manie temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in so much that wher they shoulde bee gods on earth, to helpe and to aide the needye, when neede requireth: they prooue themselues cages of vn cleane diuels.</p>
            <p>Some lords of landes do beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their poore tenantes, they racke and impouerish them to better their owne estate: some hourde vppe corne for deere
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:26873:141"/>
times, to the vtter beggering of the poor, some haue catching hands, who though they haue enough, yet are alwaies cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and snatching at the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes mite.</p>
            <p>Vsurers or rather robbers, who haue inough but the rich? who want it but the poor? whie want they it, but because cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is deade, and the rich are snared in deadly temptations? But yet they will be riche, they scrape and trauel for goods.</p>
            <p>But what crie the proud and the rich men in the fift of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Oh say they, what hath pride profited vs? or what hath the pompe of riches broughte vs?</p>
            <p>Come hither Lazarus, art
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:26873:142"/>
thou poore? desire not to bee rich: for this is the vsuall song of such as are rich in this world Oh! what hath the pompe of riches brought vs? doo not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches better a man? nay, dooth not the pompe of riches bring any commodity with it.</p>
            <p>What? can it not deliuer vs from dansing with death, from the gnawing worme, from the bed of earth? no though wee were as beautifull as Absolon, as long liued as Methuselah, as eloquent as Cicero, as subtile as Aristotle: to end, as riche as Cresus, yet we must needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wormes meate, &amp; turne to dust and ashes,</p>
            <p>How now Lazarus? what if thou hadst courtlye palaces to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:26873:142"/>
lodge in? excessiue plentie of al thinges? euen the pompe of riches? what should they auail thee? nothing: yea nothing, and yet is pouertie a burthen vnto thee?</p>
            <p>It is the will of God Lazar that thou shouldest be a Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus: and it is thy dailie praier, that his wil be doone: and it is his will to saue all men. But what? is it his will, that thou shouldest bee poore? and art thou not merrie?</p>
            <p>It is his wil to saue thee? nay, is it he that can only saue thee? nay, is he woont to saue vs by crossinge vs, that wee shoulde enter into heauen by manie tribulations: and wilte thou not yet lodge in comfort?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:26873:143"/>
Nay what? doest thou praie that the wil of God be doone? if thou praie for it, as it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee vpon, so thou dooest wish it. Now his will is to beat thee with pouertie: thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est for it, thou wishest it. What now? dooest thou wish it? and yet art thou sad and pensiue?</p>
            <p>Men are woont to ioye, yea and to reioyse when they haue their wishe? but thou hast it: and wilte thou bee sorie? The Lord saith, nay the Lord swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, that He wil not the deth of a sinner: and death is the due wages of thy sinnes, the which of iustice he might paie vnto thee, but hee will not of mercie.</p>
            <p>Wil he not thy death, which
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:26873:143"/>
is due vnto thee? and yet doost thou complaine of pouertye, which is his will to laie vppon thee? let this bee thy lodge of comfort, that his mercie is our safetie: and that his will is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge else but his mercie: yea, though hee doo beat and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet vs neuer so much.</p>
            <p>And to perswade vs in this point, who are so incredulous of nature from time to time, it hathe pleased him to scourge his children, or rather to scour the vessels of their heartes, the lodge place of his holy spirite, from the dregs of iniquity.</p>

            <p>This lodge is his wounds, which hee had on the crosse to heale vs: which woundes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies are open, for al st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>Here is a lodge for al Lazars, that grone in spirit. All such as are heauie and laden, &amp; heare and follow that proclamation of Baptist, Repent: al that with father Dauid weepe, &amp; learne to wet the couch of their harts with the tears of their groning soules.</p>
            <p>This lodge of comfort is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all, it is denied to none that repent, haue they beene neuer so greuous sinners.</p>
            <p>Besides these two sortes of Lazars, there are some that are rich in temporal blessings, and

yet very Lazars in grace: co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous men and vsurers, they doo not onelie want that they haue, but by euer seeking more and more, they drowne theyr seelie soules in sinne, and for a lodge of comfort, they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in hellish Aegypt.</p>
            <p>Thus was Diues the glutton a Lazar: hee had plentie of all things, and yet hee was not so riche in grace as to bestowe a crum of bread vpon Lazarus: and therefore dooth hee nowe thirst for a drop of water, and cannot get it, to ease the furye of his tormenting toong.</p>
            <p>Diues is the ringleader of the dance to al carelesse ritch men that haue departed this life, as couetous wretches. But vnto

            <p>Yea, it is open for al sinners, who are Lazars by nature, and want the verie crums of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: they gape to receiue vs, and they are alwaies fresh and greene.

            <p>And here I might begin with wondering at the churlish na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, who being so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called by the voice of God and his deputies, from sinne: doth yet notwithstanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therein, like swine in filth and mire.</p>
            <p>Duste and ashes! shall the Lord himselfe crie vpon thee? Sinne not: and wilte thou not

            <p>O thou drowsie creature! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, bee wise. Consider if God being wisedome, doo cal thee from sinne, then is it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to follow sinne. If God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the father of mercie, doo cal thee from sinne the mother of endles misery, then ô wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched creature returne, repent, least for mercie thou doo reap the rewarde of sinne, which is death eternal.</p>
            <p>But why should wee by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning make our selues thrall to so tyrannous a maister as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? and despise the cal of so lo uing a Sauiour as Iesus Christ, crieng vnto vs, Sinne not.</p>
            <p>The seruice of Satan is mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bondage: the seruice of Iesus Christe is a blessed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is a freedome, that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth al freedomes: and so much the rather to be embraced, as the other is myserable and to be detested: yea, it is with both

            <p>For being bondslaues of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, so vile a varlot, shall the Lord offer vs his seruice, which is perfect libertie, and shall we refuse it, and not rather receue it?

            <p>But to make this retraite to sounde more shrill in the eares of slumbring Adam: looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the damned spirit of Diues, he burneth in hel: but whye if not for sinne? His toong fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, neyther can hee get a droppe of water to quench it: and why but for sin? The fire that hee burneth in is vnquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable: his dolefull musicke is gnashing of teethe, howlinge, weeping, and great lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: his case is curssed for euer,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:26873:152"/>
and why but for sinne?</p>
            <p>If Diues had knowne, that the seruice of the Lorde hadde beene perfect libertie, and that obedience to his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had beene the pathway to heauen, or that his sinful life would haue wrought him such a web of wo, or rewarded him with death for his wages in seruing Satan: no doubte hee would haue followed as good counsell, as hee wished by the dead to be reuealed to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: that is, he woulde haue sought grace of the Lord, that hee might haue obeied him in holines, and so be saued.</p>
            <p>But marke ô yee liuing, and learne of the dead. Diues was a sinner, he serued sinne, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:26873:153"/>
the old serpent, but his seruice wrought his wo, euen a wo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. Now what a tirannous maister is that, that so rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his seruant? or what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable seruaunt is that, which reapeth nothing by his seruice but wo?</p>
            <p>But O thrise miserable are we! if we will serue the same maister, whose seruice in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues wee see to bee a slauishe thraldome, and our wages no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but biting myserie. So that, if the Lorde our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iesus Christ, by his louing cal be not able to recal vs from sinne: yet let the bitter end of Diues, and the flaminge tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his soule damned for sinne, bee a sufficient retrait
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:26873:153"/>
vnto vs. Woe, wo, was due to him for sin, and therfore sinne not.</p>
            <p>This Diues was a rich man, God had blessed him with his creatures, and these arguments of his loue cryed vppon him, Come home by repentance, &amp; to holines in conuersation: he notwithstanding neglected, and stil continued a seruant of sinne, for the which his seruice, he doth now lament in hellish torments, and so shall doo for euer. Hee shall alwaies howle weep and waile, in paine with out ease, in sorrowe without comfort, in griefe without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and that for euer.</p>
            <p>But, O miserable Diues! whie didst thou not repente and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:26873:154"/>
from sinne, at the retrait of so manie and so great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Lord? why didst thou not plaie the good steward of thy riches, in bestowing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vpon needie Lazarus? why wast thou more vngentle and vnnaturall than the verie dogges, that licked his sores? where was charitye? surelye it was frozen, it was dead: noe better euidence than thyne owne confession, which thou makest amidest thine endlesse torments, crieng out and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng:</p>
            <p>My life was sinful, mine obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was to Satan, my para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise was the wicked worlde, I neglected the retrait of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie benefits from sin, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:26873:154"/>
I lie in paine, and so shall doo, til I haue paide the vtmost farthing, and that is euer.</p>
            <p>Come hither now ye liuing, consider in time and bee wise. Diues was a sinner, and so are you: Diues neglecting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait from sinne, and puttinge off from daie to daie, was at lengthe vpon a sudden thruste downe into hell: and surely, if you do not in time repent, but followe his pathes, then as his ende was tormentes, so shall yours bee. For God is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of persons.</p>
            <p>Therfore, ô ye liuing, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; be wise: and if you haue begun the race of Diues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, returne, awake, least Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan take you napping, and the

Lord in his iust iudgement suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to take your soules fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, and so rob you of all ioye for euer.</p>
            <p>If Diues had known the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of Satan, or the wages of his seruice, or the dangerous extremities of carnal securitie: no doubt he would haue awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from sinne, and bin as wise before hand to haue prouided for himselfe, as hee was to late for his brethren.</p>
            <p>And shall wee, knowing the danger of deferring to repent, &amp; the vilanie of sinne, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide before hand against such a dangerous tempest, as Diues abode, and walke wisely: but incur the danger of extremitie by sleeping in carnal securitie,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:26873:155"/>
and perilous seruice of sinne?</p>
            <p>O ye sonnes of men, be wise and repent, returne from your wicked waies, giue the old ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the slip, forsake your old maister sinne, bid adieu to all iniquitie, if you will not swim in the tormentorie seas of hell with Diues.</p>
            <p>Besides this bitter retrayte from sin, there bee other trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters of Gods iust iudgments whiche ought continuallie to mooue, and effectuallie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade vs to forsake the seruice of sinne and Satan. The whole world did serue Satan, bicause it ouerflowed with sinne, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beholde, it ouerstreamed with water, and al the worlde was drowned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:26873:156"/>
Here, if it please al sinners to put on the spectacles of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may see what it is to serue sinne, and what to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte the Lordes retraite from iniquitie. The whole worlde hauing forsaken the lord God, wente a whooring after Satan, and marryed it selfe to sinne, renouncing innocency of life, to folow vice; but lo the ende: when Satan by sinne had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten suche a maysterie, and by reason of iniquitie was becom a prince of this world, beholde the end of all his practises: the ruine and destruction of the world.</p>
            <p>And surelie this was the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lorde, to destroy them wholie, that had neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:26873:156"/>
to hear his voice in the day of visitation: &amp; this iudgement is bent against al those that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in sinne and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Lord hath made a couenant, and therof he hath giuen vs a certaine sacrament and earnest penie, that he for sinne will neuer drowne the world againe: but yet the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant may breed in vs no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, but rather it is a retrait from sinne, forsomuch as it is a couenant betweene the Lord and vs, betweene whome no couenant can continue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, vnlesse wee returne from sinne.</p>
            <p>For although hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised not to destroy the world
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:26873:157"/>
againe for sinne, and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise shall be perfourmed, not because we deserue it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee hath promised: yet vnles we repent, <hi>Omnes simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peribimus.</hi> We shall al like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perish. He wil drowne vs in wo for euer.</p>
            <p>This flood of torments, and hellish lake, wherein the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doo wallowe, and wade in vnspeakable paine: this floud doth passe the other, and vnles we repent, and by heartie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance leape into Noahs arke, and so into the bosome of mother Sion, there is no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for vs.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore repent, and lament our sinnes, and close our selues in the readie arke of

Moses, least being at the brink of death, the waters of hell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer swallow vs.</p>
            <p>But to come from the whole world to the part: behold So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorrha, the twoe stewes of Sathan, wherein hee dayly committed fornication with the sonnes of men.

            <p>They had renounced al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie chastitie, and to marrie the olde serpente they had broken their obedience vnto the lord. But be hold, those two wild ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were tamed, destroyed: yea burnt with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:26873:158"/>
Now, O ye children of men, come and see the terrible sight of these two citties burning &amp; consuming with fire: repente and lament your owne liues, that you are not behinde So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomor in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but like miserable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, haue pledged them in the cuppe of spirituall fornication with sinne and Satan.</p>
            <p>Let this fire and birmstone, like terrible Trumpetters of Gods iust iudgementes, sound so shrill in your eares, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake you from sleeping anye longer in sinne, least a worse thing than this doo happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: yea whensoeuer you see water, fire, and brimstone,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:26873:158"/>
thinke vppon the iudgementes of God against sin, and sinne not.</p>
            <p>Consider that Sodom and Gomor were destroied for sin, and that God, when it pleaseth him, maye execute his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vppon thee, whosoeuer thou be vnlesse thou repent: &amp; therefore returne from sin, and sinne not.</p>
            <p>Consider, that where al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were made for mans vse: yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in his wrath against sinne, doth vse them as swords of vengeance, to cut him off. And therefore, if wee will not onelie haue the Lord, but also his creatures to profite vs, so that wee may vse them to the ende they were created, then
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:26873:159"/>
where not onlie the Lord him selfe, but also all his creatures doo crie vpon vs, Repent and sinne not: it standeth vs vpon to amende our faultes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our liues, and to frame our selues to all good workes, which God hath prepared for vs, that we should walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>But, ô the lamentable case of Iesus Christ! O the vnspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble churlishnesse of man! for if the churlishnesse of one wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked citie Ierusalem, did wring teares out of the glorious eyes of our Sauior Iesus Christ, and made him to sigh and sob, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee had dealt so vncur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouslie with him, so preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouslie with hir self, as to stone

Now what is Iesus Christe? and what are we? wee are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and therefore our due is death: but Iesus Christ is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: yea, saluation and life it selfe: and therefore to goe to him, and to leaue sinne, is to passe from death to life, from sorow of conscience to peace: yea, such a peace as passeth all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Behold how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel hath handled him, behold how his helhoundes haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, and all for s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nne. Behold his holy bodie racked,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:26873:162"/>
behold his holie feet &amp; handes rent with nails, his head crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes, his pretious side launced with a speare. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his pretious bloud drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, yea outstreaming: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold howe the onelie beloued sonne of God, our louing and blessed Sauiour, lo how tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouslie the ministers of Satan haue vsed him.</p>
            <p>But why are his holie armes outstretched? why dooth his holie head bow it selfe down? why are his feete and hands so torne with nailes? why dooth his pretious blood spinne out? why is this holie lamb of God so piteouslie slaughtered vpon the tree?</p>
            <p>Surely O man, thou thy selfe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:26873:162"/>
haste ministred the cause, and thy sinnes haue wrought this crueltie vppon this innocent Lambe Iesus Christe: so that if thou either loue Iesus Christ whome thy sinnes haue torne so cruelly, or tender thine own case, for whom he died so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifullie, beyond thy merit: sin no more, but repent, repent, repent, and defie the diuel, and al his tyrannie.</p>
            <p>Yea, and sith his head, his armes, his hands, his feete, his side, and pretious bloud doo so cleerelie shew the tyrannie of sinne: detest, abhor, and auoid it. And whereas his thornie crowne that tore his head: and the nailes that rent his handes and feete: and the speare, that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:26873:163"/>
pearsed his glorious side: doo all crie out vppon vs, that wee haue so rente and torne by our sinnes Iesus Christ our blessed Sauiour, let vs for shame bee ashamed of our villanie.</p>
            <p>Let vs lament, and repente our iniquities, least that the ve rie thornie crowne of his head the verie nailes that fastened him to the tree, and the speare that pearsed his side, doo testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a iust condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against vs, that we did so vnthankfully vse them to destroy the sonne of God, and yet doo commyt sinne, to our power seeking to slaie him againe.</p>
            <p>O yee butchers! consider this innocent Lambe, how he bleedeth, and sheaddeth his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:26873:163"/>
pretious bloud, to cleanse you from sinne, and so to saue you from Satan: drinke vp in faith the droppings of his bloud, and moisten your soules therwith: eate him and chewe him: for hee is the bread of life, which whosoeuer eateth, he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hunger any more.</p>
            <p>Bid war to old Adam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime battell against the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile serpent, and fight like good souldiers of Christ crucified, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne: that death and hel beeing put to the foile, by the strength of your valiant capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ye may at length be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred among the blessed saints of God for euer.</p>
            <p>But if al this will not moue thee, O foolish creature, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:26873:164"/>
neither the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruice of Satan, nor the horrible end of sinne, nor the maiestie or mercie of Iesus Christ, nor the villanie that sin wrought vnto him, which all ought to be forcible motiues, and sufficient retentiues from sinne: yet consider a while the condition of sinners, which of al other is most miserable.</p>
            <p>For first, they are Gods eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, euen such rebellious eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as with open armes in Satans quarrel, vnder corrupt nature, as their souereigne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist Gods gouernment: which thing, O sinfull man, is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most horrible, to be Gods enimie, to be at war with God to be hated of the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:26873:164"/>
puissant and omnipotente Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p>Neither doo sinners, by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against the honor of God vnder sinne and Satan, onelye purchase the anger and hatred of God vpon their heads: but also they greeue the courtiers of Ierusalem, which is aboue and put the Angels and Saints of God to great greefe and sor row.</p>
            <p>For if that they reioise at the conuersion of a sinner, and bee gladde when the loste groat is found, and the straieng sheepe brought to the sheepfold: then what greefe, what sorow, what heauinesse do sinners purchase vnto them, when being loste, they wil not be found: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:26873:165"/>
straieng sheepe, they will not be brought to the sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of grace againe.</p>
            <p>And heere it may please all sinners to consider, that as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting wee gladden the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saintes of God, and make the diuell to repine and greeue: so, when wee commit sinne, and decline from the right line of righteousnes, then do we keepe wakes for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, then dooth he hop for ioy, when we defraud the good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God of their ioy.</p>
            <p>These irreuocable sinners, these the Lorde dooth hate, as vtter enimies: yea, rotten and stinking carion is more sweete before men, than is such a soule before God and his Aungels.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:26873:165"/>
And therefore let all such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, not onelie because they are iniurious to God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue to the good: but also bicause they are stinking crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and such as the Lord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may nor will abide, vnles they returne vnto him in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and ashes: and therefore repent and amend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, those sinners that stop their eares against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of these motiues, let them consider their woonderous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. For sinne is the dung of the old serpent, and he that sinneth for the vilest thing that is, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh the most pretious iewel in heauen and earth.</p>
            <p>For what dooth mans soule lose by sinne? from whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:26873:166"/>
she? from whom doth she separate hir selfe? euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God her maker, her redeemer and Sauiour: yea when shee sinneth she forsaketh saluation and her owne safetie, she run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into the stinking lappe of the diuell her desperate aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, and hasteneth hirselfe vn to hell.</p>
            <p>Yea, by sinne the kingdome of the diuel is inlarged: for he that committeth sinne is the seruant of sinne. And what if I saye that sinne maketh man like to Satan? for whatsoeuer deformitie or filth is in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that is by sinne: of the which if the Deuill might bee freed, he were a noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creature. Euen so the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:26873:166"/>
soule of man, by sinne is made filthie and deformed like the Diuel. And what an iniurie is this to God, that by sinne, of his owne image, wee shoulde make the image of the diuell?</p>
            <p>Repent therefore, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thirdlie, that it gladdeneth the diuell to see vs sin, because thereby we become his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling house. Now how cursed a thing is sinne, which maketh the temple of God the temple of Satan? what follie: nay, what madnes is it to lodge the diuel in our heartes, and to driue Christ and his holie spirit out of doores?</p>
            <p>Why shoulde man deale so vnthankefullie with him, that being God, came from the top
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:26873:167"/>
of the heauens to this vallie of miserie, to take mans flesh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that hee might be his Iesus? or why should we sinne, and by continual sinning, bid adieu to the spirit of holines, &amp; harbor satan in our harts? shall he, by whom al creatures were made glorious, by sinne bee banished far from vs? and he, by whome all creatures were deformed, bee wholie lodged within vs?</p>
            <p>But tel me, O man, Christ is saluation, life, ioy, loue, and all in al; the diuell is the father of death, a murderer, a manslaier, a tyrant, a prince of darknesse, the worker of woe. Now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, doest thou like better of death, than of lyfe: of paine,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:26873:167"/>
than of ioye: of hatred, than loue: of damnation, than sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: and of hel, than of hea uen? if thou doo, then shalt thou depart curssed into the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting fire. But if thou doo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Iesus Christ, with his inesti mable blessings, before Satan: then why doost thou wallowe in sinne, which is the onelye waie to preferre Satan in this world, &amp; to establish his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darknes?</p>
            <p>Wherfore, O miserable man repent and amende: consider that Iesus Christ, like an euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical henne, neuer ceaseth clocking to gather thee vnder his winges like a chicken: let him not clock &amp; cal in vaine, neither be thou like vnto them
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:26873:168"/>
that stoppe their cares against the charmer, charme he neuer so wiselie.</p>
            <p>Consider that God created thee wholie to serue him, with al thy hart, soule, strength, and power: remember that thou at baptisme diddest vowe and swear obedience to his name: remember that before GOD, and al the bande of the holye Aungels and Saints, thou didst renounce satan, &amp; al his works, and repent, vnlesse thou wilte haue God and all his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Citizens, at the great daie of reuelation, to giue sentence of condemnation against thy periurie.</p>
            <p>And why, O miserable man, shouldest thou break thy faith
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:26873:168"/>
giuen to God in baptisme? it is not an oth to bee repented. For the seruice of the Lorde is onelie mans safetie, as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Satan is the only cause of mans miserie.</p>
            <p>The gailor that helde vs in a slauishe and spirituall Aegypt, was not Pharao, but the diuel, and that for sinne: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we couet to inhabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Againe, al the spirits in hell may cursse the filthie bondage
