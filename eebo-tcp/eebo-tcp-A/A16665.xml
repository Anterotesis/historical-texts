         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas many in the corruption of their erring opinions and reasonlesse arguments, haue auerred how <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the primarie mouer, conseruer and preseruer,</hi> yet Seneca will tell you, that it is God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth these things which we ascribe to a fained Deitie; and that <hi>Nature differeth no more from God or God from Nature,</hi> then <hi>Annaeus</hi> from <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Epist. ad Lucil.</note> Seneca:

as he speaketh in his naturall Questions, and in his bookes of Benefiting. But this was the opinion of such as had not the supreme light of deuine knowledge to them reuealed, but such as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped whatsoeuer they thought was a guider or director of them, or by custome (how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous soeuer) was traduced to them. So we may<note place="margin">Vide Episto.

Others worshipped trees, stockes, stones, and venimous serpents. Thus did the brutish affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of vnnaturall men shew their Gods by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphering an heauenly power or influence, in Branches and such workes of Nature. But these though in no wise excusable, may admit some reasonable defence, forasmuch as their conceipt could reach no further. For as <hi>Zenophanes</hi> saith, <hi>If</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zenophanes.</note> 
                     <hi>beasts could paint, they would pourtray God to their owne shape and feature, because they could conceiue no further.</hi> And this is the cause why the Heathen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored their plants, starres, and such creatures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they could not reach nor attaine to the knowledge of an higher Deitie. But to conferre them, that is, the Heathen and prophane people with the now-being Christians, it will seeme wonderfull, if I make manifest by relation had to their liues, how the depraued conditions of our Christians now adayes (whose knowledge giues them assurance of Eternitie) walke in as great blindnesse and palpable darknes as euer the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then<note place="margin">The occasion of this Treatise.</note> did.

And <hi>Pandora</hi> seemeth to make this speech or oration vnto them, as an introduction formally handled, for their pleasure &amp; delectation. Louing Arcadians, if this spacious world now so specious (whilome an indigested <hi>chaos</hi>) were first ordained for a place of libertie, do not you make it a cage of restraint. It was the will of Nature, who not onely founded but disposed of this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse as you see, that <hi>Men</hi> the hope of her loines and ioy of her life, should liue deliciously, and not be enfeebled by strict &amp; rigorous abstinence the

He is happie, and free from dangers menacing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or aspiring thoughts (Ambitions subtilest traines) vndermining at home. But <hi>Epictetus</hi> feare proceedeth from the height of his knowledge, fearing Death the abridgement of knowledge: yet fearelesse of Death it selfe, for it is nothing; but the issue of Death making his knowledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Polixenus</hi> none can disturbe; for his minde is fixed on that obiect which is placed before him; since Nature hath alotted him meate, drinke and apparell, he respects no more. Yet as rich as <hi>Bias,</hi> for he can sing,—<hi>Omnia mea mecum porto.</hi> But simple <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who reposeth so great trust in his Contemplatiue part, whereto auailes his studie? whereto tendeth this Speculation? since Art hath made him no wiser then to make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt wine and water.

When this—<hi>indigesta moles,</hi> this vnseasoned peece of matter had first receiued some forme or fashion, then presently as it increased in yeares, so it began to adorne it selfe with a comely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,

                  <p>IT is reported of <hi>Croesus,</hi> that he sent for <hi>Solon,</hi> well perceiuing that he was esteemed the wisest in Greece: to the intent he might see him placed in his maiesty, pompe, and great solemnity. When <hi>Solon</hi> was come, he demanded of him, whom he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23781:13"/>
thought to be the happiest man in the world; not doubting but he would conclude him to be the happiest, considering the magnificence of himself, the admiration of his attendants, &amp; the security of his state, grounded on such powerfull alliance. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> (contrary to his expectance) replyed, He could iudge none truly happie before his death,—<hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem ante obitum faelicem esse arbitror.</hi> Yet <hi>Croesus</hi> would not let him go so, but demanded further: whom he thought then liuing to be the happiest; whereto answered <hi>Solon, Tellus;</hi> &amp; who next saith <hi>Croesus?</hi> Next to <hi>Tellus</hi> do I esteeme <hi>Cleobis</hi> &amp; <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (who died in the very performance of parentall obedience:) &amp; so forward without the least men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of <hi>Croesus</hi> felicitie. Whereby it seemed that <hi>Croesus</hi> was much offended, though he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lde his anger for that present time, lest the foolish conceipt of his selfe-esteemed happinesse should become palpable. But within short time afterward <hi>He</hi> found <hi>Solons</hi> saying most true: for being taken prisoner by <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Persian king, he was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously punished, &amp; restrained by straite seuere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, till such time as a day was appointed for <hi>Croesus</hi> death: &amp; being to be set vpon the fagot, &amp; ready to suffer death, he cried forth: <hi>O Solon, Solon, vera sunt quae dixisti neminem ante obitum faelicem: Cyrus</hi> hearing these words, and enquiring the meaning of them, presently deliuered him, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: <hi>&amp; ea quoque mihi euenire possunt.</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the state of mans life to be vncertaine, and that none ought to plant his hopes vpon that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of fortune in terrene affaires, as to promise
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23781:14"/>
himselfe security in his state, or continuance of successe for one victorie atchieued: seeing her wings are not clipped, that her flight should be restrained, nor to any Prince so particularly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he onely should be by her attended. In briefe, as the onely hope of the vanquished con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the expectance of all extremitie: so is it the principall glory of the Conquerour, to moderate his fortune by a mild and tempreate bearing of himselfe to the conquered. Hence also haue wee sufficient argument of reproofe, towards such as take pleasure or delight in their abundance, as <hi>Croesus</hi> did, so as their minds become drowned, hauing no respect to the eternitie promised. The reason is, they repose their beatitude and felicity in things transitorie and vncertaine, not looking vp to the Author of all blisse and happinesse, who is the director and protector of all men, disposing them to the line and leuell of his blessed will, by expecting them foreslowing, inuiting them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, recalling them wandering, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them returning: without whose aide our strength is weakenesse, without whose light our sight is blindnesse, and without whose grace our endeuours are fruitlesse. For alas, what is mans di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection but distraction, what is his knowledge but imperfection, and what is the best of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution but confusion, wanting his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention that giueth to each worke a happy period and conclusion? Especially in this curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Labyrinth of mans life, wherein many Cymmerian windings (to wit, priuate seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23781:14"/>
are framed and cunningly contriued by that subtil-winged <hi>Dedalus.</hi> So as miserably are we forced to erre and stray, vnlesse by <hi>Ariadnes</hi> threed, that is, the heauenly light of Gods illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Spirit, we be directed and conducted in this vast Theatre of intricacy, to the <hi>flowrie Eden</hi> of endlesse felicitie. For without that all working po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, we are ouerwhelmed with darknesse, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attaine to the comfort of our soules, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the fruition of eternall consolation in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>To shew you the worthie intendments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of the <hi>Ancient,</hi> would but make a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish without effect: as by way of illustration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplefide in mortification, to shew you how <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> made himselfe an Eunuch, <hi>Democritus</hi> put out his owne eyes, <hi>Crates</hi> cast his monie into the sea, <hi>Thracius</hi> cut downe all his vines.

                        <hi>EVrystheus</hi> a potent and puissant Prince of Greece, by the instigation of <hi>Iuno</hi> imposed <hi>Hercules</hi> most difficult labours, to the end to haue him dispatched.

himselfe honour through their hate, gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to himselfe renowne, where his foe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ineuitable reuenge. Whence we may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect two remarkable things, no lesse fruitfull in obseruing, then delightfull in perusing. The one is, to note how prompt and prepared men of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued or vicious disposition are, to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the pleasure of great ones, how indirect or vnlawfull soeuer their pleasures be: directing and addressing their employments to the bent of their command, be it wrong or right. And these are such who account it good sauing policie, to keepe euer correspondence with greatnesse, esteeming no supportance firmer, no protection safer, then to hold one course with those high-mounting <hi>Cedars,</hi> from whose grouth the lower <hi>shrubs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue shadow and shelter. The second which I note, is to obserue what glorious and prosperous successe many haue, who pursued and iniuriously persecuted (like <hi>Zenocrates</hi> Sparrow) either find some compassionate bosome to cheare &amp; receiue them, or by the assistance of an vnconfined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>PErillus</hi> an excellent Artificer (being then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for excellent inuentions) to satisfie the inhumane disposition of the tyrant <hi>Phalaris,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in hope to be highly rewarded for his ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deuice: made a <hi>bull</hi> of <hi>brasse</hi> for a new kind of torment, presenting it to <hi>Phalaris,</hi> who made, triall thereof by tormenting <hi>Perillus</hi> first therein. From this Argument or subiect of <hi>reuenge,</hi> we may obserue two speciall motiues of Morall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or humane Caution. The first is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre vs from humoring or soothing such, on whom we haue dependence, in irregular or sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster respects. For the vertuous, <hi>whose comfort is the testimonie of a good conscience,</hi> scorne to hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with vicious men, whose commands euer tend to depraued and enormious ends. The second is, a notable example of <hi>reuenge</hi> in <hi>Perillus</hi> suffering, &amp; in <hi>Phalaris</hi> inflicting. Much was it that this curious Artizan expected, but with equall &amp; deserued censure was he rewarded: for inglorious

seconded by like ends. Hence the Satyre display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such in their natiue colours, who rather then they will lose the least esteeme with men of high ranke or qualitie, vse to dispence with faith, friend, and all, to plant them firmer in the affection of their Patron. But obserue the conclusion, as their meanes were indirect, so their ends sorted euer with the meanes. They seldome extend their temporizing houres to an accomplished age, but haue their hopes euer blasted, ere they be well bloomed: their iniurious aimes discouered, ere they be rightly leuelled: and their wishes to a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall period exposed, as their desires were to all goodnesse opposed. May all proiectors or state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forragers sustaine like censure, hauing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures so reluctant or opposite to all correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with honour. Longer I will not dilate on this subiect, but recollect my spirits, to adde more spirit to my ouer-tyred <hi>Satyre,</hi> who hath bene so long employed in the <hi>Embassie of Nature,</hi> and wearied in dancing the <hi>Wilde mans measure,</hi> that after <hi>Perillus</hi> censure she must repose ere she proceede any further; and take some breath ere I dance any longer.</p>
