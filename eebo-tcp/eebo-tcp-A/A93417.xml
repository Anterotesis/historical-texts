         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now concerning the Arreſts and Impriſonment of the Body, and
Extent of all the debtors Lands and goods for Satisfaction of debt;
acknowledged according to the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnell,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Statute <hi>de Mercatoribus</hi> made only between Marchant and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant;
as alſo the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the penalty of ſuch as ſhall
acknowledge a Recognizance, in the nature of the <hi>Statute Staple</hi> for
Marchandize; It is true, that they who doe Enter into ſuch Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
doe grant that the penalty in that Caſe provided, ſhall runne
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168197:3"/>
upon them; and give away their Liberty, by their owne conſent, and
are willing to be Enſlaved and ruined by the Creditor, in which caſe
the Maxime of <hi>Volenti non fit Injuria,</hi> is a proper anſwer.</p>
            <p>But for ſuch as at this day are Out-lawed, Arreſted, and Impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for Debt by <hi>Capias Vtlegatum;</hi> the <hi>Capias</hi> in corporate Cities,
and Boroughs, or by Bill of <hi>Midaleſex,</hi> or <hi>Latitat,</hi> before any Debt
or Damage is recovered, there being no poſitive Law now Extant, to
warrant the ſame; ſeemes to be utterly againſt the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and
an incroachment upon the Liberty of the Free-born people of <hi>England</hi>
by ill Cuſtome and uſe, which ought to be aboliſhed. And although
it be regulary true; that where a <hi>Capias</hi> lyes in Proceſs, there a <hi>Capias
ad Satisfaciendum</hi> lyes in Execution; yet that is intended in Actions,
<hi>Vi et armis</hi> only; for there a <hi>Capias</hi> did lye at the <hi>Common Law,</hi>
before and after <hi>Judgment,</hi> but not in Debt and detinue, before the
Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. So as it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Capias ad Satisfacien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>
in Debt, was never given by any <hi>Statute-Law</hi> to take the Body
in <hi>Execution,</hi> upon a recovery in any meer Perſonall action, contrary
to the <hi>Common-Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Statute of <hi>Bankrupts</hi> were made againſt Marchants, and
ſuch as got their living by Buying and Selling only, as may appeare by
all Caſes adjudged upon thoſe <hi>Statutes;</hi> yet of late times, there was
a particular Temporary-law intituled an <hi>Act for reliefe of Creditors
and poore Priſoners;</hi> that ſubjected all <hi>Debtors</hi> that were in Priſon, at
or before the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1653. and ſhould not pay their Debts
before the firſt of <hi>Aprill</hi> following, to be <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> and their Lands
and Eſtates were to be ſold by the <hi>Judges,</hi> in the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> nominated
for the ſatisfaction of their <hi>Creditors;</hi> which <hi>Act</hi> for weighty Reaſons
moving your Highneſs, was ſeaſonably ſuſpended by your <hi>Highneſs</hi>
and your <hi>Councell,</hi> and ſince by the late <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of all Priſoners; For the proceedings of the late <hi>Judges</hi> therein,
were ſo arbitrary and deſtructive to the Priſoners &amp; their Eſtates; that
if the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> ſhould have continued, or if any <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the like
nature ſhould hereafter be Eſtabliſhed (as ſome projecting Creditors
are now buſie and active to obtaine) it would bee of ſuch ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that all <hi>Priſoners</hi> now being, and all <hi>Debtors</hi> which hereafter
may be Priſoners, would be utterly ruined with their <hi>Poſterity</hi> alſo?
For the particular Aime and Ends, of ſome cruell and implacable
Creditors only (who have gone as farre as the Common practice will
permit, and that againſt their owne Election; for after the Body is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168197:3"/>
charged in <hi>Execution,</hi> the Creditor cannot reſort to the Goods or Lands of
the <hi>Debtor</hi> (while he liveth) but the <hi>Priſoner</hi> is to enjoy what Eſtate hee
hath without farther moleſtation of the Creditor, at whoſe ſute he is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
and as it is of ſad conſequence to the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> ſo it may in time
prove to all the Free people of the <hi>Nation;</hi> for that which befalls one may
happen to all, and the courſe of <hi>Out-lawing,</hi> and <hi>Arreſting,</hi> being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for Debt and detinue, and other perſonall Actions againſt the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law,</hi> and perſonall Liberry of the people; there is ſcarce any that lives
but may be brought to the ſame condition and Catigorie, who yet (though
free) upon a bare pretence of Debt, may be <hi>Out-lawed, Arreſted,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
(as too many of us now are) upon meer vexatious and feyned Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for which abuſe hee can have no reparation, although hee remaines
three <hi>Termes</hi> in priſon, unleſſe he can find ſufficient Baile beyond Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Recovery of Debts,</hi> and take away the <hi>Capias</hi> in all Civill cauſes, which
will be a moſt Honourable and juſt <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and prejudiciall to none;
for the Ancient and laudable proceedings were more remediall to Creditors
then that barbarous Impriſonment of the Debtor is or can bee; for if the
Debtor be worth nothing, it is againſt the Law of GOD, Nature, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that he ſhould live all his dayes in the grave of a <hi>Priſon;</hi> whereby
he is deprived of Friends, and diſabled for ever by any Induſtry in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to attaine to any Eſtate, wherewith to make ſatisfaction to his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

            <p>May it pleaſe your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and Honorable <hi>Councell,</hi> to reflect upon theſe <hi>Propoſals</hi> humbly offered to your Honorable and prudent Conſiderations, in order to the reſtoration of the Ancient <hi>Law,</hi> and proceedings for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Debt and damages, only aimed at by Your Petitioners.</p>

to try any fradulent ſettlement of any Lands or Goods made to defeat the
Creditor, by a Iury of Twelve men, and may be directed (if your <hi>Highneſs</hi>

By this courſe the Creditor will be ſure of his juſt Debt in a ſhort time, with little
Expence; alſo the Debtors Wife, and Children, of a Houſe, and ſome ſubſiſtance out
of the Third part, the Debtors themſelves of their Liberty, to follow their buſineſſe
and to ſerve the Common-wealth in their ſeverall ſtations, as occaſion ſhall require;
ſo ſhall Peace and much quiet redound to the Publique, when the power of Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the ſting of the Law, which is the <hi>Capias</hi> ſhall be taken away; ſo may the
Sheriffes ſerve the Common-wealth with much ſafety, being not ſubject to pay for
Eſcapes of Priſoners, Blood-ſhed, and Murther avoyded; which often happens by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting
of Debtors, who many times rather hazard their Lives upon a reſcue, then they
will looſe their precious Liberty, and indure the miſeries of a Priſon. Alſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
will be ſaved, which is commonly waſted in unneceſſary and vexatious Outlawries,
Arreſts, and Impriſonments, by malicious and male volent Creditors; and every man
will have their due from each other. Alſo by this courſe, Iuſtice can be no looſer,
when there is a generall and equitable Law, for the mutuall good of <hi>Creditor</hi> and
<hi>Debtor,</hi> now and hereafter. And the memoriall of this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> under your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
Government in a Caſe of ſuch Publique concerment, will be Honourable to
future Ages.</p>
