            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

magnifie our office,</hi> Rom. 11. 13. and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
it a <hi>singular gift</hi> of divine grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon us, that we should <hi>preach the
unsearchable riches of Christ,</hi> Eph. 3. 7, 8.
and accordingly to adorn our Ministry
by such lives and learning as becomes it,
and not to dishonour by sordid, earthly,
sensual, or brutish conversations, so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and divine an office.</p>
            <p>Neither shall I at all mention the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of it, which made the Prophet cry
out, <hi>I am a child,</hi> Jer. 1. 6. and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>who is sufficient for these things,</hi> 2 Cor.
2. 16. thereby teaching us by unwearied
diligence in our <hi>Studies,</hi> and assiduity in
our <hi>prayers,</hi> to wait upon God for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of his Spirit and grace, who alone
maketh able Ministers of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>But I shall speak a very little of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96726:7"/>
               <hi>necessity</hi> of this weighty work, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and provoke those who are call'd
unto it, with the more fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
with the more fidelity and assidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to attend upon it.</p>
            <p>A thing is necessary two ways, either
<hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> because it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
or <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> because it is
instituted as a special means unto some
great and weighty end which is to be
thereby attained. The preaching of the
Gospel is necessary both these wayes.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Necessitate praecepti,</hi> as in special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
appointed by Christ, who is the <hi>King
and Lawgiver</hi> in his Church, as his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sent him,</hi> and gave him a Commission
and a command to discharge the service
which was intrusted in his hand, which he
with all willingness and obedience set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
though it were not only to <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
but to <hi>dying,</hi> that so the <hi>pleasure of the
Lord might prosper in his hand:</hi> Even so
did <hi>he send forth his Disciples,</hi> John 20. 21.
with a strict commission and command
(as having all power in heaven and earth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96726:7"/>
given to him) <hi>to preach</hi> the Gospel,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. And in order to the
perpetual discharge of that service, he
appointed not onely Apostles, Prophets,
and Evangelists, which were temporary
officers, but <hi>Pastors and Teachers</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the same to the worlds end, for the
perfecting of the Saints, for the work of
the Ministry, for the building up of the
body of Christ, <hi>Eph. 4. 8—13.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the Apostles took special care
to commit the same service <hi>unto faithful
men,</hi> who might be able to teach others,
and <hi>appointed Elders</hi> to be ordained in
every City for carrying on this necessary
work, <hi>Acts 14. 23. 2 Tim. 2. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 5.
And <hi>as our Saviour by the argument drawn
from his power</hi> over them, and <hi>their love</hi>
to him, presseth the exercise of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon his Disciples, <hi>Matth. 28. 18, 19.
Iohn 21. 15—17.</hi> so <hi>do the Apostles</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
by the Author of their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency,
the holy Spirit, by the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi>
of God in his Church, <hi>by the blood</hi>
whereby it was purchased, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96726:8"/>
by the <hi>presence of God,</hi> by the <hi>judgement</hi>
to come, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. by the <hi>Crown of
Glory</hi> which they shall receive from the
chief Shepherd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. presse
diligence and fidelity in the same upon
those whom they ordained thereunto.</p>
            <p>2. It is necessary, <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the great <hi>Ends</hi> of conversion and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
for where there is <hi>no vision</hi> the
people <hi>perish,</hi> Prov. 29. 18. when they
were <hi>without a teaching Priest,</hi> they
were without <hi>the true God, 2 Chron.</hi> 15. 3.
no salvation without calling upon God,
no calling without faith, no faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearing, no hearing without a
<hi>Preacher.</hi> It is the Apostles <hi>gradation,</hi>
Rom. 10. 13—15. for albeit it be <hi>not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
naturale,</hi> which doth by an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal
and constant vertue perpetually
produce the effect intended, (for many
more are called than chosen) inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Prophet complains, <hi>who
hath believed our report?</hi> Isa. 53. 1. <hi>All
the day long have I stretched out mine hand
unto a rebellious people,</hi> Isa. 65. 2. yet it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96726:8"/>
is <hi>medium institutum,</hi> appointed by God
to be the <hi>Ministry of Reconciliation, 2 Cor.</hi>
5. 18. and the <hi>word of Grace,</hi> Acts 20.
32. whereby ordinarily men are called
to salvation, <hi>repentance and remission of
sinne,</hi> being thereby preached in the
Name of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. the Lord
working together therewith by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his power, as it pleaseth him,
and dividing unto every man as he will,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5—7. 12. 11.</p>
            <p>In one word, It is necessary, 1. In
regard <hi>of Christ,</hi> whose <hi>Authority</hi> insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth
it, and whose <hi>Glory</hi> is greatly
concerned in it, as being his <hi>effectual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi>
to demolish the Kingdom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and to bring into captivity every
thought to the obedience of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. 5.</p>
            <p>2. In regard of <hi>the Church</hi> of Christ,
the <hi>Collection, Edification, Perfection</hi> and
<hi>Salvation</hi> whereof doth so greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon it, as the mighty power of
God unto that purpose, <hi>Rom. 1. 16.
1 Cor.</hi> 1. 21. hereby men are <hi>gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96726:9"/>
and turned from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan
unto God, <hi>John 11. 52. Acts</hi> 26. 18.
hereby they are <hi>built up</hi> towards the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of their inheritance, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32.
hereby they are <hi>carried on</hi> in the unity
of the faith and knowledge of the Son
of God unto a <hi>perfect man,</hi> Eph. 4. 13.
Hereby they <hi>save</hi> themselves and those
that hear them, 1 <hi>Tim 4. 16. Acts</hi>
11. 14.</p>
            <p>3. In regard of <hi>our selves,</hi> It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
1. <hi>Ad impletionem muneris,</hi> for of
all Stewards, the Stewards of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of God must be found <hi>faithfull,
1 Cor. 4. 2. 2. Ad Acquisitionem Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
for they that turn many to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
shall <hi>shine as Starres</hi> for ever
and ever, <hi>Dan 12. 3. 3. Ad evitationem
periculi,</hi> for woe be unto us if we preach
not the Gospel, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. So every
one of these wayes a <hi>necessity is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore great diligence, fidelity
and wisdome is to be used in this so
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96726:9"/>
weighty a service. It is no small work
whereby <hi>strong holds</hi> must be pulled
down, and every <hi>high thing</hi> that exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it self against the Kingdom of God
be demolished, whereby sinne and Satan
must be dispossessed, and the whole man
subdued to the obedience of Christ,
whereby the very natural propensions
of men must be changed, and they effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
perswaded to hate what they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
to love what they hated, to deny
themselves, their reason, their will, their
appetites, their interests, their lands,
their relations, their lives, their All, (for
this they must sometimes do <hi>quoad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitium,</hi>
ever <hi>quoad praeparationem animi</hi>)
to please an invisible God, and to obtain
an invisible inheritance. This is not the
work of an <hi>illiterate Reader,</hi> but of one
who hath the <hi>tongue of the learned,</hi> a
workman that need not to be ashamed.
This is not the work of a <hi>carless loite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
that shears the fleece, and starves the
flock, but of one who gives himself
wholly to it. So did those <hi>Renowned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96726:10"/>
Bishops</hi> in the primitive times, we read
every where in Saint <hi>Chrystome</hi> of his
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> intimating that he was a
daily preacher; and of Saint <hi>Ain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
his <hi>Omni Die Dominico,</hi> as Saint
<hi>Austin</hi> tells us, <hi>Confess. 6. c. 3. prayer
and preaching</hi> are two excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
parts of the Ministery of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
appointed as mutual helps and
furtherances each to other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they on either hand do very ill,
who justle out and disparage the one
by the other, as if performing the one
were a sufficient discharge of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Function, and means of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
edification and salvation without
the other. Certainly our <hi>Saviours
Commission</hi> extends to the <hi>worlds end,
Matth.</hi> 28. 20. as long as there are
strong <hi>holds</hi> to be demolished, sin to be
reproved, a Church to be edified, Saints
to be perfected, enemies to be resisted,
there will be a necessity of every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Christ, by which these great
works may be effected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96726:10"/>
And unto the more sure effecting of
them, this weighty work of <hi>preaching</hi> is to
be managed and discharged with that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
skill that we may <hi>approve our selves
unto God,</hi> as workmen that need not be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>

the conscience, and make powerful and
awakening discoveries and impressions
upon the <hi>practical judgement,</hi> which may
not by any sophisms or subterfuges be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded,
or gain-said; this the Apostle
calleth <hi>demonstrative or convincing preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
My speech and my preaching was not
with enticing words of mans wisdom,</hi> with
ostentation of wit or humane Elocution,
with Rhetoricating sophismes, or plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
insinuating deceptions, as <hi>Cicero</hi>
somewhere boasteth that he had dazled

complains of many in his time, <hi>id
habent curae non quomodo Scripturarum
medullas ebibant, sed quomodo aures populi
Declamatorum flosculis mulceant:</hi> But
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96726:11"/>
saith the Apostle, my preaching was
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. In a spiritual,
powerful and invincible <hi>demonstration,</hi>
which admits not of any possibility of
being gain-said or disproved; for such
is that syllogisme which the Philosopher
calls a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> wherein a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is most evidently deduced ex
<hi>principiis primis necessariis &amp; per se veris,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 4. and elsewere, speaking of
an unbeliever, who heareth Evangelical
preaching, he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
he is so <hi>convinced,</hi> that he
is <hi>judged;</hi> the <hi>secrets of his heart</hi> are so
discovered, that he falls on his face as a
cast and convicted prisoner, worshippeth
God, and acknowledgeth God to be in
such preaching, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. so the
Prophet is said to <hi>judge</hi> men when he
maketh them <hi>know</hi> the abomination of
their fathers. <hi>Ezek</hi> 20. 4. and once
more, we have <hi>not,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<hi>walked craftily, nor handled the Word of
God deceitfully,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
by <hi>manifestation,</hi> or evident discovering
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96726:11"/>
of the truth, <hi>we commend our selves to
every mans conscience in the sight of God,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. and thus it is said of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
That his adversaries were <hi>not able
to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which
he spake,</hi> Act. 6. 10.</p>
            <p>2. With <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>seasonablenesse,</hi>
as men are able to heare and bear, so
Christ spake the word, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 33.
<hi>John</hi> 16. 12. we must have <hi>milk</hi> for
the weak, and <hi>meat</hi> for the strong, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
our Ministry as to prevent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all occasions of prejudice and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
from any which watch for matter
of advantage and exception against us.</p>
            <p>3. With <hi>sincerity and faithfulnesse,</hi>
not dissembling any necessary doctrine,
nor dawbing with untempered morter,
nor corrupting the Word of Truth, but
delivering the <hi>whole counsel of God,
pleasing</hi> men in all things for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and edification, and to all other
purposes, <hi>not pleasing men but God which
trieth the heart,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 33. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4.
speaking his words whether men will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96726:12"/>
hear or forbear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 7. and telling
them the Truth, though we be judged
<hi>enemies</hi> for so doing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>4. With spiritual power and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
as Christ did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 29. to <hi>declare</hi>
unto men their <hi>transgression</hi> in such a
manner <hi>as to judge</hi> them for it, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 8.
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 4. that their hearts may be
<hi>pricked,</hi> Acts 2. 37. and they made to
fall on their face and give glory to God,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25. to <hi>shew</hi> unto a man <hi>his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse</hi>
in such a manner as that he may
find God <hi>gracious</hi> to him, and may see
his face with joy, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 23.—26. so to
preach the word as <hi>to binde</hi> and <hi>loose,</hi> to
<hi>remit</hi> and <hi>retain,</hi> to <hi>heal</hi> and <hi>settle</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of our hearers, that they may
finde the Gospel come unto them,
<hi>not in word only, but in power,</hi> 1 Thes.
1. 5.</p>
            <p>5. With <hi>meeknesse</hi> and all winning
insinuations, that there may appear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>love</hi> and <hi>gentlenesse</hi> in every
thing which we deliver; as the Apostle
professeth to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96726:12"/>
was <hi>gentle among them, as a nurse che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
her children,</hi> 1 Thes. 2. 7. and
exhorteth <hi>Timothy</hi> and other spiritual
persons <hi>with meeknesse to instruct</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
and to restore such as are overtaken
with any fault, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 24, 25. Gal.</hi> 6. 1.
It is an <hi>excellent Character</hi> which Saint
<hi>Austin</hi> giveth of a preacher, that he
should so manage his Office, <hi>ut doceat,
ut delectet, ut flectat, ut intelligenter, ut
libenter, ut obedienter audiatur.</hi> So to teach
as withal to delight and perswade, and
by a constraint of love to gain willing
and chearful obedience to the doctrine
which he teacheth.</p>
            <p>6. With courage and <hi>boldnesse,</hi> not to
fear the faces of any presumptuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who dare to affront the Law, and
not to fear the face of God. Shall any
man be so bold as to do what God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids?
and shall a Minister be so timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as not to speak what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?
Shall I be afraid to offend him
by doing my <hi>duty</hi> who is not afraid to
offend God by neglecting his? Shall I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96726:13"/>
be afraid to save him who is not afraid
to destroy himself? or shall I be dismaid
at the face and frown of a man, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the wrath of God who can tear me
in pieces? <hi>be not dismayed at their face,</hi>
saith the Lord, <hi>least I confound thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them,</hi> Jer. 1. 17. yet this boldnesse
must be in a way of <hi>conviction</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
without indiscretion</hi> and exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that when we shew our <hi>zeal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
mens <hi>sins,</hi> we may withal manifest
our <hi>love</hi> to their <hi>persons,</hi> and that <hi>honor</hi>
and reverend esteem which we owe to
their dignities and conditions.</p>
            <p>Lastly, our <hi>Lives and Examples</hi> must
teach the people as well as our doctrine,
we must be like the <hi>Star</hi> which did not
onely lighten the wise men, but lead
them unto Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 9. He who
by his wicked life buildeth againe those
things, which by his holy doctrine he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
maketh himself a transgressor,
<hi>Gal. 2. 18. verbis tantum philosophari non
doctoris est sed historionis.</hi> It is rather pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry
than serious piety, for men to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96726:13"/>
preach Angelical Sermons, and to live
diabolical conversations, <hi>ut dicta factis
deficientibus erubescant,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
speaks. We cannot expect that other
men should follow our doctrine, when
we our selves forsake it, the greatest part
of men being like sheep, which go <hi>non qua
eundum sed qua itur,</hi> rather as they are
<hi>led</hi> then as they are <hi>taught.</hi> And so much
of the duty here supposed, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
necessity, and manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>We proceed to the object or matter
of preaching, expressed, 1. <hi>Negatively,
not our selves.</hi> Men may be said <hi>to
preach themselves</hi> these four ways.</p>
            <p>1. When they make themselves <hi>Lords
over the flock,</hi> and exercise <hi>dominion</hi> over
the consciences of those that hear them,
as if a Ministry were a <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> or as
if the sheep were their own, to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and disposed as they please; this
is the character which the Apostle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
of the <hi>man of sinne,</hi> that he <hi>sitteth
as God in the Temple of God,</hi> usurping a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96726:14"/>
divine authority over the souls of men,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4. and exercising a bloody ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
over their bodies. And therefore
both our Saviour and his Apostles to
prevent the danger of so tempting an
ambition have left strict and severe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
against it. <hi>Be not you called Rabbi,
for one is your Master, even Christ,</hi> Matth.
23. 8.—12. <hi>We have not dominion over
your faith, but are helpers of your joy, 2 Cor.</hi>
1. 24. <hi>Not as being Lords over Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage,
but ensamples to the flock,</hi> 1 Pet.
5. 3.</p>
            <p>2. When they make themseves the
<hi>Authors</hi> of their own Ministry, underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
so weighty an employment of their
own heads, and <hi>running before</hi> they are
<hi>sent,</hi> as many did in the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi>
time, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 21. And many more in
in the late licentious days amongst us,
of whom we may say as the Historian
said of an obscure person, that he was
<hi>Homo ex se Natus,</hi> they were <hi>Concionatores
ex semetipsis Nati,</hi> self created preachers,
as <hi>Agathocles,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> of a <hi>Potter,</hi> a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96726:14"/>
               <hi>Preacher</hi> of a <hi>Trooper,</hi> men who made it
the principal business of their usurped
preaching to disgrace, and pull down le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
preachers, and beget an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of those serious principles, which
they knew sober and fixed Divines would
never desert, and contrary unto which
they were resolved to act.</p>
            <p>3. When they make themselves the
<hi>Matter</hi> of their preaching, prophesying
<hi>lies</hi> and the <hi>deceits</hi> of their own hearts,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 16, 26. teaching for doctrines
the traditions or <hi>commandments of men,</hi>
Mat. 15. 9. making <hi>sad the righteous,</hi> and
<hi>strengthning</hi> the hands of the wicked by
their lies, following their own spirits,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 3, 22. venting in the place and
name of Christ their own passions, and
animosities, their own interests and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
their own private opinions and
paradoxes, somenting distempers, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
discontents and divisions in the
hearts of the people, corrupting the

made it his onely end to please God,
and by all means to save souls, to manage
his Masters interest and not his own,
that Christ alone might be glorified in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96726:16"/>
the hearts of men; for how much so
ever we <hi>attribute to our selves,</hi> so much
we detract from Christ. Whom the
Apostle makes the <hi>sole matter</hi> of his
preaching.</p>
            <p>Which leads to the <hi>positive</hi> part of
our preaching, <hi>Christ Jesus the Lord,</hi>
whereby is intimated that the Lord
Jesus is both the <hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
and the <hi>End</hi> of all our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>1. The Lord Jesus is the <hi>Authour</hi> and
<hi>Instituter</hi> of this service in his Church;
how high a presumption it is for men to
intrude into a Ministry without a call
and warrant from God, the sad examples
of <hi>Corah, Dathan, Abiram, Vzziah,</hi> the
<hi>vagabond Exorcists,</hi> Acts 19. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—16. and
others do abundantly testifie. And
therefore as <hi>Aaron</hi> was solemnly sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to minister to the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
23. 13. and in like manner Christ was
<hi>called of God an high Priest</hi> after the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> Heb. 5. 5, 6, 7, 10.
Even so were his <hi>Apostles sent by him,

course to be observed afterwards, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. from him then, and those
whom he hath appointed must we receive
both our <hi>mission</hi> and our <hi>message,</hi> our
whole Ministry we must <hi>receive in the
Lord,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Archippus,</hi> Col. 4. 17.
It must be <hi>given</hi> and <hi>committed</hi> to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we presume to take unto our selves
the stiles of Ambassadors for Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
            <p>1. From him we must have <hi>our Mission,</hi>
for <hi>how shall they preach except they be sent,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. an <hi>Honor</hi>
must not be undertaken without a <hi>Call,
No man taketh this honour unto himself, but
he that is called of God,</hi> Heb. 5. 4. the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
Function is an <hi>honour,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sheweth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. A <hi>Trust</hi> must
not be undertaken without a <hi>Call,</hi> the
Ministry is a Trust and AEconomy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
9. 17. Great would be the disorder and
confusion, great the mischief and danger,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96726:17"/>
if hereticks and seducers might of their
own heads sow their tares &amp; subvert the
souls of men; if ignorant and self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
men may heap up to themselves
Hearers; if giddy and unstable people
may run after novelties, and be carried
about with divers and strange doctrines;
if so honorable an Office should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to contempt, and be destitute of
divine blessing and assistance by the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of unqualified and worthless Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>A <hi>call</hi> then is necessary. And this <hi>call,</hi>
though mediate and by the Ministry of
men, is from Christ. <hi>Pastors and Teachers,</hi>
who have onely a <hi>mediate call,</hi> are set up
by him as well as Apostles and Prophets,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. the <hi>Elders of Ephesus,</hi> though
appointed by an ordinary call, are said to
be made <hi>Overseers by the holy Ghost,</hi> Act.
20. 28.</p>
            <p>This Call is twofold, Internal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
1. <hi>Internal,</hi> standing, 1. In an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of <hi>fit qualifications</hi> for so weighty
a work, <hi>viz. 1. Sanctity of life,</hi> which may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96726:17"/>
fit and dispose for the faithful and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
discharge of the Office, to make a
man<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 17. 16.</note> zealous for the glory of God, sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the interest of souls,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 11, 12</note> exemplary

               </note>
the consolations of the holy
Spirit, and other the deep mysteries of
salvation. 2. <hi>Soundness of Doctrine,</hi> and
such able parts of substantial learning,
as that he may be<note n="h" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>apt to teach,</hi> to<note n="i" place="margin">Isa, 50. 4.</note>

use <hi>sound speech which cannot be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
It is not a little measure of learning
which will serve to open the Scriptures,
to confute errours, to state questions, to
decide controversies, to resolve cases, to
speak with demonstration and authority
to the consciences of sinners. The Lord
hath been pleased to intersperse some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of almost all kinde of other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
besides divine, in the Scriptures.
<hi>Physick,</hi> in what is reported of beasts,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96726:18"/>
birds, plants, meteors, precious stones,
<hi>&amp;c. Ethicks and Politicks</hi> in <hi>Solomons
Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastes. Logick and
Rhetorick</hi> in the strong reasonings, and
powerful Elegancies of Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
<hi>Mathematicks and Architecture</hi> in
the structure of <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, and of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
and <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Temple. <hi>Languages,</hi> the
Old Testament being written in <hi>Hebrew</hi>
and <hi>Chalde,</hi> the New in <hi>Greek.</hi> Allusions
to <hi>Exotick and profane</hi> History and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<hi>Mythology, Parables, Poetry,</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
out of prophane writers. And all
this to instruct us what abundance of
learning is requisite unto him who will
rightly understand and divide the word
of Truth. 3. <hi>Aptnesse to teach,</hi> spiritual
skill and wisdom to shew himself <hi>a Scribe
instructed to the Kingdom of heaven, Mat.</hi>
15 32. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
expressions are, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 2. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>2. This <hi>Internal call</hi> standeth in a
sincere desire, by the secret work of
God on the heart, to serve him and his
Church in the work of the Ministry,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96726:18"/>
and that not out of ambition, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or carnal affections, but out of an
intire regard to the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of souls.</hi> The Apostle calleth it
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. a willingnesse unto it,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 17. an <hi>addicting</hi> ones self unto
it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 15. an <hi>offering</hi> a mans self to
be sent by God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>External call</hi> instituted by
Christ in his Apostles, is managed by
their successors, the Bishops and Pastors
of the Church. 1. In <hi>Examination</hi> of the
fitnesse of those who judge themselves
thus inwardly called, by the preceding
qualifications, that the office may not be
invaded by ignorant or unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. 2. In <hi>Approbation,</hi>
when upon trial men are found able,
willing, apt, faithful, the Church by her
Officers declareth them such, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
testimony unto them, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
doth unto <hi>Epaphras</hi> and <hi>Tychicus,
Col.</hi> 1. 7. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>3. In separation and <hi>solemn consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
unto the function by fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96726:19"/>
commending the persons so approved
unto the grace of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2. 14. 23.
And this done in <hi>the Church Assembly,
praesente plebe,</hi> whose assent and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was anciently required, of which we
read in Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Ep. 68. <hi>Concil.
Carthag. 4. can.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and in <hi>Leo. Ep.</hi> 89.
Hereby the Church are <hi>witnesses,</hi> and (not
declaring their dissent and dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<hi>Approvers</hi> of what is done. And
it was done with the Rite and Ceremony
of Imposition of hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 23. as
importing, 1. A dedication and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the person to the Office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.
18. 2. A deriving authority to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Office. 3. An imploring the
gifts, blessing, protection, custody of the
holy Spirit upon them, and commending
them to the Grace of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 26.
Thus from Christ and according to his
Institution Ministers of the Gospel have
their Mission.</p>
            <p>2. From him they must receive their
<hi>Message.</hi> He is <hi>King</hi> in the Church, and
they <hi>his Ambassadors,</hi> who must from him
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96726:19"/>
only receive their instructions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
20. they must speak <hi>His Words,</hi> Ezek.
2. 7. that the Church may have a proof
of <hi>Christ speaking in them,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 3.
and of the <hi>Counsel of God</hi> delivered by
them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. teaching the people
the things <hi>which he hath commanded,</hi> Mat.
28. 20. <hi>His command is our commission.</hi> We
must deliver nothing but what we have
<hi>Received. I have received of the Lord that
which also I delivered unto you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.
23. <hi>That which I have heard,</hi> saith the
Prophet, <hi>of the Lord of Hosts, the God of</hi>
Israel, <hi>have I declared unto you,</hi> Isa. 21. 2.
<hi>Speak unto all the Cities of</hi> Judah <hi>which come
to worship in the Lords House All the
words which I command thee to speak unto
them, diminish not a word,</hi> Jer. 26. 2. <hi>What
thing soever I command you observe to do it,
thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from
it,</hi> Deut. 12. 32. <hi>If any man speak, let
him speak as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.
11. The Lord hath committed unto us
the Word and <hi>Ministry of Reconciliation,</hi>
what we do in attendance on that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96726:20"/>
we do <hi>in Christs stead,</hi> and therefore
ought seriously to consider with our
selves, whether the words which we
speak unto the people, be, for the truth,
gravity, and sanctity of them, such, as may
without indignity done to Christ, have
his name and authority prefixed on
them. He will not own the dictates
and inventions of men for the Oracles of
God. Though it belong to the duty,
authority, and wisdom of the <hi>Church</hi> to
direct meer <hi>circumstantials</hi> in the service
of God, so as may most conduce unto
that <hi>order and decency</hi> which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
so as may best become the serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
simplicity, and sanctity of so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and spiritual worship: Yet she
may not impose <hi>as doctrines her command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
Mat. 15. 9. She may <hi>not adde any
thing</hi> to the alsufficiency and plenitude
of the holy Scriptures, <hi>Deut. 4. 2. Prov.</hi>
30. 6. when we speak of the means of
<hi>salvation,</hi> of the rules, principles, and
grounds of <hi>faith and worship,</hi> of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate
subject of <hi>Evangelical preaching,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:96726:20"/>
we must keep <hi>to the law and testimonies, if
we speak not according unto them, it is because
there is no light in us,</hi> Isa. 8. 20. no doctrine
is necessary or sufficient to carry us unto
Heaven, but that which first came down
from heaven. Thus we <hi>preach Christ Jesus
the Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> both of our
<hi>Mission</hi> and of our <hi>Message.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. We <hi>preach Christ Jesus the Lord,</hi>
as the <hi>Matter</hi> and substance of our
preaching; there is not any matter of
preaching, which doth not either <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi>
or <hi>reductive</hi> comprise <hi>Christ</hi> in it.
<hi>We preach Christ crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23.
<hi>I determined not to know any thing among
you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified,</hi>
1 Cor. 2. 2.</p>
            <p>All materials of Religion are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under four heads, <hi>Agenda, Credenda,
Petenda, Participanda,</hi> duties to be done,
mysteries to be believed, mercies to be
implored, seals to be imparted.</p>
            <p>1. Of the <hi>Agenda,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> is the Rule,
and this is a <hi>Schoolmaster to bring us unto
Christ,</hi> Gal. 3. 24. Consider it as <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96726:21"/>
of Life,,</hi> and so it sends us unto
Christ, by whose onely <hi>obedience</hi> the
<hi>Righteousnesse</hi> thereof hath been <hi>fulfilled</hi>
for us, <hi>I am not come to destroy the Law, but
to fulfill it,</hi> Mat. 5. 17. by whose onely
<hi>sufferings</hi> and satisfaction the <hi>curse</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hath been <hi>removed</hi> from us, <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 13.
Christ is the end of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi>
10. 4.</p>
            <p>Consider it as a <hi>Rule of living,</hi> and so
also it sends us unto Christ. 1. His <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Doctrine</hi> openeth the sense and
wideness thereof unto us, for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is exceeding broad, this was
one great end of his Sermon in the
Mount to vindicate the Law from the
narrow glosses which had been cast upon
it. 2. His most <hi>holy example leads</hi> us in
the way of it, that we may walk as he
walked, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 21. 1 John</hi> 2. 6. 3. His
<hi>holy Spirit and Grace,</hi> and his love shed
abroad in our hearts, enable and constrain
us to the obedience of it, <hi>I am able,</hi> saith
the Apostle, <hi>to do all things through Christ
who strengthened me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. We must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96726:21"/>
never preach the Law without Christ.
As it was delivered, so it must be <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
In the hand of a Mediator,</hi> Gal. 3. 19.
when we discover the <hi>disease</hi> we must
shew the <hi>Physician.</hi> So God to <hi>Adam,
1. Conviction,</hi> where art thou? then
<hi>consolation,</hi> the seed of the woman shall
bruise the serpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 9, 15.
So <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to the multitude, first
<hi>generation of Vipers,</hi> then, <hi>bring forth fruits
worthy of Repentance,</hi> Luke 3. 7, 8. So
Christ to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> first, <hi>thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> art poore,
and blinde, and naked:</hi> then, <hi>I counsel thee
to buy of me gold tried,</hi> Rev. 3. 17, 18. Thus
<hi>Omnia Agenda</hi> lead to Christ.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Omnia Credenda</hi> contained in the
Gospel are comprized in Christ.</p>
            <p>1. All the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Gospel, as
is evident by every <hi>Article</hi> of the Creed.
I believe in the <hi>Father</hi> as the Father of
Christ; By whom he made the world,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. and in whom he is our Father,
<hi>John</hi> 20. 17. I believe in the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
who is the Spirit of Christ, <hi>Rom. 8. 9. Gal.
4. 6. Vicarius Christi,</hi> who brings him and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96726:22"/>
his comforts to the soul. I believe the
<hi>holy Catholick Church,</hi> the Spouse of
Christ, the Body of Christ, the <hi>fulness
of him that filleth all in all,</hi> Eph. 1. 23. <hi>caput
&amp; corpus unus est Christus.</hi> I believe the
<hi>communion of Saints,</hi> &amp; our communion is
with the Father &amp; the son as K. of Saints,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. and with holy Angels and men,
<hi>as subjects</hi> to that King. The <hi>Remission of
sins,</hi> and this is from him, It must be
preached in <hi>his Name,</hi> Luke 24. 47. The
<hi>resurrection of</hi> the body, and this also is
from him; <hi>The Son quickeneth whom he
will</hi> John 5. 21, 25. John 11. 25. The
life everlasting, and this from him.
<hi>Christ in us the hope of glory,</hi> Col. 1. 27.</p>
            <p>2. All the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Gospel
have their foundation and stability in
Christ; they are <hi>in him yea, and Amen,
2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. He the <hi>purchaser</hi> of them
by his propitiation: He the <hi>procurer</hi> of
them by his Impetration: He the <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
of them by his Princely Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>
            <p>3. All the <hi>Comminations</hi> of the Gospel
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96726:22"/>
lead us to consider Christ as the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
and Refuge,</hi> through whom they are
by believers to be avoided, as the <hi>Prince
and Judge</hi> by whom they are upon unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
to be inflicted, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42, 43.
13. 39.</p>
            <p>4. The whole <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> leads
us unto him. For as the Covenant of
<hi>Works</hi> was made with the <hi>first Adam</hi> in
behalf of his posterity, so the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Grace</hi> is made with the second
<hi>Adam</hi> in behalf of his posterity. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both <hi>God and man</hi> is equally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Interests of both; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he preserves Gods interest by his
satisfaction and righteousnesse, and mans
interest by reconciliation and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
He is the <hi>Surety of the Covenant,</hi>
for the satisfaction of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22.
and he is the <hi>Mediator of the Covenant</hi> for
the reconciliation of man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. Thus
<hi>omnia credenda</hi> lead unto him.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Omnia Petenda,</hi> All things to be
prayed for do necessarily carry us unto
Christ. <hi>His Father</hi> the answerer of our

our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Eph. 3. 14. His

<hi>Baptisme simulacrum mortis &amp; Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis
Christi,</hi> the image of the death
and resurrection of <hi>Christ,</hi> wherein we
are planted and regenerated to his <hi>life</hi>
and <hi>likenesse.</hi> The <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> the
<hi>Memorial</hi> of the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> wherein
we feed and feast upon him as our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover
which was sacrificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>In one word, we preach him, 1. <hi>In
his Office,</hi> as the <hi>Christ</hi> anointed of his
Father. 2. In the great <hi>Ends</hi> of those
Offices, which are to be our <hi>Jesus</hi> to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96726:23"/>
save us, and <hi>our Lord</hi> to Rule us; to be
a <hi>Prince and a Saviour to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Remission of sinnes,</hi> Acts
5. 31.</p>
            <p>III. We preach Christ Jesus the Lord
as the <hi>great End</hi> of all our preaching, that
thereby we may advance his interest, and
promote his designs, that he may <hi>see of
the travel of his soul and be satisfied.</hi> That
his people may be gathered, his body e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified,
his Saints perfected, his enemies
subdued, his Gospel propagated, his
name glorified, and he finally admired
in all them that believe, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10.
These are <hi>in se finis operis,</hi> Eph. 4. 12.
and they ought to be in us <hi>finis ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having secured Christs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and interest, the Apostle returns
again to himself, and sheweth in what
capacity he looketh on himself in the
Church of Christ, not as a Lord, but as
a <hi>servant. Our selves your servants,</hi> far
from the temper of those whom you
suffer to bring you into bondage, to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96726:24"/>
smite, to devoure you, to exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. Whatever titles of
honour or dignity the pastors of the
Church are adorned withal, (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
assureth us of an <hi>Honor</hi> due unto
it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. and an <hi>Authority</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8.) yet this
very <hi>honour</hi> consists in a <hi>service</hi> which
they owe to the Church of Christ. Christ
onely hath domination and preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
all others, even Apostles themselves,
nothing but service and Ministry. As
the Priests and Levites are commanded
by <hi>Josiah, to serve the Lord and his people</hi>
Israel, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 3. The highest Officers
and noblest abilities are all the Churches,
and for their edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22.
The <hi>Names</hi> in Scripture given to Pastors,
as Stewards, Ministers, Watchmen, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
all import a <hi>service,</hi> excluding
domination, which our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbids, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25. 28. Inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
humility, industry, fidelity, love,
helpfulnesse, all endeavours to attend the
service of the Churches faith, as the
Apostle calls it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:96726:24"/>
Yet withal they are such servants and
stewards as are also <hi>Rulers,</hi> so they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Luke 12. 42. 1 Tim. 5. 17. serviunt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitati
non potestati,</hi> servants they are to
the souls of the people, but not to their
power, whom the people have no despoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
authority over, but are to submit unto
as unto those that watch for their souls,
1 <hi>Cor. 16. 15, 16. Heb.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Apostle addeth, That
they are the peoples <hi>servants for Jesus sake,</hi>
in order to the promoting of his Honour
and interest in the Church. The Church is
his Spouse, his Flock, his Body, is to him the
purchase of his own Blood. We are his
Officers, and must give an account of you
to him. Our Love, our Loyalty, our Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
our Fear of him constrain us to spend
and to be spent in the service of your souls.
He is our <hi>Jesus</hi> and your <hi>Jesus,</hi> as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
our own salvation from him, or
value and desire yours, we must serve your
faith and shew our selves his servants by
being yours.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude all with a word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96726:25"/>
to my reverent Brethren in this
sacred Function, and you that are candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
thereof,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Preach</hi> the Gospel, <hi>be instant in season
and out of season reprove,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>rebuke, exhort with
all long suffering and doctrine;</hi> think not
much to further the salvation of those by
your labours, whom Christ purchased with
his blood, <hi>Magnifie your Office,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13.</note> not by pomp
and state, by scorn or superciliousnesse;
these things debase it; but by humble and
painful attendance upon the Ministry
<hi>which you have received of the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 4. 17.</note> Esteem
not that a needless Office, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
hath made <hi>necessary;</hi> nor a bootlesse
service unto the performance whereof so
great a <hi>Reward,</hi> unto the omission whereof
so great a <hi>woe</hi> is annexed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16, 17.
If you be not moved by the souls of others,
preach for your own sakes, that you may
<hi>save your selves.</hi> If you value not your
own salvation, preach for the sake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that you may <hi>save those that hear you,</hi>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. If there be yet <hi>ignorance</hi> in the
people, let them not continue in darknesse
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96726:25"/>
for want of your teaching. If there be yet
<hi>sins</hi> amongst them, let them not perish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, for want of your <hi>Reproving.</hi> If
they be yet <hi>imperfect,</hi> let them not be still
children, for want of your <hi>instructing;</hi> if
they be yet exposed to <hi>Temptation,</hi> let not
Satan swallow them up, for want of your
<hi>Resisting</hi> him. If Satan destroy men by his
suggestions, he shall not answer for them
as an <hi>officer</hi> (he had not inspection over
them) but as a <hi>Murtherer</hi> onely. If you
destroy them by your negligence, if the
<hi>Shepherds</hi> do not feed, nor the <hi>Physicians</hi>
heal, nor the <hi>Watchmen</hi> keep, nor the <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
provide for the flock, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
a <hi>trust,</hi> abused a Lord, exposed a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi>
you shall give an account, not
onely for souls murthered, but for an <hi>office</hi>
neglected, for a <hi>talent</hi> hidden, for a <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardship</hi>
unfaithfully and injuriously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred.
O therefore studiously and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
apply your selves to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
skill of <hi>spiritual preaching.</hi> Preach
in good earnest, as those who seriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their own and their hearers salvation.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96726:26"/>
Preach not as a Rhetorician at a Desk, only
to tickle ears, and to play a prize; but as
an Advocate at a Bar to preserve a Client,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 8, 9.</note>
to save a soul. So <hi>convince of sinne,</hi> the
guilt, the stain, the dominion, the pollution

the soul is exposed by it, that your hearers
may be awakened, and humbled, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually

            <p>2 <hi>Preach not your selves,</hi> your own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
the devices of your own hearts,
set not up your <hi>reason</hi> against Gods Word,
nor <hi>your will</hi> against his grace, nor <hi>your

wisdom</hi> against the simplicity of his holy
Gospel. Preach not <hi>out of ostentation</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>fancies</hi> and wits of men to please
or to tickle them, but out of <hi>manifestation</hi>
of truth to the <hi>conscience</hi> to please God.
Preach not your own passions and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
things tending to widen breaches,
to foment jealousies and discontents, to
kindle fedition, to cherish faction, to beget
turbulency &amp; disquiet, to shake the piety
which the people owe to God, or the <hi>loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>

4. <hi>Serve the souls,</hi> not the wills or lusts
of men. Consider the worth of <hi>souls,</hi> their
excellency, their immortality, the <hi>price</hi>
that bought them, the <hi>sin</hi> which defiles
them, the <hi>curse</hi> which destroys them, the
<hi>grace</hi> which renues them, the <hi>glory</hi> which
blesseth them. Consider the <hi>vigilancy of
Satan</hi> who goeth about to devour them.
His malice and industry, his power and
policy, his sophisms and devices, his artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and temptations, the indefatigable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and various methods he useth to
destroy them, against whose engines and
machinations our Ministry is appointed.
Is it a small sin to gratifie Satan by negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
to save those precious <hi>souls</hi> which he
seeketh to ruine? Is it a small sin by our
carelesnesse to betray <hi>such souls as</hi> those,
and our own with them, to the peril of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
perdition? Shall we be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the hideous outcry of destroyed <hi>souls</hi>
wherewith we had been entrusted, howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out that doleful accusation against us,
<hi>Parentes sensimus parricidas,</hi> our Guids have
misled us, our Watchmen have betrayed us,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96726:28"/>
our Pastors have starved us, our Stewards
have defrauded us, our fathers have been
our parricides?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Jesus sake,</hi> if you <hi>love Jesus;</hi> It is
the argument which himself useth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.
15, 16, 17. (and <hi>if any man love not the Lord
Iesus, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</hi>) If
you would have Jesus love you, if you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his sheep, if you regard his command,
if you fear his wrath, if you value his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
study the price of <hi>souls,</hi> snatch <hi>souls</hi>
out of the fire, forewarn <hi>souls</hi> of the wrath
to come, be <hi>humble,</hi> be faithful, be painful,
be pitiful towards the souls of men. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
your fidelity, set forth Christs excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
unto the souls of your hearers, that
you may be able to say to him at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
as he to his Father, <hi>Behold me and
the children whom thou hast given me.</hi> Thus
doing, you shall both save your selves and
them that hear you.</p>
