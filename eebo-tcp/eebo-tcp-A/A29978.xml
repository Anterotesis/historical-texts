            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
TO
Sir Thomas Osborn,
One of
His Majesties PRIVY COUNCIL,
Upon the Reading of a Book, called,
The present Interest of ENGLAND stated.</head>
            <p>I Have read over the Book you sent me, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
<hi>The present Interest of</hi> England
<hi>stated,</hi> and shall deliver you impartially my
Opinion of the Author's Judgment. I had
done it sooner, could I have believed the giving
you so much trouble would admit of an excuse.
But if at any time my sending you these Papers
can be pardonable, it is now, when we are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a War against the Dutch, since the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon which they are written, is the subject
of common discourse. In the first place, I shall take
notice, that this Author treats of our Domestic
Affairs, not only more rationally, but more like a
man concerned for the good of <hi>England,</hi> than he
does of our Interests abroad: For then instead of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103371:3"/>
examining calmly, how far the friendship of other
Countries would at this present be useful to us,
he falls into passionate expressions of kindness for
the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> as if our principal design in seeking
<hi>Foreign Alliances,</hi> ought not to be the encrease of
our wealth and power, but the finding out humors
in another Nation that please us, and the being
civil to those with whom we have been longest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.
This is a mistake so general amongst
us, that I dare not find much fault with it, for fear
of being censur'd my self; having observed in most
of our discourses upon things of this nature, that
though we ought to be in earnest only for our selves,
yet out of our extraordinary zeal for some other
Country, the debate between us commonly ends
in our being ready to go to cuffs one with another.</p>
            <p>I fully agree with him, that it is the interest of
the King of <hi>England,</hi> to make himself head of the
Protestants, and that he should do it, not by being
violent for any one Sect, but by taking generally
into his Protection all Christians whatsoever, that
will not submit to the Government of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> I also approve of his stating the true interest
of <hi>England</hi> to be Trade, of his observation of some
of our customs which are useful to it, of his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
of new Laws to be made for the advance of it,
and of the necessity of having some enlargement
given to people in matters of Religion; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
considers the advantage <hi>England</hi> has by its
situation, above the rest of the whole world, as to
matters of Trade, cannot choose but conclude,
that all Traders would desire to live here, if our
Laws did not make it uneasie to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103371:3"/>
In a word, I differ from him in none of his
Maxims relating to our interest at home, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ought to take it the less ill of me, if I can
not agree with him in all his notions concerning
our Alliances abroad. Thus far I am of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that we ought to keep a good correspondence
with <hi>Spain,</hi> that we should hinder the ruin of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and that we are to use our utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to preserve the command of the <hi>Baltick</hi>
Sea from falling absolutely into the hands, either
of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> or the King of <hi>Swedeland.</hi>
I do also believe, the interest of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and
ours, as to that point, is the same; but why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should be so far transported, as not to care
what prejudice they do us in other matters, is a
piece of Policy I do not very well understand, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I see the Consequence why even as to that
end, the <hi>Dutch</hi> must needs be so powerful at Sea,
as they are now; for if they were less considerable
in Shipping, it would not be less their Interest to
keep the Dominion of those Seas divided, nor less
in their power to effect it, by joyning their Forces
with ours. In the beginning of his Book, he rightly
states the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to be Trade; but
when he comes to his Politicks, he recommends
to us in the first place, and as the main point of
which we ought to be most careful, that we should
be Friends with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and study their Interest,
because they are Traders: never considering, that
the same Reason which should make us endeavour
the growth of Trade in our own Countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must
of necessity oblige us to do all we can to obstruct it
in another; and that the strength of his Argument
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103371:4"/>
in plain <hi>English,</hi> is no more than this, That because
we love Trade, therefore we ought to love those
that take it from us. Had the Author been a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
instead of a Politician, he would have known,
that Rivals are the things in this world, which men
commonly do, and ought most to hate. He goes
on and tells us, that it would be of dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to <hi>England,</hi> if the <hi>French</hi> King should gain
any Towns in <hi>Holland,</hi> because then he would
ruine their Trade: How right soever he may be
in this Notion, he is mistaken at least in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for it were certainly better for us, if no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the world traded by Sea, but our selves.</p>
            <p>He says, that if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and we were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we might both together be very considerable.
That cannot be denied; but what Reason have we
to believe, they ever will join with us to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?
except it be that they never have done
so yet, and that it has been their constant Practice
to massacre and make Slaves of our Countrey-men
in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> at the same time they amuse us
with fair Promises at home. A Humanity to which
they owe more the Greatness of their Possessions
in those Parts, than to any other Virtue, for
which the Author of this Book can justly commend
them.</p>
            <p>He says, that their being industrious and parsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
is not a good Reason why we should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
them; as if we ought to observe the same
Rules between us and other Nations, which we
are bound to keep amongst our selves. The true
Aim of every <hi>English</hi> man should be the Good and
Prosperity of <hi>England;</hi> for that Reason Industry
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103371:4"/>
and Parsimony are to be wished for in the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>England,</hi> because they are Qualities advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
for us, and useful to our Trade: but for
the same Reason, they ought not by us to be
wished for in the Inhabitants of <hi>Holland,</hi> because
those Qualities in them are prejudicial to <hi>England,</hi>
and destructive to our Trade. In short, we may
love particular men for what Reasons we please,
but the measure of our Love to other Nations
ought to be only their being useful to ours. I do
not from hence infer that because of their Parsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
we ought to do them Injustice, but on the
other side, I see no Reason why we should receive
any from them, because they are a niggardly
People.</p>
            <p>He enters then into a great Admiration of their
Morals and Justice, the contrary of which he
would certainly have been convinced of, if he had
lain but one Night in any Inn of their Countrey.
It is true, that almost the whole Nation being
Merchants or Tradesmen, every ones Endeavour
to under-sell his Neighbour, is the Cause why in
the Shops things are sold at a pretty cheap Rate;
for this we are but to thank their Necessities, and
not their Morals, nor their Justice.</p>
            <p>The Author in one place touches a little upon
the Necessity of inviting all Princes whatsoever
into the Triple League. A Maxim much in vogue
with some, who looking very grave, do therefore
take it very ill, if for that Reason, you will not
allow them to be infallible. To make appear the
Profoundness of which Notion, it is necessary that
I explain a little what the Triple League is:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103371:5"/>
The <hi>Triple League</hi> was made between the King of
<hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> and the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> King had entred <hi>Flanders</hi>
with a very powerful Army. The Design of this
League was to induce the <hi>French</hi> to make a Peace
with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> upon such terms as should be
proposed to them by the Confederates of the
Triple League; and that they might the easier
bring this to pass, they were forced to offer such
Conditions as were not altogether for the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Advantage, though such as preserved the
greatest part of <hi>Flanders</hi> in his Possession.</p>
            <p>At the same time the Confederates made Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
amongst themselves to help one another, in
case any of them should be invaded, for having
made the Triple League, either by the <hi>French</hi>
King, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or by any of their Allies.</p>
            <p>Upon this followed the Treaty at <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,</hi>
where the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> accepted
of the Articles delivered to them by the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
of the Triple League, and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
became their Guaranties or Sureties for the
Performance of those Articles on both sides. This
being the State of the matter, it is very true, we
may admit other Princes into the Guaranty of the
Peace, but to say, we should invite them into the
Triple League, which enforced the Peace, is as
much as to say, we should desire their Conjunction
in order to the making of a Peace, which had been
already concluded several years before; and that,
if you mark it, is such a kind of Figure in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
as commonly is called a <hi>Bull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, we were then forced to agree to several
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103371:5"/>
Articles both with the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which
it would not be for our advantage now to make
with the Emperor or the Princes in <hi>Germany:</hi> it
being no Consequence, that because the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and we did mutually engage to assist one
another, upon our own Charge, at a time when
we were afraid the <hi>French</hi> might invade us; that
therefore now when we are in no such danger,
we should promise to help any other State or
Prince, except they will pay us very well for it.
They might consider too, if they please, that we
are a little nearer <hi>Flanders</hi> than <hi>Hungary;</hi> and that
it is not altogether so difficult for us, to transport
our men to the other side of the Water, as it would
be to make them march into the farthest Parts of
<hi>Germany,</hi> as often as it should happen to be invaded
by the Great <hi>Turk;</hi> and that the Emperor should
claim our Assistance, because the Great <hi>Turk</hi> is
one of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Allies. Observe I
beseech you, the prettiness of this Politick Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Consequence of it, if it were put
in Practice: Because we have thought it fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our Neighbours in <hi>Flanders,</hi> we must therefore
presently march into the Empire, to defend there
some who are not our Neighbours, nor indeed
within the Reach of our Protection. Now I would
very fain know by this Rule of theirs, when our
poor Countrey-men should hope to be at Rest?
For the same charitable Reason would lead us on
as well to the farthest Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> nay of the
whole World, if these Politicians could but catch
us once in a good humour. I must confess, if it be
our Ambition to gain the Name of <hi>Peace-makers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103371:6"/>
General,</hi> without any Consideration, either of
our own Interest or Profit in the case, then this
this were the readiest way to compass that End:
but if we will look back into the Examples
of former Ages, we shall find, though many
Nations have gone a great way for Conquest into
Foreign Parts, yet that never any before went
so far out of the way to defend their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>There is another Conception of this kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon by some, as a matter of very great
weight, which is, that now we must not fall out
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> upon any Provocation, because
that would be a Breach of the Triple League.
This (under favour) is an Absurdity yet greater
than the former, there being no one thing you can
allege as a Consequence to any other thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
that will not make every whit as sensible
a Conclusion as this. For Example, to say,
that you ought not to go to Bed to night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did not go yesterday a
hunting; or that I must not dine to morrow,
because <hi>Monsieur de Wit</hi> loves dancing, is not a
more incoherent Discourse, than that because we
have promised with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to save <hi>Flanders</hi> from
the <hi>French,</hi> therefore what Injuries soever the
<hi>Dutch</hi> shall offer us, we cannot defend our selves
against them. The Argument, if you mark it,
is just thus, that because I agree with <hi>William</hi>
to save <hi>Thomas,</hi> therefore I am bound to let
<hi>William</hi> cut my Throat. If those good men that
start these Notions, would instead of <hi>instructing</hi>
others, but take the Pains sometimes to <hi>think</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103371:6"/>
themselves, they would find that Self-Preservation
ought to be look'd after a little in these kind
of Affairs; And that if the Consequence of the
Loss of <hi>Flanders</hi> did not somewhat concern us,
we should be no more in pain about it, than we
were for the Conquest of <hi>Granada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall now take upon me to state the Interest
of <hi>England,</hi> and begin as this Author does,
though I differ with him in the Conclusion.</p>
            <p>The undoubted Interest of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Trade,</hi>
since it is that only which can make us either
<hi>Rich</hi> or <hi>Safe;</hi> for without a <hi>powerful Navy,</hi> we
should be a <hi>Prey</hi> to our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and without
<hi>Trade,</hi> we could neither have <hi>Sea-men</hi> nor <hi>Ships.</hi>
From hence it does follow, that we ought not
to suffer any other Nations to be our <hi>Equals</hi> at
<hi>Sea,</hi> because when they are once our <hi>Equals,</hi> it
is but an even Lay, whether they or we shall
be the <hi>Superiours.</hi> And it would not be a stranger
thing that the <hi>Dutch</hi> should come to be so from
what they are, now than it is, that they are
arrived to what they are now, from what
they were in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. I shall
add to this one Observation, which in my
Opinion is very clear:</p>
            <p>That <hi>England</hi> has never been so considerable
since her time, as it was then, and yet it is much
more so in it self, the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> being
now joyned to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which it
was not before.—If you enquire into the reason
of this, you will find it to be, because we are not
now so absolutely the <hi>Masters at Sea,</hi> as we were
in those times: for though we have at present
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103371:7"/>
more, and better ships, and a far greater trade
than we had then, yet we have of neither so much
a larger proportion, in respect to other Nations,
as we had at that time.—The Dutch who were
then but <hi>a company of Fishermen,</hi> being now both
in <hi>shipping</hi> and <hi>trade</hi> very near our <hi>equals,</hi> and if
you will take their words for it, our <hi>Superiours.</hi>
And without doubt it is a vain thing for us to
pretend to be a ballance between any considerable
powers at Land, so long as we are thus equally
ballanced at Sea by the Dutch. This it self
methinks, should be sufficient to make us not very
well pleased with the change of our condition;
but our case has yet in it a further considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we are by this means in a perpetual
danger of being conquered. For though the
Dutch alone cannot do it, yet by joyning with
<hi>France</hi> they may, and it is that which a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
party amongst them has been labouring
for these many years. To this it is objected,
that it can never be the interest of <hi>Holland</hi> to joyn
with <hi>France</hi> in the conquest of <hi>England;</hi> but for
ought we know they may mistake their interest,
and certainly it is not wisdom in any Nation, to
have its <hi>safety</hi> depend upon the <hi>prudence</hi> of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
Besides, it does not appear to me, that it
is not the interest of <hi>Holland</hi> to have <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by them and the French: For first, they
may make such a division of <hi>England,</hi> as to keep
to themselves the most considerable parts in it
for trade, and being Masters of the French at
Sea, they will be sure to make their party good
with them in an Island. In the next place,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103371:7"/>
those parts of <hi>England</hi> which should fall to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the French, would be inconsiderable as to
matter of Trade; that, and their <hi>Arbitrary</hi> way
of Government, being <hi>incompatible</hi> one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And the reason is plain, for there are few
that will put out their money upon this double
adventure, of losing it at Sea, or having it taken
from them when it comes home again. Besides,
the nature of the English is so averse to the
Government of <hi>France,</hi> and our Religion so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from theirs, that if <hi>England</hi> should happen
thus to be conquered, they would be likelier to
close with the Dutch, than become subject to the
French. All the Trading men would live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dutch, and by consequence they would
have all the rich Towns, and it is no difficult
matter to determine what influence those Towns
would have over the rest of the whole Nation.
For the very same Reasons, if ever <hi>Holland</hi>
should be in danger of a Conquest, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the French and us, the Dutch
would rather choose to become Part of our
Government, then submit themselves to the
Power of <hi>France.</hi> Against this I have heard
some say, that because we endeavour to obstruct
their Trade, the Dutch will never joyn with us:
But those Gentlemen do not consider, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Conjunction all such Endeavours would
cease; for it would then be as much our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
to promote their Trade, as the Trade of
any other part of <hi>England.</hi> Another Argument
which I have met with upon the same Subject
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103371:8"/>
is, That the fear of us would force the Dutch
to accept of Conditions from the French: But
upon a true Examination of the matter, there
will be found in the practice of it this Difficulty,
that the French will not trust to what the Dutch
shall promise, without having such a Power
given them in their Countrey, as may force
them to keep their Words; and the Dutch
will hardly trust the French with that Power,
lest it should be made use of to their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
whether they keep their words or no. In
short, the usual course that all men take, when
they are no longer able to defend their own
Government, is to choose what is next best for
them. So that the natural Question, if that
should happen, must necessarily be, Whether,
considering our <hi>Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Situation</hi> of our
<hi>Countrey,</hi> the Proffer of a <hi>Coalition</hi> with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
would not prove more acceptable, and
more advantageous to a Trading People, than
any Terms they can expect from the <hi>French.</hi>
The Sea Towns at least would fall to be our
share: And then, though the French should
be Masters of the rest of the whole States Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
we should have no reason to complain
of our part in the Division. Nay, supposing
the worst, that we should be so ill advis'd, as
to let the French take all, and leave us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
yet, even in that Case, the French
King would rather make their <hi>strength</hi> at <hi>Sea</hi>
inconsiderable, by their being subject to him,
than his own more formidable, by his being
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103371:8"/>
their Master. For the Power of <hi>Holland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon two things, their <hi>Parsimony,</hi> and their
<hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By their Liberty, they are encouraged to trade,
and by their Parsimony, they are enabled to do
it cheaper than any other people. Both which
would certainly be destroyed by the <hi>profuseness</hi> of
the French living, and the <hi>Severity</hi> of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend, that all this is as plain, as
that <hi>two</hi> and <hi>two</hi> make <hi>four,</hi> it being impossible
to use that certainty of reasoning in things of this
nature: but thus far I dare affirm, that no man
can be assured, but that some time or other the
Dutch may take it to be their Interest to joyn
with <hi>France</hi> in the Conquest of <hi>England;</hi> for
which Reason, I lay it down as a Maxim, That
we must never give them leave to be our <hi>equals</hi>
at <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, I think it our interest to
preserve <hi>Flanders</hi> from being over-run by the
French, lest that might prove of a dangerous
consequence to us. But no apprehension of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ought to frighten us into a certain ruine;
and therefore at the same time we are securing
others by the Triple League, we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
at least, to take some care of our own
safety; for if whilst we labour to save the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> we suffer the Dutch to rob us of
our Trade, we shall make in my judgement, but
a very ill bargain for our selves; and the world
would have just cause to believe, the Dutch are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103371:9"/>
our <hi>Masters</hi> already in point of <hi>understanding,</hi> if
they could impose upon us so silly a notion, as
that we should employ our <hi>strength</hi> to support
their Government, and let them use their <hi>Arts</hi> to
cut off the Sinews of ours.</p>
            <p>I told you at first the reason why I send you
now these Papers, and if you find any thing in
them with which you cannot agree, I shall be so
far from being angry at your differing from my
opinion, that you will do me a favour in convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
me to be of yours; being very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
it is better for a man to be <hi>really</hi> in the
right, than to have it only <hi>thought</hi> he is so, either
by himself or other people.</p>
            <p>My aim in this is, that the Interest of <hi>England</hi>
may be throughly <unclear>
                  <hi>search'd</hi>
               </unclear> out; and I can truly
say for my self, I never yet had any Design, but
what I believed was for the <hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>Greatness,</hi>
and the <hi>Prosperity</hi> of this <hi>Nation.</hi>
