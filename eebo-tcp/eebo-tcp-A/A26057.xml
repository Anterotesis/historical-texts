            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>YOU cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the reſtleſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the <hi>Romiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> to gain Proſelytes to their Church. And 'tis probable, that you your ſelves e're long, may happen to hear from them. For they have different forms of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, very plauſible and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, fitted to the Capacities of all ſorts of Perſons. And therefore that you may not be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54158:3"/>
ſurprized with theſe Charmers, nor impoſed on by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Deceit; I do think it my Duty thus to caution you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, by deſiring you to obſerve theſe <hi>two</hi> Directions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>A Holy Life.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>A modeſt dependance upon your Spiritual Guide.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, let me admoniſh you in the words of St. <hi>James, Shew me thy Faith by thy Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it ſignifies nothing what Mens <hi>Profeſſion</hi> is, if their <hi>Practice</hi> is not anſwerable. And he who is in earneſt to ſave his Soul, will doubtleſs be as much afraid of <hi>Debauched Courſes, as of erroneous Opinions:</hi> Since thoſe do as much, nay more than theſe, occaſion his Damnation.</p>
            <p>I do therefore beg of you,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54158:3"/>
That as you do profeſs your ſelves Members of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> ſo you would take great Care, that your Lives and <hi>Converſation</hi> may be anſwerable to its <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as it relates to Practice, you do find in the <hi>Church-Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> in anſwer to thoſe <hi>two</hi> Queſtions. <hi>What is thy Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God?</hi> and <hi>What is thy Duty towards thy Neighbour?</hi> Which I would adviſe you very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to read, and ſeriouſly to conſider. And when by the Aſſiſtance of God's Bleſſed Spirit, you have tranſcribed thoſe <hi>Anſwers</hi> into your Lives; Let me then aſſure you, That the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> thus pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, are the beſt Expoſition of your <hi>Creed. If any Man will do</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54158:4"/>
               <hi>his Will, he ſhall know of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether it be of God,</hi> John 7. 17. <hi>For he that hath, to him ſhall be given: and he that hath not, from him ſhall be taken, even that which he hath,</hi> Mark 4. 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> He who maketh a right uſe of that Grace and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which God hath given him: He who values and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, and is truly thankful for it, <hi>To him ſhall be given more. And he that hath not; i. e.</hi> He who hath not made a right uſe and improvement of his Grace or Knowledge; from him ſhall be taken, even that which he hath.</p>
            <p>But becauſe you muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that God ſhould now teach and inſtruct you in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he did the Apoſtles,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54158:4"/>
but <hi>mediately,</hi> and in the uſe of Means: You are therefore to conſider what thoſe Means are, which God hath appointed for your Direction and Inſtruction. The chief of which (to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A modeſt Dependance upon the Miniſterial Function.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not now inſiſt upon the publick Offices of the Church, nor your Obligation to attend them; as <hi>Prayers, Sacraments, Preaching,</hi> &amp;c. But ſhall only direct you how to behave your ſelves, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one deſigns to ſeduce you from the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Expedients I would propoſe, are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be your earneſt and daily <hi>Prayer</hi> unto God, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54158:5"/>
give you his Grace, <hi>to hold faſt the Profeſſion of your Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wavering;</hi> that you may continue in the ſame unto your Lives End.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When you read the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures,</hi> and do find ſome Place which is too difficult for you; do not then pretend to <hi>Interpret</hi> it your ſelves. But beg the Direction of your <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guide;</hi> and deſire him to ſhew you how it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As far as poſſible avoid all Diſputes about Religion. <hi>Be not carried about with every Wind of Doctrine,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> Do not hearken to the Whiſpers of every bold Pretender.</p>
            <p>Which to Perſons of your Capacity is very ſeaſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. For, <hi>To convince Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54158:5"/>
and to anſwer <hi>Objections,</hi> is a matter of Skill and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: And therefore <hi>You</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a working People, who ſweat for your daily Bread) may with great modeſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to your <hi>Catholick Miſſionary,</hi> that you have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Leiſure nor Ability for ſuch Diſputes. And conſequently you may deſire him, ſince he is diſpoſed to diſcourſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that he would rather help your Devotion, than diſturb your Belief.</p>
            <p>You may aſſure him, That you ſhall not think your Faith the leſs firm and orthodox, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot return an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary</hi> anſwer to the preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated Objections of a learned Adverſary.</p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible that ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54158:6"/>
Diſputant, as he is, might pretend to prove to you; <hi>That Graſs is not green.</hi> And he might urge ſuch Arguments as would really baffle you; and to which you could not return any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anſwer. But yet for all his Sophiſtry, though he might ſilence, he would not ſatisfy. For you would ſtill believe your Senſes, and could not think it of any other Colour.</p>
            <p>If this will not make him to deſiſt; But that he will ſtill be urging the great Priviledges of the Romiſh Church: <hi>The Security of her Faith; The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her devotion; The great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Piety of her Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. To this you may reply</p>
            <p n="4">4. That you underſtand ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of the Priviledges of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54158:6"/>
to know the State of any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Church, requires more Skill and Reading than can be expected from Perſons of your mean Condition. That you are Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apoſtolick Church. That into this Church you were admitted by Baptiſm; and with this Church you have held Communion in all her Offices. And conſequently to ſeparate from this Church, without ſome urging cauſe, is downright <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in the proper noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, is, <hi>A cauſleſs ſeparation from that part of the viſible Church, of which you are Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore he who hath a mind to make you his <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and will talk pertinently, and to the Point; before he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54158:7"/>
to invite you to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt firſt convince you, That it is your Duty to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In order to which, he muſt plainly prove, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is no ſound Member of the Church Catholick; and conſequently, That Salvation cannot ordinarily be had in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> at leaſt not with ſuch ſafety, certainty, and advantage, as it may in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove this he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, That the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>defective</hi> or <hi>falſe.</hi> If he pretends that it is <hi>defective;</hi> he muſt then ſhew, that there are ſome Truths neceſſarily to be believed, as Articles of Faith, which the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54158:7"/>
doth not receive as ſuch: And alſo that there are ſome neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duties, or Parts of Worſhip, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> either wholly omits, or elſe doth not require under any ſuch Neceſſity. And let him here inſtance to you; what thoſe Articles and Parts of Worſhip are, wherein our Church is thus <hi>defective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he affirms, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Falſe,</hi> he muſt then prove, That the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth require ſome <hi>unlawful</hi> Condition of her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that either in <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Plainly thus: He muſt make it appear, that her Faith is <hi>erroneous,</hi> and contrary to the written Word of God; <hi>The Faith once delivered to the Saints:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54158:8"/>
Or elſe that her Worſhip is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> Superſtitious, or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous. And let him here likewiſe give you an inſtance, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſhew you, what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Article of our Faith is thus <hi>erroneous:</hi> and what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part of our Worſhip he thinks <hi>unlawful.</hi> And when he hath made his Exceptions, you may then tell him</p>
            <p n="5">5. That your Memory is but ſhort; and if he pleaſe therefore to give you in <hi>Writing</hi> what he hath now ſaid, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of his beſt Arguments upon thoſe Points; you may then conſider them at your Leiſure.</p>
            <p>If he refuſeth to give you ſuch a Paper, ſuſpect him for a Cheat, and that he comes with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to impoſe upon you. For
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54158:8"/>
Truth doth not Fear the Light, but ſubmits its Tenents to the ſtricteſt Examination.</p>
            <p>But if he grants your Deſire; then bring that Paper to <hi>Me,</hi> and give me the opportunity to tell you my Thoughts of it. And I do here beg and entreat you, nay (as one who muſt anſwer for your <hi>Souls,</hi> if they Periſh through my Neglect) I require and charge all you in this Pariſh committed to my Care; that you would be ſo Faithful both to your ſelves and me, as not to be too confident of your own Skill: nor to think any Argument unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe you your ſelves are not able to anſwer it.</p>
            <p>In the affairs of this World, you do judge it Prudent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult other Men in their ſeveral
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54158:9"/>
Profeſſions, <hi>Phyſicians, Lawyers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Should ſome crafty Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion pretend to your <hi>Eſtates,</hi> you would not at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring of his Action, grant him Poſſeſſion; but would conſult the Learned in the <hi>Law,</hi> how to defend your Title.</p>
