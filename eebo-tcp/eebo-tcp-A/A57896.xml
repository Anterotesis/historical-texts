            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Present you with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thanks for your excellent Physick Treatise, and for your favour in the direction of it to me; But for your printing of it, all mankinde is to give you thanks. For certainly all ages and Nations have ever held a gratefull memory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of any Devise or Engine,
<pb facs="tcp:58229:5"/>
to the publique advantage of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life: For, as it is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God that gives us life; so, of all men, they are most subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to that goodnesse, who help to make that life long and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; amongst whom this your Whalebone Instrument will assuredly cause your name to stand. It hath already (though crept out by stealth) gained much credit abroad, in forrain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; where I have known per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of eminent quality to hold it in great esteem. And besides the undenyed reputation (where rightly used) it gains, in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; practise thereof, it cannot in a rationall discourse, but have much preeminence above the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall way of Physick. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse mens diseases arise from the Stomach; whose impurities ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the passages of life, poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fermenting the whole
<pb facs="tcp:58229:6"/>
moisture of mans body, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like a House which having it Vaults and Sinks furred up and stopt, soon growes so full of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction and stink as cannot be endured: In which case Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are like men who should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise to cast into such a house Mirrhe, Musk, Amber-greece, or other pretious stuffe, in hopes to amend the uucleannesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And to magnifie that course as rationall, they make learned discourses of the Drugges and the severall degrees of heat or cold, with their specifique virtues, which countenanced under strange names and Authors, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to be made tryall of. But at last, when the simple Master of the House (after much fruitless trouble and expence) finds no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that the corruption and stench is grown more abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: Then come you with this
<pb facs="tcp:58229:6"/>
Engine, like some discreet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who with a Broom and a little water, without charge, in half an hours time, makes a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner House, than the others, with all their parade, cost, and trouble could ever doe: But as for the two remarkable Simples, which you most imploy; that is Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co and Cophie, a man may guess at their rare efficacie, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves how universally they take with mankinde, and yet have not the advantage of any pleasing taste wherewith to tempt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch our Palat, as Wine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such pernicious things have; for at the first-Tobacco is most horrid, and Cophie insipid, yet doe they both so generall prevail, that Bread it self is not of so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall use. The Tartars and Arabs, two great Nations, have little or no use of Bread, yet they,
<pb facs="tcp:58229:7"/>
the Turks, Persians, and most of the eastern World, have hourly use of Tobacco and Cophie, but especially of Cophie: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the innumerable store of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie houses, there is not a private fire without it all day long: They all acknowledge how it freeth them from crudities, caused by ill dyet, or moist lodging; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as they, using Cophie morning and evening, have no Consumptions, which ever come of moisture; no Lethargies in aged people, or Rickets in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and but few qualmes in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with child; but especially they hold it of singular preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Stone and Gout. When a Turk is sick, he fasts and takes Cophie, and if that will not doe, he makes his will, and thinks of no other Physick. And as for your way of taking both Cophie
<pb facs="tcp:58229:7"/>
and Tobacco, the rarity of the invention consists in leaving the old way: For the water of the one, and the smoke of the other may be of inconvenience to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but your way in both takes in the virtue of the Simples, without any additionall mischeif. And as for Tobacco, not in smoke, but swallowed down, there is not observed a more sure or sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den remedy for a Cough or the Stone, amongst all that men have found out. And whereas most medicinall Books are usually but bare transcriptions from former Writers; and so nothing but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say upon hear say, with mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous addition of untruth upon untruth, till upon try all not one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt in an hundred makes good what it promiseth. Yours is all of your own constant experience on your self and others; which in
<pb facs="tcp:58229:8"/>
your personall recovery, and healthfull old age, gives a fair pledge to all who please to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low so considerable an Example. Thus, Sir, with my best thanks I present you the love and Service of him who is</p>

pot on the fire, is still boyling within us, and hath much froth; whence, if the concoction be not very good, there are ilfavoured fumes, and fuliginous evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ascend into the head; where being distill'd, they descend in Catarrhes and defluxions sometimes upon the Optiques, and that may be called the Gout in the Eyes; if they fall upon the Teeth, it may be call'd the Gout in the Mouth; If into the Hands, 'tis <hi>Chiragra;</hi> if in the Hip, <hi>Sciatica;</hi> if in the Knees, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagra;</hi> if in the Feet, <hi>Poda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra.</hi> Now Sir, <hi>Your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi> serves to take away the grounds of these distempers, by rummaging and scouring the
<pb facs="tcp:58229:10"/>
Stomach, and make it expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that froth, or phlegmy stuffe which lodgeth there, and that in a more gentle manner than any Drugge. 'Tis true that <hi>Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbe</hi> is good against Choler, <hi>Agarick</hi> against Phlegme, and <hi>Hellebore</hi> against Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but they use to stirre the humors so violently by their nauseousnesse, that their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a sicknesse of it self all the while. Your Instrument causeth no such thing, nor leaves any lurking dreggs behinde, as <hi>Drugges</hi> use to doe.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Coffee,</hi> I concurre with them in opinion, who hold it to be that black broth which was us'd of old in <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58229:11"/>
whereof the Poets sing; Surely it must needs be salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, because so many sagacious, and the wittiest sort of Nations use it so much; as they who have conversed with <hi>Shashes</hi> and <hi>Turbants</hi> doe well know. But besides the exsiccant quality it hath to dry up the crudities of the Stomach, as also to comfort the Brain, to fortifie the sight with its steem, and prevent Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Gouts, the Scurvie, together with the Spleen, and Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacall windes (all which it doth without any violence or distemper at all) I say, besides all these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, 'tis found already, that this <hi>Coffee</hi> drink hath caused a greater sobriety among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb facs="tcp:58229:11"/>
For whereas formerly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices and Clerks with others, used to take their mornings draught in Ale, Beer, or Wine, which by the dizziness they cause in the Brain, make many unfit for businesse, they use now to play the Good-fellows in this <hi>wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and civill drink: Therefore that worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Mudiford,</hi> who introduced the practise hereof first to <hi>London,</hi> deserves much respect of the whole Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb facs="tcp:58229:12"/>
taken, It helps concoction, makes one void Rhume, break winde, and keeps the body open: A leaf or two steeped in white Wine, or Beer over night, is a Vomit that never fayles; It is a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to sedentary men, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents when they are stupified by long reading or writing, by dissipating those vapours which use to o're-cloud the Brain: The smoak of it is passing good against all contagious aires; In so much that if one takes two or three puffs in the morning, before he goes abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there's no infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous air can fasten upon him; for it keeps out all other sents, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Axiome, <hi>Intus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istens prohibet alienum.</hi>

That those matters are at first Flegme, which, being baked with the heat of the stomach, breed Choler, &amp;c. and by consequence the Stone, is the generall opinion of learned Physitians; And <hi>Vanthelmont</hi> (a rare late Writer) describeth the same in many places, and sheweth how the humors are not of such severall natures, as they are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily distinguished, but originally are Flegme, and then baked to higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and get other names, as Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The seat of these humors are in the stomach, but principally in the mouth of the stomach, which is the principall seat of life, which <hi>Vanthel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> describeth excellently; where he saith, That in the stomach, but especially in the mouth thereof, as in the very center point and root, is evidently set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the beginning of life, of digestion of meat, and of the disposition thereof to maintain life, what then soever the

            <p n="4">4. Common experience shewes this to be true in very many men, who can neither eat or drink in the morning, but loath the same, and are troubled with waterish humors, but cannot get away the same with all their fasting and physick.</p>
            <p n="5">5. How to avoid these superfluous humors, is our great labour, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are the occasions of diseases, as is said before; and besides that, while they are in the body, they make our bodies like unseasonable Vessells, which doe spoyl the good meat which we doe put in our stomachs for our nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so that it cannot be well dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; which made <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to deliver the Aphorismes, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 2. <hi>Corpora impura, &amp;c.</hi> That the more sustenance is taken into unpure bodies, the more mischief happens unto them.

            <p n="7">7. <hi>Lemnius de occultis</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a whole Chapter of the rattle which men have in their throats before they die, and ascribes it to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the vitall spirits, &amp;c. and so it may be well enough; for that a mans breath is stopped by flegme and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested humors, which come from the mouth of the stomach into the throat, as well as an halter doth stop it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When all means are tried to<note place="margin">Vomiting.</note> avoid both corrupt humors and corrupt meat in the stomach, vomiting of it up is accounted the best means by <hi>Rantzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> and <hi>Heurinus,</hi> and many learned Physitians commend it exceedingly, and say that the Egyptians and Caldeans u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it twice every moneth: And <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> saith, that it purgeth not only the stomach, but also all the other parts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58229:22"/>
of the body, to the very heart. And finally, That as all evill humors doe come out of the stomach to disturb all parts of the body, by certain secret passages: So if the stomach be made clean by vomiting, the same corrupt humors return into the stomach again by the same passages, to be avoided by the ordinary passages of nature, which otherwise cannot be purged down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; whereof a man may read it at large in <hi>Rantzovius, cap.</hi> 18. and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> there, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Parent</hi> his notable book of Chyrurgery and Physick, and many others.</p>
            <p n="9">9. How dangerous it is to procure vomiting by the ordinary course of Physick, I leave it untill you come to the eighth following pointe <hi>cap</hi> 10. But how to doe it otherwise with little or no offence or disturbance unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and without observing of any cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diet, or hindrance to a man in his Vocations or Journeys; that is my principall labour, for which purpose I shall shew this easie and safe way fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

or sickness, whensoever you finde any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill<note place="margin">Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> disposition in the stomach, eat a convenient meal of what meat and drink you please, then walk a little while after it: Then sit down with your body bending, and thrust the said Whalebone Instrument into your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, stirring it very gently, which will make you vomit; then drink a good draught of drink, and so use the Instrument as oft as you please, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe this upon any empty stomach.</p>
            <p n="11">11. To make the stomach more apt to vomit, and to prepare the humors thereunto before you eat and drink, Take the bigness of a Nutmeg, or more of the said Electuary of Cophie, &amp;c. into your mouth; then take drink to drive it down; then eat and drink, and walk, and use the Instrument as before. There may be more or less of the said E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary taken at any time before meat, as a man findes it to be most agreeable to the constitution and strength of his body, without any curious observance of diet or fire, or hindrance for a man to goe or travell about his business.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Some may think it strange to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58229:23"/>
procure Vomit with this Instrument, rather than by Physick; but look upon <hi>Rantzovius, cap.</hi> 18. and other books, and there you shall finde them, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, that if a Vomit will not work, you must help the same with putting a feather into the throat; and many use a Rosemary branch: but these things doe not goe into the bottom of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to stir up the humors (as the whalebone Instrument doth) which I leave to every mans experience.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Many objections have been made against this course, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse I doe not finde by experience, that the same are of any weight, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what is before directed.</p>
            <p n="14">14. As to that which Physick books say, That vomiting more often than twice a moneth is dangerous, and may bring a man to an habit of vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and so weaken the stomach, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I doe agree, If it be done by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, whose opperations are contrary to nature, as <hi>Fernelius</hi> saith. But this way I prescribe is naturall, which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in little Children who are at Nurse, and are never accounted heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

but when they vomit often. Also the Dog is taught by nature to vomit, and all manner of Hawkes cast their castings every morning, otherwise they are not in health. And the Councell in <hi>Ecclesiasticus, cap</hi> 31. doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only unto superfluity of meat, but also to superfluity of humors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers old Commentators of that place affi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="15">15. Others say, what good doth the meat when it is vomited up again, and that whosoever doe use it, have not the benefit of nature downwards? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I say, by experience, that all the meat doth not come up, but part of it, which is in the upper regiment of the stomach, and doth carry with it the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humors of the stomach, which doth swim upon the top of the meat, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being eased of that burthen, doth work the residue of the meat more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly downwards, which may be found by experience; and also nature draweth quickly the quintessence of the meat to the nourishment of the body, to avoid all corrupt humors, so that the body &amp;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58229:24"/>
minde shall be more strong and free for all occasions, and shall be with far lesse trouble, charge, and danger, than to<note place="margin">☞</note> doe the same by Physick.</p>
            <p n="16">16. In respect I have spoken so much of Vomiting, I will add the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of learned <hi>Fernelius</hi> there, where he saith, That if after a Vomit, the pulse being full and strong, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant sleep commeth easie, and free<note place="margin">☞</note> breathing, a good appetite, and the rest of the body lighter; then the Vomit is commendable, otherwise not, and very hurtfull: I leave the experience hereof to every mans judgement who useth it.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That although by vomiting, as aforesaid, a man shall avoid much thick flegme, yet by the often using of the said Electuary of Cophie, &amp;c. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man shall by ordinary cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing avoid great pieces of blew congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fleagme, which I could not see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by any other means. If a man will take a spoonfull of the said infusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tobacco in his mornings draught of Ale or Beer, it will add much good for this purpose, without lothsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

or trouble to the body.</p>
            <p n="18">18.

            <p n="1">1. THAT those humors come out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to the severall parts of the body; and that those humors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Stomach again, to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58229:30"/>
by the ordinary passages of nature, and especially by vomit, doth appear, by that which is before spoken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Gout is the principall, and reputed unrecoverable Disease, which commeth from those humors, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth up and down into severall parts of the body, to seek some vent to get out of the body: In which case, although I will not presume to say, that the Gout can be absolutely cured, yet I dare say, that it may be much eased, so that a man may live long, without much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that disease.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although vomiting is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall means to avoid the matter of the Gout, as aforesaid; yet there be other outward means to draw the goutie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which remaineth in the Joynts; which may stand well with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Aphorism, where he saith, that <hi>where Nature swelleth, and offereth to vent it self, there it is to be avoided in convenient places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Many be the wayes and means which are prescribed in physick books: But that which, after many experiences, I found best, is, to apply a Sinapismus, or

Mustard plaster, as before; and that before and afterwards to apply one of the Dropaces, or pitch plaster, as <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>numb.</hi> 7. which the learned <hi>Heurinus</hi> in his Method doth commend excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and doth much condemne the neglect thereof; which he thinketh to be for no other cause, but because it is cheap.</p>

This Mustard plaister is to be used in this manner First, a convenient large Plaister made of Frankincense, Pitch &amp;c. as before, is to be applyed to one of the said places for at least six hours; Then make a lesser Plaister of about an Inch, and not above two Inches in breadth, of the said Mustard Plaister; and apply it to one of the said places, as occasion shall require: let the same stay there for about eight hours, until the place blister and grow red: then take away the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Plaister, and lay the other Plaister thereupon. If the place doe blister, prick the same, to let out the water.

Egges; and when it had stood a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, it grew to be a substance, like leather; so that I could scarce tear it with the strength of both my hands: which I verily beleeve is the humor which congeals in the hands, and makes crooked and knotty hands.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Although this will draw the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish and salt humors out of the joynts; yet there is an easie convenient way to draw it out of the Stomach, to prevent it from coming to the joynts, (that is) Take about the bignesse of a Nutmeg of the said Electuary of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, as before, every morning when a man is rising out of his bed: Then take into your mouth about an Inch in length of the stalk of a Tobacco leaf well dryed, and a little Cinnamon, to take away the loathsome taste thereof; which will draw the Rhume out of the mouth; and as it doth moisten, bite it; and sometimes a little of the juice of it may be let into the Stomach; and then drink some drink to drive it down: This a man may doe while he is putting on of his clothes, and oftener, as a man findeth it to agree with his body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58229:32"/>
offence. But Tobacco leaves, or the stalkes thereof, undryed are loathsome and troublesome, howsoever the same are prescribed by <hi>Wecker</hi>'s Antidotaries. I have known some being troubled with the Pox, have received great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by often drawing of waterish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors with Tobacco, &amp;c. as before: But I leave them to Mother <hi>Cornelius</hi> Tub.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I doe know that there are Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite numbers of Bathes and Pultices prescribed for the Gout; but I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found, that boyled Turnips made to a Pultice, and the water wherein they were boyled for a Bathe, will serve as well as any others. Look more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>numb.</hi> 20. the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Also I have found a very good Pultice, by beating of the white of Egges to a froth; and then to mingle therewith ordinary Soap, and apply it to the grieved place. But if any skinne be broken it will burn, unlesse one of the Pitch Plaisters be laid on the place under the Pultice.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Also if there be any swelling or heat, after these Plaisters, take greene
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58229:32"/>
Hemlock and Vinegar pounded to green sance, and binde it to the place, or lay the leaves of Burres under the said Pitch Plaister, to the place grieved.</p>
            <p n="12">12. He that will not use these means<note place="margin">Note.</note> to draw the humos out of the body, but repercussive means to drive the same back into his body, may shorten his dayes, and breed many diseases, as I have known it to happen often times.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Also the malignancy of these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors may be known by this; For by the said application for the Gout I have often seen, That besides abundance of waterish humors, and thick humors drawn out, as aforesaid, of severall parts of the body, but especially out of the Knees, there came out thence an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive heat, with much smoak, as if it were out of a boyling pot.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THIS is a strange thing, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly seen, as in Agues, when a man hath sometimes an hot fit, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a cold fit, with little intermission of times. And men commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that they have a hot Liver and a cold Stomach. Doctor <hi>Primrose</hi> hath handled this Question among the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Errors in Physick; and makes it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58229:33"/>
plain, that although the Liver be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hot of it self, which over heateth the bottom of the stomach; yet the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is cold by accident, by reason of the noisome humors, like barm or froth, which come into the uppermost part of the Stomach, by evill digestion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There be many Julips and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous medicines prescribed by Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to remedy this evill; and especially in burning Feavers; and these are of great use. But to spare much trouble herein, In hot diseases, and upon sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, let a man drink oftentimes great store of cold water, and eat a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Broth, Bread, and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Cheese, and then vomit with the Whalebone Instrument, as before. A man shall thereby avoid the corrupt humors in the Stomach; and then a man shall quickly avoid these Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and bring the body to a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; after which a man may drink strong drink, and wine, &amp;c. with little offence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have known so much good done to all men of all Ages, who would first in the morning drink at least half a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58229:34"/>
pinte of cold water; whereunto Sugar may be added, together with the juice of Oranges and Lemmons, to make it pleasant. That I must say, that I never found any thing of more use for the health of man; but I am afraid I labour in vain, in respect that most men doe abhorre it, as present poyson (as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Primrose</hi> saith,) yet he sheweth the excellency thereof, by many experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the authorities of many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern learned Authors. For all this I have found many Doctors of Physick (with whom I have conferred hereof) to speak much against it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at I doe not much marvail; for that, if that be practised, which I have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Chapter, there will be little use to be made of their Physick, and of the Shopps of the Apothecaries.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I must adde one thing more for the use of Good fellows, who use much drinking, &amp;c. Let them first drink cold water, as before, to cool their Liver, and bottome of their Stomachs: Then the drinking of Strong drink, &amp;c. will comfort the upper part of their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs; and much hinder the vapours,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58229:34"/>
which fume up to their heads, from the excessive heat of their Stomachs: And their drinking of water after the taking of Tobacco is very good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I have known divers men doe swallow small white pibble Stones, to cool the heat of their Stomachs; which I conceive to be in imitation of long winged Hawks: I have used the same my self, and they doe passe thorough a man downwards; but I found little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereby.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I have known others that used to swallow small bullets of Lead; which giveth me occasion to report a strange history, which I know to be true. An old Souldier, and a Commander in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, in the low Countries, was drinking of healthes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Companions, and at every health he did drink a Pistoll bullet, to the number of eighteen; which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his belly for neer the space of two years, with much pain and grief: He acquainted a Physition with this case, who did hang the Souldier by the Heels, by a beam in the Chamber; and then all the bullets dropped out of his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58229:35"/>
mouth again; but the same were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worn in his Belly. This Souldier is yet living, and in good health, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourscore and ten years of age.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I have spoken so much of the cooling of the Stomach, that it may be expected I should write somewhat of warming of cold Stomachs: But I finde every man so ready to take Tobacco, and to drink Wines, and strong drinks, that I need say no more thereof; But, as I have said before, so I say still, keepe the Stomach clean, with the said Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone Instrument, when you finde any disturbance or loathsomnesse therein: And keep the lower parts conveniently loose, with the said Suppositers: And draw out the humors which trouble the outward parts, with the said Plaisters, &amp;c. And keep the body in a temperate heat, as before; and avoid intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in dyet; then there will be little use of Physick.</p>

            <p n="3">3. That the common course of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Physick is dangerous, by reason of the venemous qualities of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, appeareth by that which is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and by the authority of <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Rantzovius,</hi> and all modest Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: And the often use thereof is very inconvenient, as those Authors, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Primrose</hi> ingeniously confesse: And that when ordinary Physick fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, the best way is to leave the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to God and Nature.</p>

I have known very many, who were almost blinde, cured in a short space by this means; and never any missed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There happened a strange cure to a Servant of mine, who was stark blinde for three quarters of a year, which I thought meet to discover. As he was led
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58229:37"/>
by his wife (a poor woman) wished her to breath often in the morning fasting in both his eyes by turns, one after the other, which she did accordingly; this made him to have a great itch in his eyes, which made him rub his eyes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and with his nayles he drew some slime out of his eyes; so that at three dayes end he began to see, and shortly after he perfectly recovered his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight. This was about twenty yeers past, and he is now perfectly well and of 66. yeers of age.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If a man will take a linnen ragge, or<note place="margin">Nose.</note> brown paper, and moisten it in the said infusion of Tobacco, and put it in his nose, &amp; draw his breath upwards, it will purge the head and eyes; and if there be any Ulcers, in the Nose (as most men have, who are troubled with the Poxe) it will much help them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If a man doth bleed over much at the Nose, let a man stand behinde the party troubled, and with both his thumbs presse hard both sides of the upper part of the back-bone upon the neck, it will presently stopp the blood.<note place="margin">Eares.</note>

            <p n="7">7. Although I doe not know any<note place="margin">Teeth.</note> present cure for the Toothache; yet I say, that whosoever will use the stalks of Tobacco as before, it will doe him much good, and be a great occasion to fasten the Teeth: also if the said <hi>Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pismus,</hi> and Pitch plaister be applyed behinde the lower part of the Eare, it will doe much good.</p>

            <p n="9">9. He who will use to drink cold<note place="margin">Throat.</note> water as before, it will preserve him from the Toad-evill, and especiallly

before drinking of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then Wine and stronge Drinks will be lesse offensive to a man.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I know some that have lain sick of the Small-pox, and their breath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most stopped; yet by the use of the Whalebone-Instrument, as before the blisters of the Pox were broken in the Throat, and they vomitted and were cured.</p>
            <p n="11">11. One was in a deep Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when all Physick failed, by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Whalebone-Instrument as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there was an Imposthume broken in the Stomach, and the party perfectly cured, after many Physitians had given him over.</p>
            <p n="12">12. It often happens that men have great I che in Bones close by the Throat, and in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upper part of the Back-bone by the Neck, and sometimes Lice come out of the same, if the said Pitch-plaisters be applyed thereunto, it will draw much water therehence, and cure the same.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I have seen Wennes in the Throat, and the Kings-Evill often cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with the application of the said

Pitch-plaister, mingled with Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grease without breaking the skinne.</p>
            <p n="14">14.

            <p n="15">15. For the Winde in the Stomach,<note place="margin">Winde.</note> look before <hi>cap.</hi> 5. But for the Winde in the Guts, the said Suppositers ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with powdered Cummin-seed, is an admirable remedy for it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. It is a common evill to old age<note place="margin">Knees and Leggs.</note> to have weake Knees, especially when men doe ride in cold weather: For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy whereof let a man have a Plaister made of the said Pitch-plaister, applyed to cover the Pans of both Knees, and continued, which will doe very much good.</p>
            <p n="17">17. It is a common evill to have<note place="margin">Leggs.</note> Ulcers and Caukers in Leggs, especially in old age, for remedy whereof, keep the Stomach clean as before, and the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58229:39"/>
of the Tobacco stalks as before, will doe much good: But for outward applications, let linnen cloth be made wet in the said infusion of Tobacco, and apply it to the sore place: I have known some have the Flesh consumed from the Bones, and the Bones scraped with a Knife, and being very old, yet cured by this means, and the Flesh restored again.</p>
            <p n="18">18. For the Gout in the Feet, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<note place="margin">Feet.</note> it to what hath been spoken before: But for a common pain which men have in the bottome of their Feet, whether they have the Gout or no, let a man lay to the sore place one of the said Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisters, and then put in his shoes the warm water wherein powder Beef, or Cow-heels were boyled, or Tobacco and Ale or Urine well boyled, and wherein store of Bay-Salt is dissolved, and let him walk as well as he can, he shall finde very much good; so that the Shoes be big and large: I have seen more by the using hereof; than by any Baths or Oyntments, or any other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, saving the drawing out of the humor as aforesaid. <hi>cap. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Some may question, whether
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58229:40"/>
the having of the Gout, be a great means to cure all diseases: I will not presume to decide the question, but say, that I have found much benefit thereby, with little trouble, and leave every man to his own sense; for whereas I had preserved my self from the Gout, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one yeer, partly by Repercussive Medicines in my Shoes, and partly by Attractive Remedies in drawing the humors into my mouth as before: In the end I had a great noyse and deafness in my Eares, pains, and strange dreams in my sleep, much disturbance in my Stomach, great heat and itching over all my Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when the Gout came again upon me, I was cleered from all these evills; so that I might say, (<hi>Silentia cuncta tranquilla sunt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>) saving, that when I had the Gout again, I did quickly and easily rid my self thereof, by drawing out the humors as I have before declared, which makes me believe that these humors were ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all parts of the Body, as men doe usually draine Quagmires.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Lastly, seeing I have spoken so much of this disease of the Gout, to be a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58229:40"/>
generall cure, for all other diseases, I think meet to add somewhat concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what dyet a man should use, when he hath the Gout. Before a man hath the Gout, a temperate dyet is best to preserve a man from it, but especially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to avoyd the moderate use of strong sharp Drinks and Wines, hot Spices, salt Meats, Tobacco, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when a man hath the Gout, and is desirous to be rid thereof quickly, a man may make a more liberall use of these things, which will urge nature to make more speedy vent, of the corrupt humors, from all parts of the Body, into some outward part of the Body, to be drawn out by outward applications as aforesaid, this may seem to be a Paradex but constant experience hath made me to presume to write so much: and then whether it be better to endure a little pain and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for a short time, which bringeth so much good to all the Body, and as I conceive prolongeth health, or to leave the Body to be continually troubled with languishing diseases, and to run up and down to the Bathe, Physitians, and Apochecaries, to their great charge
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58229:41"/>
and expence, I leave it to every mans judgement; and for a mans better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction herein, he may read the witty &amp; eloquent Apologie of learned <hi>Rilibal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in praise of the Gout.</p>
            <p>Thus I have made an end, of shewing<note place="margin">Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> a great part of the miserable case of mens Bodies, which comes to them by unavoydable course of nature, with shewing my well wishes to remedy the same, hoping that this may move some honest and learned Physitians to make more additions of more Artificiall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines thereunto, for relieving of mens miseries in those cases: But I am afraid of another greater misery, spoken of by the learned Physitian in his Preface <hi>Gratorolus,</hi> wherein he doth much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the miserable negligence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, who never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>thinks of the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of health untill it be too late, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the losse thereof: And for my part I shall end with that honest wish (<hi>Optan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano</hi>) that in every man there may be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and sound Soul in a sound Body: And so we shall all make a good end.</p>
