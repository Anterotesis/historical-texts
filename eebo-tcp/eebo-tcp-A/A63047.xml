            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE design of this
Treatise is, not to
stroak and tickle the
<hi>Fancy,</hi> but to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the <hi>Soul,</hi> and refine its
Apprehensions, to inform the
Judgment, and polish it for
Conversation, to purifie and
enflame the Heart, to enrich
the Mind, and guide Men
<pb facs="tcp:52038:3"/>
(that stand in need of help)
in the way of <hi>Vertue;</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
their Desire, to encourage
them to Travel, to comfort
them in the Journey, and so at
last to lead them to true Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
both here and hereafter.</p>
            <p>I need not treat of Vertues
in the ordinary way, as they
are <hi>Duties</hi> enjoyned by the
Law of GOD; <hi>that</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>The whole Duty of
Man</hi> hath excellently done:
nor as they are <hi>Prudential
Expedients</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> for a
mans Peace and Honour on
Earth; <hi>that</hi> is in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
done by the <hi>French Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52038:3"/>
of Wisdom. My purpose is
to satisfie the Curious and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Soul, concerning the
reality, force, and efficacy of
<hi>Vertue;</hi> and having some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
from the knowledge
I gained in the nature of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi>
(by many years earnest
and diligent study) my business
is to make as <hi>visible,</hi> as it is
possible for me, the lustre of its
<hi>Beauty, Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Glory:</hi>
By shewing what a necessary
Means <hi>Vertue</hi> is, how sweet,
how full of Reason, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
in it self, how just and
amiable, how delightful, and
how powerfully conducive also
<pb facs="tcp:52038:4"/>
to Glory: how naturally Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
carries us to the <hi>Temple</hi>
of <hi>Bliss,</hi> and how immeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
transcendent it is in all
kinds of <hi>Excellency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (if I may speak free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
my Office is, to carry and
enhance <hi>Vertue</hi> to its utmost
height, to open the Beauty of
all the Prospect, and to make
the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> appear, in
the Blessedness of Man, by
setting forth its infinite Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency:
Taking out of the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries</hi>
of <hi>Humanity</hi> those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that will discover the
great perfection of the <hi>End</hi> of
Man, which he may atchieve
<pb facs="tcp:52038:4"/>
by the capacity of his <hi>Nature:</hi>
As also by opening the Nature
of <hi>Vertue</hi> it self, thereby to
display the marvellous Beauty
of Religion, and light the Soul
to the sight of its Perfection.</p>
            <p>I do not speak much of
<hi>Vice,</hi> which is far the more
easie Theme, because I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
taken up with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Worth and Beauty in
<hi>Vertue,</hi> and have so much to
say of the positive and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Goodness of its Nature.
But besides, since a strait Line
is the measure both of it self,
and of a crooked one, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That the very Glory of
<pb facs="tcp:52038:5"/>
               <hi>Vertue</hi> well understood, will
make all <hi>Vice</hi> appear like <hi>dirt</hi>
before <hi>Jewel,</hi> when they are
compared together. Nay, <hi>Vice</hi>
as soon as it is named in the
presence of these Vertues, will
look like Poyson and a Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or if you will, as black as
<hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude:</hi> so
that there will need no other
Exposition of its Nature, to
dehort Men from the love of
it, than the Illustration of its
Contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vertues</hi> are listed in the
rank of <hi>Invisible things;</hi> of
which kind, some are so blind
as to deny there are any existent
<pb facs="tcp:52038:5"/>
in Nature: But yet it may,
and will be made easily appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that all the <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Beauty</hi> in the World proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from <hi>them,</hi> all <hi>Honour</hi>
and <hi>Security</hi> is founded in
them, all <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Esteem</hi> is
acquired by them. For the
<hi>Prosperity</hi> of all Kingdoms is
<hi>laid</hi> in the <hi>Goodness</hi> of GOD
and of Men. Were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World but the
<hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Amity,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the <hi>highest Vertue,</hi>
they alone would testifie of its
Excellency. For there can be
no <hi>Safety</hi> where there is any
<hi>Treachery:</hi> But were all
<pb facs="tcp:52038:6"/>
               <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Courtesie</hi> exercis'd
with <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> there
could be no <hi>Injustice</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint</hi>
in the World; no <hi>Strife,</hi>
nor <hi>Violence:</hi> but all <hi>Bounty,
Joy</hi> and <hi>Complacency.</hi> Were
there no <hi>Blindness,</hi> every Soul
would be full of Light, and the
<hi>face</hi> of <hi>Felicity</hi> be seen, and the
<hi>Earth</hi> be turned into <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things we treat of are
great and mighty; they touch the
Essence of every Soul, and are
of infinite <hi>Concernment,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Felicity is eternal that
is acquired by them: I do not
mean <hi>Immortal</hi> only but <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
to be <hi>Eternal:</hi> and it is
<pb facs="tcp:52038:6"/>
impossible to be happy without
them. We treat of Mans great
and <hi>soveraign End,</hi> of the
Nature of <hi>Blessedness,</hi> of the
<hi>Means</hi> to attain it: Of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
and <hi>Love,</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi>
and <hi>Goodness,</hi> of <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Holiness,</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi>
and <hi>Mercy,</hi> of <hi>Prudence</hi> and
<hi>Courage,</hi> of <hi>Temperance</hi> and
<hi>Patience,</hi> of <hi>Meekness</hi> and
<hi>Humility,</hi> of <hi>Contentment,</hi> of
<hi>Magnanimity</hi> and <hi>Modesty,</hi> of
<hi>Liberality</hi> and <hi>Magnificence,</hi>
of the <hi>waies</hi> by which <hi>Love</hi> is
<hi>begotten</hi> in the Soul, of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi>
of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and
<hi>Charity,</hi> of <hi>Repentance, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
<pb facs="tcp:52038:7"/>
Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
In all which we shew
what <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>mysterious
Creatures</hi> they are, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Operations of
Mans Soul; their great <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
their <hi>use</hi> and <hi>value,</hi> their
<hi>Original</hi> and their <hi>End,</hi> their
<hi>Objects</hi> and their <hi>Times</hi>:
What Vertues belong to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of <hi>Innocency,</hi> what to the
Estate of <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi>
and what to the Estate of
<hi>Glory.</hi> Which are the <hi>food</hi> of
the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the <hi>works</hi> of
<hi>Nature</hi>; which were occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Sin, as <hi>Medicines</hi> and
<hi>Expedients</hi> only: which are
<pb facs="tcp:52038:7"/>
               <hi>Essential</hi> to Felicity, and
which <hi>Accidental</hi>; which
<hi>Temporal,</hi> and which <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>:
with the true <hi>Reason</hi> of
their Imposition; why they all
are commanded, and how <hi>wise</hi>
and <hi>gracious</hi> GOD is in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
them. By which means
all <hi>Atheism</hi> is put to flight,
and all <hi>Infidelity</hi>: The Soul
is reconciled to the <hi>Lawgiver</hi>
of the World, and taught to
delight in his <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>:
All <hi>Enmity</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment</hi>
must vanish as
Clouds and Darkness before
the Sun, when the <hi>Beauty</hi> of
<hi>Vertue</hi> appeareth in its
<pb facs="tcp:52038:8"/>
               <hi>brightness</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi> It is
impossible that the <hi>splendour</hi>
of its <hi>Nature</hi> should be seen,
but all <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi>
will be manifest.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will meet some
<hi>New</hi> Notions: but yet when
they are examined, he hopes
it will appear to the Reader,
that it was the actual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of true <hi>Felicity</hi> that
taught him to speak of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>;
and moreover, that there is
not the least <hi>tittle</hi> pertaining
to the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
or altered in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
For he firmly retains all
that was established in the
<pb facs="tcp:52038:8"/>
Ancient Councels, nay and sees
Cause to do so, even <hi>in the
highest and most transcendent
Mysteries</hi>: only he enriches
all, by farther opening the
<hi>grandeur</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
with the interiour depths
and Beauties of <hi>Faith.</hi> Yet
indeed it is not he, but GOD
that hath enriched the Nature
of it: he only brings the Wealth
of <hi>Vertue</hi> to light, which the
infinite Wisdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Power of GOD have
seated there. Which though
Learned Men know perhaps
far better than he, yet he
humbly craves pardon for cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:52038:9"/>
in his <hi>Mite</hi> to the <hi>vulgar
Exchequer.</hi> He hath nothing
more to say, but that the Glory
of GOD, and the sublime
Perfection of <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
are united in Vertue. By
Vertue the Creation is made
<hi>useful,</hi> and the <hi>Universe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.
All the Works of
GOD are crowned with their
End, by the Glory of Vertue.
For whatsoever is good and
profitable for Men is made Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred;
because it is delightful
and well-pleasing to GOD:
Who being LOVE by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
delighteth in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
welfare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52038:9"/>There are two sorts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
Actions necessary to
Bliss. Actions in GOD, and
Actions in Men; nay and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
too in all the Creatures.
The <hi>Sun</hi> must warm, but it
must not burn; the <hi>Earth</hi>
must bring forth, but not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up; the <hi>Air</hi> must cool
without starving, and the <hi>Sea</hi>
moisten without drowning:
<hi>Meats</hi> must feed but not poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<hi>Rain</hi> must fall, but not
oppress: Thus in the inferiour
Creatures you see Actions are
of several kinds. But these may
be reduced to the Actions of
GOD, from whom they
<pb facs="tcp:52038:10"/>
spring; for he prepares all
these Creatures for us. And it
is necessary to the felicity of
his Sons, that he should make
all things healing and amiable,
not odious and destructive: that
he should Love, and not Hate:
And the Actions of Men must
concur aright with these of
GOD, and his Creatures.
They must not <hi>despise</hi> Blessings
because they are given, but
<hi>esteem</hi> them; not <hi>trample
them under feet,</hi> because they
have the benefit of them, but
<hi>magnifie</hi> and extol them: They
too must <hi>Love,</hi> and not <hi>Hate</hi>:
They must not <hi>kill</hi> and <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52038:10"/>
but <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the End, for the sake of which, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is desired.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is the Prerogative of Humane
Nature to understand it self, and
guide its Operations to a Known
End: which he doth wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
that lives at random, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering what is worthy of his
Endeavors, or fit for his Desires.</p>
               <p>THE End is that which crowns the
Work; that which inspires the Soul with
Desire, and Desire with a quick and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Industry. It is last attained, but first
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52038:18"/>
intended in every Operation. All Means
which can be used in the Acquisiton of it,
derive their value from its Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and we are encouraged to use them
only on the Account of that End, which
is attained by them.</p>
               <p>IT is the Office of <hi>Morality</hi> to teach
Men the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them in the Practice of it, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
its use and Efficacy.</p>
               <p>THE Excellence of Virtue, is the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Efficacy thereof in the Way to
Felicity. It consisteth in this, Virtue is
the only Means, by which Happiness can
be obtained.</p>
               <p>SINCE the Consideration of the End
is that alone, which does animate a
Man, to the use of the Means, they that
treat of Virtue do worthily propose the
End in the beginning, and first shew the
Excellency of Bliss before they open
the Nature of Virtue. For it is a vain
thing to discover the Means, unless the
End be desired by those to whom the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and use of them, in their tendency to
that End, is taught and commended; for if
the End be despised, all endeavors are
but fruitless, which instruct us in the
Means; and the Knowledge of them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52038:18"/>
vain, if they never be used or improved.</p>
               <p>THAT Reason, whereby Man is able
to Contemplate his End, is a singular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
wherein he is priviledged above
a Beast. It enables him not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Nature and perfection of his
End, but the Equity and fitness of the
Means in Order thereunto and the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Excellency of his first Cause, as its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Goodness appeareth in the Design
and Contrivance: Especially in making
mans Happiness so compleat and perfect.</p>
               <p>THE Heathens, who invented the
name of <hi>Ethicks,</hi> were very short in the
Knowledge of Mans End: But they are
worse then Heathens, that never consider it.</p>
               <p>THE more Excellent the End is, the
more prone by nature we are to pursue it,
and all the Means conducive thereunto
are the more Desirable.</p>
               <p>REASON, which is the formal Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Soul of Man, guides Him to
desire those Things, which are absolutely
supreme. For it is an Eternal Property
in Reason to prefer the Better, above the
Worse: He that prefers the worse above
<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Better acts against Nature, and

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wervs from the Rule of Right Reason.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER Varieties of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52038:19"/>
there are concerning Happiness,
all conclude and agree in this, that Mans
last End is his perfect Happiness: And the
more Excellent his Happiness is, the more
ought his Soul to be enflamed with the
Desire of it, and inspired with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Industry.</p>
               <p>THE more perfect his Bliss is,
the greater is the Crime of despising
it. To pursue an infinite and Eternal
Happiness is Divine and <hi>Angelical;</hi> to
pursue a Terrene and Sensual Felicity, is
<hi>Brutish;</hi> but to place Felicity in Anger
and Envy is <hi>Diabolical:</hi> the pleasures of
Malice being Bitter and Destructive.</p>
               <p>TO live by Accident, and never to
pursue any Felicity at all, is neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
nor Brutish, nor Diabolical: but
<hi>Worse</hi> then any Thing in some respect
in the World: It is to act against our
<hi>own</hi> Principles, and to wage war with our
very <hi>Selves.</hi> They that place their Ease
in such a Carelessness, are of all others,
the greatest Enemies and Disturbers of

of a mean estate, upon a suspicion
there is no true happiness, because
the nature thereof is so much doubted
in the World. The Disputations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
its nature argue its existance. And
we must cease to be Men, before we can
extinguish the desire of being Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
He only is truely Generous, that
aspires to the most perfect Blessedness of
which God and Nature have made him
Capable.</p>
               <p>BY how much Greater the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is, by so much the more Heedful
ought we to be, lest we should be sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and deceived, in the Choice of
Happiness: For the Danger is the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And by how much the more Eager
Men are in their Disputations, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, by so much the more weighty is
the Nature of the Theme to be presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>HASTINESS in catching at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined
Felicity, is the great Occasion
of all the Error about it, among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
who are led, like Beasts, by their
<hi>Sense</hi> and Appetite, without discerning
or improving any other faculty. The
lip of the Cup is annointed with Hony,
which, as soon as they taste, they drink
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52038:20"/>
it up, tho the liquor be nothing but Gall
and Poyson. Being deluded with a shew,
instead of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> they rush hand over
head on their own <hi>Destruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is as natural to Man to desire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
as to live and breath: Sence and
Instinct carry him to Happyness, as well
as Reason: onely <hi>Reason</hi> should rectifie
and direct his <hi>Instinct,</hi> inform his <hi>Sence,</hi>
and compleat his <hi>Essence,</hi> by inducing
those perfections of which it is capable.</p>
               <p>THINGS Good in themselves, when
they stand in Competition with those
that are better, have the notion of Evil:
Better Things are Evil, if compared
with the Best; especially where the
Choice of the one hinders the Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the other. For where Good,
Better, and Best, are subservient to each
other, the one is the better for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sake; but where they interfere,
and oppose each other, the Good are
bad in comparison of the Better, and the
Better worse than the Best of all. This
is the Cause why Reason cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in any Felicity less than the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme:
which must needs be infinite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Almighty Power, which made
Reason active, is illimited in its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52038:20"/>
and never rests, but in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Glorious Act, that is infinite
in Perfection.</p>
               <p>IF Felicity be infinite, the Loss is as
great, that attends our Miscarriage, and
the misery intolerable, that follows our
Loss. For (our eyes being open) a
Loss that is incomprehensible must needs
produce a Greif unmeasurable, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
as infinite as our Damage.</p>
               <p>ALL inferiour felicities are but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
compared with the Highest. A far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is <hi>good</hi> and pleaseth a Beggar in
time of distress: but a piece of Gold is
<hi>Better.</hi> An Estate of a thousand pounds
a year is better than a Piece of Gold;
but our Ambition carries us to Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Empires. An Empire is more
desirable than a Province; and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the Richer, the Better it is, the more
Desirable. But the Empire of all the Earth
is a Bubble compared to the Heavens:
And the Heavens themselves less than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to an infinite Dominion.</p>
               <p>PERFECT Felicity is not Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
nor Pleasure, nor Riches alone,
nor Learning, nor Virtue, nor Honour;
but all in Perfection. It requires that
every Soul should be capable of infinite
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52038:21"/>
Dominion, Pleasure, Learning, and Honor
for the full and perfect attainment of it.</p>
               <p>IF all these be infinite and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in that Felicity which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for Man, those Actions are of
inestimable Value, by Virtue of which
his Felicity is gained; and it becomes
his Wisdom and Courage to suffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Things for so noble an End: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if in this Life it may in any
measure be thereby acquired and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p>THE Great Reason why GOD has
concealed Felicity from the Knowledge
of man, is the enhancement of its nature
and value: but that which most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
it, is the Corruption of Nature.
For as we have corrupted, so have we
blinded our selves. Yet are we led by
Instinct eagerly to thirst after things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
remote and forbidden. The truth
is, our Palates are vitiated, and our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
so Corrupted, that till our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be purified by a little Industry, to
make felicity Known, is but to Expose it
to Contempt and Censure. It is too Great
and Pure for perverted Nature.</p>
               <p>THE Concealment of an object
whets our Appetite, and puts and Edge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52038:21"/>
upon our endeavours, and this carries
some thing of Mystery in it; For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Maxime is <hi>Ignoti nulla Cupido, All
Love comes in at the Eye,</hi> we affect an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to which we are Blind, and the more
Blind we are, the more restless. We
are touched with an unknown Beauty
which we never saw, and in the midst of
our Ignorance are actuated with a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
which does not abate the value of
our Virtues, but put Life and Energy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Actions.</p>
               <p>THO Felicity cannot, perfectly be
understood, because it is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
to Men on Earth, yet so much
of it may be discerned, as will serve to
meet our Instinct, and feed our Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
animate our Endeavour, encourage
our Expectation (to hope for more
then we enjoy) enable us to subdue
our Lusts, support us in temptations, and
assist us in overcoming all obstacles what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p>INFINITE Honors and Pleasures, were
there no more in Felicity, are enough to
allure us: but the fruition of all in the Best
of Manners, in Communion with God,
being full of Life, and Beauty, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in himself, and having the certain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52038:22"/>
Assurance that all shall be included in his
Bliss, that can be thought on; it is a
Thing so Divine, that the very Hope of
it fills us with Comfort here, and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
with perfect Satisfaction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>HE that can enjoy all Things in the
Image of GOD, needs not covet their frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a Baser Manner: Man was made in
GODS Image, that he might live in his
Similitude.</p>
               <p>I am not so Stoical, as to make all Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
consist in a meer Apathy, or freedom
from Passion, nor yet so Dissolute, as to
give the Passions all their Liberty. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I perswade you to renounce the
Advantages of Wealth and Honor, any
more then those of Beauty and Wit: for
as a Man may be Happy without all these,
so may he make a Happy use of them when
he has them. He may be happy with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
without them, but Easily with them.
If not in Heaven, yet certainly on Earth,
the Goods of fortune concur to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of <hi>Temporal Felicity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where they are freely given, are not
to be despised.</p>
               <p>THAT which I desire to teach a man
is, How to make a Good use of all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52038:22"/>
of his Birth and Breeding;
How in the Increase of Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
to be Happy in their Enjoyment:
How to secure himself in the temptations
of Affluence, and to make a man glorious
in himself, and delightful to others in
Abundance: Or else if Affliction should
arise, and the State of Affairs change,
how to triumph over <hi>adverse</hi> Fortune,
and to be Happy notwithstanding his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.
How to govern himself in all
Estates so as to turn them to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>FOR tho felicitie be not absolutely
perfect in this World, nor so compleat
in Poverty, as in a great and plentiful
Estate; you are not to believe that wealth
is absolutely necessary; because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is requisite to forfeit all for
the sake of Felicity. Nothing is absolutely
necessary to Bliss, but Grace and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
tho to <hi>perfect Bliss,</hi> Ease and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
be absolutely necessary.</p>
               <p>THERE are many degrees of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
beneath the most Supream, that
are transcendently Sweet and delightful:
And it sometimes happens, that what is
most bitter to <hi>Sence,</hi> is pleasant to
<hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52038:23"/>RATHER then make Shipwrack of
a good Conscience, we must do as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
in a storm, cast our riches over
board for our <hi>own</hi> Preservation. It is
better losing <hi>them,</hi> then <hi>our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VERTUE is Desirable and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
because it teacheth us through many
Difficulties in this Tempestuous World
to Sail Smoothly, and attain the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Nature of Felicity, its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and Perfection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> so far forth as
they contemplated the Nature
and Estate of man <hi>in this World,</hi> were
Wise, in defining the Goods of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
Soul and Fortune to concur to Mans
perfect Happiness. For Difficulties and
Conflicts are not Essential to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Bliss,</hi> nor confistent with the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its fulness and Perfection.</p>
               <p>THERE is the Way, and the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
end.</p>
               <p>IN the Way to Felicity many things
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52038:23"/>
are to be <hi>endured,</hi> that are not to be
<hi>desired.</hi> And therefore is it necessary,
to make a Distinction between the way
to Felicity, and the Rest which we attain
in the end of our Journey.</p>
               <p>THE Goods of the Soul, are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary in the Way to Happiness;
the Goods of the Body are very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
and those of Fortune Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough. But the latter of these are
not with too much eagerness to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued.</p>
               <p>THE Goods of the soul are wisdom,
Knowledg, Courage, all the Virtues,
all the Passions, Affections, Powers and
faculties. And these you know are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary.</p>
               <p>THE Goods of the Body are Health,
Agility, Beauty, Vivacity, Strength and
Libertie: and these shall in Heaven it
self, together with those of the Soul,
he enjoyed. By which you may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that the Goods of the Body are real
Parts and Ingredients of Happiness.</p>
               <p>THE Goods of Fortune are food
and Rayment, Houses and Lands, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Honours, Relations and Friends,
with all those convenient Circumstances
without the Body, that are subject to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52038:24"/>
chance. By which vertue is assisted, and
of which a noble use may be made, in
Works of Justice, Hospitality, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
and Charity, which may redound to
our greater Felicity here and in heaven.</p>
               <p>THE more Honor and pleasure we
enjoy, the Greater and more Perfect is
our present Happiness: Tho many times
in the Way to Felicity, we are forced to
quit all these, for the Preservation
of our Innocence.</p>
               <p>GALLANT Behavior in flighting all
Transitory things for the Preservation of
our Virtue, is more conducive to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Perfection, then the greatest ease
imaginable in our present condition.</p>
               <p>IT is incumbent upon us, as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part of our Care, to take heed,
that we be not ensnared by the easiness
of Prosperity, and that we do not set
up our Rest in the <hi>Way</hi> to Happiness,
nor deceive our selves in thinking the
Goods of Fortune Essential: nor discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
our selves, by thinking it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siable
to be Happy without them.
Our Thoughts and Affections must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
disentangled, that we may run,
with Alacritie the Race set before us,
and close with the Sublimest Perfection
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52038:24"/>
of Bliss, as our only portion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
               <p>FELICITY is rightly defined, to
be <hi>the Perfect fruition of a Perfect Soul,
acting in perfect Life by Perfect Virtue.</hi>
For the Attainment of which Perfection,
we must, in the Way to Felicity, endure
all Afflictions that can befall us. For
tho they are not Parts of Felicity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet we may acknowledge them
great Advantages for the Exercise of
Virtue, and reckon our Calamities among
our <hi>Joys,</hi> when we bear and overcome
them in a virtuous Manner, because they
add to our <hi>Honor,</hi> and contribute much
to our Perfection, both here, and hereafter.</p>
               <p>FOR this purpose we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that our present Estate is not that of
Reward, but Labour: It is an Estate of
Trial, not of Fruition: A Condition
wherein we are to Toyl, and Sweat, and
travail hard, for the promised Wages;
an Appointed Seed Time, for a future
Harvest; a real Warfare, in order to a
Glorious Victory: In which we must
expect some Blows, and delight in the
Hazzards and Encounters we meet with,
because they will be crowned with a
Glorious and joyful Triumph; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52038:25"/>
with ornaments and trophies fa<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
surpassing the bare Tranquillity of idle
peace.</p>
               <p>WHEN we can cheerfully look on an
Army of Misfortunes, without Amazement
we may then freely and Delightfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the Nature of the Highest Felicity.</p>
               <p>ARISTOTLE never heard of our
Ascension into Heaven, nor of sitting
down in the Throne of GOD, yet by
a lucky Hit (if I may so say) fell in point
blanck upon the Nature of Blessedness.
For a perfect fruition by perfect virtue, is
all that can be thought of: It implies
our <hi>Objective,</hi> and our <hi>formal</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OBJECTIVE Happiness</hi> is all the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is fit to be enjoyed either in
GOD or in his Creatures: while <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Happiness</hi> is an active Enjoyment of
all Objects by Contemplation and Love,
attended with full Complacency in all
their Perfections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PERFECT Fruition</hi> implies the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of all its Objects. Among which
GOD himself is one, Angels and Saints
are next, the World also with all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Creatures in it, the Laws of
GOD, and his wayes in all Ages, his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52038:25"/>
Counsels and Divine Attributes
are other Objects of our Content and
Pleasure. Unless all these be perfect in
their Nature, Variety, Number, Extent,
Relation, Use and Value, our fruition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be simply perfect, because a Greater
and more perfect fruition might, upon the
production of better Objects, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
and no fruition can be truly
perfect, that is not conversant about the
highest things. The more Beautiful the
Object is, the more pleasant is the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But where Delight may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
the Fruition is imperfect.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Perfect Soul</hi> is a Transcendent Mystery.
As GOD could not be Perfect, were it
possible there could be any Better Essence
then he; so neither would the Soul be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
could any more Perfect Soul be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>IT is a Soul in which no Defect, or
Blemish can be discerned; perfect in the
variety and Number of its Powers, in
the fitness and Measure of every power,
in the use and value of every Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
A perfect Soul is that whereunto
nothing can be added to please our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re.
As all its Objects are perfect, so
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it self. It is able to see all that is to
be seen, to love all that is Lovely, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52038:26"/>
hate all that is Hateful, to desire all that
is Desirable, to honour all that is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
to esteem all that can be valued,
to delight in all that is Delightful, and to
enjoy all that is Good and fit to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
If its Power did fall short of any one
Object, or of any one Perfection in any
Object, or of any Degree in any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
it would be imperfect, it would
not be the Master piece of Eternal Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PERFECT life</hi> is the full exertion
of perfect power. It implies two things,
Perfection of Vigour, and perfection of
intelligence, an activity of life, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through all Immensity, to all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
whatsoever; and a freedome from
all Dulness in apprehending: An exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Tenderness of perception in feeling
the least Object, and a <hi>Sphere of activity</hi>
that runs parallel with the Omnipresence
of the Godhead. For if any Soul lives
so imperfectly, as to see and know but
some Objects, or to love them remisly,
and less then they deserve, its Life is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
because either it is remisse, or
if never so fervent, confined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PERFECT Fruition,</hi> (as it implie<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the Perfection of all objects) more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imports the intrinsick Perfection o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
its own Operations. For if its Object
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52038:26"/>
be never so many, and perfect in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
a Blemish lies upon the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if it does not reach unto all their
Excellence. If the Enjoyment of one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be lost, or one Degree of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
abated, it is imperfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PERFECT Vertue</hi> may best be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by a consideration of its Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
Perfect <hi>Knowledg</hi> is a thorow
compleat understanding of all that may
be Known. Perfect <hi>Righteousness</hi> is a
full and adequate Esteem of all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
that is in Things. It is a Kind of
Spiritual Justice, whereby we do Right
to our selves, and to all other Beings.
If we render to any Object less than it
deserves, we are not <hi>Just</hi> thereunto. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Wisdome</hi> is that whereby we chuse
a most perfect end, actualy pursue it by
most perfect Means, acquire and enjoy
it in most perfect manner: If we pitch
upon an inferiour end, our Wisdom is
imperfect; and so it is, if we pursue it
by feeble and inferior Means, or neglect
any one of those Advantages, whereby
we may attain it. And the same may
be said of all the Vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOW if all Objects be infinitely
Glorious, and all Worlds fit to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52038:27"/>
if GOD has filled Heaven and
earth, and all the Spaces above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
with innumerable pleasures, if his
infinite Wisdome, Goodness, and Power
be fully Glorified in every Being, and
the Soul be created to enjoy all these
in most perfect Manner; we may well
conclude with the Holy Apostle, that
we are</hi> the children of GOD, and if
Children, then Heirs, Heirs of GOD,
and joynt heirs with Christ, if so be that
we suffer with him, that we may also be
glorified together. That our light Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is but for a Moment, worketh out
for us, a far more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Weight of Glory: That beholding as in
a Glass the Glory of the Lord, we shall at
last be transformed into the same Image
from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord. <hi>For all his Works, of
which the Psalmist saith,</hi> They are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be had in remembrance, and are
sought out of all them that have pleasure
therein, <hi>are like a Mirror, wherein his
Glory appeareth, as the face of the Sun
doth in a clear fountain. We may conclude
further that Vertue, by force of which we
attain so great a Kingdome, is infinitely
better then Rubies, all the Things thou
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52038:27"/>
canst desire, are not to be compared to
her: So that with unspeakable comfort
we may take Courage to go on, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the study, but the Practice of all
kind of Vertues, concerning which we
are to treat in the ensuing Pages. For
as the Apostle</hi> Peter <hi>telleth us,</hi> He hath
given to us all things that pertain to Life
and Godliness, through the Knowledge of
him that hath called us to Glory and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
whereby are given unto us exceeding
great and precious Promises; that by
these you might be Partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

that is in the World through List.
And besides this, <hi>saith he,</hi> giving all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,

                  <hi>VERTUE</hi> is a comprehensive Word,
by explaining which we shall make the
way more easy to the right Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all those particular Vertues, into
which it is divided. Forasmuch as the
Nature of Vertue enters into knowledge,
Faith, Hope, Charity, Prudence, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Meekness, Humility, Temperance,
Justice, Liberality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every one of
these hath its <hi>essence</hi> opened in part, by
the explication of that which entreth
its Nature, which is <hi>VERTUE</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>THE Predicament of <hi>Quality</hi> contains
within it either Natural <hi>Dispositions</hi> or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi>:
Habits may be either <hi>Vertuous</hi> or
<hi>Vicious</hi>; Virtuous Habits are either
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52038:29"/>
                  <hi>Theological, Intellectual, Moral,</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi>
And these are branched into so many
Kinds of Vertue, as followeth.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Theological Vertues</hi> are generally
divided into Three, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and
<hi>Charity:</hi> which are called <hi>Theological,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have GOD for their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Object, and are, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
taught by his. Word among the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Religion. To which we may
add <hi>Repentance</hi>; forasmuch as this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
tho it be occasioned by sin, is chiefly
taught by the Word of GOD, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
GOD as its Principal Object.
For which reason we shall account the
Theological Virtues to be four, Faith,
Hope, Charity and Repentance, to which,
if we making them more, we may add
<hi>Obedience,</hi> Devotion, Godliness.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Intellectual Vertues</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
reckoned to be five, <hi>Intelligence,
Wisdome, Science, Prudence, Art.</hi> Which,
forasmuch as the Distinction between them
is over-nice and curious (at least too
obscure for vulgar Apprehensions) we
shall reduce them perhaps to a fewer
number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>INTELLIGENCE</hi> is the Knowledg
of Principles; <hi>Science</hi> the Knowledg of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52038:29"/>
Conclusions. <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that knowledg, which
results from the Union of both <hi>Prudence</hi>
and <hi>Art,</hi> have been more darkly explained.
The Objects of Wisdom are alwayes <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
Prudence</hi> is that knowledge, by
which we guide our selves in Thorny
and <hi>uncertain</hi> Affairs; <hi>Art</hi> is that Habit,
by which we are assisted in composing
Tracts and Systems, rather then in regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our Lives, and more frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in Fiddling and Dancing, then in
noble Deeds: were it not useful in Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for the Instruction of others, we
should scarce reckon it in the number of
Vertues.</p>
               <p>ALL these are called <hi>Intellectual</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
because they are Seated in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and chiefly exercised in
Contemplation. The Vertues that are
brought down into action, are called
<hi>Practical,</hi> and at other times <hi>Moral,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they help us in perfecting our
Manners,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Minners</hi> in Latine are called <hi>Mores</hi> whence the English word <hi>Moral</hi> is derived.</note> as they relate to our Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Men.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> are either Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
or less Principal. The <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi>
are four: <hi>Prudence, Justice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi>
and <hi>Fortitude.</hi> Which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are the Hinges upon which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52038:30"/>
our whole Lives do turn, are called
*<hi>Cardinal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cardo is a <gap reason="illegible: broken type" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing.</note> and are commonly known
by the name of <hi>The four Cardinal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>
They are called <hi>Principal,</hi> not
onely because they are the <hi>chief</hi> of all
Moral Virtues, but because they enter
into every <hi>Vertue,</hi> as the four <hi>Elements</hi>
of which it is compounded.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>less Principal</hi> Vertues are <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi>
and <hi>Liberality, Modesty</hi> and <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
Gentleness of behaviour, Affability,
Courtesie, Truth</hi> and <hi>Urbanitie,</hi> all these
are called <hi>less Principal,</hi> not because
they are indifferent, or may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
useless, for then they would not be
Vertues: but because, tho their Practice
be of extraordinary Importance in their
places, they are more remote, and less
Avail in the Way to Felicity, and are
more confined in their Operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DIVINE</hi> Vertues (which we put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the Heathenish <hi>Heroical,</hi>) are
such as have not only GOD for their
Object and End, but their Pattern and
Example. They are Vertues which are
seen in his eternal Life, by Practicing
which we also are changed into the same
Image, and are made partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="several words"/> 
                  <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52038:30"/>
                  <hi>Truth,</hi> in the Sublimest Height we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to be Three: but we shall Chiefly
insist upon <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi>
and <hi>Holiness.</hi> All which will appear in
<hi>Divine Love,</hi> in more peculiar manner
to be handled.</p>
               <p>BESIDES all these, there are some
Vertues, which may more properly be
called <hi>Christian</hi>: because they are no
where Else taught but in the Christian
Religion, are founded on the Love of
Christ, and the only Vertues distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
a <hi>Christian</hi> from the rest of the
World, of which sort are <hi>Love to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Meekness</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALL these Virtues are shut up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one common Head, because they
meet in one common Nature; which
bears the name of <hi>Vertue.</hi> The Essence
of which being, well understood will
conduce much to the clear Knowledge
of every one in particular.</p>
               <p>VERTUE <hi>(in General)</hi> is that habit of
Soul by force of which we attain our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Or if you please,</hi> it is a Right and well
order'd Habit of mind, which Facilitates the
Soul in all its operations, in order to its Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.
<hi>These Terms are to be unfolded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>VERTUE is a Habit</hi>: All Habits
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52038:31"/>
are either Acquired, or Infused. By call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a Habit, we distinguish it from <hi>a
Natural Disposition,</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of the Soul.
For a <hi>Natural disposition</hi> is an inbred
Inclination, which attended our Birth,
and began with our beings: not
chosen by our Wills, nor acquired by
Industrie. These Dispositions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not flow from our Choise
and industry, cannot be accounted
Virtues. Tis true indeed that vertuous
Habits are sometimes <hi>infused</hi> in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Manner, but then they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
called <hi>Graces</hi> then <hi>Vertues</hi>: and are
<hi>ours,</hi> only as they are Consented to by
our Wills, not ours by choise and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
but only by Improvement and
exercise. Tho they agree with Virtues
in their Matter and their end, yet they
differ in their Original and form. For as
all Humane Actions flow from the Will
and the Understanding, so do all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
when they are rightly understood;
whereas we are Passive in the reception
of these, and they flow immediately from
Heaven.</p>
               <p>AND it is far more conducive to
our Felicity, that we should conquer Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in the attainment of Vertue,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52038:31"/>
study, chuse, desire, pursue, and labour
after it, acquire it finally by our own
Care and Industry, with Gods Blessing
upon it; then that we should be Dead
and Idle, while virtue is given us in our
Sleep. For which cause GOD ordered
our state and Condition so, that by
our own Labour we should seek after
it; that we might be as well pleasing
in his Eys, and as Honorable and
Admirable in the <hi>Acquisition</hi> of vertue, as
in the <hi>Exercise</hi> and Practice of it. And
for these reasons GOD does not so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
infuse it, and is more desirous that
we should by many repeated Actions
of our own attain it.</p>
               <p>GOD does sometimes upon the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Sloth of mankind inspire it, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up some persons thereby to be like
salt among corrupted men, least all should
putrifie and perish: Yet is there little
reason why he should delight in that way,
without some such uncouth and Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
necessity to compell him thereunto.</p>
               <p>FOR any man to expect that GOD
should break the General Order and
Course of Nature, to make him Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
without his own Endeavours, is to
Tempt GOD by a presumptuous Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesseness,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52038:32"/>
and by a Slothful abuse of his
Faculties to fulfil the parable of the
unprofitable Servant.</p>
               <p>THE Powers of the Soul, are not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
themselves, but when they are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with vertuous Operations, they are
transformed into Vertues. For Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are in the Soul, just as Limbs and
Members in the Body, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
be applied to Vertues and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
alike be busied and exercised in
either.</p>
               <p>AS the Members are capable of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Motions, either comely, or Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and are one thing when they are nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
another when attired, and capable of
being modified with several Habits: so
are the Powers and Faculties of the Soul.
As they are in the Nature of Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Exercise, they are void and Naked:
But by many acts of Vice or Vertue,
they put on a Habit, which seems chiefly
to consist in an Inclination and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to such Actions, a Facility of
Working, an Aquaintance with them,
a Love to them, and a Delight in them;
For by long Custome it turns to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Nature, and becomes at last as
Necessary as Life it self; a confirmed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52038:32"/>
Habit being taken in and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Powers of the Soul by
frequent exercise.</p>
               <p>2. IN the second Definition we add,
that <hi>Vertue is a right and well ordered
Habit.</hi> A <hi>Habit</hi> is something added to
that, which wears it, and every Power
of the Soul is naked, without the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
wherewith long Custom cloaths it.
Much of the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of Vertue is
shut up in those Words, <hi>Right and well
ordered.</hi> For confused, irregular, and
careless Habits will be alwayes errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Deformed, and must consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
end in Dishonor and Miseries. He
must aim at the Mark, that hits it, for
only those actions that are well guided,
produce right and well order'd Habits,
which right and well orderd Habits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
can carry us to our Sovereign
end.</p>
               <p>A Mind in Frame is a Soul clothed with
Right Apprehensions: Thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
well ordered, Principles and
Contrivances well proposed, Means and
Ends rationaly consulted, all considered,
and the Best chosen. [Long Custom
in uring us to the Benefit and Excellence
of these, disposes the Soul into <hi>a right
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52038:33"/>
and well ordered Habit, or Frame of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
which regards that Glorious End
for which we were created.</p>
               <p>BY <hi>force of which we attain our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi>
Idleness and vertue are as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to each other, as fire and water.
In all vertue there is some force, and in all
Force much action. A vertuous, Habit
ceaseth to be virtuous unless it actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
us to virtuous Operations. As the
Powers of the Soul when they are well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
turn into Vertues, so is it by that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion</hi>
that we attain our Happiness. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is that right and well ordered Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
by force of which we attain our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ITS force is never expressed but in
exercise and operation. Yet even when
we are asleep, it may tacitely incline us
and make us ready, when we awake, to
be Vertuous. Perhaps the <hi>Habit</hi> Sleeps
and awakes with the Body: But if the
Habit and its Energie be the same thing;
it still sleepeth when its energie ceaseth: if
they be Divers, the Habit may continue
for some time without the force of its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</p>
               <p>BUT not to Divert into Blind and
Obscure Corners: Whether the Soul
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52038:33"/>
of a man a sleep may be stiled Vertuous
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r no; Whether the Habits continue
in him at that time without their Acts,
is nothing to our purpose. It is Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that when he is awake, he, that hath
a Vertuous Habit, is in all his Actions
inclined and Carried to his own Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
unless he falls into an oblivion
worse, than Sleep, because without
some such Damnable and vicious Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
he is always mindful of his Last End,
and tends towards it in a Direct Line.</p>
               <p>ALL his Actions derive a Tincture
from the first Principle, <hi>that Habit of
Soul by which he is carried toward his
own Felicity.</hi> All those Actions, that
Spring from that Habit tend to Bliss, and
by force of that Habit are made Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and with facility performed.</p>
               <p>ALL the Difficulty is in the Begnining.
Vertues in the beginning are like green
fruits, four and imperfect, but their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
is accompanied with sweetness
and delight. It is hard to acquire a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Habit at first, but when it is once
gotten; it makes all Virtue exceeding
Easie, nor Easie alone, but Happy and
delightful. For a virtuous Habit as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
acts according to its own nature,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52038:34"/>
as the Sun shines, which is light by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
It acts freely, yet when it does
Act, it must needs act Vertuous, and can
do nothing else. For it is no vertuous
Habit; but some other Principle that
exerteth vicious and bad Operations.</p>
               <p>HAPPINESSE is with so much
Necessity the end of Vertue, that we
cannot take a Due Estimate of the
Excellence of Vertue without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the tendency which it has to
Felicity. For as the Means are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
(and indeed no means) that
have no Relation nor Proportion to
their End: so would all the Vertues be
inept and Worthless (no Vertues) if
they did not in some Sort conduce to
our Happiness. For Happiness is the
adequate End, which by nature we seek
Wether it be Glory, or pleasure, or He
nor that we design, or wealth, or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
all that is Delightful, and Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our reason, is comprehended in
our Happiness. If we desire to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
GOD, or to please the Angels, or
be grateful to men, it is because we love
our selves and delight in our own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and conceit all those action
whereby we so do, either a Means, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52038:34"/>
a part of it. So that in the Partition and
Distribution of Vertues we must take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Course to display their Glory,
by exhibiting them in such a prospect,
as that is, wherein their Place and office
will appear in their Tendency towards
mans last End, his Blessedness and Glory.</p>

                  <p>Of the Powers and Affections of the Soul;
What virtues pertain to the Estate of

what to the estate of Glory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TWO things in Felicity are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to the Eye, Glory and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and the Faculties of the soul do in

atcheive Glory to our actions; <hi>Anger,</hi> to

that might stand in our way;
<hi>Appetite,</hi> to pursue the Pleasure in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>Fear</hi> to heighten our concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we might more dread the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of losing that Happiness, wherein
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52038:35"/>
no less then Glory and Treasure are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
united: <hi>Reason</hi> it self, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Felicities and weigh which is the
most perfect. <hi>Desire,</hi> to covet it; <hi>Hope,</hi> to
encourage us in the pursuit of it; <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
for the avoiding of all Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Impediments; <hi>Love,</hi> to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it; <hi>Joy,</hi> for its fruition; <hi>Hatred,</hi>
to keep us from the Misery which is
contrary thereunto; <hi>Boldness,</hi> to attempt
it; <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Despair,</hi> to punish and
torment us, if we fail to attain it. For
these two, being unpleasant affections,
serve to engage us in the pursuit of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
because we are loath to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the Sence of such Troublesome
passions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AMBITION</hi> and <hi>Covetousness</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the Soul, by the one of
which we are carried to <hi>Glory,</hi> by the
other to <hi>Treasure.</hi> And as all the
rest, so may these be made either Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
or Vices. <hi>Vertues</hi> when they are
Means conducive to the Highest end;
<hi>Vices</hi> when they distract and entangle
us with inferior Objects.</p>
               <p>THE Inclinations and affections of
the Soul may be Defective or excessive
in their exercise towards Objects. In
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52038:35"/>
relation to the Highest Object there is
no danger of excess. We can never too
violently either <hi>love</hi> or <hi>desire</hi> our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Happiness; our <hi>Hope</hi> can never
exceed its greatness, we can never too
much <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the fruition of it; Nor
can we exceed in <hi>Anger</hi> or <hi>Hatred</hi> against
those Things, that would bereave us of
it; or too much <hi>fear</hi> the Misery of that
Life, which will be ever without it;
or be affected with too much <hi>Sorrow</hi> and
<hi>Despair</hi> at the Losse of it. But if we

there is nothing in the World but
may be made, conducive to our highest
Happiness: Nor is there any value in any

or affection, no Vertue, no Grace, no

soever) can be of any Value, but
in order to Felicity. In real truth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without this can be Great or Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.
Every Vertue therefore must have
this, in common with all the Laws and
Ordinances, and Works of GOD, they
must all directly or Obliquely tend to
our supreme Happiness; upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
all their Excellency.</p>
               <p>SOME Vertues are necessary in the

Glory.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT <hi>seeing,</hi> it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to enjoy our Happiness, or find out
the Way unto it; therefore is <hi>Knowledge</hi>
necessary in all estates: without <hi>Loving</hi>
it is impossible to Delight in its Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
The Office of <hi>Righteousness</hi> is to
render to every Thing a Due esteem;
And without this it is apparent that no
Treasure can be to us, (tho in it self never
so great) of any value. <hi>Holiness</hi> is the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52038:36"/>
conscience that we make of discharging
our duty, and the Zeal wherewith we
avoid the Prophaness of its Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>Goodness</hi> is necessary, because we
our selves cannot without that be Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
nor unless we be Delightful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
enjoy our selves, or acquire Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The office of <hi>Wisdom</hi> is to chuse,
and pursue the Highest end, by the Best
of all means that can be chosen.</p>
               <p>THESE are Transcendent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
whereby even GOD himself
doth enjoy his Felicity. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on us by the Law of nature,
and so essentially united to our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Happiness, that no Blessedness or
Glory can be enjoyed without them.
Therefore are we to look upon them as
the Life and Soul of Religion, as <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Duties in all Estates for ever to be
exercised. They are all Exercised in the
very fruition it selfe, as will more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
be seen, when we come to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of these Vertues in particular.
They were enjoyned in the Estate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
without any need of a positive
Law, by the very nature of GOD and the
Soul, and of things themselves, and must
be exercised in the state of Grace and will
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52038:37"/>
abide for ever in the State of Glory.</p>
               <p>THAT Vertues might be <hi>ours,</hi> in
being wrought by <hi>our selves;</hi> and be
Vertues <hi>indeed,</hi> in being wrought with
<hi>Difficulty;</hi> that we might be so much the
more Laudable and Glorious in our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Condition, GOD gave us Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
in the beginning, that we might
chuse what we would, and placed us in
such an Estate; that, having in us only the
Seeds and Principles of all Vertue, we
might exercise our natural Powers of
our own Accord, for the Attainment of
that actual Knowledge, Wisdom and
Righteousness, wherein the Perfection of
our soul consisteth, and by which the
Perfection of our Bliss is to be enjoyed.
That being Naked by Nature, tho Pure
and clean, we might cloath our selves
with our own <hi>Habits,</hi> attain the Glory
of those Ornaments, in our own Acts,
for which we were created; And work
our <hi>own</hi> Righteousness, in such a Way
as GOD had appointed.</p>
               <p>FOR the Glory which we were to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is that Goodness which we are to
shew in our own voluntary Care and
obedience; and that Goodness is chiefly
expressed in the kind and Genuine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52038:37"/>
of our own Liberty, while we are
tender of Displeasing him, to whom we
are Obliged, and so Good as to gratifie
his Desires, tho we had no restraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</p>
               <p>TO make our selves amiable and
beautiful, by the Exercise of our own
Power, produces another kind of Beauty
and Glory, than if we were compelled
to be good by all his preventing Power.
All Goodness is spoiled by Compulsion.
Our own Actions, springing from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Fountain, deep within the Soul,
when voluntarily and freely exerted,
are more acceptable; and the Will,
whence they spring, is more excellent
and perfect. This I would have you to
note well, for the intrinsick Goodness
and Glory of the Soul consists in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of an excellent Will, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this it might be a piece of Dirt sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Gold; but no imputed
or annexed value could make it a
Jewel.</p>
               <p>THE Actions of GOD, or of the
Angels, or of other men towards it, add
no value to the Soul, if it will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it self. If it be Idle or unactive,
the more excellent the Actions of GOD,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52038:38"/>
and of all other Creatures are towards
it, so much the more deformed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
is the Soul: nor will all the Glory
of its Powers and Inclinations excuse
it, but the more Great and Divine they
are, the more abominable will it make it
self by abusing them, in frustrating their
Inclinations.</p>
               <p>FOR the removing of all Constraint,
and the infusing of greater Excellency
and Beauty into these holy Actions;
which he required from them, it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
GOD to make <hi>Men</hi> obnoxious to
Temptations, that having obstacles to
overcome, and disadvantages to strugle
with, Mans Righteousness might be
more full of Vertue, and himself made
capable of Victory and Triumph. For
this End he seated him in a low Estate;
even in an Estate of Trial: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was the Occasion of Exercising
Faith and Hope, because his Felicity
was distant from him: Faith in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Promises of God, and Hope in
waiting for the Accomplishment of his
Bliss: He had Occasions for Fear also, in
in relation to Gods Power and Justice,
who was able to remove his Happiness,
upon the least offence, and to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52038:38"/>
him that Misery that was denounced
for his Transgression. In this Estate of
Trial, Prudence, which is conversant in
nice Affairs, was to watch, and consider,
and direct his Behaviour, in the midst
of those Dangers and Temptations, that
might possibly be expected: His <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
was to be exercised in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Appetite; so that all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
satisfactions, and sensual Pleasures
might be limited and ordered, as it
most consists with his highest Happiness:
<hi>Humility,</hi> in the acknowledgement of his
own Unworthyness, who was taken out
of Nothing; and Gratitude in a kind of
just Retribution to his Benefactor, for
all the Glory to which he was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>ALL these Vertues are in themselves
Delightful, and Easie in their Exercise;
they immediately respect Felicity, and
are by nature necessary to Mans enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, they are consonant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and agreeable to the Circumstances
of his Happy Condition: His Fear and
Humility, which were in Paradise the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest,
were aided and comforted, with
a Transcendent Hope and Assurance,
that upon his Diligent Care, he might
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52038:39"/>
be Eternally Blessed; and with the
Sweet Sence of his Happy Change, and
a Glorious Admiration resulting from
the Comparison between his present E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and the Estate to which by his
Creator he was to be exalted.</p>
               <p>I will not say but there were more
Vertues than these to be Exercised in
<hi>Eden</hi>: But by these you may discern of
what nature they all are, and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
they must be such as obedience to
God, and Charity to one another.</p>
               <p>ALL <hi>Harsh</hi> and <hi>Sour</hi> Virtues came in
by Sin: and we are to look upon them,
not as Vertues intended by God and
Nature, but occasioned afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Use and Existence is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.</p>
               <p>WHEN we fell into Sin, we let
Death and Misery into the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
shame and guilt upon our selves,
defiled our Nature with Deformities
and Diseases, and made many Things
upon that Occasion, necessary to our
Happiness, that before were not so: And
whereas they have a Mixture of <hi>Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Advantage</hi> in them, we may
thank our selves for the <hi>Bitterness,</hi>
and GOD for the <hi>Advantage</hi>: For as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52038:39"/>
we, by Sin forfeited our <hi>Happiness,</hi> so
a new Obedience, consisting in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of proper Vertues, was necessary to
recover it. Vertues, whose Names and
Natures were of another kind, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of before: All which we must
look upon, not as Food, but Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and considering them under the
notion of Remedies, not admire that
there should be something in them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasteful
to Sence, tho they are now,
when their Occasions are known, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
agreeable to Reason.</p>
               <p>THEY are but an <hi>AEquivocal</hi> Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of the Fall: Sin could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
such beautiful Children, as Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Repentance, Patience, Alms-Deeds,
Self Denyal, Submission and Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Divine Will, Fortitude, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in all Estates, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>WHILE there was no Sin, there
<hi>was</hi> no need of <hi>Penitence</hi>; while there
was no <hi>Pain</hi> or Misery, no <hi>Patience</hi>;
Without wrongs and Injuries there is
no use of <hi>Meekness</hi>; nor place for <hi>Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Deeds,</hi>
where there is no <hi>Poverty</hi>: no
Courage, where are no Enemies. In
<hi>Eden</hi> there was no ignorance, nor any
Supernatural Verities to be confirmed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52038:40"/>
by Miracles; Apostles therefore and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Ministers and Doctors were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
there, and so were Tythes
and Temples, Schools of Learning,
Masters and Tutors, together with the
unsavoury Duty incumbent on Parents
to chastife their Children. For as all
would have been instructed by the Light
of Nature, so had all been Innocent,
and Just, and Regular: Whereupon no
Magistrate had been needful to put any
to Shame, no Courts of Judicature, nor
Lawyers in the World. No Buying
and Selling, and thereupon no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Justice, because the Blessed Earth
had naturally been fertile, and abounded
with rich and Glorious Provisions: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
had been the Splendor and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of Men, as it will be in Heaven:
the Glorious Universe had been their
common House and Temple, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
fited for all Seasons, no Alien or
Stranger, no Want, Distress, or War,
but all Peace, and Plenty, and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
all Pleasure, and all Fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
throughout the World. Masters
and Servants had been unknown, had
we continued in that Estate, all had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the Liberty of Kings, and there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52038:40"/>
had been no Dominion, but that of
Husbands and Fathers, a Dominion as full
of sweetness, as so gentle and free a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
importeth. I can see no Use that
there had been of <hi>Trades</hi> and Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
onely the pleasant Diversion that
<hi>Adam</hi> had in dressing the Garden, and
the consequents of that: I am sure there
had been no Funeral <hi>Pomps,</hi> no <hi>Sickness,
Physick,</hi> or <hi>Physician.</hi> There had been
no <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son
of God, because no occasion for that
Incarnation, no Ceremonial <hi>Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
no <hi>Baptism,</hi> nor <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there were no supernatural My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
to be Typified, but the clear
Light of a Diviner Reason, and a free
Communion with God in the Right dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of those Vertues, Divine and
Moral, which naturally belong to the
Estate of Innocency. All which Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Primitive Vertues ought now
to continue, as it were the Face of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
beneath that <hi>Mask</hi> or <hi>Vizor</hi> of
Ordinances and new Duties, which Sin
and Corruption hath put upon it; Tho
we have forgotten the Vertues of our
first Estate, and are apt now to terrifie
our selves with that <hi>Disguise,</hi> wherewith
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52038:41"/>
we have concealed their Beauty, by
regarding only the Vertues, that were
occasioned by. Sin and Misery.</p>
               <p>IT is a great, Error to mistake the
<hi>Vizor</hi> for the <hi>Face,</hi> and no less to stick
in the outward <hi>Kind</hi> and Appearance of
things; mistaking the Alterations and
Additions that are made upon the Fall
of Man, for the whole Business of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And yet this new Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Vertues, that appeareth above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
is almost the only thing talked of
and understood in the World. Whence
it is that the other Duties, which are
the <hi>Soul</hi> of Piety, being unknown, and
the <hi>Reason</hi> of these together with their
Original and Occasion, unseen; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
appears like a sour and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Thing to the World, impertinent
to bliss, and void of Reason; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
GOD is suspected and hated,
Enmity against GOD and <hi>Atheism,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought into, and entertained in the
World.</p>
               <p>FOR it is an <hi>Idea</hi> connatural to the
Notion of GOD, to conceive him
<hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good</hi>: And, if we cannot see
some <hi>Reason</hi> in his Ways, we are apt to
suspect there is no <hi>Deity,</hi> or if there be,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52038:41"/>
that he is Malevolent and <hi>Tyrannical,</hi>
which is worse then none. For all Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness are contained in
Love: And if it be true that GOD is
Love, he will shew it in our Beings, by
making us Great and Excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
in his Gifts and Bounties, by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
us with real and serviceable
Treasures, in all his Laws, as well as in all
his Works, by consulting our Welfare in
the one and in the other. And as he makes
the World Glorious and Beautiful for us
to dwell in, so will he make such Actions
and Vertues only needful to be exercised
by us as are excellent and Divine: he
will impose no Duties but such as are full
of reason, and lead us more Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to Bliss and Glory.</p>
               <p>We are apt to charge our own Faults
on God, by confounding all things: and
because we see not how <hi>Penitence,</hi> and
<hi>Meekness,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> in roliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Poor, directly and immediately
bring us unto Bliss, are apt to repine at
their Imposition. But when we see all
these Virtues in their several Places and
Offices, their Objects and their Uses, the
Ends for which, and the occasions on
which they were introduced, all are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52038:42"/>
to the Reason of mans Soul, and
highly Eligible, while GOD is adored
and admired for the depth of his Wisdom
and Goodness, and beloved for the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Excellency of his Proceedings.
For all these Occasional Vertues are but
Temporary, when our Life, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World are past and gone as a Dream,
Love, and Joy, and Gratitude will be all
that will continue for ever, in which
Estate, Wisdom and Knowledge, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Righteousness, and True Holiness
shall abide, as the Life and Glory into
which the Souls of all that are Blessed
will be transformed. Repentance shall
be gone, and Patience cease, Faith and
Hope be swallowed up in fruition, Right
Reason be extended to all Objects in all
Worlds, and Eternity in all its Beauties
and Treasures, seen, desired, esteemed,
enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Let it be your Care to dive to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of true Religion, and not suffer your
Eyes to be Dazled with its Superficial Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
Rest not in the <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi>
that it bringeth, but search for the
Hidden Manna, the substantial Food un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath,
the Satisfaction of all Wishes and
Desires, the true and Coelestial Pleasures,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52038:42"/>
the Causes of Love, and Praise, and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
founded in the Manifestations of
Gods Eternal favour, especially in the
Ends, for the sake of which all Helps and
Remedies are prepared. For it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, that <hi>his Laws are Sweeter then
the Hony and the Hony Comb, and far more
precious then thousands of Gold and Silver.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>KNOWLEDGE and Love are so
necessary to Felicity, that there can
be no Enjoyment or Delight without
them. Heaven and Earth would be Dark
and obscure, Angels and Men vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
all the Creatures base and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable,
Felicity impossible, were there
no Knowledge. Nay GOD himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Knowledge and Love, could not well
exist; for his very Essence is seated in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Knowledge.</p>
               <p>GOD is Light, and in him is no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52038:43"/>
at all; He is Love by nature and
there is no hatred in his Essence. His ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Godhead is all Perfection, by the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Knowledge and Love in his Nature.</p>
               <p>THE Original of our Knowledge is his
Godhead, His Essence and his will are the
Fountain of it; and the stream so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that in all Estates it is for ever to be
continued, as the Light and Glory of the
whole Creation.</p>
               <p>THE understanding Power, which is
seated in Soul, is the Matter of that Act
wherein the Essence of Knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth:
Its form is the Act it self, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that Power of knowing apprehendeth its Object.</p>
               <p>ITS nature is invisible, like that of all
other Spirits, so simple and uncompoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that its form and matter are the same.
For all Powers, when transformed into
Act, are Acts themselves. And the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of understanding, in a Compleat and
Perfect Act of Knowledge attains its
Perfection, and is Power exerted, or an
Act in its Exercise. For every Act is
Power exerted.</p>
               <p>THE Power of Knowing is vain if
not reduced into Act; and the Soul a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
and Dreadful Cave, or Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52038:43"/>
of Darkness, if void of Knowledge.
Had GOD himself a Power of Knowing
Distinct from its Operation, if he never
exercised that Power, it would be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to him. His Glory and Blessedness
are seated in the Light of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
whichto us upon Earth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Inaccessible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF we would <hi>be perfect, as our Father
which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> our Power
of knowing must be transformed (into
<hi>Act,)</hi> and all Objects appear in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Light of our <hi>own</hi> understanding.
For tho all Eternity were full of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and the Whole World, and all the
Creatures in it transformed into Joys and
our Interest to all never so perfect; yet if
we are Ignorant of them, we shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
as poor and Empty, as if there were
nothing but Vacuity and Space. For not
to <hi>be,</hi> and not to <hi>appear,</hi> are the same thing
to the understanding.</p>
               <p>WERE a Man a Seraphim by his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or something by nature more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Divine then the Highest Order
of the most Blessed Angels, nay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Creature that Almighty power was
able to produce, his Soul and Body would
signifie nothing, if he were unknown to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52038:44"/>
himself, and were not aware of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.</p>
               <p>IF you would have a solid Prospect
of any Vertue, you must understand,
that Vertues are Powers transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into right, wise, and regular Acts,
avoiding all extremes of <hi>remissness</hi>
on the one hand, and <hi>excess</hi> on
the other. The Extreams of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
are Ignorance and Error.</p>
               <p>FOR ought you know Heaven and
Earth are as full of Treasures, as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power was able to create them,
and you by Nature, the best and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all possible Creatures, made like
GOD, for the highest and best of
all possible Ends, and called to live
in Communion with him, in all his
fruitions: but being vilely corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
you have lost the sence of all
these Realities, and are ignorant of the
Excellences of your own Estate and
Nature.</p>
               <p>I am sure that GOD is infinite in
Wisedom, Goodness and Power, and
nothing is wanting on his Part, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
your Desires: But yet you may be
blind, and idle, and ignorant, and dead
in a manner, while you are wanting to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52038:44"/>
your self, and have need of nothing,
but clear and perfect apprehensions, but
because they are Sottish and Erroneous
at present, they may make you mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,

               <p>IF Sin had been like <hi>Circe's</hi> Cup,
and changed the shape of Mans Body, to
that of a <hi>Swine</hi> or <hi>Dragon,</hi> the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his Nature had been plain and
visible; yet without knowing what
kind of Form he had before, it, would
not appear, because we should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
of his first Form, and unable to
compare the one with the other: But
Sin is a <hi>Moral Obliquity,</hi> and the change
it produceth in the Soul is <hi>Spiritual.</hi> It
makes a man to differ far more from
himself, than any alteration of Body can
do; but withal so blinds his Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that he does not remember what
he was in his first Parent; Tho the first
Man (who had experience of both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states)
was able to compare them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in his Corruption, he might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
retain a Sence of that Nature, and
Life which he enjoyed in his integrity:
Yet all his Posterity, that are born Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
never were sensible of the Light
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52038:45"/>
and Glory of an Innocent Estate, and for
that cause may be wholy ignorant both
of GOD and themselves, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to conceive the Glory of the World,
or of that Relation, wherein they should
by Nature have stood towards all the
Creatures.</p>
               <p>IT is impossible to conceive, how
great a change a slight Action may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.
It is but pressing the Wick a
little with ones Finger, and a Lamp is
extinguished, and Darkness immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made to overspread the Room. The
Glory and Splendor of the whole World
would vanish upon the Extinction of
the Sun: And one Instants Cessation from
the Emission of its Beams would be its
Extinction. A Soul is a more Glorious
Thing than the Sun: The Sphear of its
Activity is far Greater, and its <hi>Light</hi>
more <hi>Precious,</hi> All the World may be
filled with the splendor of its Beams;
Eternity it self was prepared for it!
Were there but one Soul, to see and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
all the Creatures, upon the suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of its Light all the Creation would
be rendred vain. Light it self is but
<hi>Darkness</hi> without the Understanding.</p>
               <p>THE Existence of many Souls is so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52038:45"/>
far from abating the value of one,
that it is by reason of their multitude
more useful and Excellent. For the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the Objects, imputes a Lustre and
<hi>Higher</hi> value to the Light wherein they
are enjoyed. And if Souls themselves
are more excellent than all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and arewith, and above all other,
to be enjoyed, that Power, whereby this
Soul is able to enjoy them, is more to
be esteemed, upon the account of those
Souls, than for all the other Creatures,
which are made for the same: GOD
himself and his holy Angels are Objects
of the Understanding. Those Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Glories, which the Sun cannot
extend to, the Soul can comprehend.
All which, since their Fruition depends
upon that Act of the Understanding by
which they are <hi>considered,</hi> reflect a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre,
and add a value to that Knowledge
by which the Soul does attain them.
Whereupon it follows that the infinite
value of all these is seated in the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;
and as the Power, so the Act of
Knowledg, on which their Fruition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth,
is of infinite use and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.
As the loss is infinite, when
the Soul is bereaved of them, so is the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52038:46"/>
mage, which it suffers by failing of its
Light, whether that Defect be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
or imposed by some outward Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.</p>
               <p>AS for the <hi>Use</hi> of Knowledge, it is
apparent enough. For the Relation
between the Use and Excellency of
things is so near and intimate, that as
nothing Useless can be at all excellent,
so is every Excellence in every Being
founded in its usefulness. The use of
Souls is as great as their Excellency:
The use of Knowledge as endless in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
as in Extent, and Value.</p>
               <p>KNOWLEDGE is that which
does illuminate the Soul, enkindle Love,
excite our Care, inspire the mind with
Joy, inform the Will, enlarge the Heart,
regulate the Passions, unite all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Soul to their Objects, see
their Beauty, understand their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
discern our Interest in them, form
our Apprehensions of them, consider and
enjoy their Excellences. All Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Raptures, and Extafies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Soul, and begotten by
Knowledge, all Laws, Obligations and
Rewards are understood by Knowledg:
All Vertues and Graces of the Mind are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52038:46"/>
framed by Knowledge, all Advantages
are by it improved, all Temptations
discerned, all Dangers avoided, all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
ordered, all Endowments acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
all the Ornaments of Life, all the
Beauties of the inward Man, all the
Works of Piety are affected by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
In the Light of knowledge all
Pleasures arise, and as Fruits and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are begotten in the Earth by the
Beams of the Sun, so do all kinds of
Joy spring from the Creatures, and are
made ours, by the help of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that shineth on them; its last
Off spring are Eternal Thanksgivings
and Praises. The Divine Image and the
Perfection of Bliss are sounded in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
GOD himself dwelleth in the
Soul, with all his Attributes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
by Knowledge: By it we are
made Temples of the Holy Ghost, and
Partakers of the Divine Nature, And
for this cause it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth,
<hi>That we might be filled with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1: 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>in all Wisedome and
Spiritual Understanding, that we might
walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
being fruitful in every Good Work, and
increasing in the Knowledge of GOD,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52038:47"/>
strengthened with all Might according to
his glorious Power, unto all Patience
and long-suffering, with Joyfulness giving
Thanks to the Father, who hath made us
meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of
the Saints in Light: who hath delivered
us from the Power of Darkness, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
us into the Kingdom of his Dear
Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Sun is a glorious Creature,
and its Beams extend to the utmost Stars,
by shining on them it cloaths them with
light, and by its Rayes exciteth all their
influences. It enlightens the Eyes of all
the Creatures: It shineth on forty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
at the same time, on Seas and
Continents in a general manner; yet
so particularly regardeth all, that every
Mote in the Air, every Grain of Dust,
every Sand, every Spire of Grass is
wholly illuminated thereby, as if it did
entirely shine upon that alone. Nor
does it onely illuminate all these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in an idle manner, its Beams are
Operative, enter in, sill the Pores of
Things with Spirits, and impregnate
them with Powers, cause all their Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
Odors, Vertues and Operations;
Springs, Rivers, Minerals and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52038:47"/>
are all perfected by the Sun, all the
Motion, Life and sense of Birds, Beasts
and Fishes dependeth on the same. Yet
the Sun is but a little spark, among all
the Creatures, that are made for the
Soul; the Soul, being the most High
and Noble of all, is capable of far
higher Perfections, far more full of Life
and Vigour in its uses. The Sphere of
its Activity is illimited, its Energy is
endless upon all its Objects. It can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Heavens in its Operations, and
run out into infinite spaces. Such is
the extent of Knowledge, that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be the Light of all Eternity. All
Objects are equally near to the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of its Beams: As innumerable mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
may be conceived in its Light, with
a ready capacity for millions more; so
can it penetrate all Abysles, reach to
the Centre of all Nature, converse with
all Beings, visible and invisible, Corporeal
and Spiritual, Temporal and Eternal,
Created and Increated, Finite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
Substantial and Accidental, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
and Possible, Imaginary and Real;
All the Mysteries of Bliss and Misery,
all the Secrets of Heaven and Hell are
Objects of the Souls Capacity here,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52038:48"/>
and shall be actually seen and known hereafter.</p>
               <p>WERE Almighty Power Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by filling Eternity with created ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and were all the Omnipresence
of God full of Joys, it is able, when
assisted by his Divine Knowledge, to
look upon all: and tho every one of
them should have an infinite Depth
within, an Endless variety of Uses, a
Relation to all the rest of the World,
the Soul, as if it were able to contract
all its strengths, from all the expansions
of Eternity and space, and fix them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Moment, or on this Centre, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
beholding this alone, in all its
fulness, can see its Original, its End, its
Operations, Effects and Properties, as
if it had nothing to consider but this
alone, in a most exquisite and perfect
manner.</p>
               <p>IT is not to be denied, that every
Being in all Worlds is an Object of the
Understanding: nor can that of the
Psalmist be doubted, <hi>In his Presence there
is fulness of Joy, and at his right hand there
are Pleasures for evermore</hi>: that is, his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence
is full of Joys, and his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Riches and Pleasures: nor is it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52038:48"/>
to be denied, that the Soul is by its
Creation intended for the <hi>Throne of GOD.</hi>
For it is made capable of his Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Eternity, and, as the Apostle
speaketh, <hi>may be filled with all the fulness
of GOD,</hi> which fulness is adequate to the
Immensity of his Eternal Power (of
which you will see more in the Vertues of
Love, Wisdom, Righteousness and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:)
This only is here to be noted, that
Nature never made any Power in vain,
but ever intendeth the Perfection of
what it produceth; and prepareth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for the understanding, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of which Power is the actual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of that Knowledge of which it is
capable.</p>
               <p>THE principal objects of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
are GOD, and a Mans self: The
Kingdom of GOD, his Laws and Works,
his Ways in all Ages, his Counsels and
his Attributes, Mans Interest and Duty,
Transactions of the World, the Thoughts
and Actions of Angels and Men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
which tho they may be stiled
less material Objects of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet in relation to GOD and a Mans
felf, are of great Importance.</p>
               <p>GOD as he is the Life and fountain
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52038:49"/>
of all Felicity, the End of all Perfection,
and the Creator of our Being, Almighty
in Power, infinite in Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Author of the universe, and Lord
of all the Creatures, is most fit to be
Known. <hi>Plato</hi> makes him the very <hi>Light</hi> of
the understanding, and affirms, that as
three Things are necessary to <hi>Vision,</hi> the
Eye rightly prepared, the object conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
seated, and Light to convey the
<hi>Idea</hi> to the Eye; so there are three things
required to compleat and perfect Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
an understanding Eye, an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Object, and a Light intelligible in
which to conceive it: Which last is GOD.
Nor is the Royal Psalmist and Divine
Philosopher <hi>David</hi> far from the Notion,
while he saith, <hi>In thy Light we shall see
Light.</hi> For GOD is the Light of the
understanding. His Nature is the Light
of all the Creation. Therefore it is said
by Christ himself that the <hi>Knowledge of
GOD is Life Eternal.</hi> For his Light is
the Life of men, and without him we can
do nothing. Till we Know his Nature,
we cannot apprehend the Excellency of
his Works: For all their Goodness is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from him, and ends in him. His Love,
moved him to create the World, and the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52038:49"/>
principal End for which it was made,
is the Glory of the Creator in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of his Creatures. The Glory of
the Creatures is seen in his. By his
Wisdom and Goodness we are guided
to the Hope, and Investigation of their
Excellence. His infinite bounty made
them all our <hi>Treasures,</hi> that for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of their Beauty and Worth we
might celebrate his Praises.</p>
               <p>HE that would not be a stranger to
the Universe, an Alien to Felicity, and a
foreiner to himself, must Know GOD
to be an infinite Benefactor, all Eternity,
full of Treasures, the World it self, the
Beginning of Gifts, and his own Soul
the Possessor of all, in Communion with
the Deity. That the Business of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is Complacency in GOD, and that
GOD never laid aside his Wisdom in any
Operation of his Power, never forgot to
make the least of his Works agreeable to
his Goodness. Nay rather he is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that his infinite Goodness, Wisdom,
and Power, are exerted wholy and wholy
Conspicuous in every Operation. It is
the Beauty of Truth that maketh Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of such infinite Value. For if all
the Treasures of Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52038:50"/>
be ordained for a Wise and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, if all Objects in the clear Light
of Heaven and Eternity be laudable and
Glorious, if Divine Wisdome hath so
far obtained, that the number and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of GODS Gifts is accurate, and
exactly answerable to the nature of its
causes; if every Soul, that will live in his
Image, may be the friend of GOD,
and acquire the Empire of the World,
and be Beloved of Angels, and admired
of Men; if fruition be the End of
Knowledge, and all Things made that they
may be enjoyed: Knowledge is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Thing that enriches the Soul, and <hi>the
Knowing Man is the friend of GOD.</hi>
The Exercise and Pleasure of this Divine
Amity is the End of the Creation, and
the Perfection of the Soul.</p>
               <p>The Knowledge of a Mans-self is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conducive to his Happiness, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it gives him Power to rejoyce in his
Excellencies, but as it shews him his
End, for which he was created. For
by Knowing what Inclinations and
Powers are in his Soul, he discerns what
is agreeable with, and fit for his Essence;
what objects and what Operations are
couducive to his Welfare, what means
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52038:50"/>
he is to use for the Attainment of his
End, and what that is, wherein his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
consisteth. If the Powers of his
Soul are illimited, his Desire infinite,
and his Reach Eternal, if he be able to
see and enjoy all Worlds, and all that
is above all Worlds in the Image of
GOD. If his Ambition carry him to be
Pleasing to all Angels and Men, and to be
Glorious in the Eyes of all Kingdoms
and Ages; if his Abilities are indeficient
for the fruition of all that is Excellent in
eternity it self, it is a token that he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for GOD, and the enjoyment
of his Kingdom: and a wicked folly to
restrain himself to the miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of a Cell, or Cottage, and
to delight in nothing but some frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Creation, that in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the whole are infinitely Defective.</p>
               <p>OF all other things I would have
this most deeply engraven in the mind,
that GOD hath exceeded all Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Works of his Hands, that he
that overcometh shall be the Son of GOD
and inherit all Things, that there is an
infinite end why the secrets of all hearts
shall at last be revealed, that in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all Thoughts and Things shall be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52038:51"/>
Known, that the Kingdome of Heaven
is so Glorious, that all the blessed are
Perfect Sovereigns, every one the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor
and End of it all: that all Things
proceeding immediately from GOD, are
the Best that are possible: that the best
and the worst things as ordered by him,
are perfectly amiable, and subservient to
Felicity, that he himself alone hath a
Proper Right to all that is excellent,
and that GOD is in every Thing to be
enjoyed, that he is enjoyed only when his
essence and his Works satisfie the Desires
of perfect reason, and exceed all Wishes in
filling and delighting the soul: That hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
filled the soul with infinite Wisdome,
he has laid infinite Obligations upon us,
and set infinite Rewards before us, made
Laws in finitely amiable, and given us
Duties infinitely Desirable: for which he
deserves eternal Adorations and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Love and Hatred. The necessity and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Love. Its General use and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
The several kinds of love. Of
the Power, Inclination and act of Love.
Its extent and capacity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BECAUSE Love is the most Desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Employment of the Soul, the
Power of Loving is to be accounted the
most High and Noble of the Faculties.
It is not seated by it self in the mind,
but attended with a mighty Proneness
and Inclination.</p>
               <p>THERE is no Creature so unsociable
and furious but it is capable of loving
something or other. Wolves and Tygres
live at peace among themselves, Lions
have an Inclination to their Grim Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses,
and Deformed Bears a natural
Affection to their Whelps, expressed in
their Rage, when they are bereaved of
them. Things must either be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Dead, or live in misery, that are void
of love. Whatsoever is endued with
Life and sence delights in easie and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52038:52"/>
Operations. Love is a necessary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of their Souls, because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to apprehend any thing Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but it must be pleasing; and what
is Pleasing must be Lovely. For to be
Pleased, and to love are the same thing.
If there be any difference, the pleasure
we take in any Object is the root of that
Desire, which we call Love; and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby we pursue the pleasure that is
apprehended in it, is part of the Love
that we bear unto it; the end of which
is the Completion of that pleasure which
it first perceives: All is Love variously
modified, according to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
wherein the Object is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>AS Love is the only Easie and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Operation, so is Hatred of all
other the most troublesom and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Displeasure and Enmity are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of its nature; and the fruits
of it (allyed to their Root) as Bitter as
Gall, and Wormwood. Murder, and
Vexation, and Grief are the off-spring
of the one, with Separation, Contention,
and Horror; Peace and Embraces are
the Fruit of the other, with Praises and
Complacencies, Honors, Services, Benefits
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52038:52"/>
and Pleasures. These are the little <hi>Cupids</hi>
that flie about this coelestial <hi>Venus,</hi> when
it is, what it ought to be, the Mother
of Felicity, and the Daughter of GOD.</p>
               <p>ALL Creatures that are sensible of
Pain or pleasure, must of necessity be
addicted to Love and Hatred; to the
Love of what is pleasing, to the Hatred
of what is Painful. And if any Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be made, which of these Twins is the
First born? the answer is; that they
may seem Twins in respect of Time, but
in nature Love is the first born, and the
Mother of Hatred. For where nothing
to be hated does at all appear, pleasant
Things are Beloved for their own sake:
whereas if there were no pleasant thing
to be beloved, nothing could be hated,
because nothing could be Hurtful, which
appeareth by this, because where there
is no Love, there is no Interest, and
where there is no concernment, there
can be no Affection, no Fear, or Hope, or
Joy, or sorrow.</p>
               <p>AS Fire begets Water by melting Ice,
so does Love beget contrary passions in
the soul of a living creature, Anger, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Envy, Grief and Jealousie: not by
its own nature, but by the accidental
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52038:53"/>
Interposure of some Obstacle, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
or endangers the fruition of its
Object. Were there no Love of Ease
and Pleasure, there could be no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or Quarrel between Competitors;
no Emulation or Desire, no Aversion
or Endeavour. All Enmity and Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
Springs from a Contention, who
shall enjoy what is Desirable; or from
some other Principle of Envy or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
in relation to what is Good: as
is Obvious to Daily Experience.</p>
               <p>LIFE and Love are so individualy
united, that to live without Loving some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is impossible. Even in Hell, where
their whole Life seemeth to be spent
in Detestation and Hatred, and actual
Love is, like fire under those Embers,
covered and continued, Could they
put off self Love, all Love of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and Interest, their Torments would
be gone: Punishments and Rewards are
things impossible, where there is not self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Love:
For without Love to something,
Pains and Joys are equally Grateful.</p>
               <p>AS <hi>Love</hi> is the Root of Endeavor, so
is it the Spring of all the Passions: They
all depend upon Love alone. We are
<hi>Angry</hi> at that which stands in our Way,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52038:53"/>
between our Love and its object: We
<hi>Desire</hi> an absent Good, because we Love
it: We <hi>Hope</hi> for it, when we conceive
its Attainment feasible: We <hi>rejoyce</hi> in
it, when we have it: We <hi>fear</hi> to lose
it: we <hi>grieve</hi> when it is gone: we
<hi>despair,</hi> if we cannot get, or recover
it: We <hi>hate</hi> all that is opposite to it.
And for this Cause is our Love, when
well regulated, the greatest Vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
upon the right Choise of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and true Goverment of it self, all
the Powers and Affections of the Soul are
well employed; and when we Love all
that we ought as we ought to do, we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
all Laws, Hope and Fear, and Hate, and
Grieve, and Desire, and Rejoyce, and
do every thing in a regular Manner.</p>
               <p>THERE is a Sensual and Brutish
Love, there is a Humane and Divine:
Brutish Love is of two sorts, the one
Springs from a Harmony of Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and a Sympathy of Bodies, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Consideration of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
abstracted. The First of these is
occasioned by a secret and unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Agreement of Tempers, by which
upon the presence of each other, the
Senses are delighted, we know not why;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52038:54"/>
it being a mystery in nature; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
founded in a grateful Transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Spirits from one to the
other.</p>
               <p>THE Consideration of Beauty seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
peculiar to the Love of Men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no Beast is observed to make any
Distinction between Lineaments and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nor upon any account of shape
and Colours to be delighted with each
other. Wherein Man exceeds the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of Beasts, in being able to note
and admire the Workmanship of GOD
in the decent Order of Symmetry and
Proportion.</p>
               <p>HUMANE Affection and Divine
Love are near allyed, yet of several
Kinds. If you take the Love of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in its utmost Height, it is always
Divine. For it is comformable to the
Love of GOD in its measures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
in its Effects and Causes. For
the Love of GOD is it self the Love of
perfect Reason. And as the Reason of
his Love is Infinite and Eternal, so is
its Operation. But in a lower Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
Humane Love differs from Divine;
it being founded upon Temporal Causes,
Vivacity, Wit, Learning, Beauty, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52038:54"/>
Moral Honesty, Fidelity, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Goodness, Power, Majesty, Wealth,
Nobility, Worth, Vertue, and the like.
But all these may be exalted, when they
are Sanctified, and made Divine by the
superadded concurrence of Coelestial
Causes. For when a Man loves another,
because he is made in the Image of
GOD, and by the Beauty of his Soul
is something more than Humane, this
Love is made Sacred, and receives a
Grace from the Influences of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>DIVINE Love strictly so called, is
founded on Eternal Causes, agreeable
to the Life of Heaven, Delightful to
GOD, and Pleasing to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>IF Divine Love be taken in the <hi>highest</hi>
Sense, there is none but in GOD.
For it is his Peculiar Prerogative to
Love without Obligation or Reward,
to be the Sole Author of all Felicity,
and to over-flow with Goodness of
himself freely, without any Motive, to
prevent the Beauty and Existence of his
Object, and to <hi>Love</hi> from all Eternity
in an immutable manner: And this is
the nature of Divine Love. Howbeit
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52038:55"/>
even here, are infinite Ends and Causes of
his Love, tho they are all in Himself: For
he <hi>Loves,</hi> that he may Love, and begets
that Love which is his Essence. His Love
is the foundation of all his Treasures, the
Cause and End of the whole Creation, and
that alone by which he proceeds from
himself (to all his Creatures, and by
those) to himself again for ever. All his
Kingdome and Greatness and Pleasure,
all his Wisdome and Goodness, all his Life
and Perfection is seated in Love, which
is his Beauty and his Holiness, his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and his Godhead. He Loves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he may be all Beauty and
Goodness, and Holiness, and that
he may enjoy himself and the Eternal
Pleasure of his Essence in Glory and
Blessedness for ever.</p>
               <p>IT is GOD alone that Loves by his
Essence, Angels and Men may Love by
Inclination, but their Affection is Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
to their nature, begins in time,
may alter and cease. It is subject to
Chance, Obligation and Reward, and
ought to be guided according to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of an Higher Agent. In this it
differs from the Love of God, but in
many things there is a great Agreement
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52038:55"/>
and proportion between them. For
GOD has made the love of Angels
and men so like his own, by extending
their Knowledge to all objects, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Perfections are contained in their
love. It is as GODLIKE as any Thing
created is capable of being; for Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Power and infinite Wisdome are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the production of it.</p>
               <p>FOR the better understanding of
this Love, we will consider it in the
power of Loving, in the inclination to
Love, in its act and Perfection. It may
seem a surprizing verity; but the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Loving is as necessary to Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Glory as life it selfe; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to love as necessary as the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and the act of Love as necessary as
the Inclination. The world is useless
without Life, and Life without Love,
the Body without the Soul, the Soul
without the Power of Loving, the
Power of Loving, without the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Inclination without the Act.</p>
               <p>IN the Power of Loving I shall note
nothing at present, but its Extent and
Capacity. In Beasts it is confined, but
in Men it is Endless. As a Beast is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to examine what spaces are above
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52038:56"/>
the Heavens, so is it unable to extend
its Affections beyond the memory of
things perceived, for a Beast cannot
represent to it self the Idea's of its Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors;
nor see into Ages that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its birth, nor contemplate Objects
that will be after it is Dead. But man
can see, and know, and love any object,
in any Age or Kingdom in the World.
He can look into any Region, tho it
be never so far removed and be
as familiary conversant with any Person
or Transaction there, when represented
once in a clear Light, as with any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in his own country. He can look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Eden</hi> consider <hi>Adams</hi> Dust in its first
Creation, survey the Procedure of
God in his Six Dayes Works, pass out
of Time into Eternity it self, run up to
the Original and fountain Head of all
existence, ponder the nature of GOD,
search in his Bosom for his Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
pierce into the Centre of the Earth,
and survey the Circumference of all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity.
His Love can follow his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in all its flights, while in spirit he
can be present with all the Angels. He
is able to Love not only his Family and
Relations, but all the City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52038:56"/>
where he liveth, all the Kingdom,
all the Cities and Kingdoms in the world,
all the Generations in all Kingdoms, all the
Spirits of Just men made perfect, all the
Cherubims and Seraphins, and GOD
blessed for ever. This is the extent:
The capacity of Love is so alsufficient,
that his Affection is not diminished, but
the more he loves one, the more he is
able, and the more inclined to love all
that are united to him. As in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
friendship, the more we love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the more we love his Wife and all
his children. For the more we love
any Person, the more we love all that
love him, or are beloved by him. As
the reasons of our Love increase, so
may our Love it selfe; the capacity of
Love being so indeficient, that it never can
be exceeded, or surmounted by its Object.</p>
               <p>THE Capacity of Love being so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
vast, multiplies and heightens in
the Soul of man, that is apt to overflow
of its own Accord. For nothing is so
prone to communicate it self as that
Active Principle of Love; that Soul
which is Generous and Divine, being
disposed to the exercise of Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
therein it findeth its Proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52038:57"/>
The very Sun is not more inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to communicate its Beams, then the
Soul to love. For the Soul being made
in the Image of GOD, who is Love
by his Essence, must needs be like him
in Power and Inclination, and is made
for nothing else but the Attainment of
its perfection, so that it can never rest,
till it actually love after his similitude.
Some Operation it must of Necessity
have. For as all Life, so all pleasure
is founded in Action.</p>
               <p>IF Love in its Perfection be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
all that is lovely is Beloved by
the soul; all the Capacity of Love is
filled with its objects, and all the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Creator and his Creatures,
at once enjoyed. It is the Life and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and enlargment of the Soul, it is
the Wisdom, and Goodness, and Glory
of the Soul. I confess there be many
Errors and Diseases in Love; and that
Love is alwayes miserable, in its Effects,
that is <hi>vicious</hi>: yet it so bewitches the
Sences, that the Soul being captivated
by the Force of present Delight is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
carried in an irresistible appetite
to those Things which Reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes,
and advises to shun as Evil.

               <p>LOVE is <hi>then</hi> a vice, when it is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
and illegal, rebellious and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,
Blind, Defective, Unjust, Absurd.
When Evil things are beloved, when
Good things are preferred above the
Better, and the Best neglected.</p>
               <p>VERTUOUS Love is that which
proceedeth from a well governed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and is seated in a Will that
is guided by Reason. It renders to all
things their just Due, and is the Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Parent of all Kind of Vertues. This
Love may be considered either in its
Properties, or <hi>Effects,</hi> the last of which
relate to the Soul it self, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of the whole man, to all
its Objects, when it is well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
it will be found the proper and
immediate Means by which we attain
our Perfection and Felicity.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What Benefit GOD himself does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by his Eternal Love. That when
our Love is made compleat and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
it will be like his, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of it will be Eternal.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEFORE we can fully discern the
Benefit of Love, or see the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it in all its high and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Effects, we must consider what Love is
and doth in GOD. For as we have said,
<hi>The Life of GOD is Love</hi>; nay the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>GOD is Love</hi>: By Loving he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his Love. And if his Love be his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
his Essence is an infinite and Eternal
Act of Love, by extending which through
all infinity, and by Loving Eternally, he
begot his infinite and Eternal Essence:
which is the Love that filleth all Worlds
with Beauty and Glory. When you
consider it well, An Act of Love is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Loving</hi>: And if his Wisdome, and
Goodness, and Blessedness, and Glory be
seated in Love, his Love is his Wisdome
which is the Son of GOD, and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and his Glory, and his Blessedness.
For all these, tho we conceive them
diversly, are the same Thing: and of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52038:58"/>
the Son of GOD it is said, that <hi>he is
the Wisdom of the Father, and the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Fathers Glory.</hi> He is the
Life of the Father, <hi>by whom also he
made the Worlds,</hi> and the Love of the
Father <hi>for whom all Things were created,
that are in Heaven, and that are in
Earth, visible and invisible, whether they
be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
or Powers: all Things were created
by him, and for him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 116.</note> For GOD en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth
all Things by his Love, which
is his Eternal Son; and made them as
perfect and delightful as it was possible
for things created to be, that he might
take Pleasure in them. As he himself
is made Glorious and Delightful in the
Eyes of all Angels and Men <hi>by</hi> Love, so
doth his whole Kingdom arise and Spring
<hi>from</hi> Love; the Beauty and felicity of all
his Creatures, their Joys and Praises, their
Uses and Perfections are founded in his
Love', by his Love he begetteth all his
pleasures in himself, by his Love he made
his Treasures infinite, and by that alone
doth he take infinite Pleasure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in himself and his Kingdome. Thus
useful is the Love of GOD.</p>
               <p>Had not GOD from all Eternity Loved,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52038:59"/>
had he never desired, nor delighted in
any thing; he had never exerted his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power, never communicated his
Goodness, or begot his Wisdom, never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
Himself, never applyed himself to
the Production of his Works, never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in his Glory to any eie whatsoever.
Removing his Love we remove all the
Properties and Effects of his Essence, and
are utterly unable to conceive any Idea of
his Godhead. For his Power, tho it be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
yet if it be Dead and idle, is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Deformed. Idle Power is not the
Essence of the Deity, but a meer Privation
and Vacuity; or at least a positive Being
as ignoble as it is unactive. The Reason of
his Works is founded in Love, so are all
the Obligations, that are laid upon his
Creatures to adore him. All their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
are founded in Love, and by Love
prepared: All his Laws are the Laws of
Love, all his Attributes and Counsels
are Love, in several formes, acting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
several occasions. When his Love
communicates it self in Joys to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Creatures, it is <hi>Goodness;</hi> when it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the most perfect End by the most
perfect means, it is <hi>Wisdome</hi>; when
it rescues guilty Creatures from Hell, it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52038:59"/>
is <hi>Mercy</hi>; when it punishes the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
it is <hi>Justice</hi>; when it inspires Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into any obstinate Person, it is
<hi>Grace</hi>; when it delights in the Beauty
of all its Works, it is <hi>Blessedness</hi>; when
it appears in the perfection of its works,
it is glory. For Glory is the perfection
of Beauty, that ariseth from, and is seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the lustre of excellent Actions, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the internal Properties of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Agent, which is by those his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
and Actions made Delightful to
all <hi>Judicious</hi> Spectators.</p>
               <p>NOR is it onely in GOD, but in us
also that the fruits and Benefits of <hi>Love</hi>
are ineffable. For by loving, as it ought
to do, the Soul acquires its own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and is united to all its Objects.
By loving as it ought to do, it is made
Holy, and Wise, and Good, and Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Onely by Loving does it embraces
the Delights of which it is capable.
Love is the root and Soul of those Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for which a Creature is desired, and
praised by others.</p>
               <p>IT is an infinite Advantage, that we
are able to live in GODS Image,
if we please: For if GOD alone be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Glorious and Blessed, there is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52038:60"/>
no way for us to become Glorious
and Blessed, but by being made, either by
our selves, or some other, like unto him.</p>
               <p>BY nature he hath implanted the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of his power: which we are
to improve by Grace, turning it into
Act after his Similitude. To be able
to Love is neither Grace nor vertue,
but a meer Gift of GOD, a natural
Endowment, which may be Blasted, or
compleated. Actually to love is the
Work of vertue; for by that Act we
enjoy our Felicity.</p>
               <p>HAD GOD limited and confined
our understanding, our power of Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had been shut up in Bounds. Had
he made it infinite, but not prepared
objects for the same, our Love had been
deluded, and had lost its force. Had
he made some Objects, but not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as it was capable of Loving, it had
been Superfluous and dissatisfied; Had
he prepared Objects innumerable and
Endless, but made them evil, our Love
had been irrational, had he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to Love them; Had he made
more Objects then we were able to love,
we had been discontented: But having
made all Objects infinitely Amiable and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52038:60"/>
Glorious, and filled his Immensity and
Eternity with himselfe, and with the
Lustre of his Actions, Love is an infinite
Vertue, because nothing is wanting, but
an Act of Love to enjoy them.</p>
               <p>IF they are all Amiable in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
they are all according to our
Hearts desire, in their Natures, Places,
Durations, Ends, Occasions, Causes,
Uses, Service, Relations, Properties,
Operations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All things, as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
proceed from him, are in all
respects most perfectly pleasing. And
if we have an Eye to see and discern
this, and a Soul able to resent the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit;
if our nature be so vast and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as to see and take pleasure in all
their Circumstances; it is the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and <hi>bruitish</hi> thing in the world
to withdraw our Affection from them,
nay it is worse then <hi>Diabolical.</hi> For we
Kill our selves, we blast our Felicity,
we offend GOD, we slight the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all his Creatures, we break his
Laws, we act against nature, we dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Light and Splendor of our Souls,
we deface his Image, we grieve his
Love, we do the most vicious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
thing that is imaginable. But
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52038:61"/>
if we excite and a waken our Power,
we take in the Glory of all objects,
we live unto them, we are sensible of
them, we delight in them, we transform
our souls into Acts of Love and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
we proceed out of our selves
into all Immensities and Eternities, we
render all Things their Due, we reap
the Benefit of all, we are Just, and
Wise, and Holy, we are Grateful to
GOD, and Amiable in being so: We
are not divided from, but united to
him, in all his Appearances, Thoughts,
Counsels, Operations; we adorn our
souls with the Beauty of all objects
whatsoever, are transformed into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of GOD, live in communion with
him, nay live in him, and he in us, are
made Kings and Priests unto GOD, and
his sons forever; There is an exact and
pleasant Harmony between us and all
the Creatures: We are in a Divine and
spiritual Manner made as it were Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
with all Objects (for the Soul is
present only by an Act of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
and the Temple of all Eternity
does it then becom, when the Kingdom of
GOD is seated within it, as the world is in
the Eye; while it lives, and feels, and sees,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52038:61"/>
and enjoyes, in every object to which it is
extended, its own &amp; its objects Perfection.</p>
               <p>IF by our voluntary Remisness, or
Mistake, or Disorder, we dote upon
one Object, or suffer some few things
to engage our Souls so intirely, as to
forget and neglect all the rest, we
rob all those we desert, of their due
Esteem, and abridge our selves of that
Liberty and Extent, wherein the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our soul consisteth. As if the
Sun, that is made to shine upon all the
World, should withdraw its Beams from
the Stars and the Heavens, and chuse
to shine upon nothing else but a Spire
of Grasse, a grain of Dust, or a little
sand. We lose innumerable Objects, and
confine our selves to the Love of one,
by sacrificing all our Affection to that,
become guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in one respect,
of <hi>Atheism</hi> in another. For we elevate
that Creature which we love alone, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place of GOD, and we rob the
Creator of that supream affection which is
due unto him: And in so doing bereave
our selves of the Sovereign Object, in the
fruition of which all the rest are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
enjoyed. Thus when a man so
Loveth his Wife, or Children, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52038:62"/>
all mankind, he forfeits his Interest
in all Kingdoms, and the Beauty of
all Ages is taken from his Eys, his
Treasures are contracted, and his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
is maimed, and made Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.
When a Covetous man doteth
on his Bags of Gold, the Ambitious
on Titles of Honor, the Drunkard on
his Wine, the Lustful Goat on his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the foolish Hector on his Dice
and Duels, they banish all other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and live as absurdly, as if a King
should relinquish his Crown, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
his Thoughts and Care to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Mannor.</p>
               <p>I will not deny, but that there are
many Disorders and Evils in the World,
many Deformities, Sins, and Miseries:
but I say two things; first that in the
Estate of innocency, wherein all things
proceeded purely from GOD, there
was no Sin, nor sickness, nor Death,
nor Occasion of Complaint or Calamity.
Secondly, that all the Evils that are now
in the world, men brought on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the Fall: And there is great
need of distinguishing between the
works of GOD, and the works of men.
For all that GOD did is Lovely and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52038:62"/>
Divine: nothing is bitter and distasteful,
but what we have done: himself surveyed
the whole Creation, and pronounced
concerning every Thing, that it <hi>was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Good.</hi> So that <hi>he</hi> was in all his
Works an Object of Complacency.
To these we add two Considerations
more; That of all the Evils and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifs
which men have introduced,
there is not one left <hi>uncorrected</hi> in his
Kingdome. Secondly, that GOD bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Order out of Confusion, Light out
of Darkness, Good out of Evil, and by a
Providence irresistable, and a Power infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
so limiteth and divideth all, that even
<hi>Evils</hi> themselves become the Matter of his
Victory, the Ground of his Triumph:
They are all improved; and he makes the
Greatest Evils Objects of Joy and Glory.</p>
               <p>NOW if all Things before GOD
are fit to be enjoyed, all Good Things
perfect, all Evil overcome; if without
any Change of Place or Scituation, all
Things are naked and open before his
Eyes, and there be no Walls to exclude,
or Skreens to hide, no Gulph to pass, nor
Distance to over come, but all things
equally neer and fair; there is some Hope,
that the same Felicity is prepared for
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52038:63"/>
the soul which is made in his Image
and that every thing, being fit for GOD
is full of infinite Depth and Beauty.
For which Cause St. <hi>John</hi> being in Spirit
saw all the Kingdomes of the World,
become the Kingdomes of the Lord and
of his Christ, and heard <hi>every Creature
which is in Heaven, and on the Earth,
and under the Earth, and such as are
in the Sea, and all that is in them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Blessing, and Honor, and Glory, and
Power, be unto him that Sitteth upon the
Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.</hi> This
we are the rather induced to believe,
because <hi>the Faithful Servant</hi> is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>enter into the Joy of his Lord,</hi>
and our <hi>Masters Joys</hi> are the Rewards
of Believers. Our Savionr telleth us
his <hi>Lord will make his Wise Servant
Ruler over all his Goods,</hi> in one-place,
<hi>and over all that he hath</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>TO see beyond all Seas, and through
all interposing Skreens and Darknesses,
is the Gift of the Understanding, and
to be able to Love any Object beyond
the Skies, any Thing that is Good from
the Centre of the Earth to the Highest
Heavens, is the Property of the Soul;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52038:63"/>
which it exerciseth here by Parts, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
but shall at once exert at the Day
of Consummation. The Infinity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Son, &amp; the Godhead of the Son
in the Holy Ghost will entirely be enjoyed.</p>
               <p>IT is the Glory of man, that his <hi>Avarice</hi>
is insatiable, and his <hi>Ambition</hi> infinite, that
his <hi>Appetite</hi> carries him to innumerable
Pleasures, and that his Curiosity is so End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
that were he Monarch of the World,
it could not satisfie his Soul, but he would
be curiously inquisitive into the original
and End of Things, and be concerned
in the Nature of those that are beyond
the Heavens. For having met with an
infinite Benefactor, he would not be
sit for his Bounty, could any finite Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
satisfie his Desire: and for this Cause
is his Reason so inquisitive, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
every thing be Delightful to his
Essence; which, when he findeth agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Wish, and to exceed his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
it is impossible to declare how
his Avarice and Ambition will both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
how much his Appetite will be
satisfied, and his Curiosity delighted.
To sit in the Throne of GOD and to
enjoy Communion with him, in those
Things which neither Eye hath seen, nor
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52038:64"/>
Ear heard, nor hath it entered into the
Heart of Man to conceive, is no mean
thing: the Advancement is infinitely
Greater, then we are able to understand.
No young man can gaze upon a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
face with greater Pleasure, no
Epicures Sence he ravished with more
Delight, than that which he apprehends
in so Glorious a fruition.</p>
               <p>THE very sight of other mens Souls,
shining in the Acts of their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
throughout all Eternity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
themselves in the Beams of Love
through all Immensity, and thereby
transformed (every one of them) into
a Sphear of Light comprehending the
Heavens, every Angel and every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
being a Temple of GODS Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence
and Perfection; this alone will
be a ravishing Spectacle to that Goodness,
which delights to see innumerable Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
of the Same Kingdome: Much
more will the Perfection of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
it self, which by infinite Wisdome
is so constituted, that every one is the
Sovereign Object, the First born, and
Sole heir, and End of the Kingdome;
Every one the Bride of GOD, every
one there a King, yet without Confusion,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52038:64"/>
or Diminution, every one distinctly,
enjoying all, and adding to each others
fruition.</p>
               <p>TO understand all this, and not to
delight in it, is more miserable then
not to understand it. To see it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to enjoy it, is to pine
away in a prison, from whence we see
the Glory of a Palace, and repine in our
misery at the Pleasures of those that are
about it: To delight in these Things,
without being affected with them; is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
Nor is there any Affection
but that of Love, whereby we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them.</p>
               <p>THE Angels see the Glory of GODS
Kingdom and delight in it; the Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
see the Joys of the Blessed, and are
tortured by them; the Wicked upon
Earth neither see, nor are affected with
them; the Saints on Earth apprehend
them in part, and believe them, desire
and endeavour after them; they wait
with Expectation for the whole, and by
certain degrees, as it were in a Glass, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Image and Reflection of them:
As many as they comprehend, they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
delight in: for their love is awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
and extended to the goodness of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52038:65"/>
all they understand, which it feeds
upon by meditation, and turnes into
Nourishment, for the Beneffit of their
Souls, which are made more Great, and
Strong, and Vigorous by their Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But without Love, it is easie to
see, that no Goodness can be at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p>GOD does desire Love from us,
because his <hi>Wisdom</hi> very well knows,
that without Love the World would
be in vain, and the End of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
frustrated: his <hi>Goodness</hi> is diffusive
and infinitly desires to communicate it
self, which it cannot do, unless it be
Beloved. To receive it, is the highest
service we can do unto it, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more agreeable to the Nature of
his <hi>Goodness,</hi> then that it should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.
His <hi>Blessedness</hi> consisteth in the
pleasure he taketh in the Felicity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and brancheth it self out into
two Parts, the Pleasure of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
all to others, and the pleasure of
receiving all from others, in the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which he taketh to see others
Blessed, in the Returns of those joys and
Praises, which are offered up to his
Goodness and Glory. His <hi>Glory</hi> desires
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52038:65"/>
to be seen, and delighted in: To be
esteemed and beloved: to be honored
and admired, is natural to <hi>Glory,</hi> the
Brightness of whose splendor is more
Sensibly Pleasant in the Reflection of
its face, and in the Joy that it makes
in anothers Soul. His <hi>Holiness</hi> takes
Pleasure in pure and upright Actions,
of all which Love is the fountain. There
is an <hi>Objective fitness</hi> and Excellency in
Love, for which it is infinitely valued
by him. It is one of the first and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Properties of Love to desire to
be beloved, to make its object most
Amiable and Beautiful, as well as Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
to be united to it, to have its own
Goodness acknowledged, its Essence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
its excellency desired, admired
and delighted in; to see all its Actions,
Appearances, Gifts and Tokens esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and to feel its own Efficacy, in
the Grateful Acceptance it finds in the
Raptures it occasions, in the flames it
enkindles in anothers Soul. Now Love
is the fountain of all Honour, Gratitude,
Praise and Esteem: By Love the Soul
is transformed into the Similitude of
GOD, by love made Bright and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
all its Blessedness and Glory are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52038:66"/>
founded in its Love, it is by Love it self
made Communicative and Diffusive, and
Great, and Rich, and as the Scripture
speaketh, <hi>fit for Delights.</hi> All Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and service are founded in Love;
And if a Creature, that is Beloved, must
freely give up it self to anothers Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
before it can shew its Love, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
be enjoyed; Love is of all other
things in the World most fit to answer
Love, because the very heart and Soul
is given thereby to the Person that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
it.</p>
               <p>LOVE is the Fountain of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
and Pleasures. House, Estate, and
Lands, Authority, Wealth, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Life it self is consecrated and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
by a Lover to his Object. So
that on our side all is given to GOD
by Love, as well as by Love it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from him. The Heavens and the
Earth and all the Creatures are Gifts
and Tokens of his Love, Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are a Present of his Love, which he
hath infinitely adorned, and made
endlessly serviceable to every Soul that
is Beloved. All these his Love would
have us to receive with a due Esteem
and therefore, is it than of his Love
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52038:66"/>
he will have us to exercise our reason
aright, and Love them as much as their
Goodness deserveth. When we see and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their Excellence, and Esteem
them according to the transcendent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
that appeareth in them, we adorn
our selves with their fair Ideas, we
enlarge and beautifie our Souls with
Bright and clear Apprehensions, and
which is much more, with regular and
well ordered Affections, we enrich our
selves, and increase our Greatness (in
the fruition of his Gifts) we are lively,
and pleasant, and vigorous Creatures, full
of Knowledge, and Wisdome, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and fit to offer up all these things
unto him <hi>again,</hi> while we empty them as
Helps and Advantages in that Service
which we pay unto him: For our Love
to himself is enkindled by these Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and while we sacrifice our selves
and them unto him, we delight in nothing
more then to see him, that is so Great in
Love and Bounty, the Author and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of all his Glories.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Excellency of Truth, as it is the Object
and Cause of Vertue. The Matter and form
of Vertuous Actions. That their form is
infinitely more Excellent then their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Heathen Morality infinitely
defective and short of the Christian.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I do not see that <hi>Aristotle</hi> made the
End of Vertue any other then a finite
and temporal Felicity, which is infinitely
short of that felicity which is here begun,
and enjoyed for ever. He did not make
GOD the Object and End of the Soul,
and if all Acts are distinguished into their
Kinds by their Objects and their Ends,
those Vertues must be infinitely base, that
have no other Objects or Ends, but Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and those only Divine and Noble,
that flow from an infinite and Eternal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
respect an infinite and Eternal
Object, rest in an Infinite and Eternal
End. His Difinition of Felicity import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all this, but his Behavior makes me to
fear he did not understand it: As <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
luckily hit upon that saying, <hi>Deus me
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52038:67"/>
solum dedit toti mundo, totum Mundum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi
soli,</hi> GOD gave me alone to all the
World, and all the World to me alone;
yet could not understand it. For had he
Known what it was he said, he would have
made a better use of it, and been more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and explicite in the Illustration. An
actual Respect had to infinite Obligations
and Rewards, a Desire in every action
to please an infinite and eternal Lover, to
Glorifie a Divine and Endless Benefactor,
to bring forth the fruits of infinite Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and to be truely Grateful for all the
Advantages of a mans Creation, that is
made to have Dominion over all the
World; these are higher and better
Qualifications of those Vertuous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which Christians perform, than
Heathens understood. And yet if nature
were divested of its Corruption, the
Natural Man, that is, no Christian, might,
by the Light of Nature, be fitted to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them. And the Truth is, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
much, (the World being so Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and Glorious in every Eye, so really
deep and valuable in Worth, so peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied to the use and service of every
person;) that the Heathens did miss the
fruition of it, and fail to measure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52038:68"/>
and their Felicity, by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of its Beauty, and the Joy which
all the Creatures ought to produce in
the mind of Man by their real Services.
For the Earth is really better than if all its
Globe were of beaten Gold, the Seas
are better than if all their Abysses were
full of Diamonds, the Air is better, than if
all the space between us and the Skys were
full of Scepters, and the Sun alone a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Treasure then all the wealthy Mines in
the Indies: every man is surrounded with
all the Light of their Advantages, and so
much served by them, as if no man but
himself were alive in the World. So
that it is a natural and easie Investigation,
even for Heathens themselves, to discern
the mystery of Bliss, and to discover the
misery of Humane Nature to be founded
in some Disease of the Will, or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
And to return from Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and Sloth, to Truth and Righ Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which was the ready Way to true
Felicity. For they Knew not the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
or Hidden mystery of Divine Laws,
nor the Excellency and Perfection of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls, which make every one a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
and Transcendent Creature; yet
they might easily observe the miserable
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52038:68"/>
Effects of Eternal Solitude, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Services, how useful and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men were ordained by Nature to be
to one another.</p>
               <p>EVERY man Loves to have many Eys
fixt on his Beauty, and to have many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Objects and Transactions for his
own. Be the Theatre never so Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
the Actions and the Actors, are more
Delightful to the Spectators than the
Gildings, and Dead Engravings. Were
all other men removed out of the World
to make room for one, the empty Theatre
would remain, but the Spectacle be lost,
all the Cities, and Kingdoms, and Ages
would be removed, with all that was
lively, and rare, and Miraculous in all
their Occurrences. Palaces, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
had been prevented, Houses and
Villages, Fields and Vineyards! The
World had been a Wilderness overgrown
with Thorns, and Wild Beasts, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents:
Which now by the Labor of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hands, is reduced to the Beauty and
Order of <hi>Eden.</hi> It is by Trades and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations
that a man gets him Corn, and
Wine, and Oyl, &amp;c. all which he would
have been without had he never seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Company but himself; condemned
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52038:69"/>
to Idleness and melancholly. Vertues
and Praises had been things unknown,
Admiration and Honor, Love and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the mysteries of Religion and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all the speculations of Wisdom, for
want of Education had been lost, at least
the Sence and Exercise of these Bright and
Glorious Things, for wont of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation:
Corrupted Nature being prone
to afford no other fruits but Barbarism
and Ignorance in that Solitary Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the Powers of the Soul are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by Tradition: and it is by the
Information of others that our minds are
awakened to perceive the Dignity of our
own Nature, the Value of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and our Interest unto them.</p>
               <p>But Religion teaches us far more, the
Beginning and the End of the World,
how highly we are honored, and beloved
of GOD, the Manner wherein we are
to converse with him, the transcendent
Excellency of Souls, and the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Deity, What his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence
and Eternity is, how we are to
be enlarged in our Apprehensions and
Desires, and prepared for infinite and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
fruitions; in what Quality, and
Capacity, we are to live in the world,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52038:69"/>
and Exercise Vertue, how we are to spend
our Time, and employ our Powers on all
Objects, every one as Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the friend of GOD! How all
Angels and Men are commanded to Love
us as themselves, and by that Love to
serve and delight us more, than by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Actions and Offices whatsoever:
That every Soul is a more excellent Being
than the visible World, more nearly ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God, and more precious in it self
than any Treasure whatsoever: That it
is endued with Powers, Inclinations and
Principles so fitly subservient and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
to Blessedness, that any one of these
is more Delightful then all inanimate
Things; in the Contemplation and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of which we may justly be lost
in Wonder and Extasie. All this by the
Light of Nature is asserted, but covered
with so Gross a vail, that we discern it
not, till it is newly revealed by the
Ministery of Men. And upon all these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
are Men themselves, (which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
mistaken to be Impediments)
Means &amp; Assistances of our Happy living.</p>
               <p>BUT however familiar, and near, and
easie these Great and evident Truths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
it so happened, that the Heathen
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52038:70"/>
Philosophers were Blind unto them, and
in the midst of their Searches after Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; failed of the Discovery; they
became vain in their Imaginations, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
felicity in a meer Apathy, or conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a self-sufficiency, or in a
brave Contempt of all misfortunes, in a
forced Contentment Dark and empty, or
in Sensual Pleasures, or in the Goods of
fortune, either alone, or conjoyned with
those of the Soul and Body, which they
lamely enumerated, and knew not how
to imploy; as if the Discovery of the
highest and best Truths in nature, had
been reserved for him that redeemed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Plainest Truths had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to honor and attend that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which brought supernatural My steries
to Light, by the Preaching of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>BY this last the Qualifications of an
humble and pious Soul, a Penitent and
Grateful Person, sensible (at once) of
his infinite Guilt and Grandure, were
introduced: Another foundation laid
upon the Meritorious Death and Passion
of GOD, the Son of GOD, a Second
Love continued in the Deity to the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
after an infinite forfeiture; all the
Oracles, and Visions, and Miracles, by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52038:70"/>
which the Nature of Man is magnified,
and Ages enlightned, the Ministry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and the Dispensations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
by which the Care and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of GOD is shewn, the infinite mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Violences of his Love, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Variety and Number of Obligati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons,
the present Advantages and Benefits,
the Eternal Rewards, the Relation of
GOD to Man as a Father and a
friend, a Bridegroom and a King, a
Light and Example, the sweetuess of
our Union and Communion with him,
and the Gift of the Holy Ghost sent
down from Heaven; all these Things,
which the Angels desire to look into,
were by the Christian Religion (with the
rest before mentioned) plainly revealed,
with our victory over Death, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of our Bodies, and Life Eternal.</p>
               <p>IN the Light of these Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Interior form of Vertuous Acts
more evidently appears. For to exercise
Vertue in the Quality and Capacity of
a Son of GOD, is another sort of
Business, than to exercise Vertue as an
ordinary Mechanick: and to do all
things being clothed with a Sence of
our Coelestial Grandeur, as we are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52038:71"/>
Heirs of the World, infinitely Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of GOD, ordained for his Throne,
Delightful in the Eyes of all, Angels and
Men, Beloved and honored by all
the Creatures, made Partakers of the
Divine Nature, intending and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Please all Spectators in Heaven
and Earth (by the excellency of our
Actions;) This makes every little Deed
as it were infinite within; while the
<hi>Matter</hi> of the Action seemeth nothing;
it renders the <hi>Form</hi> Divine and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>THE best Actions of the prophaner
Heathen fell under the notion of <hi>Dead
Works:</hi> By which name the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all wicked Deeds, to intimate the
Privation of all that excellency that
ought to be in Humane Actions. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Deed and Thought, of ours ought
to be <hi>Inspired</hi> with Life from Heaven.
The Light of the Understanding, and
the vigor of the Will is the <hi>Soul</hi> that
informes it. When it is void of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and springs not from that series of
GODS infinite Love, that ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate
it, nor regardeth those Eternal
Joys that are set before us, nor at all
considers those Obligations that are laid
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52038:71"/>
upon us, it is bereaved of its <hi>Vital</hi> and <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi>
form, it is like a fair Carcase with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Soul, <hi>unsensible</hi> of those Interests
and Concerns, that ought chiefly to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
and promoted. And by this you may
see clearly, that the Matter of a Good
act falles infinitely short of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
wherewith it ought to be inspired,
if this <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> be wanting; which
tho less visible to the Eye of flesh, is of
as much greater Excellence and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
as the Soul in nature is above
Body.</p>
               <p>THUS when a Heathen giveth to the
Poor, the matter of the Act is the very self
same which a Christian man does: So is an
Act of Courage, or Patience, in encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
Death; the subduing of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
and the Denial of a Lust, a piece
of Justice against Interest and friendship,
an Act of Prudence, Temperance, or Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
In all these, if we respect the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them, Heathens have acted (in a
manner) as high as any Christian, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
appear to vulgar Apprenhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as Heroick and Stupendious. But
consider the <hi>inside,</hi> the Heathen did it
that he might satisfie his Conscience and
and please the GODS, that he might
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52038:72"/>
acquire honor and immortal fame, or
please the generous Inclination of his
own Soul, which delighted in Honor and
Worth, or assert his own Principles, or
five his friends, or preserve his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And doubtless these are Great and
brave considerations, but they are <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi>
and <hi>finite:</hi> and Sick of two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
(for the most part) that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.
They were Sacrifices of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to false Gods, plain Idolatry,
and attended with an ignorant Loftiness
and Height of Mind, that confided in
them: and besides this, they aspired to
little more then a Glorious name in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Ages.</p>
               <p>WHEREAS the Christian makes
all Kind of Graces to meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centre
in every Action, Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Justice, Courage, Temperance,
Prudence, Humility, Penitence, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Meekness, Liberality, Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Gratitude, Joy in the Holy Ghost,
Devotion, Piety, Faith, Hope, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
all Kind of Holiness, And his
Action extends to all the Objects of these
Graces, and includes their Causes. He
remembers the infinite Obligations that
are laid upon him by that Deity, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52038:72"/>
infinitely Loves him; the Benefit of the
Creation, and the Glory of the Divine
Image, the Guilt of fall, and that blot
and misery that lyes upon him, the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Redemption, and the Love of
Christ, his Death and Passion, the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Pains and Endeavors of GOD in
all Ages, to reclaim him, the Giving of
the Holy Ghost, and his holy Baptism, the
New Covenant which he is in with GOD,
the Height and Glory of his Place and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Beauty of the World, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over all the Living Creatures, the
Joy and Amity of all the Angels, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and Welfare of all his Neighbours
the Joy and Prosperity of future Ages;
the Glory of GOD, the Honour of his
Church, and the Propagation of Religion,
the Salvation of others Souls, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
State and condition of his own,
the Acquisition of a Coelestial and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Kingdom, and the Delight he taketh
in an infinite Sphere of Eternal Joys, the
fervent Desire he has to be Grateful to the
Almighty; all these by the Light of his
Divine and Coelestial Knowledge enter
into the Act, for want of which the other
work, that is wrought by an Ignorant
Heathen, is in a Manner rightly called
<hi>a Work, of Darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:52038:73"/>
I do not speak this, as if I would
discourage a Heathen from doing the
Best that he is able; or condemn those
reasons upon which he proceedeth in his
Vertuous Deeds; No, nor as if all this
were necessary to the Acceptance of an
Action. But to shew how highly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
does ennoble the Soul of Man,
how far more sublime its Principles are,
and how far more perfect it makes his
Actions: When they are what they may
be: And withal to provoke Christians
to a more Intelligent and lofty Practice
of Christian Vertues, lest they differ
not in their Morals from the better sort
of Heathens. All these things are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the perfection of an Action, tho
not to its Acceptance; And GODS Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence,
and Power, and Wisdom, and
Love ought to be considered in all places,
among all Persons, upon all occasions;
And the Blood of Christ, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Glory of Eternal Bliss. But that
which above all I chiefly intend, is to
shew what influence the great Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Felicity hath upon all our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
not only to stir us up to do them,
but by entering their Constitution, to
inspire them with their Beauty and form
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52038:73"/>
for their fuller Lustre, Glory and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
That we may see also, how
Great and Transcendent that Life must
be, wherein every Act is capable of so
much Majesty and Magnificence, if I
may so speak, by reason of the variety
of its Ends and Causes. And how abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minable
and absurd they are all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
GOD out of their Thoughts and
Considerations; Who is alone the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all the Beauty in every Vertuous
Deed, and the proper fulness, Cause and
End of all its Perfection!</p>
               <p>HOW Ambitious we ought to be of
Knowledge, which is the Light wherein
we are to adorn and compleat our selves,
we may learn and collect from all that is
said. It is rightly called <hi>the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
it admits us into the spacious Reces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of every Vertue, openeth the Gate by
which we enter into the Paths of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that lead to the Temple and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of Bliss. Where all the Treasuries
of Wisdome are exposed to the Eye of the
Soul, tho hidden from the World. How
Great and Amiable every Vertue is, how
Great and Perfect it may be made, is only
discerned by <hi>the Eye of Knowledge;</hi> It is
by this alone that men come to discern
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52038:74"/>
how full of Reason Religion is, and with
what Joy and Security and Sweetness it
may be practised.</p>

                  <p>Wisdom is seated in the Will, it attaineth
best of all possible Ends by the best of all
possible Means.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>KNOWLEDGE, how excellent
soever it may be conceived, is
without Wisdome like skill without Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
which whether, it be in Musick, or
Painting, or in any other Art, as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Navigation, Preaching, Judicature,
is altogether vain and fruitless, if it be not
reduced into Act and Exercise. For
Wisdome is that Excellent Habit of Soul
by which we chuse the most Excellent
End of all those which may be Known,
and actually prosecute it, by the best
Means that are conducive thereunto.</p>
               <p>TO Know the best of all possible
Ends and not to embrace it, is the greatest
folly in the World. To chuse and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, without Endeavouring after it,
is a folly contending with the other for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52038:74"/>
Eminence. To chuse any means less
then the best in Order thereunto, is a
new piece of solly, even then when we
pursue what Wisdom requires. For no
less than the best of all possible Means
is requisite to the Acquisition of the best
of all possible Ends. And by all this we
discern, that Wisdome is not a meer Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of Excellent Things, but a
Practical Habit, by Vertue of which we
actually atchieve and compleat our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
For it is impossible for the best
of Means (when they are well used) to
fail; we may grow remiss, and suspend
our Endeavor, which is another Kind
of folly, and so be diverted from the
best of all possible Means by some strong
Temptation, or cease from using them
through our own Inconstancy, or yield
to some Light and easie Allurement, or
be discouraged by some terrible Danger,
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd thus may abandon the Best of all
Ends, but without some such folly it can
ever be lost.</p>
               <p>POSSIBILITIES are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le,
so that nothing less than infinite
Wisdome can find out that which is
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bsolutely the Best. But when the best <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f
all possible Ends is by infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52038:75"/>
sound out, it is an Easie thing for
Wisdome to discover that End to the
Knowledge of others, to whom it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to communicate it self by way of
Gift and Participation.</p>
               <p>WHAT the best of all possible Ends
is, only GOD fully comprehendeth.
But in General it is such, that it includeth
all Kind of Goods in the highest Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
infinite varieties and Degrees of
Possibility <hi>turned into Act,</hi> all Sweetness
and Beauty Empire, Dominion, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
all Riches, Pleasures, and Honors
Victories, and Triumphs, and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
will be in it, and nothing possible
or Desirable be wanting to it. GOD
alone is the Best of all possible Ends,
who includeth all things in himself as
then Cause, and End: the Perfection of his
Will is his Blessedness and Glory, and his
Essence the only Means by which he can
attain unto it. By himself it is that we
come unto him in a manner afterward
more fully to be explained. His Essenc<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is the Best of all possible Means; by
which he attains himself, and by which
he is enjoyed. Our Conformity to h<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
Essence is our Way, by a Wise Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our Souls to that Eternal A<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
which is his End.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:52038:75"/>
THAT Sweetness and Beauty are
Attributes of the best of all possible
Ends, is evident and clear: As it is also
that these must be infinite in their Degree
and Measure, because nothing but what
is infinitely convenient, is absolutely E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.
Now what is infinitely conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
is infinitely Sweet and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
What is infinitely Desirable is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Good, because it is Agreeable
to that Love wherewith every Existence
intends it self, and pursues its own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Happiness.</p>
               <p>IT is easie to conceive how GOD
should be the End of his Creatures, but
how he should really be his own End
is difficult to understand: Because his
Creatures are Defective, and have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
besides themselves to aspire after:
but GOD from all Eternity is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect, and being all that he can be,
needeth nothing that he can endeavor
to attain. But if we consider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Wisdome, which is a voluntary
Act, we may be freed from the Despair
of understanding the Mystery. For
Wisdome must of necessity intend it self
in its Operations, because it becometh
Wisdome by doing the Best of all Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52038:76"/>
Things; and doth them all that it may
be Wisdome, or Wise in doing them.
It implies Deliberation and Freedome;
being a Vertue seated in the Will and
Understanding, It implies a Power of
Knowing, and Chusing, and Doing all
Things, it consisteth not in the Power
of Knowing only, nor in Power of Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
nor in the Power of Doing. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else is Wisdome, but to chuse and
do what we Know is absolutely
most Excellent. Wisdome then is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Act of Doing, nay it is the Act
of Doing all that is Excellent. And if
it be a free and voluntary Act, as it
must needs be, because nothing is Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but that which guideth it self by
Counsel freely, to a Known End, which it
discerneth to be most Excellent, it implies
an Ability to forbear, in him that is wise,
by chusing to do what he might forbear.
Had it forborn to do what is most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
it had turned into folly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it had by that means lost the most
Excellent End: but by chusing to do
all that was best, it became an act of
Wisdome; which being most Lovely,
it chiefly desired to be. And so by
Chusing and Doing the most Excellent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52038:76"/>
of Things, begot it self; and by it
self proceeded to all its Operations,
which must needs be infinite, if Wisdome
be so, because any thing less would
(if rested in) be infinitely Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
               <p>THAT Riches and Pleasures may
be infinite, is evident from the Nature
and extent of space, which is illimited
and Endless, from the Omnipresence
and Eternity of GOD, in which there
is infinite Room for innumerable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
especially from his Wisdom and
Goodness which are <hi>Infinite Treasures.</hi>
It appears also from his Almighty Power,
which is able in all Parts of his Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Eternity, to work without any
Bound or Period, without cessation at
once to work in all Places of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and throughout all his Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to act, and do what he will. So
that in one Instant he can fill both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
and Time with enjoyments,
Every Part and Particle of which
shall be infinitely Delightful, because
of the vigor of his Eternal Power in
very Operation. Thus is he intirely
Acting in Heaven, and Earth, and Hell,
at the same time, and at all conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52038:77"/>
Distances beyond all Heavens ever
Acting, because he is Willing Decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seeing and ruling there, and every
where accomplishing his Counsel and
Pleasure. His Essence and his Will are
both the same, his Essence is his Act,
and his Act his Pleasure.</p>
               <p>BY exerting his Almighty Power he
begot that Act, which is the Means and
End of all his Endeavors. An Act of
Wisdome infinite and Eternal is his
Blessedness and Glory. We must
take heed of conceiving GOD to be
one Thing, and his Act another, for all
his Wisdom and Goodness, all his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
and Life, and Glory are in the
Act, by which he became the Fountain
and the End of all Things. He became
so freely, and yet was so by his Essence
from everlasting, for Eternity is an
infinite Length of Duration, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
present in all its parts in a Stable
manner. To fill one part of space
with Treasures, and leave another Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
was not Wise. Common Reason
will instruct us, that it is better to have
all spaces full of Delights, than some
sew or none. And by his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
it is that he Knows how to enjoy,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52038:77"/>
what he never needed, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his Enjoyments by giving them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>INFINITE and Eternal Wisdom
does not onely imply the Possibility,
but the certain Reality and Existence
of Eternal Treasures. Where least
you should wonder how such should
be infinite, you must needs be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that God is his own best and most
perfect Treasure. For if Treasures are
by nature those precious Things, which
are Means whereby we acquire our Ends,
or those Things which we most Esteem,
as the Sovereign Objects of our Joy;
GOD is in both those respects his own
<hi>Wealth,</hi> because his Essence is the <hi>Means</hi>
by which he atchieveth all his ends, and
the Sovereign End of all those Means
which he by his Wisdom useth for his
Ends. <hi>For of him, and by him and to
him are all things</hi>: As the Scripture
witnesseth. Matter is the Dreg of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Dead without Power; Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is the Abyss of Nature, but void
without act: Act is the Top and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Nature, it is the fulness of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the fountain and the means of all
that is; for Power by transforming it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52038:78"/>
self into Act, becometh, an act, and
by that Act produceth and perfecteth
all its Works both outward and in
ward; so is it the Means of all its
Productions: being so infinitely Simple
and various together, that nothing but
Power exerting it self is in the Nature
of the Act by which it is exerted. All
the Essence of that Act is the compleat
Exertion of Eternal Power, and yet to
it alone we ascribe the Original and
Means of all: it is the Cause, and Means
and End of it self, as well as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Things, which for its own sake, are
Produced by it. For idle Power can
do nothing: Meer Power is neither the
Cause, nor the Means, nor the End of
any thing. Power not Idle, but exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and throughly employed, is all Act:
And this is the Cause of all its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
because of this Power exerting
it self they spring: and the Means of all,
because by this Power exerting it self, they
are; and the End of all, because it did
all, that it might be not <hi>Idle,</hi> but Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Exerting</hi> it self, or a Glorious Act in
its full Perfection.</p>
               <p>IT was an effect of infinite Wisdom,
wherein GOD by one Act acquired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52038:78"/>
and all his Dominion, prepared
his own, and his Creatures blessedness,
made himself and all his Kingdome Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
But this is scarcely intelligible,
because the manner of his Life is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible:
we cannot tell how to
conceive, what the Learned constantly
affirm, that all Eternity is at one
Time. All I shall observe in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the explaining of this Mystery,
is onely this, that tho the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
and Ends with Time, yet Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
does immutably include Time, and
the Operations of Divine Wisdome are
various, and exactly fitted to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Seasons, yet all the parts of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
are filled with Operations, which,
tho they are one in GOD, like that of shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the Sun, are manifold in Effects,
as the Beams of the Sun in their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Works among all the Creatures.</p>
               <p>IT is a natural Effect of infinite
Wisdome to make every of its Treasures
suitable to its own excellence. And that
the Wisdome of GOD has done, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every the smallest Thing in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
infinitely serviceable in its Place,
and station, for the manifesting of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
Goodness, and Glory to the Eye of a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52038:79"/>
clear Beholder And this he hath done by
making all his Kingdome oneIntire Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and every Thing in it a Part of that
Whole, Relating to all the innumerable
Parts, receiving a Beauty from all, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
a Beauty to all, even to all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
throughout all Eternity. While e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one among Millions of Spectators,
is endued with an Endless Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to see all, and enjoy all in its
Relations, Beauties, and Services.</p>
               <p>I cannot stand to enlarge on this, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
I might illustrate it by a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Example. No single Part of a state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Monument is so Beatutiful out of its
Place, as it is in its Place: because if it
be seen alone, it is not understood;
for the Beauty that results from all,
consists in Order and Symmetry, which
by any Division is broken to pieces.
He Knoweth nothing as he ought to
Know, who thinks he Knoweth any
thing, without seeing its Place, and the
Manner how it relateth to GOD, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, and to all the Creatures in
Earth, Heaven, and Hell, Time, and
Eternity.</p>
               <p>IT is an Act of Wisdome to prize
and enjoy, what is by Wisdome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52038:79"/>
and Because infinite Wisdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
all Wisdome, infinite Wisdome
at once Knoweth, Chuseth, Doth, Esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and Enjoyeth, all that is Excellent.
It is an Act of Wisdome to make ones
self Good and Delightful to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Honor, and Peace, and Amity,
are founded therein. It is infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to become infinitely Good and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to others, and for that cause to
be infinite in Bounty. For what is
infinitely Good is infinitely <hi>Glorious.</hi>
And therefore is it, that GOD needing
Nothing in himself, gives all Things to
others, Gives them in enjoying them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
in Giving them, while his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
delights in the Felicity of others,
and in being the Felicity of others. For
by making them Great and Blessed he
magnifieth himself; and by replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them increaseth his Treasures.</p>
               <p>HOW little soever of this you are
able to conceive, you may understand,
that to be like GOD is the way to be
Happy: And that if GOD hath put it
in your Power to be like him, it is the
extremest Madness in the VVorld to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
your Power, and to neglect his
Treasures, but it is infinite VVisdome by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52038:80"/>
the best of all possible Means to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and enjoy them, Because an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
End is thereby attained, even
GOD himself, who is thereby made
the portion of the Soul, and its Reward
forever.</p>
               <p>THE best of all possible Means
whereby we can acquire his Eternal
Treasures, is to imitate GOD in our
Thoughts and Actions; to exert our
Powers after his Similitude, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Image, which is after GOD in
<hi>Knowledg, Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>true Holiness.</hi>
For by Knowing all Things, as GOD
Knoweth them, we transform our Souls
into an Act of Knowledge, most Bright
and Glorious: By Loving all Things as
GOD Loveth them, we transform our
VVills into an Act of Love, which is most
Sweet and Blessed. VVe enrich and
Beautifie our selves with the Image of his
Goodness, while we communicate our
Souls (in our Powers) to all Objects
in his whole Eternity. VVe magnifie
our selves by magnifying Him in all his
Works: We do right to our selves by do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
right to GOD, and all other Things.
VVhich for as much as we must here
on Earth learn by Degrees, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52038:80"/>
perfectly accomplish the VVork, till
it is given us in Heaven, it is VVisdome
to walk in the Paths of Righteousness
as far as we are able, and to do those
Things here, tho small and defective,
which he will recompence with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
so perfect hereafter.</p>
               <p>IF ever we be so happy as to come to
Heaven, his VVisdome shall be our VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
his Greatness our Greatness, his
Blessedness our Blessedness, his Glory
our Glory, All his Joys and Treasures
shall be ours, his Life and Love ours,
and Himself ours for evermore.</p>
               <p>HIS VVisdome is made ours because
it is the Light in which we shall see
Light, and learn thereby to inherit all
Things: the Exemplar and Original of our
VVisdome, the Fountain and Patern of
all our Joys, the Author and Inventor
of all our Delights, the End and Sum
of all our Desires, the Means of all
our Felicity, our very Blessedness and
Glory.</p>

               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:52038:81"/>
               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Of Righteousness. How Wisdome, Justice,
and Right Reason are shut up in its
Nature. What GOD doth, and what
we acquire, by the Exercise of this
Vertue.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>RIGHTEOUSNESS and VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
are neer allyed. For to be Just
towards all Objects is to render them
their spiritual Due, their <hi>Due Esteem.</hi>
It is VVisdome, because thereby we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our End, and enjoy their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.
It is Right Reason, because to
value all Things just as they are, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
to them neither more nor less
then they deserve, is to do Right to
our selves and them, it is a Vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by force thereof we attain our
Happiness.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding of this
Vertue we must Know that there is a
Righteousness of Apprehension, a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Esteem, a Righteousness of
Choise, and a Righteousness of Action.
Righteousness of Thought is that Habit
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52038:81"/>
by Vertue of which we think aright;
forming and framing within our selves
aright Apprehensions of all Objects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
This, tho it be the First and
smallest Part of Righteousness, is of
Great importance; because no man can
use that aright, the Nature of which he
does not apprehend. He that mistakes
his Hand for his Meat, will rise hungry
from Table. He that mistakes a Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
for an Axe, will neither cut Wood
well, nor make good Musick. The
Misapprehension of Great and Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Objects, whether visible or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
is not perhaps so Gross, but more
pernicious and Destructive. He that
apprehends GOD to be a Tyrant, can
neither honour GOD, nor Love him,
nor enjoy him. He that takes Vertues
to be vices, and apprehends all the
Actions of Religion unpleasant will loath
and avoid them. He, that conceits Nothing
in the World to be his own but his low Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and course diet, will think it needless
to praise his Maker, and will deny himself
to be happy in those narrow and Mean
enjoyments. He that thinks all the wealth
is shut up in a Trunk of Gold, will lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
regard the Magnificence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52038:82"/>
the Light of the Sun, or the
Beauty of the Universe.</p>
               <p>RIGHTEOUSNESS in esteem is
that Habit, by Vertue of which we value
all things according as their Worth and
Merit requires. It presupposes a right
Apprehension of their Goodness, a clear
Knowledge of all their excellencies. It
is a Virtue by which we give to every
thing that place in our Soul which they
hold in Nature. It is wonderful both
for its extent, and Value. For there
is Room enough for all Objects in the
esteem of the Soul, and it is by esteem
that they are honored, perfected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p>A wise man will actually Extend his
Thoughts to all Objects in Heaven and
Earth, for fear of losing the Pleasure
they afford him, which must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spring from his esteem of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
               <p>HONOUR and Esteem are neer a
kin. How the Creatures are honoured
by esteem, needeth not to be unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
but how they are perfected by it,
is a little Misterious. A thing is then
perfected when it attains its End. Now
the End for which all things were made
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52038:82"/>
is that they may be seen and enjoyed.
They are seen that they may be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by an intelligent and right
esteem are all enjoyed. In our esteem
therefore they find and attain their end,
and by attaining that are consequently
perfected. The Application of <hi>Actives</hi>
to <hi>Passives</hi> is a mystery in Nature of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great and General Importance; In
all Pleasures, Cures, and Productions.
All satisfactions, Joys, and Praises are
the happy off-spring of Powers and
Objects well united. Both the one
and the other would lie void and barren
if they never met together: and when
they meet their Union must be regular,
wise and holy.</p>
               <p>GOD is an Object of Mans Esteem:
Which unless it were able to render him
his Due and Quadrat with his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
a man could never be <hi>Righteous</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
GOD. For that Esteem is void of
Righteousness, that either exceeds, or falles
short of its Object. If it becometh us
<hi>to fulfil all Righteousness,</hi> it becometh
GOD, to endue us with the Power
of Esteeming all, that is Good and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
according to the Worth and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
thereof. For which cause he enables
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52038:83"/>
us to Esteem all that we can see in
Heaven and Earth, and in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Heavens. For this Esteem is the
Foundation of that choise which is the
Original Spring of all excellent Actions.
Even GOD himself meeteth his Honour
in the esteem of our Souls. He is injured
by the Sacrilegious Impiety that robs him
of his Esteem; being infinitely Quick
and Tender in apprehending, he is more
jealous of his Honour, and more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when he loseth it then any other.
His Wisdom and his Love are infinitly
offended, when they are slighted and
profaned; but pleased extreamly when
they are sanctified and honored: and
that they are by a just Esteem. And for
this cause he hath made us able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him in all his Works, and in all
his ways, and to have Communion with
him in all his Counsels and Perfections
that as our Saviour saith,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>The Father

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52038:83"/>
                  <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants, for
the Servant Knoweth not what his Lord

all Things that I have heard of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I have made Known unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Omnipresence and Eternity of
GOD are so far from filling the Soul,
that they fit it only to be filled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Objects. For by the Indwelling of
GOD all Objects are infused, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
within. The Spiritual Room of the
Mind is Transcendent to Time and
Place, because all Time and Place are
contained therein: There is a Room
in the Knowledge for all Intelligible
Objects: A Room in our Esteem for all
that is worthy of our Care and Desire.
I confess this Room is strange and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious.
It is the Greatest Miracle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in Nature. For it is an infinite
Sphere in a Point, an Immensity in a
Centre, an Eternity in a Moment. We
feel it, tho we cannot understand it.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER we close our Eye
against, we exclude out of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Whatsoever we Hate, we reject,
tho we Know it. We give a Place in
our Heart only to that, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and embrace with a Kind Affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:52038:84"/>ETERNITY it self is an Object of
Esteem, and so it is the infinity of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
GOD: there are infinite Causes for which
they ought to be Esteemed. Our Esteem of
these cannot be abridged, for upon the
least substraction of the smallest Part,
Infinity is lost, and so is Eternity.
We must be able to esteem the utmost
Extent of every Perfection of GOD,
or our <hi>Righteousness</hi> in relation to that
will be infinitely Defective. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
between our Esteem and its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
is that wherein Righteousness is
seated, if our Esteem be finite, it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
destroyed: for where the Object
is infinite, insteed of Proportion, there
is infinite Disproportion.</p>
               <p>FROM Righteousness in Esteem we
proceed to Righteousness in Choice.
We weigh and consider what is fittest
to be valued, and what we find of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Esteem, we most desire. To prefer
the Better above the worse is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Choise; but to prefer the Worse,
is abominable Impiety. The Election of
GOD may be more strictly, or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
conceived. His Election of perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
persons from the Rebellious Mass
of Mankind to be employed, as Ministers,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52038:84"/>
in restoring the residue, is a matter of
Grace; which as Arbitrary and free, is
occasioned by the Accident of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rebellion, and his Mercy thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Howbeit it is Righteous: for he
does Right to himself, and to all his
Creatures, and Perfections therein. For
thereby notwithstanding the universal
Apostasie of the World, he upholdeth
and continueth his Righteous Kingdome.
But the <hi>Primitive Election</hi> (by which,
when he had considered the nature of
all Possible Things, he chose the fittest
and the Best) was wholy Natural. For
according to the Merit of all Objects
he chose them, which Merit nevertheless
was to be infused by himself, in their
first Creation. Whether a star were a
Thing fit to be made, Whether the Sun
should be limited, whether his Image
should be infinite, whether naked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
or Bodies should be created, or
Bodies and Spirits personally united:
Whether Men should at first Instant be
placed in Glory, or in an Estate of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
whether when they fell into Sin
they should be redeemed or no, what
Laws were most fitting under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works, what conditions were
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52038:85"/>
most proper for the Covenant of Grace;
What Helps and Assistances Men should
have, what Impediments and Obstacles;
all these and many Millions of Objects
more passed his Examination, in order to
the Perfection of his Kingdome: as it did
also whether he should <hi>Create</hi> a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or no? and look what surpassed
in Esteem, as best and most Eligible,
that he chose to create, and Perform. To
fail in a Tittle had been an infinite fault,
because had he in any one perticular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the Worse above the better he had
contracted a Blot upon his own Wisdome
and Goodness, and made the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
deformed. For there is such a Love to
Righteousness implanted in our Natures,
that should GOD be unjust to a poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
beyond the Seas, we should be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Blemish, and any Blemish in him
would blast our Felicity. For the Justice
of the Soul is an impartial Thing, and its
Severity Greatest, where its Expectations
is the Highest. It is more easie with GOD
to be infinitely Wise then with Man to
be any thing; He may be Exact and
perfect in every action with Greater
Ease, then any other of his Creatures can,
because he is Almighty, Omniscient, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52038:85"/>
Omnipresent: all the Advantages of his
Wisdom, and Knowledge, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Power, would be Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his fault should he Sin against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The least offence would be an infinite
Blot in him because committed against all
Wisdome, Goodness, and Power, and a
misery to us, because it would tend to the
Ruine of his Creatures: The Accurate
Perfection which he acquires in all his
Ways, (having to do with so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Objects) becomes our infinite
Joy, our Amazement and Wonder, a
Transcendent Cause of Complacency
and Adoration, it fills Eternity with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and Praises. The possibility of
doing otherwise, in him that is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to no Laws awakens our Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But the prevention of our fear,
by the establishment of our Security, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
our contentment, he is an Absolute
and free Agent, and therefore we may
fear a miscarriage in his Choise: but as
from all Eternity he hath determined
himself, and is by his Essence an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Act of Wisdom and Righteousness,
he secures our Felicity and makes it
more Great, because he is not imposed
on by another, but freely of himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52038:86"/>
in the most Excellent things.</p>
               <p>THIS relateth to the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of action, whereby GOD did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
all his Decrees, and <hi>does</hi> Eternally.
For Nothing is past, but all things in
him are immediately neer and present for
ever. If you desire further Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning the Nature of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions, Those Actions are properly
called Righteous, that are adequately fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their ends and Causes. And in this
respect there is in every being under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Circumstances a several Righteousness.</p>
               <p>THE Effect of Righteousness with
men is Peace and Assurance for ever:
because Righteous men are Agreable to
GOD and all his Creatures: rightly
answer all their Natures, and assist in
the Harmony of the whole Creation.
It is Fruition and Blessedness, because
all the perfection and Goodness of GOD
is, with his Kingdome, received into the
Soul, by the Righteous esteem of all
Objects. It is the Beauty and Glory
of the Inward Man, because a voluntary
Agent, that does incline himself to such
excellent Actions, is highly Amiable and
and Delightful to be seen; Not only
because his soul is transformed into an
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52038:86"/>
                  <hi>Intelligible World,</hi> transcendent to all
that is created, by the <hi>Ideas</hi> of GOD,
and his Works erected in the mind,
but his <hi>Affections</hi> are framed in a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and incomparable Order, according
as every Cause and Object requires.
There is something in the Soul of
a Righteous man, that fitly answers all
Obligations and Rewards, It is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into the Image of GOD in
such a sort, that in the <hi>Righteous Act,</hi>
which it becomes, GOD for ever dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and appeareth.</p>
               <p>THE Effect of Righteousness in
GOD is so Great, that whereas all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibles
are stark naught, all things
which it is possible for GOD to do,
are fair and excellent, all the Best are
made actual, by the execution of his
Righteous Decree. By this the Son of
GOD is in the bosom of the Father, and
the Spirit of GOD proceedeth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Eternities to his own perfection.
For the Righteousness of GOD is not
like the Righteousness of Men, that may
be permitted to sleep, and intermit their
Operations, an Accidental Habit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from their Essence, which may
sometimes exist, when it doth not work
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52038:87"/>
but it is Quick and Powerful, and ever
in action and is indeed the Act it self
which is his eternal Essence and his Son
begotten of it self for ever.<note place="margin">Wis. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>For Wisdom
is more moving then any motion, she
passeth and goeth through all things by
reason</hi> of her <hi>Pureness, It is the Breath
of the Power of GOD, and a pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
flowing from the Glory of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
the Brightness of the Everlasting
Light, the unspotted Mirror of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of GOD, and the Image of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Being One it can do all things, and
remaining in it self, maketh all things
new, and in all Ages entering into holy
souls, she maketh them Friends of GOD,
and Prophets.</hi> GODS Righteousness
is the end and effect of it self. His Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is an infinite and Eternal Act of
Righteousness and Wisdome, which
filleth his Kingdom with the Majesty of
its Glory, and by coming into Being in a
voluntary Manner giveth to all Things
their Essence, and Perfection. Because it
cometh into Being in a voluntary manner
it is mysterious and incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>THE Glory of this Act is derived
from himself, and springeth purely from
the Perfection of its pleasure. Of its
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52038:87"/>
Pleasure it is what it is, and as the Son
of GOD is LIGHT of LIGHT, so
he is Wisdome of Wisdome, Righteousness
of Righteousness, Life of Life, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Godness. For it is infinite
VVisdome that found out the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Act, and Eternal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that first atcheived it. The Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
atcheived could not spring from
any but Eternal Righteousness in it self
atcheiving it, which is unbegotten in the
Person of the Father, Begotten in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Son, and Proceeding in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Holy Ghost to all its Creatures
and Operations, in its Actions, existing
and abiding Perfect for ever.</p>
               <p>IN GOD, to <hi>Act</hi> and to <hi>Be,</hi> are the same
Thing. Upon the suspension of his act, his
Essence would be gone; whereas our Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
may without its Act, or Operation,
remain. And if his Act existeth, by Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his Righteousness is, and existeth
of it self, and by it self compleateth its
Essence forever. It is not the Power
of being Righteous, but the Exertion of
that Power, which is the Parent of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Righteousness.</p>
               <p>GOD, having such an infinite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Righteous Act, which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52038:88"/>
                  <hi>himself,</hi> is, designed to make <hi>us</hi> such
Righteous Acts as <hi>himself</hi> is. And
when we perfectly do what we ought, we
shall in Operation and Extent be like
unto him, being <hi>perfect, as our Father
which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> for <hi>we
shall see as we are seen, and Know as we
are Known.</hi> In the mean time GOD
hath taken care to endue us with Power,
to make our perticular Actions compleatly
Righteous. Every little Act we perform is
a fruit &amp; Off-spring of the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
infinite Love is delighted by it, infinite
Glory and Blessedness acquired. A Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of infinite Value is preserved, the
Crown is put upon all GODS VVorks,
and all the Spectators, Angels and Men,
are Eternally pleased. For being done
it is admitted into Eternity, and shall
remain in its Place, and be visible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 5.</note>
                  <hi>For the Lord will Come, who both

to the Joy of the Righteous, because
of the innate Goodness of their Souls,
which moveth them to delight in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Goodness Natural, Moral and Divine;
its Nature described, The Benefits and
Works of Goodness.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>GOODNESS is a vertue of the
first Estate, a Divine Perfection in
GOD by which he is, and enjoys his
Blessedness. In Men it is an Habit or an
Act of the Soul, by force of which they
Love, and delight in all that is Blessed.
Tis that by which all Creatures Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
themselves to others Benefit, all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures affect others, and delight
in doing Good unto them. In GOD it
is that infinite and Eternal Act from
which all other Goodnesses spring, and
on which they depend. The Nature of
Goodness is founded in a <hi>Convenience,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:52038:89"/>
between that which is Good, and that
to which it is profitable. If we consult
its several Kinds, there is a <hi>Natural</hi>
Goodness, a <hi>Moral,</hi> and a <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NATURAL</hi> Goodness is the Aptitude
of Corporeal Beings, to produce such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and healing Effects as the enjoyer
desires. The Nutritive Power in Aliment,
the Medicinal Vertue in Herbs, the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Quality in Perfumes, the Grateful
Lustre in Precious Stones, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.
Heat in fire, the Beautiful
splendor in the Sun, the Refreshing Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
in the Sea, the Reviving Nature of
the Air, the solid Convenience and fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Ground, all these are <hi>Physical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Good. But this is Goodness in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Degree, being no more then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fitness of Dead Agents that are made
to act by a <hi>Fatal</hi> Necessity, without sence
or Desire; tho their Action be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the several Exigencies of other
Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MORAL</hi> Goodness includeth all the
Perfections of the former, and something
more. For <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> enter its
Existence; and it is <hi>Wisely</hi> exercised in
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> A clear Understanding
and a free will are the principles of those
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52038:89"/>
Actions that are <hi>Morally</hi> Good: they must
flow from <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi>; tho the
Person doing them be subject to anothers
Empire, and made to give Account of his
Actions. The Nature of its Excellence
is very deep and retired, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
more in the <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of
its Operation, than the <hi>Thing</hi> that is <hi>Done;</hi>
and is measured more by the <hi>Intention,</hi>
then the <hi>Benefit.</hi> A mad man, or a fool,
may by accident save a mans Life, or
preserve an Empire, yet be far from that
Goodness which is seated in the VVill
and Understanding Which plainly
shews, that the <hi>Goodness</hi> chiefly regarded
is in the <hi>Soul</hi> of him that does any
thing convenient, not in the <hi>Benefit</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
but in the <hi>Mind</hi> of the Benefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.
And the Truth is that the <hi>External
Benefit,</hi> tho it saves the Lives, and Souls,
and Estates, and Liberties, and Riches,
and Pleasures, and Honors, of all mankind,
acts but <hi>Physically</hi> by a Dead or passive
Application, the root of its influence and
value is seated in another place, in the
Soul of him whose Goodness was so Great
as to sacrifice his Honor, and Felicity for
the Preservation and Welfare of those
whom he <hi>intended</hi> to save. It is feated in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52038:90"/>
the <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of the Actor. It
is a hard matter to define it, but it is
something like <hi>a willing Conformity to the
Interests and Affections of his fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
attended with a voluntary Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
in a person Obliged and subject to
Laws, to all those Obligations that are
laid upon him, &amp; to all the Rewards that
are set before him, but especially to the
Desires and Commands of his Superior,
to whom he Naturally owes himself and
desires to be pleasing. To Act upon Great
and Mighty Principles, in a vigorous free
and Genorous Manner, for the sake of
those that obliged him, and for the sake
of those to whom his Kindness is shewn,
increases the <hi>Measure</hi> of Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
but its Perfection is seated in a
Loyal Respect, and Perfect Gratitude
to GOD Almighty. Who, by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Good to us, has infused and
created such a Goodness in the Soul,
that its principal Joy and Delight is to
please him. For tho all Creatures consult
themselves &amp; their own Preservation, yet
the force of Gratitude upon an Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soul is very powerful. Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is an Alacrity and Readiness of the
Will, to sacrifice it self, upon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52038:90"/>
of the Benefits a Man hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to anothers Benefit, Enjoyment, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DIVINE Goodness</hi> is an Active and
Eternal Principle, stirring up it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Obligation or reward, to do the best
and most excellent Things in an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
manner. It is proper only to GOD;
Its Excellency is Supreme, its Beauty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
its Measure endless, its Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable,
its Perfection unconceiveable.
It hath no Cause, but it is the Cause of all
other Things whatsoever. It is a <hi>Living</hi>
and <hi>Eternal Act</hi> of free and undeserved
Love, an indeficient Ocean of Bounty,
which can never be fathomed, or (by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Degrees be) wholy received. It is
<hi>Invisible</hi> in its Essence, but <hi>Apparent</hi> in its
effects, Incomprehensible, but manifest
enough, to be <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>adored.</hi> It is
an infinite and Eternal Essence, which
is Good to it self, by being Good to all,
infinitely Good to it self, by being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Bound or Measure Good to all its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
It is an infinite and Eternal Act,
which continually ponders, and intirely
intends the Welfare of others, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes
its own (in a voluntary manner)
by that intention: An Act whose Essence
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52038:91"/>
is seated in the Preparation of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and the Communication of all its
Glories. Its Felicity is Eternal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
yet seated intirely in the Felicity
of others. It doth infinite Good, to
all its Recipients Meerly for the sake of
the Excellency of the Act of <hi>Doing Good.</hi>
It delighteth in the Excellency of that Act,
and useth all its power in doing Good,
that the Act in which it delighteth might
be infinitely perfect. And the perfect Act
in which it finally resteth is the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which all adore and desire. Its
Sovereign Joy and Pleasure, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to others. All its Creatures are
Delightful to it self, only as they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
and receive its Goodness. Should
we run into its Properties, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
and Endless; but as infinite
in Beauty, as variety and greatness. It
is the utmost Height of all Goodness
as well as the Original, and end of
all. It exceedeth Moral Goodness, as
much as that exceedeth Natural, and
infinitely more. In Physical Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there is a Mechanical fitness, and
Dead convenience: but all it can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, is the Benefit and Pleasure of
Moral Agents. For the Sun, and Moon, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52038:91"/>
Stars, and Trees, and Seas, and Minerals
are made for Men. Whereas Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is made to enjoy all Physical Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that in a higher sphere it might be
pleasing to GOD and is immediately sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to his Divine &amp; Essential Goodness.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>Divine</hi> Goodness is the first
Perfection of the efficient Cause of the
Worlds Creation, which of necessity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
an immediate Excellency into all
the Creatures, because it is the most
Communicative and active Principle that
is. But the Necessity is attended with
a Liberty no less then infinite. For it
freely pleaseth it self in all its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and its Pleasure is to delight it
self in the Acquisition of Felicity for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Its freedom is a necessary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of its operation. For the Glory of
its inclination and Kindness could not be,
much less be seen, did it act by Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Nature, Imposition, Chance or
Accident. When the Act is in Being it
worketh Physically, and it is no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that such an Act should produce
such Effects, and be so Beneficial. For
when it is done it cannot be otherwise,
but that such and such Effects must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
its Existence; They are as Natural
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52038:92"/>
as if they were Essential to it: All the,
Wonder is, what should determine the
Liberty of the Agent at first to do such
Great and Mighty Things for others
sake, and all that can be said, is his own
Goodness and the Excellency of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For it is not with GOD as it is with
Men: few men will be at the expence
of Doing, what all admire: all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Benefit, applaud and delight
in the Action; and so much the more by
how much the more <hi>Hazzardous,</hi> and
great, and Painful it was; but scarcely
one will endure the Difficulty of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Deed for the sake of others. GOD
on the contrary takes infinite Delight in
the Action which all admire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is infinitly great and Heroick, and
perfectly Divine, finds his Liberty and
Ease in that Act, and is so taken with
the Beauty of the Work, that his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Pleasure exceeds all the necessity
and fate in Nature.</p>
               <p>THAT Pleasure, which he taketh in
promoting the Happiness of all Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
created and increated, is his
Goodness. It is the infinite use of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Liberty freely Delighted in: as Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to himself as to all Intelligent Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52038:92"/>
and all Enjoyers. It is easie to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that this goodness is the Foundation
and Essence of his Happiness and glory.</p>
               <p>BY it he becomes Delightful to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
by it he becomes Delightful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
By it he communicates all his
Powers and Perfections with pleasure,
and receives the Services of all the
Creatures with high Satisfaction. By
it he is concerned in the Joy of others,
and enjoys their Blessedness. By it he is
capable of all their Affections, and of
the Services which his Laws require. By
it all Angels and Cherubims are moved
to admire and adore his Glory. By it all
Creatures visible and invisible are made
his Treasures. By it he is multiplied
and magnified in every Soul, as the
same Object is in several Mirrors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intirely represented in every living
Temple of his Eternal essence. By it
he becometh his own end, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Author, and the King of Heaven.
By it he liveth a Divine and a Blessed
Life, and by it he is what he is for ever
By it all the Graces, Exaltations, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of all his Creatures are made his Joys
and their Persons and Praisers are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to him. Of all his Laws and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52038:93"/>
Decrees, and Counsels his Goodness is
the fountain. It is the Original and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Cause of all our Thanksgivings.
Our ease, and repose, and Satisfaction, our
Bliss and enjoyment are founded in it, and
caused by it. For its own Pleasure all
our Delights are made exquisite in their
place, and the most of them Eternal. For
its own Glory it maketh all its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Glorious, and prizeth its own Glory,
because it is the Sovereign Delight of
all its Creatures. It is every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect, as infinitely Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
as it is Great in Bounty, as Good
to it self as to all others. There is no
End of all its Perfection, and for that
Cause it is <hi>Incomprehensible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO be made Partaker of the Divine
Nature, without having the Goodness
of Almighty GOD is impossible. Nor
can we enjoy his Goodness, or bear the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of his Glory, unless we are
good in like Manner. We enjoy the
Goodness of GOD, and may be said
to have it, either when we have its <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi>
in our selves, or the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of
it in others. Since the Goodness of
GOD is the great Object of our Joy,
its Enlargment is our Interest; and the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52038:93"/>
more there are to whom he is Good,
and the more he communicates his Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to every one the Greater Pleasures he
prepares for us, and the more is our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
therein delighted. To see innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Millions in Communion with him,
and all of them made Glorious and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and every one seated in his throne,
is the greatest Elevation of our Souls,
and the highest Satisfaction in the World.
When our Goodness meeteth his in all
Places, and congratulates the Felicity
of every person, we may then use the
Words of our Saviour, because we are
endued with the same <hi>Mind</hi> and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And as he accepts all the Good that
is done to his Members as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
saying <hi>Inasmuch as ye have done
it to the least of these my Brethren, ye
have done it to me.</hi> Our Souls will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<hi>Inasmuch as thou hast done all this
to the least of these my Brethren, thou
hast done it to me,</hi> for loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as our selves, all Angels and Men
will be our fellow Members, our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
our other selves! As we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in all Acts of Goodness for their
own sakes, that are done to us, so shall
we delight in all the Bounties of GOD
for theirs, who are the partakers of them,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52038:94"/>
and in GOD for this very reason, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is good to all.</hi> We shall be as Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in others, as in our selves; and Esteem
the Goodness of GOD our Felicity,
because it hath prevented our Goodness,
and done all for them, which were it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
we should desire to do our selves.
because our Goodness is a principle that
carries us to delight in their perfect Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
VVhich that we may do the more
Sweetly, and with more full Satisfaction
and perfect Reason, his Goodness to all
others is but the Perfection of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to us, for they are all made Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for our fuller and greater Felicity.</p>
               <p>HAD GOD withheld, or withdrawn
his Goodness from all others, it had not
been Greater to us, but less. The Stars
are no hindrance to our Enjoyment of
the Skie, but the Light and Beauty of
the place which we contemplate. Were
they all annihilated, the Heavens would
be obscure. They do us many Services,
of which we should be bereaved, by their
Absence and Destruction. GOD by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beams and influences to them! made
our Treasures more rich and fair, which
are increased and multiplied by their
Beauty and Number. Did the Sun shine
upon us, and upon Nothing else, it would
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52038:94"/>
be less beneficial to us, than now it is.
Its Beams that are scattered, seem to be
lost; yet were they contracted upon one,
his Body would be consumed, and all
the rest of the World be dark about
him; those Rays which fly from the Sun
to the utmost parts of the World,
illuminate all Objects, and from them
more conveniently return to the Eye
with their Beauty and Glory, which
by those Rayes that are dispersed become
visible and Profitable. They fall not all
upon every single man, but work for him
in other places, begetting Herbs, and
Fruits, and Flowers, and Minerals, and
Springs, and Trees, and Jewels, with
all that is rich and delectable in the
VVorld for his fruition. It serves Beasts,
and Fowles, and Fishes, for my sake, and
for my sake does it serve even Men
and Angels: That they, being more
Divine and Glorious Creatures, might
adorn Heaven and Earth with their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which without them would be void
and Empty. For we all desire to be
seen, and Known, and Beloved, and for
that Cause, without Living Agents, should
be very Desolate and discontented.</p>
               <p>THUS you see, if GOD had given
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52038:95"/>
all Eternity and Immensity to a man, if
he had made no other Creatures but him
alone, his Bounty had been defective:
Whereas by the Creation of these he
hath filled Eternity and Immensity with
Treasures. All which he hath made ours
by commanding them to Love us as
themselves; fit to be enjoyed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by us, by filling them with his
Goodness, and making them in his Image.
For every one of them is to Love all
his Creatures as he does, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Beauty and Felicity of all,
and to be the joy and Delight of all, as
as he is: And the Greater, and the Richer,
and the fairer they are, the more Great
and Happy are we, because they are made
our Lovers and Friends, our Brides
and Brethren, our Sons and Daughters,
our Fathers, and our Servants, which the
more Honourable and Excellent they are,
the more Delightful: the more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Blessed these are, their Love is the
more precious and Acceptable. True
Goodness removes all Envy and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of the VVorld, and introduces
nothing but Peace, and Bounty, and Joy,
unspeakeable and full of Glory.</p>
               <p>WE Love nothing more then to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52038:95"/>
be Delightful to others, and to have our
Glory seen is a natural Desire, which our
Saviour has countenanced by his own
Petition. It is our Interests; that the Eys
should be innumerable, that see and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Glory which we had with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in some Sense before the VVorld
was; that they should see (I mean) how
much we are Beloved of GOD from all
Eternity; that there should be Millions
of Blessed Persons to whom we may
communicate our selves, concerns our
Glory, as it doth also that, that they should
be Great and Perfect, that are made to
Admire and Delight in us. If we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Into his Eternal Glory,</hi> as the Scripture
saith, and our Bliss be individually one
with his, or so perfectly like his, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
it is no fault to desire Glory, for
it is <hi>Goodness</hi> it self that desires Glory and
Esteemeth all those its Best and Sovereign
Treasures, that are capable of Loving and
Delighting in it.</p>
               <p>THERE is in the Goodness of GOD,
and Men, and Angels, a Living Power,
that is exquisitely tender in Sence and
and feeling, which as it feels and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
it self, doth also feel its Object, and
apprehend both its own, and its Objects
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52038:96"/>
Excellences. By Vertue of which <hi>Living
Power,</hi> it is able to delight in its own
Goodness, and its Objects Glory.
The Apple of its Eye is not more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
regarded, than the Person which it
Loveth. It is afflicted in all our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and crowned and delighted in all
our Prosperities. It tendeth by its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the Benefit of others, and cannot
endure the least Damage or Detriment
to any. It infinitely hates the least De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in it self, or in its Creatures. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be Evil to it, but what is Evil to
another. Its Interests, and its Objects are
so united, that it intirely lives, and sees,
and feels, and enjoys, in others. All
its inclination is to be doing Good, and
it has no other Element than the Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of its Creatures. In friendship it
appeareth, and from Love it proceedeth,
it endeth in felicity. It hath many Great
and Glorious Designes, all contending
with each other for Supremacy. It cloths
it self with Glory, and adornes its Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
with all Kind of Beauties. It endures
all Afflictions and Hazzards, It undertakes
all Labors, It builds a Palace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
a Kingdome for its Beloved. And
yet when all is done nothing can exceed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52038:96"/>
the Delight which it taketh in the Person
of its Beloved. All the Honour, and
Esteem, and Glory it desires, it findeth
there, the Use and Value of all its Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
consists in the Benefit they do to its.
Beloved. Infinite Goodness can be seated
no where but in Love alone, for that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is capable of infinite Benevolence and
Complacency.</p>
               <p>THE Liberal Soul deviseth Liberal
Things, and by Liberal Things shall he
stand. The more Good it doth, the more
Good it is, and the more Good, the more
Great and Honourable, the more perfect
and Happy. There can be no Excess in
Goodness; because the more Delightful
it is to its Object, and the more Divine and
Glorious its Object is, the more abundant
Pleasure it taketh in communicating all
Felicities to its Object, &amp; the more Great
and manifold its Treasures are, the more
Sweet and Precious the Things are which
it giveth away, and the more its Beloved
delighteth in them; by so much the more
Admirable and Divine it is, its Goodness
and its Blessedness are both the Greater.
There is no Inconvenience which it can
possibly meet, but a stop or Impediment.
It cannot be hurt by it self, because its Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is always overflowing, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52038:97"/>
Evil it can fear from others is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
of its Object, or the Wrong that
it may receive from free Agents. For
Angels and Men being made free, that
they may Love, and Honour, and Praise
in a voluntary manner, and be, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Good of their own Accord, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot be made <hi>Morally</hi> or
<hi>Divinely</hi> Good, without the Liberty of
their Concurrence, and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.)
there is some fear, that they
may abuse their Power, because for the
more Illustrious use of it, they are left
in the Hand of their own Counsel.
Howbeit he has endeavoured as much as
as is possible, without prejudicing their
Excellence, to secure their Duty; he
hath infused into them the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to goodness imaginable, and
the Greatest principles of Honour, he
hath shewn them the Glory and felicity of
Goodness by his one Example, he hath
commanded them by the Severest Laws
that are possible, to be Good, he hath
founded their Peace and Pleasure in
Goodness, he hath made the suspension of
Goodness uncouth and unnatural, all
evil Actions Dark and disagreeable, he
has laid infinite Obligations upon them
to exercise Goodness, and set Eternal
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52038:97"/>
Rewards before them. He hath made
the Object unto which they must shew
it extremly amiable, he hath given them
all Advantages, Helps and Assistances.
He hath prepared the Severest Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Torments to punish the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of it. And for a Complement
of all, will extremely be grieved, if
they fail to shew it. This in the Estate
of Innocency. Since the fall indeed we
must be kind and Good to injurious
Persons: but this is founded in his
own Goodness toward us Sinners,
and tho it be a difficult. Work in
the first Appearance, Carries us to
higher and more Perfect Glory.</p>
               <p>THAT such a Goodness as this
should be, cannot be incredible to
them that are acquainted with the
Nature of the Universe: tho it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hard at least, if not impossible
to them that converse with peevish
men. Being corrupt in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
they are narrow and base
and servile in their Affections. They
start at a shadow, and boggle at a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Sin hath transformed them into
slaves and Cowards. They misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Nature of their Duty like
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52038:98"/>
                  <hi>Fools</hi>; that were made to be great and
Mighty as <hi>Kings.</hi> They think they
shall be undone, if they become too
Great and Good: they fear they shall
grow weak and Contemptible by
Goodness: whereas nothing makes them
so Amiable and Glorious as Excess of
Goodness.</p>
               <p>TO shew that there is such a
Goodness as that, which infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in powring out its Glory upon
all Creatures, the Sun was made:
Which continues Night and Day pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out its Streams of Light and
Heat upon all Ages, yet is as Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
this day as it was the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its Creation. To shew this
the Stars were made, that shine in their
Watches and Glitter in their Motions
only to serve us. The Moon was made
to shew this Goodness, which runs
her race for ever to serve us. The
Earth was made to support us, Springs
and Rivers expend their Streams to
revive us. Fruits, and Flowers, and
Herbs, and Trees delight us. All cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Things wast and consume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
that they may sacrifice their
Essence to our Benefit. For if they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52038:98"/>
were made Stiffe and unalterable they
could not feed us, nor communicate
their Essence and Perfection to us.
The Emanations and Effusions of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
are unknown, but that of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Odours is well understood.
And if these by Disbursing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sweetness, become more sweet and
enlarge themselves, if they are made
Bright and fair for our sake, if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
any Light and Pleasure in their
Service, as the Sun and Stars do, as
Herbs and Flowers do, as Beasts, and
Birds, and Fishes do; the Goodness of
the Creator is abundantly more clear
and apparent herein, for in all those
Creatures that perfect themselves by
the Service which they do, the
Service it self is a sufficient Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
while those upon which we
feed, being more Corruptible, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
in their Beings, by being turned
into ours. And the Trade of Bees,
in the Hony they make for us, and
the Warmth of sheep, in the fleeces
they bear for us, the Comfort of
Birds in the feathers they wear, and
the Nests they build for us, and the
pleasures of Beasts in the off-spring
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52038:99"/>
they beget and bring up for us,
these things shew that <hi>GOD is Good
to all, and that his mercy is over all
his Works.</hi> And if any perish in our
Service, the Bloody Characters of
his Love and Goodness are the more
Stupendious. All Nature is sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to our Welfare, and all that
we have <hi>By pure Nature</hi> to do (till
Sin marres all) is to admire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that Goodness, to the Delight
of which we sacrifice our selves in
our own Complacency.<note place="margin">Note, All this is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
truth, if it be a great Wonder
that any Goodness should be thus
infinite, the Goodness of all other
Things without that Goodness, is a
far Greater, If it be Wonderful, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and adore it.</p>

            <div n="12" type="chapter">

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Of Holiness: Its Nature, Violence, and
Pleasure. Its Beauty consisteth in
the infinite Love of Righteousness and Perfection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE infinite Love of his own
Goodness is the Holiness of
GOD. There are infinite Pleasures
and perfections in its Nature, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
an infinite Esteem and Desire. His
Goodness is all Beauty, and his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
all Fire and flame in pursuing it.
His Holiness is all Beauty, and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
all Fire and flame to enkindle it.
The infinite Excess of his Eternal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is its own Holiness, and the Beauty
of Holiness is Excess of Goodness.
For if Righteousness and Holiness be
well distinguished, Righteousness is that
Vertue by which GOD doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
affect and Esteem all Excellent
Things according to their value, and
chuse and do always the Best and most
Excellent: Holiness is the Love which
he beareth to his own Righteousness:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52038:100"/>
Which being infinite, makes him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
enflamed with the Love of the
most perfect Actions; and carries him
with an infinite Ardor to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of them. For tho it be a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Thing to esteem the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of GOD in an infinite manner,
yet there is as much difference between
Righteousness and the Love of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as between an Object and the
Affection embracing it. Tho here also
the Affection &amp; the Object are the same
Thing: For this Holy Esteem and Love
of Righteousness is Righteousness it self:
for it does but render Righteousness
its due, tho the Affection be infinite
which it bears unto it.</p>
               <p>HOLINESS (if it be strictly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined)
is that Vertue in GOD, by
which he Loveth the most Perfect
Things, and infinitely delighteth in
them. For by Vertue of this Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he shunneth and hateth all that is
profane, pursuing and delighting in all
that is Holy. For the Object of Holiness
may be Holy, as well as the Affection,
Whereupon it followeth, that Holiness
is of two kinds, either the Holiness
of the Affection, or the Holiness of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52038:100"/>
the Object They bear a Relation
to each other, yet are absolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in themselves. For the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of all Defects, Imperfections, Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
and Errors is a Glorious thing in
itself, yet relates to the Perfection of
those Objects from which it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
those odious Imperfections. The
Perfection of all Objects when they are
free from all Blemishes is a Glorious
Thing in it self too, yet is Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to that Affection, that desires to
see a Compleatness and Perfection in
every Object. And all is resolved
into the same Goodness of which we
have been speaking</p>
               <p>FOR infinite Goodness must needs
desire with an infinite violence, that all
Goodness should be compleat and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
and that Desire, which makes to
the Perfection of all Goodness, must
infinitely avoid every slur and Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
as unclean: and infinitely aim
at every Grace and Beauty, that tends
to make the Object infinitely perfect,
which it would enjoy. It cannot
desire less then infinite Perfection,
nor less then hate all Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in an infinite Manner. All Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52038:101"/>
are made, and Sanctified by the
Holiness of GOD. It is the measure and
strength and Perfection of Goodness.</p>
               <p>THE Holiness of GOD is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
called in his Oracle, <hi>The Beauty
of Holiness.</hi> As if all the Beauty of
GOD were in this. It extends to
all Objects in Heaven and Earth, from
the Highest to the Lowest, from the
Greatest to the Meanest, from the
most Pure to the most profane, with
a Goodness and Wisdome so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect disposing all, that some way
or other every Thing might answer
its infinite Affection. It infinitely hates
all that is Bad, and as infinitely desires
to Correct the same. The Influence of
that Affection, by which GOD abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the least Spot in his Kingdome, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to the Perfection of every Object,
and the is real &amp; proper fountain of all
the Perfection of Life &amp; Glory. And for
this Cause in all Probability, do the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
so continually cry, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,
Lord GOD of Hosts</hi>; because the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Infinite Glory and Perfection
appeareth in his <hi>Holiness,</hi> the violence
of his Eternal Love, and the Excess
of Goodness. It may be, also because
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52038:101"/>
all the Heights of Created Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
owe themselves to this Holiness, all
the Raptures and Extasies of Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the Zeal wherewith GOD is
carried to perfect Blessedness. All which
are occasioned by those pure and Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessential
Joys, those most sublime and
Perfect Beauties, which they see and
feel every where effected by the irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible
Strength of that Eternal <hi>Ardor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SINS of Omission have an unknown
Guilt and Demerit in them. They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
bereave us of infinite Beauty. To
let alone that Perfection which might
have been infinite, to pass by, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it, to exert Almighty Power in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
and lazy manner, is infinitely Base
and Dishonourable, and therefore
unclean because so Odious and Distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<hi>Lukewarmness</hi> is Profane, as well
as <hi>Malice.</hi> And it hath pleased GOD
to brand it with a worse and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Censure. No folly or iniquity can
dwell with him; Omission is both. To
be hated is to be rejected; but to be
beloved Lukewarmly is to be embraced
with polluted and filthy Armes. And
for this Cause, the fire of his Jealousie
burns most <hi>devouringly</hi> about the Altar.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52038:102"/>
He will be sanctified in all them that
draw nigh unto him, and but to touch
his Ark irregularly, is to be consumed.
Nor is this any other then a concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of his Holiness, and an evident
Testimony of his Love to perfection,
For it First shews, that on his own
Part, he maketh our Powers Perfect,
that we may be able to see and adore
him worthily; and next that he delights
in no Adoration but the most Worthy.
It moreover shews that he infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in the Perfection of his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for otherwise he would not be so
severe against the Imperfection of ours.</p>
               <p>NOR is the reason of his Love to
the utmost Perfection less then infinite:
You Know that all impure Things upon
Earth are dull and Obscure; as Vile in
Esteem, as Base and faint in their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
Neither will a Lump of Dirt
shine like the Sun, nor a Mudwall be
Resplendent like polisht Marble. All
Glorious Things have a Height of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensness</hi>
in them; and owe most of their
Beauty to the Motion of their Strength
and Activity. But GOD is a more
High and Necessary Thing than these.
Perfection is his Essence, and he could
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52038:102"/>
not be himself upon any Abatement. It is a
great Wonder I But the smallest Thing
in the world may spare somewhat of it
self rather than that which is infinite.
Upon the least substraction, that which
is infinite is made finite, and the Loss is
infinite. We cannot be at all Beloved by
Almighty GOD unless we are infinitely
Beloved. For to Love and neglect us at
the same time is impossible, and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do infinite Things for us, and
yet to do but some of them, is to Love
and neglect us at the same time. Tis
Love in what it does, &amp; neglect in what
it leaveth undone. The Reason why
it is our duty to Love him infinitely, is
because he infinitely Loved us. Did
he not exert all his Power himself, he
would never command us to exert ours.
The Love of all Perfection is his Essence
and must be infinite for its own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
The least flaw in a Diamond
abates its <hi>Price</hi>: one Tooth awry, or
wanting in a Clock, doth make it use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
<hi>Dead flies corrupt the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Oyntment, so doth a little folly him
that is in Reputation for Wisdome and
Honour.</hi> The Greater his Reputation
and Wisdome is, the more Grievious a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52038:103"/>
Disparagement is any Srain. Nor is
GOD above these Rules, for his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
it self is the Ruled of ours: and
the Higher his Divinity is the more
Exquisite is its <hi>Care</hi> of its own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is no Danger of being Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in our Expectations, for GOD
does infinitely hate any Defect in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
more then we, tho we infinitely
hate it; and enjoys himself only as
he is an Object Worthy of his own
infinite Love and Honour.</p>
               <p>FROM GODS Love of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Action it proceedeth, that he made
ours so compleatly capable of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Righteous, and that he adventured
a Power into our Hands of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It is a strange thing, that the
Excess of the Hatred of all Sin should
make Sin possible, and that the most
perfect Righteousness should be the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
Cause of Unrighteousness. But
yet it is so, an infinite Love to the Best
of all possible Things made the worst
of all things that could be possible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
those that are impossible, which
yet we need not except.</p>
               <p>TO read these Riddles aright, you must
vnderstand, that even <hi>Impossibles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52038:103"/>
are conceiveable Things, and may
be compared with <hi>Possible,</hi> and <hi>Actual.</hi>
That the Highest and Best of all that are
Possible, are the most Easie with GOD,
and most near to his Nature; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forior
Possibles are more remote, and
only thought on in the second place;
that Things Impossible are the worst
of <hi>Evils,</hi> and Things Actual the <hi>Best</hi> of
GOODS. For nothing is impossible
but that GOD should lye, or Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or displease, or deny himself, or
abuse his Power, or suspend his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or injure his Creatures, or do some
such thing, which is contrary to his
Nature, yet very conceiveable, because
he is a free Agent; and has a kind of
Power, were it not prevented by his
Eternal Act, whereby he is able to do
these Impossible things. Nothing is
Eternally Actual, but the Goodness, and
Wisdome, and Holiness of GOD, or
some such Thing; as his Righteousness,
and Blessedness, and Perfection. All
which spring from his Will, and are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
his pleasure, as well as his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
In the idle Power of being,
and doing all Excellent Things, there is
much Hazzard and danger; but he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52038:104"/>
and voluntarily became all these
from all Eternity. He wrought all
Righteousness and Wisdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from everlasting, and by so doing
became the fountain of all that is Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
from all Eternity. The Worst of
all <hi>Possible</hi> Evils are the Sins of Men:
Which have an infinite Demerit and
Vileness in them, yet are truely possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And the reason of their Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is thus accounted. Impossible,
which are worst of all, are Sins in
GOD.</p>
               <p>TO make Creatures infinitely free
and leave them to their Liberty is one
of the Best of all Possible Things; and so
necessary that no Kingdome of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
could be without it. For in
every Kingdome there are subjects ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Laws, and Rewards, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.
And these must be free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.
There is no Kingdome of Stones
nor of Trees, nor of Stars; only a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Men and Angels. Who were
they divested of their Liberty would be
reduced to the Estate of Stones and
Trees; neither capable of Righteous
Actions, nor able to Honor, or to
Love, or praise; without which Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52038:104"/>
all inferior Creatures and meer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Agents would be totally Useless.
So that all the Glory of the World
depends on the Liberty of Men and
Angels: and therefore GOD gave it
to them, because he delighted in the
Perfection of his Creatures: tho he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well knew there would be the Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their abusing it, (and of Sin
in that abuse) when they had received
it. The abuse of it he infinitely hated
yet could not prevent it, without being
Guilty of a Greater Evil. He infinitely
hated it, because those Actions of Love
and Honor which should spring from
the right use of it, were the onely
fair off-spring, for the sake of which
the whole World was made, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the right right use of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
all Creatures, Angels and Souls
would be in vain: he could not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it without being himself Guilty
of what in them he abhorred.</p>
               <p>FOR himself to be Guilty, was the
worst of Evils, and absolutely impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Twas better let them make their
Power vain themselves, then do so
himself. For the Author of that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
be it who it will, is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="tcp:52038:105"/>
of the Sin. If <hi>they</hi> would make
it vain, <hi>He</hi> could not help it, for him to
divest them of the use of Liberty after he
had given it, was as inconsistent with
himself, as it was with their Beauty to
abuse it: the Act of giving it by taking
it away being made vain. He infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hated that the Liberty should be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
which he gave unto men, for
their more perfect Glory: he laid all
Obligations upon them to use it well,
and deterred them (as much as was
possible) from abusing it, but would
not transfer their fault upon himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he fore saw they were about to do
it; which he certainly had done, had
he made their Power vain <hi>himself,</hi> after
he had given it. Either to refuse to give
the Power, or Having given it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
and determine it without their
Consent, was alike detrimental to the
whole Creation. For indeed it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that he by determining their
Wills, should make them the Authors
of Righteous Actions, which of all
things in the World he most desired.
There is as much Difference between a
Willing Act of the Soul it self, and an
Action forced on the Will, determined
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52038:105"/>
by another, as there is between a man
that is dragged to the Altar, whether
he will or no, and the man that comes
with all his Heart with musick and
Dancing to offer sacrifice. There is
Joy, and Honour, and Love in the one,
fear and constraint, and shame in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
That GOD should not be able
to deserve our Love, unless he himself
made us to Love him by violence, is the
Greatest Dishonour to him in the
World: Nor is it any Glory or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for us, who are such sorry Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that we cannot be entrusted
with a little Liberty, but we must needs
abuse it.</p>
               <p>GOD adventured the possibility of
sinning into our hands, which he infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
hated, that he might have the
Possibility of Righteous Actions, which
he infinitely Loved. Being a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and free Agent, he did without any
Constraint Love and desire all that was
most high and Supreamly Excellent of
all Objects that are possible to be
thought on, his own Essence which is
a <hi>Righteous Act</hi> is the Best: and the
Righteous Acts of Saints and Angels
are the Highest and Best next that which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52038:106"/>
Creatures could perform: The very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Excellence of the most noble
Created Beings, consisted in Actions of
piety freely wrought: which GOD so
Loved, that for their sake alone, he
made Angels and Souls, and all Worlds.
These Righteous Actions he so Loved,
that for their sake he prepared infinite
Rewards and Punishments. All the
Business of his Laws and Obligations
are these <hi>Righteous Actions.</hi> That we
might do these in a Righteous Manner
he placed us in a mean Estate of Liberty
and Tryal, not like that of Liberty in
<hi>Heaven</hi> where the Object will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our Wills by its Amiableness,
but in the Liberty of <hi>Eden,</hi> where we
had absolute Power to do as we pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and might determine our Wills our
selves infinitely, desiring and Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Righteous use of it, hating
and avoiding by infinite Cautions and
Provisions all the unjust Actions that
could spring from it. If we Love Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Actions as he does, and are holy
as he is holy, in all manner of Wisdome
and Righteousness; then shall we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in all Righteous Actions as he
doth, shall Love Vertue and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52038:106"/>
as he doth, and prefer the
Works of Piety and Holiness above all
the Miracles, Crowns and Scepters in
the World, every Righteous and Holy
Deed will be as pleasing to us, as it is to
him: all Angels and Men will be as so
many Trees of Righteousness bearing
the fruit of Good Works, on which we
shall feast in Communion with GOD;
Or if our Righteous Souls be vexed,
as <hi>Lots</hi> Soul in <hi>Sodom</hi> was, in seeing and
hearing the unlawful Deeds of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
they shall be recreated and revived
with the sight of GODS most Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judgments, and with the Beauty
of his holy Ways, by which he recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Malignity of the Wicked, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the evil of their Deeds, and
turnes all the vices of men into his
own Glory, and ours, in the Kingdome
of Heaven. The Delights of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Righteousness, and Holiness
are suitable to their Nature as those of
Goodness are to the nature of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
Which no man can enjoy, but
he that is qualified for them, by the
Principles of Goodness and Holiness
implanted in his Nature. For as he
that has no Eys, wanteth all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52038:107"/>
of sight, so he that has no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
wanteth all the pleasures of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
he that is void of Holiness, is void
of the Sence which Holiness inspires,
and he that is without Goodness must
needs be without the Pleasures of
Goodness, for he cannot delight in the
Goodness of GOD towards other
Creatures. To be Good, to be Holy, to
be Righteous is freely to delight in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Actions which unless we do of
our own Accord no External Power
whatsoever can make us, Good, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or Righteous: because no force of
External Power can make us free;
whatever it is that invades our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
destroys it. GOD therefore may
be infinitely Holy, and infinitely desire
our Righteous Actions, tho he doth not
intermeddle with our Liberty, but
leaves us to our selves; having no
Reserve but his Justice to punish our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Justice in General, and Particulars.
The Great Good it doth its Empires
and Kingdoms, a Token of the more
retired Good it doth in the Soul.
Its several Kinds. That GODS Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive
Justice Springs from his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THO following the common
Course of Moralists, in our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
of Vertues, we have seated
<hi>Justice</hi> among the Cardinal <hi>Moral;</hi> yet
upon second Thoughts we find reason
to reduce it to the number of <hi>Divine</hi>
Vertues, because upon a more neer and
particular Inspection, we find it to be
one of the Perfections of GOD, and
under that notion shall discover its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
far more compleatly, then if we
did contemplate its Nature, as it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
and bounded among the Actions of Men.</p>
               <p>THE Universal Justice of Angels
and Men regards all Moral Actions
and Vertues whatever: It is that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52038:108"/>
by which we yield Obedience to all
righteous and Holy Laws, upon the
Account of the Obligations that lye
upon us, for the Publick Welfare of the
whole World. Because we Love to do
that which is Right, and desire the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Eternal Rewards. There is much
Wisdome and Goodness, as well as Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Prudence necessary to the
Exercise of this Vertue, and as much
need of Temperance in it, as any.
For he that will be thus just must of
necessity be Heroical, in despising all
Pleasure and Allurements that may sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his Spirit, all fears and dangers that
may discourage and divert him, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Obligations and Concernes that
may intangle and ensnare him, he must
trample under foot all his Relations
and friends and particular Affections
so far as they incline him to partiality
and sloth; he must be endued with
Great Wisdome to discern his End,
great Constancy to pursue it, great
Prudence to see into Temptations and
Impediments, and to lay hold on all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and Means that may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
he must have a Great Activity
and Vigor in using them, a Lively sence
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52038:108"/>
of his Obligations, a transcendent Love
to GOD and felicity, a mighty Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Long-suffering, because his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
are many, his Condition low, his
Mark afar off, his Business manifold, his
Life tho short in it self, yet long to him,
his undertaking Weighty, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
corrupted.</p>
               <p>THEY otherwise define Justice to be
that Vertue by which we render unto all
their Due. Which is of large Extent
if the Apostles Commentary comes in
for Explication, <hi>For this Cause pay
you Tribute also, for they are GODS
Ministers attending continually on this
very thing: Render therefore to all their
Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is Due,
Custom to whom Custom, Fear to whom
Fear, Honour to whom Honour: One no
man any thing, but to Love one another for
the he that Loveth another hath fulfilled
Law.</hi> Kings, and Magistrates, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and Parents, and Children, must
have all their <hi>Due,</hi> and so must GOD,
Blessed for ever: Adoration, to whom
Adoration is due, and Obedience, to
whom Obedience. In strict Justice we
must render Hatred to whom Hatred is
Due, and Love to whom Love. Hope
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52038:109"/>
is due to certain Grounds of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragemeut,
and Sorrow to certain sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
Objects. But all our Passions
must still be guided by the Rule of the
Law, and all our Actions as Honour and
Equity require.</p>
               <p>PARTICULAR Justice is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in the Distribution of Rewards
and Punishments, or else it observes the
Rules of Equity and Reason in Buying
and Selling. It is called particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Excercise of it is not allotted
to all, the Power of rendring Rewards
and Punishments being committed to a
few, namely to the Magistrates: and
among Private persons many not at all
accustomed to Buying and Selling. This
Vertue, being to be exercised by some
particular men, is particular Justice.
However it has occasioned a Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Thing, whereby <hi>Justice</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into <hi>Distributive</hi> and <hi>Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi>
the one being used in Courts of
Judicature, the other in the Market.</p>
               <p>IT was a notable Observation of
<hi>Plato,</hi> that by reason of our Dim Eyes
we are not able to see immediately what
Vertue does in Secret in the Soul. And
therefore he sayes, that as an Old man
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52038:109"/>
that is blear-ey'd if he hath something
given him to read in little Characters,
finds it necessary first to see the same in
Capital Letters; so to observe first what
Vertue doth in a Commonwealth, is
expedient to him, that would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what it doth in his own Soul.
The Throne is upholden by Justice, the
Majesty of Kings, and the Glory of
Kingdomes is preserved by Justice.
When Vertue is rewarded, and Vice
supprest, the City flourisheth, as the Laws
are the Rampart of Mens Estates, Justice
is the Rampart of the Law, the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Angels of every family, State and
Kingdome. Kings and Counsellors,
and Priests, and Soldiers, and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
have all their several Office, and
proper Duty in a Kingdome: and that
Nation is blessed (with order and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
where every one contains himself
in his proper Duty. But where Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
invade the Priests office and defile
the Altar, the Soldiers turn Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and every Consellor deposes the
King, nothing but Confusion can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in such a State. The Senses and
Members of the Body are like Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
they traffick with sensible Objects,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52038:110"/>
the Irascible passions of the Soul are
Soldiers, and very apt to rebel and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny;
the Conscience is the Priest in
the Temple of the Mind; Right Reason
is the King, and the Concupiscible Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
or smoother Passions, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> may pass for
Counsellors. They may do well to put a
man in mind of his Interest, but when
they depose Right Reason, and usurp
the Throne, Ruine must follow in the
Soul, the Passions will turn Consellors,
the Trades-men invade the Temple,
and all Rights (Sacred and Profane) be
blended together. To sell offices of
Trust and Places of Judicature, is for
a King to do that himself which Rebels
attempt in violence; to put unworthy
men in places of Trust promiscuously,
that will sell Justice by Retail, as they
bought it by Whole Sale. Justice is a
a Severe Vertue, and will keep up all
the Faculties of the Soul upon hard
Duty. For otherwise it would not pay
to Felicity its Due: But where its Care
is remiss in taking an Account, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Goods are barterd away to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
false Commodities, the Soul will
grow loose and poor in a moment: All
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52038:110"/>
its Powers subordinate and Superior
will forget their Duty, and the Healthy
Estate of the Mind fall into Anarchy
and Confusion. All its Hopes and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities
will be lost, for want of that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
which Distributes to every Power
its proper office.</p>
               <p>THERE are two passages that I
mightily desire to be imprinted in the
Memory of all the World: and they are
both of our Saviour. The one is, <hi>He that
is faithful in a little, shall be Ruler over
much:</hi> The other is this, <hi>Who then is
that faithful and Wise Servant, whom his
Lord hath made Ruler over his Houshold,
to give them meat in due season: Blessed
is that Servant, whom his Lord when
he cometh shall find so doing. He that
is faithful in a little, is faithful also in
much.</hi> To be Just in a little Silver and
Gold, and accurate in deciding Causes
between a Man and his Neighbour, are
Actions that in their own Nature seem
to have little tendency to Bliss and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But when we consider that we are
Servants for a time, entrusted by a
Lord, that will come and examine
what we have done, we are not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our Hopes by those little Acts, as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52038:111"/>
they determine in a Moment, but in
relation to the Recompences which our
Lord will give when he cometh. For
our Saviour hath added, <hi>Blessed is that
Servant</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Verily I say unto you that he
shall make him Ruler over all his Goods. But
and if that evil Servant shall say in his
Heart my Lord delayeth his Coming; and
shall begin to smite his fellow Servants,
and to eat and drink with the Drunken,
the Lord of that Servant shall come in a
day when he looketh not for him, and in an
hour that he is not ware of, and shall cut
him asunder, and appoint him his portion
with Hypocrites, there shall be Weeping
and gnashing of Teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF GOD should be loose and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in his Kingdome, as it is infinitely
Greater then all other Dominions, so
would it quickly be more full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions:
Especially Since the King
would then himself be so loose and
Careless. For Licence and profaness
are of a spreading Nature, and such as
the King is, such is the people. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Kings do always punish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Imitation of their subjects,
especially where the Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Profane and Holy is lost, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52038:111"/>
there is no Hope and Fear of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Rewards. If GOD should
declare it by any Act of his, to be
a Thing indifferent whether men did
well or ill; it would mightily abate
the Rectitude of his nature, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
his Majesty. His Sovereignty
would be slighted, and his Will despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which ought infinitely to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
While Justice is infinite and there
is an infinite difference put between
Good and Evil, his Creatures we see
are apt to abuse their Liberty, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
and become Apostates; tho they
have an infinite pleasure to aspire after,
and an infinite destruction, or Wrath
to fear. What would they do, if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will were feeble and remiss, and
exacted no reverence to its Law and
Pleasure? It is the Height and Glory
of GOD, that he sets an infinite Rate
upon Excellent Deeds, and infinitely
detests and abhors the Wicked. Their
last ends are not more distant then their
first Beginnings; in his Esteem, and
Displeasure. Because he is infinitely
Offended and displeased at Evil Deeds,
he guards and fortifies his Law, deterres
men from displeasing him by the fear
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:52038:112"/>
of infinite Punishments; Encourages
men to please him by proposing infinite
Rewards, and the Truth is the infinite
Approbation and Esteem which he hath
for Wise and Holy Deeds, produceth a
Delight and Complacency in them,
which is the principal Part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Nothing is more honourable
then to be Praised and honoured by the
King of Kings; The infinite Hatred of
Evil Deeds is the very Torment it self,
that afflicts the Wicked. Tis but to
see how much we are hated of GOD,
and how base the Action is, no other
fire is needful to Hell: The Devils
chiefest Hell is in the Conscience.
They are obdurate and feared that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern and feel.—The Wound
which they inflict on themselves, who
grieve and offend their Creator. It is
easie to see, the Necessity of that
Justice which springs from Holiness,
and that GOD could not be infinitely
Holy, were he not infinitely Just in
like manner.</p>
               <p>THAT his <hi>Punitive Justice</hi> springs
from his Goodness, is next to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He punishes them that are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to others. He is most severe in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52038:112"/>
pleading the Cause of the Fatherless
and the Widow. Himself is persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
when his Saints are molested: and
he faults for which the untoward
servant was punished, are particularly
those of <hi>beating his fellow Seruants.</hi>
A good man by how much the more
tender and compassionate he is, by so
much the more is he provoked at any
gross Affront or abuse of the Innocent.
Every soul is the Bride of GOD:
and his own infinite Goodness, which
deserves infinite Love, is infinitely
Beloved by him. He infinitely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it and avoids its least Displeasure:
but its Displeasure is infinite at
every Sin, and consequently his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when such a Sovereign Beauty
as his infinite Goodness, is offended by
it.</p>
               <p>THE foundation of his Righteous
Kingdome, and of the Room prepared
for his Eternal Justice to act in, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
deeper, and must in other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
more full and copious (on that
Theme) be shewn. And to those we
refer you. All we shall observe here
is, that this Punitive Justice being
GODS infinite Zeal whereby he vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52038:113"/>
his abused Goodness: His
Goodness must of necessity proceed it,
and be abused, before he can be Angry,
and before his Anger can be accounted
Justice. His Dominion is infinite, but
cannot be Arbitrary (in a loose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction)
because it is infinitely <hi>Divine</hi>
and Glorious.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Mercy, The indelible Stain and
Guilt of Sin. Of the Kingdom which
GOD recovered by Mercy, The trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
Nature of that Duty, with its
Effects and Benefits.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SUCH is the infinite Justice of God,
and the Severity of his Displeasure
at Sin, his Holiness so Pure, and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
so irreconcilable, his Hatred so real
and infinite against it, that when a Sin
is committed, his Soul is alienated from
the Author of the Crime, and his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Displeasure will ever see the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and ever loath the Deformity
therein.</p>
               <p>THE Person of a man is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:52038:113"/>
in (and always represented in the
Glass of) his Action. Union between
him and his Deeds is Marvellous. Tis so
close, that his Soul it self is hated or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
in his Actions. As long as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in that deed which is Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Deformed, he can never be
Beloved.</p>
               <p>HOW slight soever our Thoughts
of Sin are, the least Sin is of infinite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,
because it breaketh the Union
between God and the Soul, bereaveth
him of his Desire, blasteth his Image,
corrupteth the Nature of the Soul, is
committed against infinite Goodness
and Majesty, being as the Scripture
speaketh <hi>Exceeding sinful,</hi> because it is
committed against infinite Obligations
and Rewards, displeasing to all the
Glorious Angels, abominable to all the
Wise and Holy, utterly against all the
Rules of Reason, and infinitely Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Holiness God, who is of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Eys then to behold the least Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
So that unless there be some way
found out to deliver the Soul from the
Guilt of Sin, to blot out the Act and to
purifie it from the Stain, there can be
no Reconciliation between GOD and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52038:114"/>
a Sinner. That an offence so infinite
should be Eternally punished, is the
most reasonable thing in the World.</p>
               <p>NOTHING but infinite power
and Wisdome is able to wash away Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie
of guilt, and to restore the Soul
to its former Beauty and Perfection.
Without which all Pardon is vain, and
the Soul dishonourable, and sick unto
Death, as long as the shame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of its Guilt does lie upon it. Which
cannot be removed by feeble Tears, nor
by Acts of Indignation against our
selves, nor by any Penitence or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of ours. For if these could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
the Divels might repent, and be
cleared of their Trespasses; long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe.</p>
               <p>THAT no Law of Works can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Sinners is evident enough from that
of the Apostle, <hi>For if there had been
a Law given which could have given
Life, verily Righteousness should have
been by the Law.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 21</note> GOD was not so
prodigal, as without an infinite Cause
to expend the Blood of his Son. And
the principal Cause for which he came,
was that he might <hi>be made a Curse</hi> and
<hi>Sin</hi> for us, that we might be delivered
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52038:114"/>
from the Curse of the Law, and be
made <hi>the Righteousness of GOD in
him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE reason why the Devils cannot
he saved, is because the Son of GOD
<hi>took not upon him the Nature of Angels,
but the seed of Abraham.</hi> And there is no
other name given under Heaven among
men whereby we may be saved, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the name of Jesus, who offered up
himself a sacrifice for us, that he might
purifie to himself a peculiar people
Zealous of Good Work. He pacified
the Wrath of God by his Death, and
satisfied his Justice in our nature, and
washed us in his Blood, and made us
Kings and Priests unto GOD. To
him be Glory and Dominion forever.
Amen,</p>
               <p>IT was the Design of Christ, and it
became the Mercy of GOD in our
redemption, to take away all the filth
and Deformity of Guilt, in which the
Perfection of his Love and Power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27.</note>
                  <hi>Even as Christ also Loved his
Church, and gave himself for it,; that
he might Sanctifie and cleanse it with
the washing of Water, by the Word,
That he might present it to himself a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52038:115"/>
Glorious Church, not having Spot, or
Wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it
might be holy and without Blemish.</hi> For
the Church of GOD being his <hi>Bride,</hi>
and we <hi>Members of his Body, and of
his Flesh, and of his Bones;</hi> it was meet
that we should be restored to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Beauty, and if not recover
the same, enjoy a Better Righteousness
than we had before.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE Light of Nature could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
nothing of all this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was taught by Revelations, and
Miracles, and Oracles from Heaven.</p>
               <p>AS all things before his fall were
subservient to mans Glory and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
so all things after his fall became
opposite to him; all creatures up braid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with his Guilt, every thing ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
his Sin and increased his
Damnation. The glory and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which he lost was his Torment,
the Honour which he had before, was
turned into shame; the Love of GOD
which he had offended, increased his
Guilt, Eternity was a Horror to him,
his Conscience a Tormentor, and his
Life a Burden; Nothing but shame and
Despair could follow his Sin, the Light
of nature it selfe condemned him, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52038:115"/>
all that he could see was, that he was
deformed, and hated of God. For
that of the Psalmist is an Eternal verity,
<hi>Thou art not a GOD that hath pleasure
in Wickedness,<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 4, 5, 6.</note> neither shall Evil dwell
with thee: The Foolish shall not stand
in thy sight, thou hatest all Workers of
iniquity: Thou shalt destroy them that
speak leasing: The Lord will abhor the
Bloody and Deceitful man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Express Declaration of GOD
assured <hi>Adam,</hi> that his Recovery was
impossible, <hi>In the Day that thou eatest
thereof thou shalt die the Death.</hi> For not
being able to dive into the Secret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
which depended absolutely
upon Gods holy Will and pleasure,
as an Act of Sovereignty above the
Tenor of the Law, all that he could
see was, that he must <hi>die the Death,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Veracity of GOD (as well
as his nature) obliged him to fulfil the
Denunciation of the Sentence: at least
as <hi>Adam</hi> conceived.</p>
               <p>IN the midst of this Black and
Horrid Condition, the Mercy of GOD
appeared like a Morning Star, and
the Redeeming Love of GOD was
that alone which was able by its Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52038:116"/>
to dispell the Mystes of Dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness
that were round about him.</p>
               <p>AS all things were before turned
into Evil, by the force of Sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
to sink him lower into the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
Pit; so all the Evils of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition were, by this infinite
Mercy, turned to his Advantage, and
his Condition in many Respects far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than before.</p>
               <p>IT is fit to see how Sin enfeebled
his Soul, and made him unable to serve
GOD; that we might the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Manner of his Recovery,
and how his Spiritual Life and Power is
restored, in the new strength which he
received in his Saviour.</p>
               <p>THE Atcount of it is this: By his
<hi>self Love</hi> he was prone to desire all that
was Profitable and Delightful to him:
While therefore GOD infinitely
Loved him, being apparently the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all his Happiness, he could not
chuse, (as long as he considered it)
but Love GOD and Delight in him,
it was natural and Easie to celebrate his
Praises. But when he was hated of
GOD, tho he could not chuse but
acknowledge that hatred <hi>Just;</hi> yet his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52038:116"/>
Self Love made him to look upon
GOD in a Malevolent manner, as
his Greatest Enemy and his Eternal
Tormentor. All that was in GOD
was a Terror to him. His power, his
Eternity, his Justice, his Holiness, his
Goodness, his Wisdome, his Unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Blessedness, all was a grief and
Terror to his Soul, as long as the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of GOD continued, against him
it made him desperate to think it would
continue forever, and reduced him to
the miserable slavery of hating GOD
even to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>BUT when the Love of GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Man appeared, the Joy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was surprized, was, in all Likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
so far beyond his Expectation,
and his Redemption so far above the
Powers of Nature, that his very Guilt
and Despair enflamed him with Love.
GOD appeared now so Welcome to
him, and so Lovely above all that was
before, that it was impossible for him to
look upon GOD, and not to Love him
with Greater Emazement and Ardor
then ever. Self Love, that Before
compelled him to hate GOD, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him now most violently to the Love
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52038:117"/>
of GOD; and the Truth is, the Love
of GOD in the Eye of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
is the influence of the Holy
Ghost proceeding from the Father by
the Son into the Soul of the Spectator.
For GOD is Love, and we therefore
Love him, because he first Loved us.
A faln man is Still a reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and having more reason to Love
GOD then he had before, is by the
pure Nature of his Essence infinitely
more prone to Love GOD and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in him, and praise him for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is so mercifully and so Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restored. Thus are we in Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the Exercise of that Power
which we lost by Sin: But without him
we can do Nothing.</p>
               <p>WHEN all the Kingdom of GOD
was at an End by the fall of man, and all
the Labor of the Creation lost, by the
Perversness of him for whom the whole
World was made; GOD by his Mercy
recovered it, and raised it out of the
Rubbish of its Ruines, more Glorious
than before. Which is the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the sake for which we introduce
the Mercy of GOD, as our best pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.
For when a man has injured us,
by Nature there is an End of all the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52038:117"/>
Lovely Exercises of Peace and Amity.
If natural Justice should be strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
but then the Season of Grace
arrives, and the Excellencie of Mercy
shews it self in the Lustre of its Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and so our Empire is continued,
our loss retrived: For by shewing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
we often recover the Love of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and restore a Criminal to the Joy of
our freindship. We lengthenout our
Goodness, and Heighten its measure; we
make it victorious, and cloath it with a
Glory above the course of Nature. And
all this we are enabled to do by Coming
of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who hath restored us to
the Hope of Salvation, and taught us a
Way to increase our own Goodness by
other mens Evils, to turn the vices of
others into our own Vertues, and to
Live a Miraculous Life of Worth and
Excellency in the midst of Enemies,
Dealing with men better than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
adornig our selves with Trophies
by the Advantages of their vileness,
making our selves more Honourable by
the Ignominy they cast upon us, more
Lovely and Desirable by the Hatred
which they bear towards us.</p>
               <p>THE foundations upon which we
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52038:118"/>
Exercise this Vertue, are wholy Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.
To be kind to the innocent is
but Justice and Goodness, but to be
Kind to the Malevolent is Grace and
Mercy. And this we must do, <hi>because
our Father which is in Heaven Causeth his
Sun to rise on the Just and the unjust and
his Rain to descend on the Righteous and
the Wicked.</hi> Because Mercy is the Head
Spring of all our Felicities, therefore
should we shew Mercy, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Mercy. As the Blood was sprinkled
upon the Tabernacle and all its Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils;
so is the Blood of Christ upon the
Heathens, and the Earth, and all our
Enjoyments. They are Daily Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Mercy to us, because they are
purchased by the Blood of Christ. For
of him it is, that the Heavens declare
the Glory of GOD, and the firmament
sheweth his Handy work to us sinners
at this day. The Salvation of Sinners
being the only End for the sake of which
we can be permitted now to enjoy them.</p>
               <p>THE Incarnation of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is an incredible mystery to
them, that do not consider the Love of
GOD towards Men, in the Creation
of the World. But they that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52038:118"/>
it by his Laws and works, and
see it in the value of their own Souls,
would think it very Strange, if that
Love which appeareth so infinite in all
other things, should be defective
only in its Ways of Providence. They
easily believe, it may express it self in
the Incarnation. Especially Since all
Ages are Beautified with the Effects
and Demonstrations of this verity, that
<hi>GOD so Loved the World, that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in him should not perish but have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Life.</hi> For Love is apt to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it self into all shapes, that the
necessity of its Object requires; and
as prone to suffer as rejoyce with
it, as apt to suffer for it, as with
it. Many fathers have died for their
Children, many for their Country, but
the Love of GOD exceedeth them all.
To be beloved in our Guilt is exceeding
Wonderful: but this also is in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Love, it may be provoked with
the Guilt, or moved with Compassion
at the misery of a Sinner.</p>
               <p>WHERE the Love is extreamly
violent, and the weak Estate of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
fit for Compassion, it is more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52038:119"/>
to Pity than Revenge: Tho
where the Object is strong, and endued
with all advantages, it is more offended
at the Outrage of its Rebellion.</p>
               <p>WHETHER we consider the
Nature of Man, or his Estate before the
Fall, we have some reason to believe
that he was more Beloved then the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels for there was more exquisite
Care and Art manifested in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his <hi>Person,</hi> and his <hi>Condition</hi> was
fitted for a more curious Tenderness
and Compassion, if he offended.</p>
               <p>IF you look into the <hi>Nature</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men you will find this mighty
Difference between them, Angels are
more Simple Spirits, Men are Images of
GOD carefully put into a Beautiful
Case. Their Souls would seem equal to
the Angels were they not to live in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies, and those Bodies are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded,
certainly for unspeakable
and most Glorious Ends; the visible
World was made for the sake of these
Bodies, and without such persons as men
are, it would be utterly useless. The
Hypostatical Union of two Natures so
unspeakable different as the Soul and
Body are, is of all things in the World
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52038:119"/>
most mysterious and Miraculous. Man
seems to be the Head of all Things visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and invisible, and the Golden clasp
whereby Things Material and Spiritual
are United. He alone is able to beget
the Divine Image, and to multiply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into Millions. His Body may be the
Temple of GOD, and when it pleased
GOD to become a Creature, he assumed
the Nature of Man. Angels are made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
Spirits for the sake of Man, and
by him alone GOD and his works are
United.</p>
               <p>IF you respect his <hi>Condition</hi> he was
made a little lower than the Angels,
that he might be crowned with Glory
and Honour; <hi>Lower</hi> for <hi>a</hi> Time, that
he might be <hi>Higher</hi> for ever. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were placed in such an Estate, that
if they fell, it would be with more
shame; yet if they stood, it would be
with less Glory: For having the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Greater Light and strength,
to Sin against them was more Odious,
and to stand in them less Wonderful.
While man, being more remote from
GOD, was more Obnoxious to Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and more Weak to resist them;
His Want of Clear Light if he fell,
would lessen his offence; And the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52038:120"/>
wherewith he was surrounded,
if he stood, would increase his Vertue,
which by consequence would make his
Obedience more pleasing, and much
augment his Eternal Glory. All which
put together, when Angels and Men
both fell, fitted Man rather to be chosen
and redeemed; he being the Greater
Object of Compassion and Mercy.</p>
               <p>THE Degrees and measures of that
Mercy which was shewn to Man in his
Redemption, are very considerable.
When he was Weak and unable to help
himself, when he was Guilty, when
he was an Enemy, when he was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous
and deformed, when he was
Miserable and Dead, before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
or Thought of such a Thing,
God freely gave his Son to die for
his Salvation, and condescended
to propose a reconciliation. Which
should teach us, tho higher then the
Cherubims, and more pure then the
Light, tho our Enemies are never so
base, and injurious, and ingrateful, nay
Obstinate and Rebellious, to seek a
reconciliation by the most Laborious
and Expensive Endeavors, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
all our Care and kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52038:120"/>
them, pursuing their Amendment
and Recovery. For the same Mind
ought to be in us that was in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:
who being in the form of GOD
thought it no Robbery to be Equal
with GOD, yet took upon him the
Form of a Servant, and being found
in fashion as a man, humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Death, of the Cross:
Wherefore GOD also hath highly
exalted him, and given him a Name
above every Name that at the Name
of Jesus every Knee might bow.
The very reason why we so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adore him, being the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Height and Perfection of his
Mercy, expressed in his Humiliation
and Abasement for us. If we would
enter into his Glory, we must walk
in the Way which he hath trod before
us, for that only will lead us into it.</p>
               <p>THO GOD hath in his infinite
Mercy redeemed us from the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Necessity of being Damned, yet
hath he with infinite Prudence ordered
the Way and Manner of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
in such sort that we are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
translated into Heaven, but
restored to a <hi>new Estate of Trial,</hi> and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52038:121"/>
endued with Power to do new Duties,
as pleasing to him, as those which he
required from us in <hi>Eden.</hi> For he Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Righteous Kingdome from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
wherein his Laws were to be
obeyed, Rewards and Punishments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and administred in a Righteous manner.</p>
               <p>THE Great and necessary Duties in
this second Kingdome are Faith and
Repentance introduced by his Wisdom,
and occasioned by Sin, necessary for our
Justification, and Sanctification, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
to the former.</p>
               <p>THIS Kingdome of Evangelical
Righteousness, being founded on the
Blood of Christ, is by Death and Sin, and
by the Supernatural Secrets of Love and
Mercy, made infinitely more Deep and
mysterious than the former.</p>

seek him, without that Credit

Discovery of his Love to them that are

we cannot use any Endeavor to

no Hope of Reconciliation, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

               <p>TO believe that GOD will be so
Gracious, as to pardon our horrible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy
and Rebellion, is a Work so
Great, that GOD accepteth it instead
of all other Works of Innocence and
Piety: to believe that he hath given his
Eternal Son to dy for us, and that he
so Loved us as to come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to suffer the wrath of GOD in our
stead, is so much against the Dictates of
Nature and reason, that GOD <hi>imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this Faith alone for Righteousness,</hi>
not as if there were no Good Works
necessary beside, but by this alone
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52038:122"/>
we are justified in his Sight, and out
Justification cannot be ascribed to any
other Work of ours whatsoever. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that which maketh Faith it self so
Great a Vertue, is that we thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Power and an Inclination with
all, to do those Works of Love and
Piety, the Performance and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of which was the very End of our
Saviours Coming.</p>
               <p>THAT there is implanted in Man a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of <hi>believing,</hi> is as certain as that his
Eys are endued with the Faculty of <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or his Soul with <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or any
other Faculty. And that this Power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
is of some <hi>Use</hi> in Nature, is as
sure, as any Thing in the World. For
nature never gave to any thing a Power
in vain, this therefore being one of the
Powers of the Soul, must have a certain
<hi>End</hi> ordained for it: And its use is the
Excercise of <hi>Faith,</hi> in order to that End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OBJECTS</hi> of Faith are those
Things which cannot be discovered but
by the Testimony of others. For some
things are known by Sence, some
by Reason, and some by Testimony,
Things that are Known by Sence, are
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52038:123"/>
present, some time or other, to the Senses
themselves. Those Things which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
discovers, are Known, as Effects
are by Causes, or as Causes by Effects;
a Good and rational Demonstration
being made by the Concatenation of
Causes and Effects depending upon
each other, whereby Things remote
from Sence are evident to Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the one is necessarily implied by
the existence of the other. But some
Things there are, which have no such
necessary Dependance at all: such are
the fortuitous Occurences that have
been in the World, with all those
Actions of free Agents that flow meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from their Will and pleasure. For
of these, there can be no certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
when they are past, but by Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Tradition. That the World
was made so many years ago, that Man
was created in an estate of Innocency
that he fell into Sin, that GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and promised the seed of the
Woman to break the Serpents Head;
that there was a Flood, that <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah</hi> was burnt by fire, that all
the World spake one Language till the
Confusion at <hi>Babel,</hi> that there were such
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52038:123"/>
men as <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Alexander the
Great,</hi> or such as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and
<hi>David,</hi> that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and were delivered from thence
by Miracles; that they received the
<hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
setled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that
they had such and such <hi>Prophets,</hi> and
<hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Kings:</hi> that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was
born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he was
GOD and Man, that he died and rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that he ascended into Heaven, and
sent the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> down upon his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</hi>
Nay that there is such a City as
<hi>Jerusalem;</hi> all these things can no other
Way be understood but only by Faith,
for no Light of Nature nor principle
of Reason can declare such verities as
these, among which we may reckon
these, that all the Nations in the World,
except that of the Jews, were <hi>Pagans</hi> and
Idolatrous, till the <hi>Gospel</hi> began to
come forth from <hi>Jury;</hi> that by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and Perswasions, and Faith, and
Patience, and Persecutions, and Deaths
of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they were converted,
and forsook their Dumb Idols, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
Temples to the GOD of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
that his Eternal Son was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52038:124"/>
in <hi>Judea;</hi> that such <hi>Emperors</hi> made
such Laws, that such <hi>Councils</hi> were
held in such Ages, that such and such
<hi>Fathers</hi> sprung up in the Church; that
there is such a Place as <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi>
these and many Millions of
the like Objects, to them that live in
this Age, and never stirred any further
then the English Coast, are revealed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Light of History, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Trust from the Testimony of
others. Nevertheless there is as great
a Certainty of these Things, as if they
had been made out, by Mathematical
Demonstration, or had been seen with
our Eys.</p>
               <p>FOR tho there are some <hi>false</hi> and some
<hi>Doubtful</hi> Testimonies, yet there are also
some that are <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Certain.</hi> And
least all Faith should be utterly blind,
and vain, and uncertain, there are Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Circumstances and inward Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by which those Testimonies which
are true and infallible are distinguished
from others.</p>
               <p>ALL those Things that are absolutely
necessary to the Welfare of Mankind,
the Knowledge of which is of general
Importance, that are unanimously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52038:124"/>
by all that mention them, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally
believed throughout all the
World, being as firm and certain, as the
Earth, or the Sun, or the Skye it self.
We are not more Sure that we have
Eys in our Heads, then that there
are Stars in the Heavens; tho the
Distance of those Stars are many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Leagues from our Bodily Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
               <p>THE Objects and Transactions
which in former Ages occur to our
Eys, (I mean the Spiritual Eys of the
intelligible Soul, that are seated within)
are by Faith received, and brought to
the understanding. When they are
transmitted to our Knowledge, their
Nature is apprehended immediately by
the Soul, and their existence examined
by Reason. There being certain
clear and infallible Rules, by which
their Truth or falshood may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
And for this Cause is it that we
are commanded, to <hi>Try all Things, and
bold fast that which is Good;</hi>

extendeth to all Objects, and penetrates

               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:52038:125"/>WHERE there is no Repugnance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Objects offered to our Faith
and the Things we already know, no
Inconsistance in the Things themselvs,
no difference, no Contention between
the Relators, no fraud in promoting,
nor folly (discernable) in the first Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of the Things that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
no Want of Care in Sifting and
examining their Reality, nor any want
(in the Hearers) of Industry, Skill and
Power to detect the Imposture, there is
a fair Way laid open to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of such Objects attested and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
with such Circumstances. But
if the Things attested were openly
transacted in the face of the World and
had Millions of Spectators at the first, if
they were so publick as to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in all Kind of Histories of those
times and places, if they were founded
on great and weighty causes, if they
were pursued by a constant Series, and
succession of affairs, for many Ages,
if they produced great and publick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
in the World, if they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all suspicious oppositions, obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

if old Records, and Monuments

which those Occurrences oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned;
our Reason it self assists our
Belief, and our Faith is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Grounds,</hi> that cannot be removed:
Much more if the Things be agreeable
to the Nature of GOD, and tend to the
Perfection of Created Nature, if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Prophesies and long Expectations
have preceded their Accomplishment,
if the misteries revealed are attested
by Miracles, and painted out many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
before, by Types and Ceremonies,
that can bear no other Explication
in Nature, nor have any Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
use besides; if all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of former Ages is founded in
and compounded by their Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
if they fitly answer the Exigencies
of Humane Nature, and unfold the
True Originals of all the Disorder
and Corruption in the world, if the
Greatest and Best Part of Learning it
self consists in the Knowledge of such
affairs; if the Doctrines on which they
attend, be the most pure, and Holy,
and Divine, and Heavenly; if the most
of them are rooted in Nature it self,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52038:126"/>
when they are examined and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
but were not discerned nor
Known before; if they supply the
Defects of our Understanding and
lead us directly to felicity, if they
take off our Guilt, and are proper
Remedies to heal the Distempers and
Maladies of our Corruption; if they
direct and quiet the passions of Men and
purifie their Hearts, and make men
Blessings to one another; if they exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
their vices, and Naturally tend
to the Perfection of their Manners, if
they lead them to Communion with
GOD, and raise up their Souls to the
fruition of Eternity, enlarge their
Minds with a Delightful Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Omnipresence, enrich<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> them
with infinite varieties of Glorious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
fit to be enjoyed, if they perfect
all the Powers of the Soul, and
Crown it with the End for which
it was was prepared: Where all these
Things meet together, they make a
Foundation like that of the Great
Mountains which can never be moved.
But if there be any flaw, or Defect,
in these Things, if any of them be
wanting, our Faith will be so far
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52038:127"/>
forth lame and uncertain, as our
Reason shall discern its Cause to be failing.</p>
               <p>NOW of all the Thingsthat
the World doth afford, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion is that alone wherein all
these Causes of Faith perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.
Insomuch that no Object of
Faith in all the World is for <hi>Certainty</hi>
Comparable to that of Religion. Never
had any Truth so many Witnesses, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Faith so many Evidences, they
that first taught and published it, despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Grandeurs and Pleasures in
the World, designed nothing but their
Eternal Felicity, and the Benefit of men,
trampled all Honours and Riches under
feet, attested the Truths they taught and
revealed, by Miracles wrought, not in
obscure Corners, but in the Eye of
the Sun, many Nations far distant from
each other were in a Moment reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and changed at a time. Millions of
Martyrs were so certain of the Truth
of these Things, that they laught at Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
and Flames, and Torments.
The Jews that are the great enemies
of Christianity, confess those Histories,
and Prophesies, and Miracles, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52038:127"/>
Types, and Figures upon which it is
founded. They reverence the Book
wherein they are recorded above all
the Writings in the World, confess that
they had it before our Saviour was
born, and glory that it was theirs,
before it was ours. Their whole Faith
and Religion is made up of Such Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
which being granted, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
the Christian Religion should be
false, Turks acknowledge the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Part. The Artifices of Corruptors
have been all detected, and must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
so be as long as there are inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Men in the World: All Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Hereticks have cavilled and
disputed about the true Interpretation
of certain. Texts, but never so much
as Doubted, much less shaken the
foundation. Nay when you look into
Matters well, the very Certainty of
the one was the occasion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The great Moment of what they
took for granted made the strife the
more Eager.</p>
               <p>THIS Advantage our Faith has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, it is suspected only by Lazy
and Profane, half witted men that
are as Empty as self conceited, as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52038:128"/>
rash as Wanton, and as much Enemies
to Felicity and Vertue, as to Truth and
Godliness. But the more you search
into it, the more Light and Beauty you
shall discern in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
the Evidences of it will appear still more
deep and abundant, as endless in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
force, and Value, as they are unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>AMONG other Objects of Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be enjoyed, <hi>the Ways of GOD</hi> in
all Ages are not the least considerable
and Illustrious. Eternity is as much
Beautified with them, as his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence
is with the Works of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For Time is in Eternity, as the
World is in Immensity: Reason expects
that the one should be Beautiful, as
well as the other. For Since all <hi>Time</hi>
may be Objected to the Eye of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
altogether, and Faith is prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Soul on purpose, that all the
Things in Time may be admitted into
the Eye of the Soul, it is very Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to Humane Reason, that <hi>Time</hi>
should be horrid, and Dark, and empty,
or that he that has expressed so much
Love in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World,
should be Unmindful of our Concerns
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52038:128"/>
in the Dispensations of his <hi>Providence.</hi>
Especially Since the World, how Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
soever it is, is but the Theatre of
more Glorious Actions, and the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of <hi>Time</hi> as Great and Large as that
of the <hi>Universe,</hi> Ages are as long and as
Wide as Kingdoms. Now if GOD
have altogether neglected the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World, all Time will be
Dark and vain, and innumerable Bright
and Delighful Objects, which were
possible to be desired, denied to the
Soul, and the better half of GODS
Love be removed. But if GODS.
Will and Pleasure be Uniform in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
and Time it self Beautified
by this Wisdome, Goodness, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as well as the World, our <hi>Faith</hi>
will have a peculiar Excellency because,
it is that by which all the Beauties in
<hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> are enjoyed: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if it be able to see and feel
them in clear Light, and in as lively a
manner as the <hi>Reason</hi> of the Soul
can do, when most fully inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It is evident that without this
<hi>Faith,</hi> the Greater half of our Felicity
can never be enjoyed.</p>
               <p>TO Know that we are Men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52038:129"/>
with the Skies, and that the
Sun and Moon, and Stars are about us,
with all the Elements and Terrestrial
Creatures, is matter of Sence and <hi>Reason;</hi>
as it is also, that we have the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and use of them; and that such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and Degrees of Goodness
are Connatural to them: But their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Perfection is discovered only by
the Truth of Religion; that alone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closes
their first Cause, and their last
End, without which all their Interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
uses are <hi>Extremely</hi> Defective: It is
for more Pleasant to see the Infinite
and Eternal GODHEAD from the
incomprehensible Height of his Glory,
shooping down to the abyss of Nothing,
and actually making all these Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Things out of Nothing for our
sakes, then to see our selves at present
surrounded with them. This is the first
Act of all the Ornaments of <hi>Time</hi> and
<hi>Nature.</hi> Which tho it be founded on
clear Reason, yet is it an Object of our
Highest Faith, as it is revealed by the
Word of GOD: and therefore it is said,
<hi>Through faith we understand that the
Worlds were made.</hi> For Faith and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are not so divided, but that (the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52038:129"/>
formally Distinct) they may enter into
each others Nature, and Materially be
the same. The very same Object (I mean)
that is Known to Reason, may by Faith
be believed: <hi>Reason</hi> not destroying
but confirming <hi>Faith,</hi> while it is <hi>Known</hi>
upon one account, and <hi>believed</hi> on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For there is a Mutual Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between these two, <hi>Faith</hi> is by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
confirmed, and <hi>Reason</hi> is by <hi>Faith</hi>
Perfected.</p>
               <p>TO see GOD stooping down to
Create the World, and Nothing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
is not so Beautiful, as to see him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
in the Act of making Man, and
Giving him Dominion over all the
Creatures. It is more pleasant to
see Man made in GODS Image,
then to see the World made for the
use of Man. For the End of the
Creation is that, upon which all the
Perfection of its Glory does depend,
and the more Noble <hi>Man</hi> is, for whose
use the <hi>World</hi> was made, the more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and Glorious its <hi>End</hi> is. To see
him placed in the Estate of Innocency,
Light, and Glory, wherein he was secure
from Death, and Sin, and Sickness, and
Infelicity, if himself pleased, is very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52038:130"/>
so it is to see, that Nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended any of those Abortive Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
that now so confound us: But
to see the <hi>End</hi> why man was placed in
such an Estate, to be his <hi>Trial,</hi> and the
End of that his <hi>freindship with GOD,</hi>
whose Exercise consisteth in voluntary
Acts of <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Amity;</hi> and the
End of those the Beauty of his Life,
and his fuller Exaltation to Bliss and
Glory; this is far more Pleasant then
the other. To see him fall is infinitely
Displeasing, but the fault is intirely
charged on himself: And had GOD
Eternally destroyed him, tho we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
had never lived to see it, yet
we confess it would have been just in
it self, and the Justice Adorable. But
to see GOD exalting his mercy in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
the offence, and for all our sakes
redeeming Man by the Death of his Son
is sweet still: as it is also to see his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Justice and Holiness in the <hi>Manner</hi>
of our Redemption. To see him lay
the foundation of our Hope on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Promise, seconded with his Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering,
yet defer the Accomplishment
of it for our greater Benefit, wisely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
to send his Son till <hi>the fulness of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52038:130"/>
Time,</hi> is very transporting, but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it is very Difficult to understand.
His foresight of our Obstinate <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Incredulity</hi> was the Cause of
His Dealy. That he might gain Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>Saviour</hi> came, to speak of him,
to paint him forth, to make him
the expectation of the World, and
the Hope of all Nations; To see him for
that End reveal himself to <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and bringing down
their Posterity into the Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
that he might make that Nation,
out of which our Saviour was to
spring, <hi>Famous</hi> by <hi>Miracles,</hi> and by
his Conduct and Government of them,
more <hi>Glorious</hi> then all Nations, to
appear himself among them, and give
his Oracles unto them, and to make
them conspicuous to the Eye of all
the World, by mighty Signes, and
Wonders, and Judgments, punishing
them for their offences, yet Gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
continuing a Seed among them,
that <hi>christ</hi> might be raised up accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Prophesies,</hi> that went before
concerning him. To see all the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Gospel painted out in so
<hi>Lively</hi> a Manner, in all the Types and
Figures of the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52038:131"/>
that Service with so much splendor
and Glory continued, before he came
by the Space of two thousand years,
wherein all the mysteries of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
are exhibited; to see <hi>the Volumen
of the Book in which it was written
of him,</hi> so highly magnified and exalted,
by them that crucified him after it was
written, and that now continue so much
to oppose him as the <hi>Jews</hi> do; To see
the <hi>Prophets</hi> at various Times, and in
Divers manners, so clearly to describe
all the particulars of his Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
his Eternity, his Godhead, the
Hypostatical Union, his Incarnation in
the Virgins Womb, his Poverty, his
Meekness, his Miraculous Life, his Death
and Passion, his Resurrection and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention
into Heaven, the Sudden and
Miraculous Conversion of the Gentiles,
compared to a <hi>Nation's being born at
once,</hi> the very <hi>Town</hi> where he should be
born, and the <hi>City</hi> from whence the
Law should go forth into all the World,
and the <hi>Temple</hi> in which the Gospel
should begin to be preached. To see
the Accomplishment of all these Things
attended with so many Glorious and
Transcendent Wonders, and the utter
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52038:131"/>
subversion of that Nation, for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity
when they had slain him; To
see Kings and Queens become the
<hi>Nursing Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers</hi> of the
Church, and so many Glorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
receive his Law that was <hi>hanged</hi>

all the World to a Crucified GOD,
and Nations upon Earth adoring his
Glory in the Highest Heavens; Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to see the manner of his satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by way of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in our stead, the
laying of our Sins upon his Head, &amp; the
sprinkling of his Blood upon all Nations
so lively represented, the Necessity of
such a Saviour exhibited by the Rigor
and Severity of the Law, his Person and
his Office being pointed out in so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
a Manner; all this as it is sweet
&amp; Heavenly, so does it enrich the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Soul, &amp; make it meet
to walk in Communion with GOD in all
<hi>Ages,</hi> adoring his Wisdome, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Power, admiring &amp; delighting
in the <hi>fulness</hi> of his Love, And all these
most Great &amp; Transporting Things we
receive into our souls by <hi>Faith</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>BUT that which above all other
Things is most satisfactory is to see Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52038:132"/>
Christ <hi>the end of the Law,</hi> and the
centre of time, the main Business of
all the Dispensations of GODS Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and the only Hinge upon which
all mysteries both of the Law and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Principally turn.</p>
               <p>HAD he come in the Beginning of
the World, there had been no <hi>Room</hi>
nor <hi>Place</hi> for all these Prophesies, and
Figures, and Expectations, and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Precedeing his Birth, we had had
nothing but a <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he had been in the world,
which by the carelesness of men had
passed away like a Dream, and died
unprofitably; As we may plainly see
by their Backwardness to believe these
Things, notwithstanding their strength
and Beauty, and the reiterated Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of GOD to excite and awaken
Man-kind, notwithstanding his care to
erect a Ministery among us, for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
end, <hi>that Jesus Christ might be Known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAD he not been GOD and MAN
in one Person, had no satisfaction been
necessary for our sins, had he not made
satisfaction for us; there had been no
Necessity of believing on his name.
The light of nature had been sufficient to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52038:132"/>
guid us to sorrow and Obedience; all
this trouble and care might have
been spared, all this Oeconomy might
have been changed into a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of less expence, and the most
of these proceedings had been imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and superfluous. For they all
receive their Attainment and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who is the fulness, and
substance, and Glory of them.</p>
               <p>NOR is it, the excellency of Faith
alone, that it looks back upon Ages
past: it takes in the Influences of all
these, that it may bring forth fruit,
in our Lives for the time to come.
For what is it but the Faith of these
things, attended with the Glory which
is intimated by them, that made so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Divine and Heavenly persons, so
many Wise and Holy Heroes, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Saints and Martyrs! What can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
us with the love of GOD, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
us with Courage, or fill us with
Joy, but the Sence of them! A true
and lively Faith is among Sinners the
only Root of Grace and Virtue, the
only Foundation of Hope, the only
Fountain of excellent Actions. And
there fore it is observed by the Apostle
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52038:133"/>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> that <hi>by Faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered a more
Excellent sacrifice than</hi> Cain, by <hi>Faith
Enoch</hi> walked with GOD, by <hi>Faith
Noah</hi> prepared an Ark, in which being
warned of GOD, he saved himself from
the general Deluge; by <hi>Faith Abraham</hi>
did such Things, as made his Seed to
multiply above the Stars of Heaven;
by <hi>Faith Moses</hi> despised the Honours
and Treasures of Egypt, and endured,
as seeing him that was invisible; <hi>What
should I say more</hi> (saith the Apostle)
<hi>For the time would fail me to tell of</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,
<hi>and of</hi> Barak, <hi>and of</hi> Sampson,
<hi>and of</hi> Jeptha, <hi>of</hi> David <hi>also, and of</hi> Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
<hi>and of the Prophets: who through
Faith subdued Kingdoms, wrought Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
obtained Promises, Stopped the
mouths of Lions, Quenched the violence
of fire, escaped the Edge of the Sword,
out of Weakness were made strong, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
valiant in fight, turned to flight the
Armies of the Aliens. Women received
their Dead raised to Life again; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were tortured, not accepting Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
that they might obtain a better
Resurrection. and others had tryal of
cruel Mocking and Scourges, yea more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
of Bonds and Imprisonments. They
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52038:133"/>
were stoned, they were sawn asunder
were tempted, were slain with the sword,
they wandred about in Sheep-skins and
Goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
of whom the World was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
they wandered in Deserts and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and in Dens and Caves of the earth.</hi>
All these things were done through
<hi>Faith,</hi> while yet there were but a few
Things seen to encourage them. But
the whole Accomplishment of mysteries
and myracles is far more fair, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and enflaming; the Beauty of the
whole Body of GODS Dispensations fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united in all its Parts, being an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<hi>Monument</hi> of his Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
declaring the Glory of his Love, and
Kingdom in a more Eminent manner,
and making us <hi>more then conquerors
in and thorrow Jesus Christ, who loved
us, and gave himself for us.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Hope. Its foundation, its Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Faith, its Extents and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
its Life and Vigor, its Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kinds, its Sweetness and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>JANUS</hi> with his two Faces, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
backward and forward, seems to
be a fit Emblem of the Soul, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to look on all Objects in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
past, and in all Objects before,
in Eternity to come. Faith and
Hope are the two Faces of this Soul.
By its Faith it beholdeth Things that
are past, and by its Hope regardeth
Things that are to come. Or if you
please to take Faith in a more large and
Comprehensive Sence, Faith hath both
these Faces, being that Vertue by which
we give Credit to all Testimonies
which we believe to be true concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Things past present and to
come: Hope is a Vertue mixt of Belief
and Desire, by which we conceive
the Possibility of attaining the Ends we
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52038:134"/>
would enjoy, and are stirred up to
endeavour after them. Faith respects
the <hi>Credibility</hi> of Things believed to
be <hi>True;</hi> Hope, the <hi>Possibility</hi> and
<hi>Goodness</hi> of their <hi>Enjoyment.</hi> The
Simple Reality of Things believed is
the Object of the one, the facility
of their attainment, and our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
united are the Object of the
other.</p>
               <p>HOPE presupposes a Belief of
the Certainty of what we desire. It
is an Affection of the Soul of very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Importance. Which forasmuch
as it is founded on Faith, and derives its
strength from the Sure Belief of what
we hope to attain, and there can be no
fruition of that which is not really <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent,</hi>
to lay the foundation of our
Hope more firmly, we will again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Objects of Faith in the best
Light wherein their apparent certainty
may be discerned.</p>
               <p>THE Objects of Divine Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the holy Scripture may fitly
be ranked into three Orders. For the
<hi>Matter</hi> of the Bible being partly <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,</hi>
and partly <hi>Prophetical,</hi> and partly
<hi>Doctrinal,</hi> the Objects of <hi>Divine Faith</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:52038:135"/>
fall under these three Heads, of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
History,</hi> and <hi>Prophesie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Scripture is
of two sorts: for some Doctrines are
<hi>Natural,</hi> some are <hi>Supernatural.</hi> The
Natural are again divided into two.
For some of them are <hi>Laws</hi> that teach
us our Duty, some of them <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
only, or bare and Simple <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which we call Articles guiding
our Apprehensions in the Truth of
those Things which are meet to be
Known. <hi>Speculation</hi> is intended in
the one, and Practice in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NATURAL Doctrines</hi> are Objects
of Divine Faith, only as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by the Word of GOD. For
the Authority of the Witness is that
which maketh our Faith <hi>Divine.</hi> They
are called <hi>Natural,</hi> because how ever
Blind any man is, in his present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
upon a diligent Search, those
Things may be clearly discerned by the
Light of Nature. Those Doctrines
which are Objects of Divine <hi>Faith,</hi> and
yet may be found out by the Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of <hi>Reason,</hi> are such as these. That
there is a GOD, that the World was
made, that man was created in GODS
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52038:135"/>
Image, that he hath Dominion over the
works of his Hands, that he is or ought
to be tenderly Beloved of all mankind,
that he is to be good, and full of Love
to others: that he is to render all Objects
their Due Esteem, and to be Grateful
for the Benefits he hath received of his
great Creator: that the first Estate of
the Worlds Creation was pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that Sin came in by the Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
abuse of the Creatures Liberty, that
Nature is Corrupted, that Death was
introduced as the Punishment of Sin,
that the Soul is Immortal, that GOD
is infinitely Just, and Wise, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that he will distribute Rewards,
and Punishments according to Right;
that there is such a Thing as Eternity
and Immensity; that the Body is frail
and subject to Diseases; that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all Things from GOD, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
in the fruition of all upon his
Power and Providence; that it is Wife
to please him, and foolish to displease
him; that Punishment is due to Sin,
and that GOD hateth it; that Reward
is due to Vertue, and GOD delighteth
in it; that there is a Conscience in the
Soul, by which it feels and discovers
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52038:136"/>
the Difference between Guilt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.
That man is a Sinner, that he
is prone to Evil, and Obnoxious to
GODS Wrath, that nevertheless he is
spared by the Long-suffering of GOD,
and that GOD Loveth him, and
desireth his Salvation. That there
is a felicity and a Supream Felicity
appointed for man: that he is a
free Agent, and may lose it, if he
pleases: that misery is the Consequent
of the Loss of Felicity: that GOD
delighteth in all those that Love and
practice Vertue: that he hateth all
those that drown their Excellencies in
any Vice: that Sorrow and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are necessary for all those that
have offended GOD: that there is
Hope to escape the Punishment of
Sin, if we endeavour to live as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
as we ought. All these things
are evident in themselves by the
Light of Nature, because they
may either be clearly deduced from
the principles of Reason, or certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned by plain Experience:
And are therefore taught by the Word
of GOD, either because they had
need to be revived and raised up
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52038:136"/>
to light from under the Rubbish of our
Fall, or because GOD would sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Nature by his express Consent,
or make its Dictates more remarkable
and Valid by his Approbation, and
confirm all by the Seal of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
or because a fair Way is laid
open by these to more retired and
Coelestial Mysteries.</p>
               <p>FOR when we know these Things
we are prone to enquire what GOD
hath done, what Way there is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
our ancient Happiness, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are prepared for the corruption
of Nature, how the Guilt of Sin may
be removed, how we may be aided
and assisted in the works of Virtue,
by what Means our Reconciliation with
GOD is wrought, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
we ought to demean our selves
that we may be accepted of him?
for the knowledge of our former health
is necessary for the clear apprehension
of our present Sickness, and the sense
of our Infirmitie fits us for the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
When we know all that <hi>Nature</hi>
can teach, and see something need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that Nature cannot, unfold; when
we are condemned by our Conscience
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52038:137"/>
yet feel our selves beloved, find that
we have forfeited all, yet see the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the creation continued (for our
use and service,) stand in need of an
Atonement, yet Know not where to
get it; our Exigency meeting with the
grace of GOD, the sence of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and Hope united, our own Guilt
and GODS Mercy (of both which
we have the feeling and experience,)
adopts us for the Reception of the Holy
Gospel, wherein those thing are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that come in <hi>most fitly</hi> to answer
our Expectations. Satisfaction for Sin
by the Death of Christ, and the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his GODHEAD above
the course of Nature, for that End;
His active and passive Obedience in
our Stead, our Justification thereby,
the application of his Merits to our souls
by faith, the Glory which we owe
him for so great an undertaking, the
coming down of the Holy Ghost to
Sanctifie our Nature, and the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Both these Persons by reason of
their Unity in the eternal Essence; for
the manifestation of which the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the Trinitie is largly revealed,
these supernatural Points come in so
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52038:137"/>
suitably and are so agreeable to Nature,
so perfectly fit in their places, so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously
conducive to the perfection
of the Residue, that the very Harmony
and sweetneess of altogether is enough
to perswade us of their <hi>Credibility</hi>;
and then the <hi>Matter of fact</hi> comes in
with the Testimony and Authority of
GODS Word, assuring us that these
Things are so, by History and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.
The Miracles at our Saviours
Birth alone one would think enough
to clear the business: much more if
we take in all the Miracles of his life;
wherein his Glory appeared, as of the
only begotten of the Father; more
fully yet, if we take in the Miracles
of his Death; and abundantly more, if
the Glory of his Resurrection and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
be added. But especially the
<hi>Coming down of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and the
Power the Apostles received from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
all the Prophesies that went before,
and all the successes that followed after,
all the Faith and Learning of the Fathers,
all the Canons and Decrees of Councils,
all the Transactions of the World drawn
down to our own Age in a continued se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
illustrate and confirm all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:52038:138"/>BUT you will say, How shall we
know such Histories to be true, and
that such Prophesies and Prophets were
in their several Ages; Since we never
saw the same with our eyes, and there
are many sleights and Fables in the
World: How dost thou know there
are any Antipodies? Thou didst never
see them! Or that there is any Sea,
which thou didst never behold! Or
that the next River has a Fountain
Head? Is not the Universal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the world (wherein the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nay the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, is but a little Part) a clear
Light for a <hi>matter of Antiquitie,</hi>
attended with a <hi>Stream</hi> of Effects and
clear <hi>Monuments</hi> concurring together,
without any Dissonancy in the Things
themselves, or Contention of Parties?
How dost thou know that there was
such a man as King <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>William</hi>
the Conqueror. Is he not a mad man
that will doubt, or Dispute it? All
that thou hast to confirm thee in the
certainty of these, and infinitely more,
conspires together, to confirm thee in
the certainty of the other, The Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Bible is confest by Turks, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52038:138"/>
Jews, and Infidels, and which is far
more, by the Testimony of the Church,
which deserves to be believed above
them all. And if the History be true,
there were such Persons as <hi>Adam,
Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses,
Samuel, David, Solomon, Elias, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha,
Josiah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,
Daniel,</hi> and the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
such persons as Jesus Christ,
and his Apostles in such Ages; such
Prophesies, and such Accomplishments
at vast Distances; such Acts, and
such Miracles, and such Doctrines upon
such occasions: And if all this <hi>Matter
of fact</hi> be true, tis impossible but
these Doctrines must be Divine, which
the Devil and wicked men so much Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and Blaspheme in the World. And
if these Doctrines are true, then all the
Promises of GOD are true, and there
is a large foundation of Eternal <hi>Hope</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Soul: because if all these
Preparations be not Eternally disgraced
by the feebleness of their End the Glory
and Felicity which is designed by them,
is infinite and Eternal.</p>
               <p>THAT all these Things are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for thy Benefit, thou mayst clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52038:139"/>
see, by thy very Power to see
them, and by the Natural Influence
which they have upon thy Estate
and condition. For tho it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by some succeeding Accident,
that thy Power to see and enjoy all
may be bereaved of its Objects, when
thine <hi>Interest</hi> is Eclipsed and forfeited
by thy Rebellion, and the <hi>Influence</hi> of
all may at last through thine own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
be <hi>ineffectual</hi> and <hi>Malevolent</hi> to
Thee; yet thou art assured by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of GOD, and of thy own Soul,
that it could not be intended Evil from
the Beginning; nay the very Order
and disposition of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
importeth the Design to be Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
and Glory. For all these Things
were written for our Admonition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom the Ends of the world are
come: And the Apostle expresly saith,
that <hi>whatsoever Things were written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4</note>
were written for our Learning,
that we through Patience and Comfort of
the Scriptures might have Hope.</hi> This
Hope maketh not ashamed, because the
Love of GOD is shed abroad in our
Hearts. We Delight in Beauty, and by
that very Inclination that we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52038:139"/>
it, are apt to Delight in any Thing
that is Amiable. We delight to see
the Order and Perfection of GODS
Ways, and GOD himself taketh Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in manifesting his Wisdome and
Goodness, for the Behoof of our Souls,
because he is Great in Bounty, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in Love by his very Essence: Nay
further we are every one Capable of
all the Benefit that accrueth thereby,
and by Nature fitted to celebrate his
Praises for all the Advantages that by
any of his Dispensations are imparted
to us, and have Liberty to improve
them all for the Acquisition of that
Glorious End to which we are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Nature of GOD, which is
hereby manifested to be Love to his
Creatures, is that which enableth thee
by this very means to honour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
him, and by so doing to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Kingdome, where he, that did
all these Things for a farther End, will
appear in Glory, and shew thee a
Perfection of Life and Bliss, that is
worthy of all this Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
being as great as thy Heart can
Wish or desire.</p>
               <p>HOPE is for its Extent and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52038:140"/>
vast and wonderful. All the
Honour, Advancement, Exaltation,
Glory, Treasure, and Delight, that is
concievable in Time or Eternity, may be
hoped, for: all that the Length, and
Breadth, and Depth, and Height, of
the Love of GOD, which passeth
Knowledge, is able to perform; All
that Ambition or Avarice can desire,
all that Appetite and Self-Love can
pursue, all that Fancy can imagine
Possibles and Delightful; Nay <hi>more then
we are able to ask or think;</hi> we are able
to desire, and aspire after (if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to us) the very throne of GOD,
and all the Joys of his Eternal Kingdom.
And the more Sublime its Objects are,
the more Eagerly &amp; violently does our
Hope pursue them, because there is more
Goodness in them to ravish our Desire.</p>
               <p>TO fall from the Height of ones
Hopes, where the Kingdome and
Glory was infinite, to which we aspire,
is to fall from the Height of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the Depth of Hell, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
a misery and Anxiety in the
Soul, an Indignation and Sorrow, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to all the Greatness of our
Objects, and the expectancies of our
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52038:140"/>
Hopes: Especially where the Hope is
<hi>Lively</hi> and <hi>Tender,</hi> and <hi>Strong,</hi> and <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>
of all it conceiveth.</p>
               <p>FOR it is the property of a true
and lively Hope to Elevate the Soul, to
the Height of its Object: tho dull and
drowzy Hopes make no Impression or
Alteration in the Mind. The Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it self with a kind of Pleasure in
its Wishes and in touching. The Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of such Goodnesses, as it proposes
to its self in its own Imagination. Love
and Beauty even in <hi>Romances</hi> are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful:
the very Dreams and <hi>Ideas</hi> of
the Perfections of Bliss, have a Pleasure
as well as their Reallity. The Desires
of it are something more Rich and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
then the fancy or Imagination: but
to Hope for such a Thing with a clear
and joyful expectation, is to grasp at its
fruition, with a faint Kind of Promise,
that it shall at last be ours. Had our
Hopes in <hi>Spiritual</hi> Things, as much
<hi>Sence</hi> as they have in <hi>Temporal,</hi> those
Beams of Assurance that enlighten our
Hope and fill it with Glory, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
a solid Strength into our Desire
and our pleasures would be so Great
that we should not exchange them for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52038:141"/>
all the Empires in the World. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it ascended so high as to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on infinite and Eternal Causes, and
the only fears that did chequer our
Hope, sprung from Nothing but the
Danger of being Wanting to our
selves. For who would think, That
when our Lives and Liberties are at
stake, we should be false to our selves,
that infinite Love and Power should be
tendered to us, infinite Beauty and
Goodness be before us, infinite Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Pleasure be offered us, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Delights, inestimable Riches, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
flourishing Joys, an infinite Empire
be without fraud attainable, and we be
so Treacherous and false to our selves,
as to fleight it all! It is an Absurdity so
incredible, that we should lose all these,
Enjoyments by our own Default, and
bare Remissness that we shall hate our
selves Eternally if we lose so fair an
Advantage. Yet this is our Case, we
daily do that which in point of Reason
is impossible to be done, and for doing
which we judge our selves Guilty of
Eternal Tortures. All the Misery that
is lodged in infinite Despair has comfort
and refreshment answerable to it in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52038:141"/>
Hope. 'Tis the present food and
Support of our Lives, 'tis the Anchor of
our Souls in the midst of all the Storms
and Tempests in the World,'tis the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste
of Bliss and Coelestial Glory, a
Glympse and Appearence of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Vision, without which to Live is to
Dye, and to Dye is to perish for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>THE Great Reason for which a
right Hope is accounted so Great a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
is because its Objects do really
surpass all Imagination. The fulness of
the GODHEAD in the Soul of
Man, the Perfection of the Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
a Transformation for Glory, to
Glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord, Communion with the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost, infinite Love and
Bounty, the Estate of a Bride in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with GOD the Possession of
his Throne, with another Kind of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
then the Bridegroom, himself enjoys,
the Resurrection of the Body, and Life
Eternal, in a Kingdome where all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Tears and Fears shall ever be
removed, Where all Regions, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and Spaces, and Times, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities,
shall be before our Eys,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52038:142"/>
and all Objects in all Worlds at once
Visible, and infinitely Rich, and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and <hi>Ours</hi>! Our very Appetites also
being ravished with Sensible Pleasures in
all our Members, not inconsistent with,
but springing from these high and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Delights, not distracting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
our Spiritual Joys, but pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Superadded, and increasing the same;
while our Bodies <hi>are made like to his
most Glorious Body, by that Almighty
Power whereby he is able to subdue All
Things to himself,</hi> all these infuse their
Value; and the Hope that is exercised
about these Things is a Vertue so great,
that all inferior Hopes, which this doth
Sanctifie, are made Vertues by it, but
without this all other Hopes are Debase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Abuses of the Soul, meer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
and delusions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Vices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Know very well that Presumption
and Despair are generally accounted
the Extreams of Hope, and the only
vices that are Opposite thereunto.
But I Know as well, that there may be
many Kinds and Degrees of Hope, of
which so me may be <hi>vicious,</hi> and some
<hi>Vertuous</hi>: and that some sorts of Hope
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52038:142"/>
themselves are Vices. When ever we
make an inferior Desire the Sovereign
Object of our Hope, our Hope is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Idolatrous and Atheistical.
We forget GOD, and magnifie an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Object above all that is Divine.
To Sacrifice all our <hi>Hopes</hi> to Things
unworthy of them, or to be Remiss and
sluggish in <hi>Hoping</hi> for Things of infinite
Importance, is apparently <hi>Vicious</hi>: But
to be just to all our Encouragements,
and to lift up our Eys to the Eternal
GOD, with an humble Expectation;
to wait upon him, and to hope for all
that from his Bounty, which his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
has promised, to desire the most
high and perfect <hi>Proofs</hi> of his Love, is
the Property of a most Great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Soul, by which it is carried above
all the World, and fitted for the Life of
the most high and perfect Vertue.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Repentance. Its Original, its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is a Purgative Vertue. Its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
its Excellencies. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that sorrow which is due to Sin
is intollerable to Sense, confessed by
Reason, and dispensed with by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>REPENTANCE is a Sowre and
austere Kind of Vertue, that was
not created nor intended by GOD,
but introduced by Sin, made fair by
Mercy, in remitting the offence, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
the Sin. It is a Strange Kind
of off-spring, which flows from Parents
so infinitely different, and has a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in its Nature, answerable to either
an <hi>Evil</hi> which it derives from <hi>Sin,</hi> and a
<hi>Goodness</hi> which flows from <hi>Mercy.</hi> Its
Evil is that of Sorrow, Indignation and
Shame, Its Goodness is the usefulness,
and necessity of the thing, considering
the Condition we are now in. It is
highly ingrateful to Sence, but transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
convenient and amiable to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:52038:143"/>
for it is impossible for him that has
once been defiled with sin, ever to be
cleansed, or to live after in a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
manner, unless he be so ingenious
as to lament his Crime, as to loath,
acknowledge, and detest his Error.</p>
               <p>THE Union of the Soul and Body
is mysterious, but that Sin and Mercy
should be united, as Causes so infinitely
different, for the production of a Child
so Black and so Beautiful, is the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Wonder which the Soul can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
on this side Heaven; and will
continue to be remembred for ever, and
appear more Wonderful than before
when the perfect Disparity and Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between them is clearly seen, in the
Light of Glory.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Efficient Cause</hi> of Repentance
is either Remote, or Immediate: Its
immediate Efficient Cause is the Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inclination, or the Will of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
its remote Efficient is GOD,
the Father of Lights from which every
Good and Perfect Gift descended. Its
<hi>Material Cause</hi> is Sorrow. Its <hi>Formal
Cause,</hi> which makes it a Vertue, is the
Reason and Manner of that Sorrow,
the Equity and Piety wherewith it is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52038:144"/>
attended, containing many ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
in its Nature too long a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to be described here. Its <hi>Final Cause</hi>
is either immediate, or ultimate, the
first is Amendment, the last Salvation.</p>
               <p>BEING thus bounded by its
Causes, its Definition is Easie, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is a Grace, or Christian Vertue,
wherein a man confesses, hates and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes
his Sin, with Grief that he hath
been Guilty of it, and purposes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of Life in Order to His
Peace and Reconciliation with GOD,
that he may answer the Obligations
that lye upon him, discharge his Duty,
lay hold on the Advantages of GODS
Mercy, escape everlasting Damnation,
and be made a Partaker of Eternal
Glory.</p>
               <p>AMONG the Vertues some are
<hi>Purgative,</hi> and some are <hi>Perfective.</hi>
The Purgative Vertues are all Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
to Bliss, and are occasioned only
by the Disorder of the Soul: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
are Essential to our formal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and Eternally necessary by the
Law of Nature. Repentance is not in
its own Nature, (If Simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
considered) necessary to Bliss:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52038:144"/>
But, in Relation to Sinners, it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
as Physick to the Recovery of
Health, or as the <hi>Change</hi> it self is, by
which we pass from the Distemper we
are Sick of, to the right and Sound E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
which we had lost by the Disease.
As the malady is accidental, so is the
Cure. For the Nature of Man may be
<hi>well,</hi> and perfect, without either this, or
the other. He that is originally pure,
has no need of a Purgative Vertue;
but he that is faln defiled musts needs
rise, and wash away the filth, before he
can be clean.</p>
               <p>FOR this Cause, even among the
Heathens themselves, the more Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Learned have a Conscience of
Sin; their Priests and Philosophers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
several Rites and Manners of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
which they taught, and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on their Disciples with much Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Ceremony, in order to their
Reception. Nor was there any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or Religion in the World, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not something to Diviner My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries:
Which were graced &amp; beautified
with Preparatory Washings, Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Fashions, Attirs, Watchings, Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Shavings, Sprinklings, Anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52038:145"/>
Consecrations, Sacrifices, or
some other Disciplines like unto these,
to be endured and past thorow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Votaries could be admitted
to their mysteries. All which Rites
as they made a great shew, because
they were sensible, so were they apt
to put a magnificent face on their
Religion to dispose the Persons <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised</hi>
by them to a more complying
Obedience, and to beget a Reverence
mixt with Awful Admiration in their
ignorant Spectators. All which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
were but <hi>Emblematical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
signifying something invisible
that was necessary to be done, of
which the Priests themselves knew
not the meaning. They had the name
of <hi>Paenitentia</hi> in their Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
but applied it to profane
and Trivial occasions: But <hi>Repentance</hi>
in Religion, which is the Soul and
substance of those mystical Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
a broken and Contrite Heart,
an internal Sorrow for their sin, was
a thing unknown; so that all their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
how magnificent soever,
were but Empty shells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>REPENTANCE</hi> alone though
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52038:145"/>
never so simple and short in its name,
being of such value, that GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
one contrite Groan above all the
Ceremonies, even of his own Law.
And therefore he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou desirest
not sacrifice else would I give it; thou
delightest not in Burnt offering. The
Sacrifices of GOD are a Broken Spirit:
A broken and a contrite Heart, O God,
thou wilt not despise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR tho Repentance be not in it
selfe a desirable Vertue, nor so much
as a <hi>Vertue,</hi> till there be a sphere and
Occasion for it, wherein to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
tho Repentance in it selfe be
far worse then obedience, yet upon the
Account of our Saviours Merits, and
GODS Love to Sinners, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
above the Greatest Innocency
and Purity whatsoever. For <hi>there is
more Joy in Heaven over one sinner that
repenteth, then over Ninety and nine
Just persons that need no Repentance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</note>
If the Soul be of greater value than
the whole World, if the loss of any
Thing we esteem, increaseth the sence
of its excellency; if our Saviour just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and rationally compareth himself to
a Shepheard, that leaveth Ninety and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52038:146"/>
nine sheep in the wilderness, to seek
one that is gone astray; if he rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
when he hath found it, more for
that one that was lost, then for the
ninety and nine which he had in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
if his Delight in the success of his
Labours be answerable to their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
if the frustration of all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and painful endeavours in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, be infinitely Grievious; and
the Vertues more Amiable and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
which sinners exercise after
their Redemption; if their Love, and
their joy, and their praise be increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the extreamity of their Distress
and the multitude of the sins that are
forgiven them; if their Communion
with GOD be more sweet, and
their Happiness more exalted, and
the Kingdom of GOD it selfe made
more sublime and Glorious thereby;
<hi>Repentance</hi> hath something more in it
then Perfection had before the fall, and
as sinners have made themselves more
infinitly Indebted, so are they infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more subject to the Arbitrary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of Almighty Power, infinitly more
Capable of Obligations and Rewards,
infinitely more Obliged for Pardon and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52038:146"/>
deliverance, as well as infinitly more
Obnoxious to Divine Justice, their
Fear and Danger is infinitly Greater,
they stand in need of infinite Grace,
and Mercy, which when they receive
and enjoy, their Love and Gratitude
are proportionably greater, their
Delights are more quick, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
and full, and so are their
praises.</p>
               <p>BUT before a sinner can atchieve
all this, or GOD enjoy the fruit of
his Salvation, he must needs <hi>repent,</hi>
for Repentance is the true and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Preparation of the Soul, the
only Purgative Vertue, by which it
is fitted for these Divine Attainments.
It is, we confess in outward Appearance
a slight invisible Act, but as Great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as Wide and Comprehensive as
the Heavens. It receiveth the Vertue
of the Divine Essence of the whole
Creation, of infinite Mercy, of the
Blood of Christ, of his Humiliation,
Merit, Exaltation, Intercession, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of all the Work of Redemption
into it self; and having fed it self, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
them, it receiveth strength by the
Influence of these to dispence all their
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52038:147"/>
Vertue again, in the Production of
those Fruits, for the sake of which
GOD hath filled all the World with
miracles, the Verdure, and Maturity,
and Perfection of which shall with
their beauty and sweetness continue in
life and Florish for ever.</p>
               <p>IF we respect Man alone, and the
things that are done in himself by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
it seemeth a Vertue of infinite
value: It divests him of all his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
Pride, and vain Glory, strips him
of all his Lust and Impiety, purges
him of all his corruption, Anger, and
Malice, pares off all his Superfluities,
and excesses, cleanseth his Soul of all its
filthiness and pollution, removeth all
that is so infinitly Odious to GOD,
and makes him amiable and Beautiful
to the holy Angels. It sits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
him for all the exercises of Grace
and Piety, introduces Humility and
Obedience into his Soul, makes him
capable of a Divine Knowledge, and
makes way for the Beauty of his Love
and Gratitude, inspires Fortitude, and
Prudence, and Temperance, and Justice
into his soul; renues his Nature, and
makes <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im a meek and patient Person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52038:147"/>
him to that Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he had lost, cloaths him with right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and true Holiness, and seats
him again in the Favour of GOD.
By Repentance he recovers the Divine
Image, and by Consequence it extends
to all that Blessedness and Glory which
is for ever to be enjoyed.</p>
               <p>REPENTANCE is the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that Life, wherein all the sweat
Labour of the Martyrs, all the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Endeavours of the Apostles,
all the Revelations of the Prophets, all
the examples of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> all the
Miracles of old Time, all the Mysteries
of the Law, all the Means of Grace,
all the Verities of the Gospel begin to
take full force and Effect, in obtaining
that for which they were intended.
Which sufficiently intimates the value
of the Grace, and how highly well
pleasing it must be to GOD: It is the
<hi>Conception</hi> of Felicity, and the <hi>New
Birth</hi> of the <hi>Inward Man</hi> the Dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Old, and the Assumption
of a New, and more coelestial Nature.
It is the Gate of the Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which they that refuse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at, can never enjoy. It is one of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52038:148"/>
the Keys of Death and Hell, by
which the Gate of the Prison is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockt,
nay the very knocking off the
Chains, and Manacles of Satan; the
very Act wherein we regain our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and become the Sons of GOD,
and Citizens of Heaven; It was fitly
Typisied in the old Law, by the Laver
that was set at the Door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
for the Priests to wash in, before
they entred into the Sanctuary, to walk
in the Light of the Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
to offer their Devotions at the
the Incense Altar, and to partake of the
shew bread on the Golden Table. In
the Outward Court they enjoyed the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of the visible Church, the sight of
the Bloody Altar, (which answers out
Saviors Cross erected in the World)
and the Benefit of their Outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
which consisted in their Admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Visible Ordinances, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Rites of Religion: But that
Court was open over head, obnoxions
to showers, in Token that a bare <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
is not Enough to shelter us from
the Dangers and Incommodities that
may be rained down in Judgments
upon us from the wrath of GOD:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52038:148"/>
whence the face of Heaven is overcast
with Clouds, and Covered with black
and Heavy Displeasure, till we wash
and be clean, and enter by penitence
into the Invisible Church, of which the
<hi>Second Court</hi> is a Figure, wherein we are
illuminated by the Holy Ghost, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up the sweet Perfumes of our
Thanksgivings and Praises; being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to feed upon the Heavenly Feast
represented by the Shew-bread. Table;
we are never received into the Society
of the Saints and Angels, bainted out in
the <hi>Cheruhims</hi> and <hi>Palm Trees</hi> round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
on the inside of its <hi>Walls,</hi> nor
Covered over head with a vail to
protect us: A vail of <hi>Blew</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the inferior Heaven, wherein
<hi>Cherubims</hi> were interwoven to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the <hi>Angels</hi> looking down upon us,
a vail of <hi>Goats-hair</hi> concealed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
above that of Blew, to signifie
the fruits of our Saviour Life, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Rams-skins</hi> died <hi>Red,</hi> to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Blood of Christ, by which we
are secured from all the Displeasure
which otherwise for Sin, was due
to us. The Goats hair fitly resembles the
Active Obedience, or the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52038:149"/>
of Christ; for as much as <hi>Hair</hi>
may be clipped off, and a Covering
made of it, while the Beast is <hi>alive:</hi>
For so might Christ have been perfectly
Righteous, tho his Life had never been
Taken away: But <hi>red</hi> is the Color
of <hi>blood,</hi> the <hi>Skin</hi> importeth Death for
as much as it cannot be fleyed off, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the destruction of the Creature.
These vails therefore as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the other, were of higher and
more mysterious importance: And
spread over the inclosed, and invisible
Court, into which none but <hi>Priests</hi> and
<hi>Levites</hi> entered, that <hi>washed</hi> at the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
to intimate the security only of
those, that are washed in the Laver of
Regeneration, and make <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Priests</hi> unto God, being purged from
their old sins, and sanctified and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
in a secret Spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
For as they only that tarried in
their Houses, were under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Paschal Lamb,</hi> whose <hi>Blood</hi>
was sprinkled on the <hi>Lintils</hi> of their
<hi>Gates</hi> and <hi>Doors,</hi> when the destroying
Angel past through the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi>
to kill the First-born of Man and Beast:
So onely they that keep within the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52038:149"/>
                  <hi>Pale</hi> of the <hi>Invisible Church,</hi> are under
the <hi>Shaddow</hi> of the Almighty, because
they only dwell in the secret place of
the most High, and they alone are under
the Coverture of that Powerful <hi>Blood,</hi>
which speaketh better things than the
Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> but pleads for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of them onely, that repent
and believe, and is therefore effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
spread over the <hi>Invisible Church</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Which in another Type is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the mixture of the <hi>Blood</hi> and
<hi>Oyl,</hi> which was sprinkled upon the
Priests and Lepers that were cleansed:
<hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> moving
alwayes together hand in hand, the
Unction of the Holy One, or the Oyl
of Love and Gladness annointing all
those that are washed, and only those
are washed in clean and pure water,
they alone being effectually sprinkled
with the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ <hi>who of GOD is
made unto us Wisdome, and Righteousness,
and Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR if God should take Pleasure
in us before we were <hi>pure,</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
would be <hi>false,</hi> and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
unrighteous. Till we are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to him we can never be <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:52038:150"/>
nor <hi>Glorious</hi> before him: Nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be pleasing to that <hi>Goodness,</hi> which
is indelible (tho latent) in our <hi>own</hi>
Souls, till we feel our selves clean and
Beautiful.</p>
               <p>IF any thing in the World can
commend the value of Repentance, or
discover the infinite use and necessity
of it, this will certainly be a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
Effectual: That tho GOD
love us with an infinite and eternal
Love, tho he magnifies his Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
over all our Deservings, tho
Jesus Christ loved us so, as to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
himself in our places, tho he made
infinite satisfaction to the Justice of
God for our Sins, tho the Holy
Ghost came down from Heaven for
our sakes, may tho we ourselves were
taken up into Heaven, all this would
he of little avail, and we should quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be tumbled down again, if only Sin
were Delightful to us, and our Wills
so obstinate, that there was no place
for Repentance in our Hearts, no sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
nor Contrition for the Offences
we had committed. It is not the Love
of GOD to us, so much as our love
to him, that maketh Heaven. It may
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52038:150"/>
surprize you perhaps, but shall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instruct you, for the Love of GOD
may be infinite, yet if it be unseen, breed
no delight in the Soul: if it be sleighted
and despised, it shall increase our
Cuilt, Shame, and Deformity, and make
us the more Odious, which it must
needs do, when we are impenitent.
For so long, it is manifest that we
are neither <hi>Sensible</hi> of his Love, nor
<hi>Just</hi> unto it. The taste of its sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Pleasure we take in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Love, is the <hi>Life</hi> of Blessedness,
and the <hi>Soul</hi> of Heaven. It is the <hi>Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
of our Love and His, when they
meet together, that maketh Heaven.</p>
               <p>HERE upon Earth we ought actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to grieve, and repent for our Sins:
—But should GOD require a measure
in our <hi>Grief</hi> answerable to its Causes,
our Repentance it self would be an
<hi>Hell</hi> unto us: For the Grief would be
Endless and insupportable. Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
requires that we should be <hi>infinitely</hi>
afflicted for the infinite folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Sin. But the Mercy of GOD
dispenseth with our Grief so far, that it
takes off the <hi>Pain,</hi> which its <hi>infinit<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Measure</hi> would inflict upon our sense,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52038:151"/>
and accepts of an Acknowledgement
made by our Reason that it ought to be
infinite, if strict Justice were exacted
at our Hands. Our intention is (in
the Course of Reason,) to be infinitely
and Eternally grieved for the Baseness
of the Act, and the Vileness we have
contracted, and so we should be, d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
its Effects continue and abide forever;
for then we should be hated of GOD
and become his Enemies World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
End. But the Removal of that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and the infinite Mercy whereby
we are forgiven, hath a kindly Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the Soul of every <hi>Penitent,</hi>
and the Joy it infuseth restrains and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the Excess of our Sorrow, it leaves
the Intension of Grief, and its inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Mind, yet stops the persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and relieves our Reason, by divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the stream of its Operations and
Exercises; it engageth its actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
upon other Objects, which
turn it all into Love and Adoration,
Praise and Thanksgiving, Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.
For the Love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
after our fall, and the Felicity to
which we are called out of the Depth
of our misery all the Advantages we
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52038:151"/>
receive upon our Redemption, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
of our miserable Estate the
Degrees and Ornaments that are added
to the Beauty and perfection of Gods
Kingdome upon so sad an occasion as
Sin is, all these things take up our
Thoughts in such a manner that while
we are actually and fully Just to these,
and Loving GOD, for his Eternal
Love, infinitely more than we Love our
selves, we live in him, and are all in
raptures of Blesseduess. yet is there a
<hi>Vertual Sorrow</hi> which Reason conceives
as most due to Sin, which being expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
only in the Humility of our Souls,
and seen as it were underneath the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Joys, in the lowly Conceit
we retain of our selves (in the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our vileness and the deep Sence of
our own unworthiness;) is far Greater,
now we are restored to the favour and
Love of GOD, far sweeter to be seen,
and deeper to be understood; than the
Grief for Sin would have been, had we
been not redeemed, but Damned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Charity towards GOD. It Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
Repentance, makes it a Vertue,
and turns it to a Part of our true
Felicity. Our Love to all other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is to begin and End in GOD.
Our Love of GOD hath an Excellency
in it that makes it worthy to be desired
by his Eternal Majesty. He is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Supreme and Perfect friend. By
Loving we enjoy him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>REPENTANCE without Love
is so far from seating us in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of Heaven, that it is one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of the Torments in Hell, a
natural Effect of Sin, and a great Part
of the Misery of Devils. Love is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Affection of the Soul, and so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
Sweet, when it is Satisfied and
pleased, that it communicates the Relish
of its own <hi>Delightfulness</hi> to every Thing
near it, and Transformes the most <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulent</hi>
Affections into <hi>Smooth,</hi> Healing,
<hi>Perfective</hi> Pleasures. Insomuch that in
Heaven our Sorrow for Sin shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52038:152"/>
be infinite, yet the malignity of it
so perfectly correctd, that tho we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
Eternally <hi>Just,</hi> in rendring our Sins
that grief which is their due, it shall
not discompose our peace, norcorrode
our Delighs, but increase our Repose
in the Beauty of our souls, and make
our Joys more full of Extasie, by those
Melting, Lively, Bleeding, Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which our Love will occasion
in the very Grief; where with it perfects
our Felicity. For as the falling out of
Lovers is the Renewing of Love, so is
the Mercy and Kindness of the one, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of him that was injured; and
the calm and secure Indignation
wherewith the other hates himself for
being guilty of so vile a miscarriage,
the very Grace and Beauty of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation;
it is a great means of their
mutual Endearment and Tenderness e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after:
the Compassion of him that is
Innocent, and the humble grief of the
Guilty making the Joy of their future
Correspondence more Deep and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
more Vigorous and Enflaming,
more lasting.</p>
               <p>LOVE is that which Sanctifies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and makes it pleasant both to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52038:153"/>
him that is Beloved, and to him that is
adored; Acceptable and Delightful to
him that repenteth, as well as to him
that had been injured. For the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Restauration makes it as <hi>Natural</hi> to
grieve for his <hi>Fault</hi> as to rejoyce in his
<hi>Felicity,</hi> his fad and humble Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are his own Satisfaction, because
he sees himself <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> in them
he delighs in his Sorrow, because it is
<hi>Honourable,</hi> and finds a new Kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in his <hi>Abasement,</hi> because it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by the Wonder of his Happy
condition; and what he hath lost in
himself is regained in the pefection and
Goodness of his Object.</p>
               <p>THAT GOD is the sovereign
Object of Love I scarcely need to
mention; all I shall observe upon this
occasion, is; that we are more to Love
him for his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compassion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us as <hi>Sinners,</hi> then for his
<hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> expressed at the
first, as we were <hi>Innocent Creatures.</hi>
The Bleeding Spectacle of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate</hi>
Deity, and the Perseverance of
his Miraculous and <hi>Transcendent</hi> Love
after all our Offences, is another Kind
of Motive to heighten our Charity
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52038:153"/>
of, and gives it another form, as much
more Mysterious, so much more perfect
and Delightful then ever. Our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for Sin infuses a New <hi>Sense</hi> into
Nature, a New Beauty into Love, and
gives as much unto it, as it receiveth
from it. But this being better known
by Experience, then by description I
shall refer you to the Life of Heaven
and Grace, for more ample satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>LOVE, as we have shewed, may
be extended to all Objects in Heaven
and Earth; all that is Goodly and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
being capable of that Affection.
Hereupon the Word <hi>Love</hi> is generally
used for that Liking and Esteem we
have for any thing, whether <hi>Dead</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</hi>
We can Love Life, and desire to
see Good Days; we can Love the Sun,
and Wine, and Oyl, and Gold; Love
our Dogs and Horses, fine Clothes and
Jewels, Pleasures, Honours, Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Houses, Riches, and as well as
Love Men and Women, Souls and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
And evermore our Love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it self in Tenderness and Care
for the Preservation of what we Love,
in Esteem of its Worth, and Delight in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52038:154"/>
its Beauty, in endeavours also to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
its Welfare as far as it is capable.
But there is another sort of Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Living Objects,</hi> Divine and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
which we call <hi>Charity.</hi> This is that
Vertue of which the Apostle saith, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had spoken of all the Miracles,
Helps, Governments, Prophesies,
Tongues, and other Gifts of the Holy
Ghost, that were then in the Church)
<hi>And Yet shew I unto you a more Excellent
Way. 1 Cor. 12.</hi> ult.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13 1.</note> And in the next
Chapter. <hi>Tho I speak with the Tongues of
Men and of Angels, and have not Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I am become as sounding Brass, or a
tinkling Cymbal. And tho I have the
Gift of Prophesie, and understand all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and all Knowledge, and tho I have
all Faith, so that I could remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and have no Charity, I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and tho I bestow all my Goods to
feed the poor, and tho I give my Body to
be burned, and have not Charity it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
me nothing.</hi> It is that concerning
which our Saviour Speaketh, <hi>The
first of all the commandements is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 12. 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Hear
O Israel, the Lord our GOD is one Lord,
and thou shalt Love the Lord thy GOD
with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52038:154"/>
and with all thy Mind, and with all thy
Strength: This is the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And the Second is like, namely
this, Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thy
self: There is none other Commandement
greater then those.</hi> Nay perhaps it is that
of which he saith to his Apostles, when
they had admired at his Miracles. <hi>He
that believeth on me, the works that I do
shall he do also, and greater Works then
these shall he do, because I go to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
For Faith worketh by Love,
Love is the Life of Faith, and without
the Works of the one the other is Dead:
The Works of Love are the End of all
Miracles, and more Blessed then they.
Nay Love is the End of <hi>Faith</hi> as well as
it is of the <hi>Law</hi>: for the Apostle saith,
<hi>The End of the Commandment it Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
out of a pure Heart, and of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and of Faith unfeigned.</hi> It is
the End of the very Creation of the
World, of all Gods Labors and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
of all his Ways in all Ages, all
the faculties and powers of the Soul, the
very End of the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the End of the Jewish Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
under the Law, the End of all the
Dispensations of Grace and Mercy under
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52038:155"/>
the Gospel; the End of our Saviours
coming down into the World, the
End of all his Miracles, Tears, and
Blood, the End of the Holy Ghosts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
upon Earth, the End of all the
Means of Grace, and in some sort the
very last End of all Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
whatsoever. The everlasting
Continuance of this Love is the End of
Eternity it self in a manner, and if our
Love be not the End of GODS Love,
his is of ours. And if the Truth be
deeply inquired into, the <hi>Intermixture</hi>
is so sweet, that his is the End of ours,
ours of his. For he Loveth us with
the Love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> that we may
Love him; and he desires to be belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of us, that he may Love us, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Kind of Love, distinct from
the former, even that of <hi>Complacency.</hi>
Which Love of Complacency is the
Crown of ours, and so Delightful to
us, that it is the very End of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and begetteth in us a new Love of
Complacency fitly answering his unto
us.</p>
               <p>NOW if Love be the End of all
the laws, Works, and Ways of GOD,
of all our Saviours Labours and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52038:155"/>
of our souls and Bodies, of the
whole Creation, of all the Endeavours
and Desires of the Deity, in all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
of his Grace and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
there must be something in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Equivalent to all these Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Undertakings, to justifie the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
that selected Love for its Sovereign
Object, for it is the office of Wisdome to
suit the means and their End together,
so that the Excellency of the one may
be worthy of all the Cost and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the other. For it is a foolish
thing to pursue a base and feeble End
by Glorious and Wonderful Methods,
because its Vileness will Disgrace the
Design, and with it their Beauty, their
very Grandure will be absurd, where
their Issue is but contemptible. The
Apostle therefore telleth us that <hi>Love is
the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> and that it is
<hi>the Bond of Perfectness.</hi> And pursuing
its properties a little more Ample, he
saith, <hi>Charity suffereth long, and is kind,
Charity envyeth not, Charity Vaunteth
not it self, is not puffed up, doth not behave
it self unseemly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>seeketh not her own, is
not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52038:156"/>
the Truth, beareth all Things, believeth
all things, hopeth all things, endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things. Charity never faileth,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>IT is one noble Effect of Charity, that
it suffereth afflictions cheerfully and
patiently for the sake of its Beloved:
Another is its Kindness to its Object;
its sweet and Courteous inclination to
do all manner of Good: Another, for
which it is highly valuable, is, that it
envieth not the Felicity or Glory of
its Beloved but taketh Pleasure to
see it far higher and greater then its
own: is not apt to vaunt and brag
of its Perfections, but hath an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Esteem of all its Atchievments:
doth not behave it self in distasteful
manner, but studies and designes the
Honour Benefit and satisfaction of its
Object. But that which of all other
is its greatest Perfection, is, that <hi>it
seeketh not its own</hi>: it is not Mercenary
or self ended, but truly Generous and
Heroick in its Performances. It Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
it self, and all its interests, to the
Advantage of its Object; it prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the person it Loveth above it self,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52038:156"/>
desires its Exhaltation, and delights in
its Glory more then its own, It <hi>is not
easily provoked,</hi> because it puts the best
sence upon all that is done by its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<hi>Thinketh no evil,</hi> is not suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or malevolent, or censorious, but
frameth honourable and fair <hi>Ideas</hi> of
all that is thought or done by its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved:
Hateth all Impurity that may
displease its Object, all black and
crooked Apprehensions, that may
wrang and disguise it; <hi>beareth all</hi> with
Hope and Equanimity, because it <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth</hi>
its Object to be Good, and
Wise, till it must of necessity change
its Opinion, and entertain a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
tending to its condemnation.
It is no longer Charity then, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and aversion, when it ceaseth to
think well of its Object: for it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Principle</hi> or distinct in Nature
from <hi>Love,</hi> as its Actions are from the
Actions of Love; the diversity of the
Effects evidently proving a Difference
in their Causes.</p>
               <p>THE Quality, by which Charity
<hi>rejoyceth in the Truth,</hi> is an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
excellence and commendation of
its Nature. Because the Truth is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52038:157"/>
GODS infinite Goodness, and Love,
and Providence, which are exercised
in preparing Delights and Treasures
for his Beloved. The truth is the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
and Glory of the Soul. And if
it be <hi>true</hi> that all Eternity is full of
Joys, and all the World enriched with
Delights, that a man is infinitely belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of GOD, and made in his Image
on purpose, that he might enjoy all
the Best of all possible Treasures in his
similitude, he may well <hi>rejoyce in the
Truth</hi>: because no Truth can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or more delightful, than that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is exalted to the Throne of GOD,
and ordained to live in Communion
with him.</p>
               <p>BUT that Quality, by which the
Soul <hi>believeth,</hi> and <hi>hopeth all things,</hi>
that concern the Honour and Fidelity
of its Beloved, is yet more acceptable
and delightful than the former. For
a good opinion of the Nature and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Person with whom we
are united, is the <hi>Basis</hi> and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all our Respect, the Cement of
our Peace, and the Life and Soul of
all that Honour that is paid unto him.
The very Grace and Beauty of all our
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52038:157"/>
Conversation dependeth upon it, and
if it be true, that we are more to love
GOD for the intrinsick Perfections
of his Essence, then for all his Gifts,
the chief Business of our Knowledge is
to Frame glorious Apprehensions of
his Nature, and to Believe him in all
things so Kind and Wise, that he is True
and Faithful in all his Declarations,
and most fit to be Honoured in all the
Dispensations of his Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is ever mindful of his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
and Promises. For then we
can believe, that all things shall work
together for our Good, can safely
trust our selves, and all that is ours in
his hands; resign our selves up to his
Disposal with Joy, and say <hi>Thy Will be
done,</hi> for it is <hi>Holy, Good, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>?
Thy Will alone is of all other
Wilis most Perfect and Desirable.
There are on Earth indeed more nice
Emergencies, many Obscurities and
Riddles, in the midst of all which to
think so well of GOD as he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
is the most acceptable thing in
the World; for it argues a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of his Worth, and a Love that is
founded on <hi>Substantial Causes</hi> never to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52038:158"/>
be removed. It feedeth the Soul with
a lively hope, and fair Expectation of
great Things from him: by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
we do right to His GODHEAD,
in acknowledging the Perfection of his
Love and Goodness, and by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
we are made able to adore him
and to live in Union and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him.</p>
               <p>THERE is great Talk of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
it is accounted the only Pleasure,
in the World; Its Offices are highly
magnified of all: Kindness of Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
a through and clear communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls, a secure Reliance upon
each others Fidelity, a perfect Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of all our Thoughts, Intentions,
and Resentments, an ardent willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to impart Lives and Estate for the
Benefit of our Friend, the Reposing
of all our Secrets in each others Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes,
to do all services, and suffer
all afflictions, for each others sakes, to
prefer the Concerns of our Friend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occasions above our own, these
are the <hi>Magnalia Amicitiae, &amp; Arcana
mutuae Benevolentiae,</hi> the Great and
mighty Effects for which Friendship is
admired: But all these, without a good
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52038:158"/>
Opinion of our Friend, are nothing
worth, they are but Externals of
Friendship, the greatest Secret in its
Nature is, the mutual agreement of
Souls and Spirits, the Delight which
either taketh in the other, the honour
and esteem they give and receive, the
Approbation and Love of each others
Dispositions, the Sence and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of each others Vertues, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Desire of being alwayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
peculiar Extasie, which the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of either occasioneth in the other,
when of all other Treasures in the
World their Persons are the greatest to
one another. Either is the proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and <hi>Refrigerium</hi> of the others
Soul. Their Bosomes are the mutual
Receptacles and Temples of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
accomplishments, whereinto they
are received in all their Desert, and
have <hi>Justice</hi> done to every degree and
Perfection in their Nature; their Hearts
are the Thrones where they are exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and magnified, and live at Ease,
are honoured and worshipped, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and reign as absolute in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Souls. There are some slight
aims and Adumbrations of this Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52038:159"/>
on Earth; but the best and highest
Degree of it here beneath is but a rude
and imperfect shadow, only GOD is
the <hi>Sovereign friend,</hi> all Adoration
paid to any one beside is meer Idolatry.
Our Hearts can be absolutely Sacrificed
to none, but him; because he alone is
immutable in Goodness. We cannot
infinitely honour and delight in any
but Him, it is he alone that can infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
honour, and delight in us.
All our Lives, Estates, and Services
are Due to him, his Will alone is
to be wholly ours, because no other
Will is infallibly Right, Wise, Holy,
but his alone.</p>
               <p>THE Union of our Wills is a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Love: but that at which he aimeth
by all his Labours, and Gifts, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
is our Right and Good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Excellencies and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
That we should see and discern
his interior Properties, admire his
Graces, adore his Perfections, adore
and magnifie his Beauty and Glory,
this is the End for which he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
himself in all his Works and
Ways unto us; it is the End of the
Whole Creation, and of all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52038:159"/>
Things in the universe: for by
this he establisheth his Empire in our
souls and makes us Pleasing to himself in
all our Operations. And for this Cause
it is, that the Apostle plainly tells us
that tho we give our Body to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all our Goods to feed the
poor, without Charity it profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
To render to GOD the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that is due to his Name, to receive
and admire all his Bounties, to rejoyce
in all his Operations, to adore him in
all his Ways, to take pleasure in all
his Works, to fill Heaven and Earth
with our Joys and Praises, is a Work
which cannot but be agreeable by its
Nature, to his Eternal Essence. And
if this be the Work of Love, it is that
which is most Excellent, because he is
therein both pleased and enjoyed.
GOD and all his Creatures are united
together by Love alone, and in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Exercise of pure and perfect Love
all Blessedness and Glory consisteth.</p>
               <p>IF you require what it is to love GOD,
you will find it worthy of his Highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
because thereby all our souls, nay all
his Creatures, and his whole Kingdome
are perfected, for to Love GOD as we
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:52038:160"/>
ought to do, is to Honour him as our
Father, Benefactor, Bridegroom, and
King, to contemplate him as our Cause
with Complacency, and to rest in him
as our End, to delight in him as our
Creator, Preserver, Lawgiver, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
to dedicate our selves, wholly
to that Service, whatever it be, wherein
he is chiefly pleased and delighted. It
is to love him in himself, in all his
Works, in all his Ways, in all his Laws,
in all his Attributes, in all his Thoughts
and Counsels, in all his Perfections; It
implies the Knowledge of all Objects,
the Use of all Means, the Attainment of
all Ends; all Wisdome and Goodness,
all Obedience and Gratitude, all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Holiness, all Joy and
Praise, all Honour and Esteem, all
Blessedness and Glory. For it is to
Love him with all our Heart, and with
all our Soul, with all our Strength, and
with all our Might, with all our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
with all our Will, with
all our Affection, with all the Powers
of our soul, with all our Inclinations
and Faculties in all his Creatures, in all
his Appearances, in Heaven and Earth,
in Angels and Men, in all Kingdoms
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52038:160"/>
and Ages. It is to see and desire, to
Esteem and delight in his Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Eternity, and in every Thing
by which he manifesteth himself in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these, so that all Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Greatness, and Light, and
Perfection, and Beauty, and Pleasure,
are founded in it, and to Love him to
Perfection implies all Learning and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
because we must necessarily
be acquainted with all Things in all
Worlds, before we can thorowly and
compleatly do it. Which here upon
Earth to do by Inclination and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to the utmost of our Power, is all
that is required of us; And if we do it
to our utmost, it shall be rewarded in
the Beatifick Vision, with a full and
Blessed Pefection with an actual Love
exactly resembling his, and fully answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to it in the Highest Heavens.</p>
               <p>THERE are two common Motives
of Love among Men, the one the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Excellency of the Person, the
other his particular Kindness and Love
to us: And both these are in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Degree in GOD. He is of infinite
Goodness and and Excellency in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for there is nothing Good in the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52038:161"/>
world, but what hath received all its
Goodness from Him. His Goodness is
the Ocean, and all the Goodnesses of
Creatures little Streams flowing from
that Ocean. Now you would think
him a Madman that should say the Sea
were not greater then a trifling Brook:
and certainly it no less folly to suppose
that the Goodness of GOD doth not
as much (nay infinitely more) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
that of all the Creatures. The
Sun is a lively Mirror of that Eternal
Act of Love which is the Glory of his
Essence, but it is infinitely less prone to
communicate its Beams, and doth less
Good to it self, and infinitely less to all
other Creatures. It shines for their
sakes nevertheless, and clothes it self
with Glory, by the splendor of its Beams
and is an Emblem of GOD, who
exerteth his Power with infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and by communicating his Essence
in an infinite Manner, propagates his
Felicity, and Glory, to the utmost
Height and Perfection. By proceeding
from himself to all Objects throughout
all Worlds, he begets, and dwelleth
in himself, he inhabits Eternity in a
Blessed and more vigorous Manner,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52038:161"/>
by establishing the Felicity of all his
Creatures, and become theirs infinite
and Eternal Glory. <hi>Wherein</hi> his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Kindness and Love to us appeareth
because he hath fitted us with Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Powers adapted for so great
an End, and as particularly appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
all to us, as the Sun to the Eye of
every Spectator. For our Bodies and
our Souls are made to enjoy the Benefit
of all, and his Desire is that we should
attain the End for which we are creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
On his side all is prepared; on
ours nothing is wanting but Love to
embrace and take pleasure in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which shineth in all these Things,
and created them on purpose, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manifested by them, we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in it for ever.</p>
               <p>HE that loveth not GOD with all
his Heart, liveth a Life most contrary
to Nature. For to Love is as natural for
the Soul, as to shine for the Sun: and the
more Lovely any thing is, the more prone
we are to Delight in it: if any thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
Amiable, weare prone to Love it in
an infinite measure, we prefer the Better
above the worse, &amp; cannot rest but in the
best of all, Reason, is the Essence of the
Soul, and tends always to the utmost Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:52038:162"/>
The more Divine and Glorious
any Thing is, the more high and Noble is
the Love that we bear it: No Beauty less
then the most Perfect, no Pleasure, no
Wisdome, no Empire, no Learning, no
Greatness, Wealth, or Honour, less then
the most sublime can be our full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
no little degree of Love, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less then the most Supreme and
violent can content us: So that GOD
being most truely perfect in all these, is
the Adequate Object of all our Desires,
and the only Person sit to be esteemed
in an infinite manner. It is as natural
for Man to Love him, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and delight in any being, which
supplies the ordinary and daily necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Life.</p>
               <p>TO Love him as we ought implies
two things, that are agreable to the
Nature of Love, yet very rarely to
be found among the Sons of Men, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to please him, and a Desire to enjoy
him. The Desire of <hi>Pleasing</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
fruit and effect of Love. For he
that Loves, is very desirous to approve
himself, and to do whatsoever he thinks
will be grateful to his Beloved. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Decree of Love, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is more or less. Where we Love
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52038:162"/>
Earnestly, we are extreamly Earnest and
Careful to please: Where Love is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
there is little need or Regard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing: But <hi>infinite</hi> Love! It is
impossible to declare what favour and
Zeal it will produce. If we Love GOD,
we shall keep his Commandements with
a Tenderness and Desire so extreme,
that no Joy will be so great as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his Laws; It will be
with us, as it was with our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; it will be <hi>our Meat and
Drink to do the Will of our Father
which is in Heaven.</hi> The measure
of our Love will not infuse some
slight and faint Endeavours of Pleasing,
but put us on the most painful and costly
Duties, make us willing to forsake our
own Ease, Goods, Friends, yea Life it self,
when we cannot keep them without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
our Creator.</p>
               <p>THE desire of <hi>Enjoying</hi> is constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen in our Love to one another. If
any man hath a friend whom he intirely
loveth, he desires his Conversation,
Wishes to be always in his Company,
and thinketh the Time long till he and
his friend be together. And thus will
it be in our Love to GOD, if as great
and Hearty as it ought to be. In this
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52038:163"/>
Life our Enjoyment of GOD is more
imperfect, more compleat and perfect
in the Life to come. Here upon Earth
we desire to converse with him in his
Ordinances, in Prayer, Meditation,
hearing his Word, in receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
which are intended all for this
purpose, to bring us into a neerer Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
and familiarity with GOD by
speaking so to him, &amp; hearing him speak,
and shew himself to us. If we love him
indeed, we shall highly Value these
Ways of Conversing with him: it
is all here upon Earth whereby we can
enjoy him. It will make us with <hi>David</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
<hi>one Day in his Courts better than a
thousand.</hi> We shall delight in all the
Means of approaching to him as often
as possible, and use them diligently, to
the End of uniting us more and more
unto him, who is the Object of our
Desire and the Life of our Souls. And
for as much as there is another Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of GOD which is more compleat
and perfect, we shall groan earnestly,
<hi>desired to be dissolved and be with Christ,</hi>
where we may see no more in a Glass,
but Face to Face, and Know as we are
Known. For Love is strong as Death,
many Waters cannot quench Love, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52038:163"/>
can the floods drown it. Affliction,
Persecution, Sickness, any thing that
will bring us to Heaven, will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Delightful.</p>
               <p>IF you would know more fully, why
GOD desires to be Beloved, you may
consider, that Love is not onely the
Motive, and Incentive to Vertue, the
Cause of Obedience, but the form and
Essence of every Grace, and the fufil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Law, We shall chuse him for
our GOD, and have no other GODS
but him, no Delights, no Sovereign En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
but him alone. We shall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him with all our Souls, and adore
him with every Power of our Will and
Understanding: We shall not regard
Images and shadows, but worship him
immediately in Spirit and in Truth. We
shall not take his Name in vain, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
stand by when others abuse it:
But shall praise his Name, and desire to
see it glorified throughout the World.
For Love desires the Honour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in the Glory and Advancement
of its Beloved. We shall reverence
his Sanctuary, and keep his Sabbaths,
desiring Rest from other Avocations,
that we may contemplate his Glory in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52038:164"/>
all his Works. For his sake we shall
observe the Laws of the second Table,
and Love our Neighbour as our self.
For to Love him is no Impediment, but
a Strong Engagement, and incentive to
the Love of all his Creatures. We
shall honour our Parents for his sake,
and preserve the Life of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
We shall not rob him of his
happiness in his Wife, nor wrong him in
her Chastity and Fidelity towards him.
We shall not steal from him, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his Possessions. We shall not
defame him, nor hurt him by Lies;
but vindicate and preserve his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
it will be our joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to see his honour clear and
unblemished. We shall not injure him
so much as in a thought, nor covet
ought that is his, either for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or pleasure: but study to add to his
Contentments.</p>
               <p>WERE all the World as full of
this Love as it ought to be, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
would still continue, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
would be the Joy and Glory of
the whole Creation. The Love of
GOD towards all would dwell and
abide in every Soul, and the Felicity of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52038:164"/>
all would be the particular Joy of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
person. All the Earth would be
full of Repose, and Peace, and Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
nothing but Honour, and
Kindness, and Contentment would
replenish the World. Which leads
me now to that other Branch of
Love, which is Charity to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

            <div n="19" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Charity to our Neighbour most natural
an Easie in the Estate of Innocency:
<hi>Adams</hi> Love to <hi>Eve</hi> and his children
a great Examplar of our Love to all
the World. The Sweetness of Loving.
The Benefits of being Beloved. To
Love all the World, and be beloved by
all the World is perfect security and
Felicity. Were the Law fulfilled all the
World would be turned in Heaven.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CHARITY to our Neighbour
is Love expressed towards GOD
in the Best of his Creatures. We are
to Love GOD in all the Works of
his Hands, but in those especially, that
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52038:165"/>
are most near unto him, chiefly those in
which he manifesteth himself most
clearly, and these are they that are
most like him, most exalted by him,
most loved of him, and most delightful
to him.</p>
               <p>ANGELS and Men, are so distinct
from the residue of the Creation, that
all the Works of GOD, as if they
were Things of another Kind, are put
in Subjection under their feet. They
were made in his Image, and are often
called <hi>the Sons of GOD.</hi> They are
the Sovereign Objects of his Eternal
Love, every one of them, considered a
part, is so Glorious; as if he were the
Sole individual friend of GOD, and
King of the Universe, so that they are
to be treated in another Manner, as
High and Sacred Persons, elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above
the Race of ordinary Creatures,
as a Progeny of Kings that are all of
them friends to the King of Kings,
Ambassadours representing his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in whom he is injured, or Oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>I confess there are many Disguises,
that overcast the Face of Nature with
a vail, and cloud these Sovereign
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52038:165"/>
Creatures: the Excellency, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and Distance, and unknown Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Angels; the Perversness of
Nature, the Ignorance, and Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Disorders of Men Darken,
and Eclipse this Glorious Duty,
and make it uncouth and difficult to us:
But all these Disorders came in by Sin,
and it is expedient to remove the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that blind us, in our miserable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and to look upon this Vertue of
Charity, in the Naked Beauty which
appeareth to us in the Light of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the Purity of Nature, Men are
Amiable Creatures and prone to Love.
To great Advantages; of which Sin
and misery hath bereaved us, and to
which we are restored but in Part, even
then when we are Sanctified. Where the
Beauty of the Object is intire, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and the Goodness of the Spectator
clear and undefiled, to Love is as Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Easie as for fire to enflame, when
applied to convenient matter. For the
Beauty of the Object is Oyl and Fuel to
the affection of the Spectator. It is
not more Easie to delight in what is
pleasant, than it is to desire what is
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52038:166"/>
Good and Amiable. To be commanded
to take pleasure in it is Liberty, not
Constraint. To be forbidden would
be hard. A Prohibition would be the
Severest Law, and the most cruel Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
There was no Possitive Law in
<hi>Eden,</hi> that required a Man to Love his
Neighbour, it was a Law of Nature.
The Nature of the Object required it,
and our Nature prompted it self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
The Service that Law required
was perfect freedome. <hi>Adam</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to Love <hi>Eve,</hi> by a silent Law,
Surprized by her Beauty and captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Chains of Nature. He was
amazed at so fair a Creature, her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
was so Delightful that there was
no need of a Law; an injunction had
imported some Sluggishness in the zeal
of his Affection. His Appetite and
Reason were united together, and
both invited him to lose himself in her
Embraces: She was as acceptable a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Love of GOD, as Wisdome
and Goodness could invent for him. He
was too apt to admire her, had not her
Soul been as worthy; as her Symmetry
was transcendent. He admired the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Donor</hi> in so Great a Gift, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52038:166"/>
Great Part of his Life was to be spent in
the Contemplation of his Treasure.
He had a Noble Creature made in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of GOD for him alone! Her soul
was far more excellent in Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then her Face, a Diviner and more
Glorious Object than the whole world.
Her Intelligence and Vivacity, Her Lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and clear Apprehensions, Her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Majesty, Her Freedome of
Action, her Kindness of Behaviour,
her Angelical Affections, Her fitness for
Conversation, Her sweet and Tender
Principles, a million of Graces and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
conspiring to enrich Her
Person and Perfection, made all the
World to serve <hi>Adam</hi> with one Degree
of Pleasure more in serving and pleasing
her. The Universe seemed to be Nothing
but the Theatre of their mutual Love, as
if all the World were made for nothing
else, but to minister to her for his sake,
and to make him happy in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Her. While the fruition was san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by a Just acknowledgement and
Thanksgiving to the Author.</p>
               <p>WE produce <hi>Eve</hi> only for a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
this first sweetness is but a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
and Copy of what follows,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52038:167"/>
fair Prologue to a more magnificent
scene, and used by us as a meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction.
<hi>Adam</hi> was able to Love
Millions more, and as <hi>She</hi> was taken
out of his <hi>side,</hi> so were <hi>they</hi> to spring
from his <hi>Bowels</hi>: All to be as Great,
and fair, and Glorious as she, as full of
Soul, and as full of Love. As the
Woman was the Glory of man, so
were their Off-springs the Glory of
both: I mean they had been so, by
the Law of Nature, had not the due
course of it been disturbed. Which
Accident is wholy to be fathered on
<hi>Adams</hi> fondness to please his Wife,
and to be mothered upon her Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Credulity. But we being
here to disclose the Felicity which is
hid in the fulfilling of GODS Laws
and to justifie his Love in commanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this <hi>Charity</hi> to our Neighbors, must
not regard the Malevolence of Men,
but look upon the pure Intention of
the Law; and the success that would
have followed, had it been, as it might
have been, perfectly observed.</p>
               <p>ALL <hi>Adams</hi> Children had been
himself divided, and multiplied into
millions, and every one a Greater
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52038:167"/>
Treasure to him than the whole world.
The Stars had not been by a thousand
Degrees so great an Ornament to the
skies, as they to the Earth, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of Incarnate Angels, an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of corporeal Seraphims, a Race of
Celestial Kings, every one loving and
Honouring <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Fountain
of their Being, and the Author of
their Well being, of the one in beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, of the other by <hi>standing</hi>
and abiding in his Integrity. They
had all been so many Pledges of his
Wives Affection; Monuments of love,
New and Powerful Endearments, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements
of their Parents, Being
Mirrors and Memorials of both their
perfections; For all had been made
for every one; and every one had
been the Joy, nay and the Beauty of all.
All had been every ones Objects, and
every one the Spectator of all, every
one would have delighted in the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all, and all had conspired and
strived together in the love of every
one, their concurrence infulfilling the
Law would have banished all sin and
Oppression, Discontentment and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
Wrong and Injury, Theft and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52038:168"/>
Murder, and Adultery, and Lying out
of the World, there had been no noise
of War or Contention, or anger, or
Envy, or Malice, or Revenge, this
accursed <hi>the Black Guard</hi> had never
appeared; but all would have been
Delightful to one another: Affections,
Honours, Benefits, and Services, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
Praises, and Prosperities, these
alone had filled the World, with Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Security, Peace, and Glory, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Goodness, Love, and Felicity,
Joy, and Gratitude had been, all that
had been Known, had Love been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
and inviolably observed.</p>
               <p>BUT where GODS Laws are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
there is confusion and every Evil
Work. Which nevertheless does
more highly commend the excellency
of his Nature, and reflect a Praise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Authority, which must first
be despised, before any Misery can
come into the World. If the Duty
which the Law requires be all sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Felicity, and Glory, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
good, and on every side Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
and Profitable; we that
fail in the Discharge of our Duty may
be condemned, but GOD is to be
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52038:168"/>
admired, and still to be confessed
most Glorious and Holy, because he
delights in the welfare of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and makes Religion so desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Mystery, and enjoynes such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Things, as would make all
transcendently Blessed, and Good,
and Perfect were they perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
He designes that all should
be amiable, whom we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Love, and that we should be
not only prone to Love, but actually
full of it, and the reason why he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistutes
Love, as the Sovereign Law;
is, because, as our Saviour saith, <hi>There
is none other greater Commandement,</hi>
none more Blessed, or Divine, or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
none more conducive to our
Bliss, his pleasure, the perfection of his
Kingdome. Removing the Law of Love,
it is impossible to put another Law
in its Place, which can answer the
Designs of his Wisdome and Goodness,
of comply with the Exigencies of
our Estate and condition. It is as easie
to change the Nature of GOD; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
another deity as Good and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
as to invent a better Law then
this, which is plainly of all other the
most Divine and Holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:52038:169"/>
If we ascend up into Heaven, and
take a perfect account of all the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
and Effects of Love as they
appear in Glory; we may first give
our selves the Liberty of Wishing, and
consult, what of all Things possible is
most fit to be desired. Had we a
Power to chuse, what Kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
would our selves be made? could
we desire to be any thing more great
and Perfect then the Image of GOD?
In the full extent and utmost height of
its Nature it is the Resemblance of
all his Blessedness and Glory. To
have Beings without Power, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
without Operations, will never
make us like GOD, because by an
infinite and Eternal Act of Power he
is what he is. Actions are so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that all Felicity and Pleasure is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
founded in some act or other,
and no Essence is of any value, but as
it employs it self in a delightful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
What Law then would we have
to regulate our actions by? Since Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are of different Kinds, some good,
some Evil, some convenient, some
Hurtful, some Honourable and some
Delightful, some Base and Odious,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52038:169"/>
some are Miserable, and some are Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
we would chuse such a Law to
guide our Actions by, as might make
them honourable and delightful, and
good and Glorious. All these are
with Wisdome and Blessedness shut up
in Love. And by Love it is that we
make our selves infinitly Beautiful, and
Amiable, and Wise, and Blessed, while
we extend that Delightful and Blessed
Affection to all objects that are Good
and Excellent, so that on this side we
have all we can desire, Essences, Laws
and Actions that most tend to our full
and compleat perfection. If on the
other side, we look after objects for
this Affection, and desire to have some
Creatures most Excellent, and fit for
their Goodness to be Beloved, what
Creatures can we wish above all other,
that can be made to satisfie and please
us? Can any thing be more high and
perfect then the similitude of GOD?
GOD is LOVE, and his Love the
Life and Perfection of Goodness. There
is no <hi>Living Goodness</hi> so sweet and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as that alone, none so Wise, none
so Divine, none so Blessed. VVhat
Laws can we desire those Creatures to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52038:170"/>
be guided by, but the Laws of
Love? By Love they are made Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and delightful to us; by Love
they are made Great and Blessed in
themselves. All Honour and Praise,
Benevolence and Good-will, Kindness
and Bounty, Tenderness and Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
all Sweetness, and Courtesie, and
Care, and Affabilitie, all Service and
Complacency are shut up in Love:
It is the Fountain of all Benefits and
Pleasures whatsoever. All Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Esteem and Gratitude, all Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
Respect, and Courage are shut
up in Love, and by Love alone doth
any object of ours Sacrifice it self to
our Desire and Satisfaction. So that
on that side our Wishes are Compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too: while the most High, and
Blessed, and Glorious Creatures love
us as themselves. For thereby they
are as much our Felicity as their own,
and as much take pleasure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
therein. <hi>As for GOD his Way is
perfect</hi>; like curious needle work on
either side, compleat and exquisite.</p>
               <p>ALL that we can fear, or except
against, is his Omission, in forbearing
to compell his Creatures to love, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52038:170"/>
they will or no. But in that
Liberty which he gave them, his Love
is manifested most of all. In giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us a Liberty it is most apparent:
for without Liberty there can be no
Delight, no Honour, no Ingenuity,
or Goodness at all: No action can be
Delightful that is not our Pleasure in
the Doing. All Delight is free and
voluntary by its Essence. Force and
Aversion are inconsistent with its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Willingness in its operation is
the Beauty of the Soul, and its Honour
founded in the freedom of its Desire.
Whatsoever it does not desire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in, tho the matter of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
be never so excellent, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is spoiled, and totally Blasted.
Now can we compel another to desire
or delight in any Thing? The Soul in
it self hath an Inclnation to, or an a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from every object. The Ingennity
and Worth of the Soul is expressed in
the Kindness of its own Intention, in
the freedom of its Desire to do what
is Excellent, in the delight it taketh
to love, its Goodness is founded. Now
tho GOD infinitely hated Sin, yet he
gave us an irrevocable Power to do
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52038:171"/>
what we pleased, and adventured the
Hazzard of that which he infinitely
hated, that being free to do what we
would, we might be Honourable and
delightful in doing (freely, and of
our own Accord) what is Great and
Excellent. For without this Liberty
there can be no Love, since Love is
an active and free affection; that must
spring from the Desire and pleasure of
the Soul. It is the Pleasure of a Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to promote the Felicity of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Whatsoever Services he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to do, he is either meerly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
in them or Cross unto them, they
are all void of the Principal Grace
and Beauty that should adorn them,
and make them pleasant and satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
men may be Dead, and moved like
stones; but in such causes there is no
Love, neither do they act of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when they are over-ruled,
and forced by another. For this cause
hath it pleased God, in order to our
Perfection, to make the most Sublime
and Sovereign Creatures all <hi>Free,</hi>
wherein he hath expressed the greatest
Love in the World. As we may see
by all the Displeasures and Pains it
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:52038:171"/>
hath cost him, through our Abuse of
so illimited and great a perfection.
But where his Love is most Highly
and Transcendently expressed, there
are we most prone to suspect it, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is so Cross and disorderly. There
can be no Wisdom without a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Act, for in all Wisdome there is
Counsel and design. Where no consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
nor Election precedes, the best
operation in all the World is Blind
and Casual. Fortune and chance must
have no hand in that which wisdom Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth:
no more then Force and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
must have in that Goodness, where
all the kindness ought to be in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Benefactor. There is
something in it which I cannot explain.
It is easily conceived, but will never (I
think) in Words, be expressed. The
<hi>Will</hi> has a mighty hand in all the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of perfect Goodness. It is the <hi>Mind</hi>
of the Doer that is the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of all our Desire and Expectation.</p>
               <p>HAVING for these Causes made
his Creatures free, he has forfeited their
Choise, and secured their Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as far as was possible. He hath
done all that can be devised to make
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52038:172"/>
them Love us, and left nothing undone
but only that which was, absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessary
that they might <hi>Love.</hi> They
could not Love us, if they were not
left to themselves to do it freely. And
their <hi>Ability</hi> being provided for, nay an
Inclination given to make them willing
he has strictly commanded &amp; enjoyned
them to Love, by Nature allured them, &amp;
ordered us so, that we might be fit to be
Beloved, he hath made it sweet and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to Love, given them his own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and solemnly protested that he will
accept of no Love to himself, but what
is accompanied with Love to his friends
and servants, engaged them to Love, or
be Eternally miserable. And if for all
this they will not Love, the fault is
none of his. All that he has done to let
secure then Love to himself, he has done
to secure then Love to us: and is as much
or more concerned in their Love to
us, then in that which himself requireth
and Expecteth. Nay he hath made it
impossible for them (truly) to Love
themselves without doing of it: And
if they will neither Love GOD nor
themselves, we may well be despised for
Company. He infinitely desires their
Love, and would take infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:52038:172"/>
in the Operation. There is no
Way to make themselves Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Delightful to GOD, but only
by Loving us, as his soul requireth.
And by all these Inducements and
Causes, are we our selves stirred up to
Love, freely to exert the Power of
Love to others in like manner.</p>
               <p>THAT which yet further commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
this Vertue of Love unto us, is,
that it is the only Soul of all Pleasure
and Felicity <hi>in all Estates.</hi> It is like
the Light of the Sun, in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and Houses, and Eyes, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea,
in Shops and Temples; in Schooles
and Markets, in Labours and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in Theatres and Fable. It is <hi>the
Great Daemon of the World,</hi> and the Sole
Cause of all Operations. It is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impossible for any Fancy, or Play, or
Romance, or Fable to be composed
well, and made Delightful, without a
Mixture of Love in the Composure.
In all Theatres, and Feasts, and Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and Triumphs, and Coronations,
Love is the Soul and Perfection of all,
in all Persons, in all Occupations, in all
Diversions, in all Labours, in all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52038:173"/>
in all Vices, in all Occasions,
in all Families, in all Cities and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
in all our Devotions, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Actions, Love is all in all. All
the Sweetness of Society is seated in
Love, the Life of Musick and Dancing
is Love; the Happiness of Houses, the
Enjoyment of Friends, the Amity of
Relations, the Providence of Kings,
the Allegiance of Subjects, the Glory of
Empires, the Security, Peace and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the World is seated in Love.
Without Love all is Discord and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
All Blessings come upon us by
Love, and by Love alone all Delights
and Blessings are enjoyed. All happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is established by Love, and by Love
alone is all Glory attained. GOD
Knoweth that Love uniteth Souls,
maketh men of one Heart in a House,
filles them with Liberallity and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to each other, makes them Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in presence, faithful in Absence,
Tender of the Honour and Welfare of
their Beloved, Apt to obey, ready
to please, Constant in Trials, Patient in
sufferings, Couragious is Assaults, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in Difficulties Victorious and
Triumphant. All that I shall need to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52038:173"/>
observe further, is, that <hi>it compleated
the Joys of Heaven.</hi> Well therefore
may Wisdome desire Love, well may
the Goodness of GOD delight in Love.
It is the form and the Glory of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Kingdome. And therefore it is
that the Apostle saith, <hi>Charity never
faileth: but whether there be Prophesies,
they shall fail; whether there be Tongues,
They shall cease; whether there be Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it shall vanish away; For we know
in part, and we Prophesie in part, but
when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away.
For now we see through a Glass, darkly,
but then Face to Face; now I Know in
part, but when shall I know, as also I am
Known. And now abideth Faith, Hope
and Charity, these three, but the Greatest
of these is Charity.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Prudence. Its Foundation is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
its End Tranquillity and Prosperity
on Earth, its Office to reconcile Duty
and Convenience, and to make Vertue
subservient to Temporal Welfare. Of
Prudence in Religion, Friendship, and
Empire. The End of Prudence is
perfect Charity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CHARITY is that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
into every Vertue, as a
main Ingredient of its Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Love is the fountain and
the End of all, without which there
can be no Beauty nor Goodness in any
of the Vertues. Love to one self, Love to
GOD, Love to man; Love to Felicity,
a clear and intelligent Love is the Life
and Soul of every Vertue, without
which Humility is but Baseness, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
but Feirceness, Patience but Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
Hope but Presumption, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
but Simpering, Devotion but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
Liberality is Profuseness, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
vanity, Meekness but a sheepish
Tameness, and Prudence it self but fraud
and Cunning. For as all other Vertues,
so is prudence, founded on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52038:174"/>
He that is not Good can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be Prudent: for he can never bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
himself, or others. For the Designes
of Prudence are to secure one self in
the Exercise of every Vertue, and so to
order the Discharge of ones Duty, as
neither to hurt a mans self in his Life,
Estate, Honour, Health, or Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor yet to fail in the Attainment
of that Worth and Beauty, which will
make our Lives Delightful to others,
and as Glorious to our selves, as Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and Delightful.</p>
               <p>PRUDENCE hath an eye to every
Circumstance, and Emergence of our
Lives. Its Designe is to make a mans
self as Great and glorious as is possible,
and in pleasing all the World, to order
and improve all Advantages without
incurring the least inconvenience: To
reconcile our Devotion, Obedience and
Religion, to our Interest and Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the World: To shun all extreams,
to surmount all Difficulties, to overrule
all Disadvantages, to discern all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
and lay hold on all Occasions
of doing Good to our selves. Its Office
is to consult, and contrive, and effect
our own Welfare in every Occurrence
that can besal us in the World, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52038:175"/>
so to mingle all Vertues in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Duties, that they may relieve,
and aid, and perfect each other, in such
a manner as at once to be pleasing to
GOD, profitable to his Creatures,
and to our selves. To take heed that
we do nothing out of Season, nor be
guilty of any Defect, or Excess, or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.
All the Vertues are United
by Prudence like several Pieces in a
Compleat armour, and disposed all like
Souldiers in an Army, that have their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Postes and Charges, or like the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Orders and Degrees in a Kingdom,
where there are Variety of Trusts, &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to be done, and every Man has his
Office assigned by the King, and knows
his own work, and is fitted for the same.</p>
               <p>FOR as no one man is sufficient
for all; the same person cannot be chief
Priest in the Temple, and General in the
Army, and Admiral at Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
neither can every Vertue serve for all
purposes but there must be several Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
for several Ends.</p>
               <p>AS the King ordereth and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all his Officers and subjects in their
several Places; if they do their duty in
their own sphere, the Great End is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52038:175"/>
by <hi>all,</hi> which no <hi>one</hi> of them
alone, was able to Effect: so here, one
Vertues supplies the Defects of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and tho every one of them moves
in his own Precincts, and does not at all
intermeddle with anothers charge, yet
the Work is done as effectually as if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one Vertue did all alone.</p>
               <p>WHILE all the Vertues conspire
to supply what is wanting in each other,
Prudence is the general Overseer, and
Governour of all, which, while every
single Vertue is ignorant of what the
other are doing, fits and proportions
the subservient Ends, to which every
one of these Directeth its Care, and
Labour, and Skill, to the Great and last
End of all, the intire Perfection and
Glory of the Kingdome. So that here
upon Earth Prudence seemeth to be the
King of Vertues, because we have such
a Multiplicity of Concernes and Affairs
to look after, that it is impossible for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one Vertue, but Prudence alone to
attend them all.</p>
               <p>THIS discovereth the Excellency of
Vertue,<note place="margin">y<hi rend="sup">s</hi>
                  </note> &amp; detected a very great Error to
which we are liable, while we are prone
imprudently to expect more from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52038:176"/>
Vertue than it is able to perform.
We are apt to believe that in every
Vertue there is an infinite Excellency.
And this great Expectation of ours is
a good opinion of Vertue, yet turneth
(not seldome) to its Disgrace and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.
For when we look upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
single Vertue, and see it so Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
that it scarce answereth one of
many Ends, because we find our selves
deceived in our expectation of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and the Service of that Vertue
so Curt and narrow, which we thought
to be infinite; we are distasted at its
<hi>Insufficiency,</hi> and prone to slight it as
a poor inconsiderable Business, infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
short of our Hopes and expectations.
Nay and to be discouraged from the
practice of it, because we find it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with many Difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
which it is not able to
remedy or answer. Thus are we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
from Liberality for fear of the
Poverty to which it exposeth us; from
Meekness, because it encourageth all
People to trample us under feet, from
Holiness, because it is scorned and
hated in the World; from Fortitude
and Courage, because of the Perils and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52038:176"/>
Hazzards, that attend it; from self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Denial,
because of the Displeasures
we do to our selves in crossing our
Appetite. Nay sometimes men are
so wicked as to hate to be obliged,
for fear of the Inconveniences of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and are much Prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Fidelity, and Love, and Truth,
and Constancy. For all these Vertues
can answer but one exigence, for
which they are prepared (especially
in our Daily Conversation with men)
and a mistake in one of them doth
expose us to more Inconveniences,
then its Benefit is worth.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Offence: and the Truth
is no Vertue is of any Value as cut off
from the rest. We may as well expect
all Beauty in a Nose divided from the
Face, or an eye pluckt out of the head,
all Perfection in an Ear, or a tongue
cut off, all serviceableness in a Hand, or
Foot dismembred from the Body; as
a full and perfect Security from any
one Vertue whatsoever. If one were
sufficient, the rest would be Superfluous.
Mans Empire and Dominion would be
a very narrow Thing, (at least a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Empty</hi> and <hi>Shallow</hi> thing) if any
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52038:177"/>
one Vertue were enough for his Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
As his Exigencies and Concerns
are Innumerable, so are his Cares and
Endowments, his Honors and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
his Offices and Employments,
his Vertues and Graces. His Offices
and his Vertues must be at least so
many, as will serve to regulate all his
Concerns. And if any be so compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
as to cure many Exigencies
at the same time, his Vertues are the
Greater in force and Extent, but the
fewer in Number. Their perfect suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
is to be measured by the ends
for which they are prepared: and their
Beauty Consists, (like that of an Army
with Banners) in the Proportion and
Symmetry of the entire Body, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Supplies and Succors they afford
to one another, the Unity of such a
Great Variety of things in order to
the Attainment of the same great and
ultimate end the full and compleat
Number of Offices and inferior Ends,
and the Extream Providence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are reducible to one su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
End, which is most High and
Excellent. It is enough for the Ear
if it can hear well, tho it is no more
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52038:177"/>
able to See, or Taste, than a Stone.
it is enough for the eye to see well,
tho it is no more sensible of Noise,
then a Rock or a Tree The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Tongue is to Tast well, of
the Nostril to smell well, &amp;c. and
there is no Defect in any of these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are every one sufficient for
its own immediate end, and also tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and united together, that the
rest are Supplies to make up the Defect
of every single Sence and Organ, and
altogether perfectly subservient to the
whole Man, for whose sake they were
prepared, that he might enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of them all. The eye sees for the
Ear, and the Tongue, and all the rest
of the Members of the Body: the foot
supports and carries the eye, the hand
defends and feeds the Eye, the Ear
instructs and Counsels the Eye,
the Nostrils smell for the eye, and
the Tongue tasts and talks for the Eye,
which the eye cannot do for it self,
because it was made to need the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the rest, the eye directs all
these in Liew of their Services, and is
of far greater Value, then if a man had
no other Member, but an eye alone. For
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52038:178"/>
the Eye is the Light of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and Great in its Relation to the
whole man: It sees for the Ear, and
the Hand, and for all, and is to
all these after some manner Beneficial,
but without these would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
There is an infinite Excellency
in every Vertue, but it is to be sought
in its Relation to all the Rest. It is
Good for nothing in its Place but for
that Particular End to which it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
in attaining that end it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to all other Vertues; and
while it serves all, is aided by all.
The other Virtues remedie the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
to which this doth expose
us, and being all joyned together ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us safely and securely to our Last
end: Because the Influence of every
one passeth thorow all, every single
Vertue is Pleasing to God, and a means
in its place of our whole Felicity. The
Beauty of all the Vertues is to be sought
in Prudence, for there they meet in an
intire Body: their Correspondence and
convenience, their Symmetry and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
their Unity and Variety, their
ful and perfect Harmony, makes up the
features of the Soul, and compleats its
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52038:178"/>
Graces, just as the Diversity of Members
perfects the Body. Knowledge gives
Light to Love, but Love gives Warmth
and Feeling to Knowledge. Love may
perhaps, like a Separate Soul, dwell in
Heaven, alone; and yet even then it
must include all Knowledge, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and Wisdome, and Holiness:
for if Love know not how to guide it
self, it will never attain its End, nor be
a perfect Vertue. But here upon Earth
tis like the Soul in the Body, it must
Eat, and Drink, and see, and hear, as a
thousand Works to do, and therefore
standeth in need of many Vertues.
Love without Goodness is perhaps a
Thing impossible, because it always
designs well. But Love without Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is a Common Thing: for such is
all that mistakes its End. Love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Discretion is a mischievious Thing,
Love without Prudence an Helpless
Thing, Love without Courage a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Cowardly Thing; Love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Modesty an impudent and Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Thing; Love without the Fear of
GOD is Lust and Wantonness; and
if the most Great and Glorious of all
the Vertues stands in need of all its
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52038:179"/>
Companions. The less and inferior must
needs be lame and maimed without the
residue, especially without the Superior.</p>
               <p>UPON this account it is, that so
much Care and Study goes to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of a Vertuous man. All kind of
Vertues must concur to Compleat his
Perfection. The Want of any one Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
a Vice, and makes him Vicious.
Nay the Want of any one destroys the
form and Essence of the rest. Vertue is
not Vertue but in order to felicity. If it
hath lost its force, it hath lost its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
As a little Poyson turnes the best
Meat from Nourishment into Poyson
so doth one Vice cherished and allowed
corrupt and viciate all the Vertues in
the whole World. Hence it is that the
Phylosophers say, all the Vertues are
linked together in the golden Chain of
Prudence. And that a Thing is made
Good by all its Causes, Evil by the least
Defect. For as one Tooth wanting in
a Clock, makes all the other wheels
and Materials Useless; tho the frame
be never so Elaberate and Curious; so
doth the abscence of the smallest Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
make void and frustrate all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue.
A man of a Kind and Bountiful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52038:179"/>
that is loose and intemperate, may
ruine his Estate, and dye like a Prodigal
and vain-glorions fool. A stout Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
person that is proud and debauched
will be little better then a <hi>Souldierly Russi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and Live if not like a Thief for
Want of Honesty, yet like a Swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
Hector for Want of Discreetion.
A Man endued with all Kind of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
may be Morose and Covetous,
and by one Vice lose all the Benefit of
his Education. A Religious Votary
that is Splenetick and Revengeful,
brings a Disgrace upon his whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
But he that is Wise, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Holy, and Just, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and Couragious, and Kind, and
Liberal, and Meek, and Humble, and
Affable, and Cheerful, and Prudent,
and Industrious, shall be serviceable,
and Honourable, and delightful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
profitable to himself, and alwayes
Triumphant: Especially if he be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and Prudent, as to make all these
Vertues move like the Stars in their
Courses, and knows how to apply and
manage their Excellencies in their due
and proper places upon all occasions:
for they are so many different in nature
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52038:180"/>
that some of their Influences, will hit
every business, and all of them together
pass a Grace and Lustre upon each other,
so Divine and Heavenly that they will
make their owner Venerable in the Eys
of the World, and correct the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the most injurious and Censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Which moved our Saviour to
exhort us to be <hi>Wise as Serpents, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
as Doves,</hi> to joyn many Vertues
together: And occasioned that of the
Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>He that will love Life and see
good Days, let him refrain his Tongue
from Evil, and his Lips that they speak no
Guile: let him eschew Evil, and do Good,
let him seek Peace and ensue it, for the
Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous:
And who is he that will harm you, if ye
be followers of that which is Good?</hi> The
only sure Way to live happily here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, is to joyn all kind of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
together, and to let them work in
season according to their several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>WHAT the efficacy of Prudence
is may be seen in friendship, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of States and Kingdoms, in the
Rule and government of Private Fame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
He that is fitted for all these is an
Excellent Person.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:52038:180"/>
IT is the office of Prudence in all
Estates, to find out the Temper of those
with whom we are to deal; and so to
suit the Exercises of all Vertues with
their several Humours, as may make
their Operation consistent with our
own Repose, and their Benefit, without
infringing our Duty.</p>
               <p>IN Friendship it often falleth out
by reason of the spiritual <hi>Sickness</hi> of
those to whom we relate, that we must
either make shipwrack of Fidelity and
a good Conscience, or run the Hazzard
of losing our Friend by displeasing,
that we may be Profitable to him.
There is no Duty so necessary, as that
of free and faithful Reproof: no Duty
so nice as this. A Good man Knows
it is incumbent upon him, and yet is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Averse from the Discharge of it. It
is as Troublesome to himself as to the
Person that needs it. Tis difficult to
be done well, and so unpleasant to
both. Here Prudence comes in, and
deviseth expedients for all Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and with a strange facility scatters
all Doubts and Fears. Three Things it
discovers to be necessary in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Business, Three in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52038:181"/>
and Three in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
He that reproves well, must shew
a great respect and Tenderness to the
Person, a necessity of the Discharge of
that Duty, his Aversness to it, and how
Nothing but his Perfect Love could
make him undertake it. The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Success is laid by these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions:
In the Superstructure, he must
consider whether it be best to be done
merrily or severely; by a Brief Hint or
a strong Enlargement, according to the
Temper and Degree of the Person. He
must chuse out the Best Opportunities,
and consult the Honour of him he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth.
And if he be displeased and
grow angry at the Liberty, he must in
the Close of all bear it patiently, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
it with Courtesie, and pursue him
with Kindness. He that rules his own
Passion is Master of another mans: He
must needs win him and Melt him: For
no man thus dealt with, is so very a
Beast, as to be angry long. Or the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is, when he that reproveth miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
in some of these Rules, especially
the last: for there are few so prudent as
not to be exasperated with the Affront
that is put upon their kindness and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52038:181"/>
when they are injured for their
Good Will: few so discreet as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
which way their patience and
Meakness are to be made the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Amity and Happiness.</p>
               <p>IN the Management of Empires, and
Kingdomes Prudence hath a vast and
Mighty Province to reign in. A
Good King when he designs the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Vice, and the Establishment
of Righteousness and pure Religion,
meets with many Rubs and Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in his Way, all which are sweetly
and easily by Prudence removed. His
Great encouragement is the Beauty of
Religion, and the Assistance of GOD.
For he Knows very well that Equity
and Piety are such Glorious Things,
that tho few practice them as they ought
to do, yet all admire them.</p>
               <p>GODLINESS, and Honesty, need
nothing but to be maintained and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the Prince, when they are
once countenanced by authority all the
Enemies of Religion are confounded,
and dare not lift up their face against
it. Wise an Holy men may easily
be exalted, and are more capable of
Exaltation then others. As they are
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52038:182"/>
more faithful when they are in power,
they will be more Grateful to the Prince,
and more Obliging to the people; and
in all Respects more able to serve
them both. The Good will secure the
Throne and exalt the Kingdome. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in such a work Knows where to
begin and where to end, by what steps
and Degrees to proceed, what Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to use, how to Oblige, and how
to Awe; whom to Oblige, and Awe;
where to remit the Rigor of the Law
and where to be severe. The Truth
is Prudence consists most in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Business, for it will go on,
and is ever waited with success when
undertaken. A King that is so Wise
as to design and endeavor, the Refur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his Nation, must needs be
Prudent. GOD has assured him, <hi>The
Throne is established by Righteousness.
When it Goeth well with the Righteous
the City rejoyceth, and when the wicked
perish there is shouting. By the blessing
of the upright the City is exalted, but it
is overthrown by the Mouth of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN Families the force of Prudence
is prodigious. Some men by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52038:182"/>
of this Vertue live more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
upon a mean state, then others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Thousands, they have more respect
among their Servants, more honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their Neighbors, more plenty at
home, more Authority abroad, more
peace &amp; comfort every where, then Men
forty times above themselves in State &amp;
Grandure. Its first care is to be Wary in
the Choise of Servants: For they that are
good act well by Nature, and have little
need of Force and compulsion. Its
next Business is to oblige them, which
is done by a religious example which
instilles a Reverence, a strict prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tion
of all Debauchery, a sweet and
affable Behaviour, a plentiful Provision
for their comfortable Subsistence, a
prudent connivance at smaller faults,
a Distribution of Rewards as well as
punishments for the Encouragement
of their Vertues, a meek and Gentle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
of their Faults, a kind acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of their Good deserts; which
is a cheap and easie kind of payment,
yet more Obliging then any Dry
gift of Gold or Silver. A prudent
man will so demean himself in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
as to make himself cordially
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52038:183"/>
beloved of all: so ordere<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his affairs,
that the Services of those about him
shall be like Preferments. By which
Means it will first come to pass, that
he shall have his choise of servants,
because it will be esteemed a Blessing
to be with him: and in the next place
their service will be mingled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and Love. They will befaithful
as well for his sake, as their own. In
the Midst of all this, his Prudence
will guid him to take a strict account,
and to make all his Servants see, it is
impossible to cheat him. Thus in all
Affaires Prudence happily demeans it
self; and of this Gift especially is that
of <hi>solomon</hi> to be understood, <hi>A gift is
as a precious stone in the hand of him that
hath it, whithersoever it turneth, it pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreth.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>FOR the Foundation of all kind of
Prudence you must remember, that he
that winneth Souls is Wise. Mens Hearts
are the stars by whose Influences the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the World are regulated:
they are as our Savour calleth them
Good or Evil Treasures; out of which

mans main Business is to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
intirely beloved by all the World.
which can never be without great Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Courage, Goodness, Prudence and
Dexterity. Flattery and Base compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
makes a man Odious.</p>
               <p>THE Last End of prudence is
Eternal Happiness and Glory, to
which it moveth by crooked Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and windings out as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
It is a strange Vertue, for its
Conversant amongst Terrene and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Objects, and yet a far more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Vertue then Wisdom it self.
Wisdome is a more High and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Vertue, but its Rules are always
fixed, and its objects Stable, where as
Prudence hath no set and Stated Rules,
but in all occasions, is to mould and
shape it selfe, it knows not which way,
till it comes to Action. Its Paths are
in the Deep and mighty Waters, among
Storms and tempests.</p>

Coward by Nature, is made more Bold

And he that is always assured of the

come off more honourably, will laugh

at the Trial of his own Innocence
and make a Game of Difficulties and
Terrors.</p>
               <p>VALOUR is a right and strong
Resolution of the Soul whereby it dare
encounter with any Difficulty and
Trouble, for Vertues sake. It is the
Armour of the Soul against all Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Fear, its Effect is an Equal and
uniform stayedness of Mind, against
all Dangerous and Terrible Accidents.
It containeth Magnanimitie, Patience,
Constancy, Invincible Resolution,
Boldness and Industry in its Nature.
Its cause is the Love of Vertue, and
the sence of Honour, Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any thing that is Base and vile,
a High Ambition and desire of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Its End is the preservation of a
Mans person and Honesty, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of all Opposition in the Way to
Bliss, the Destruction or Subjection
of Enemies, Triumph and Conquest, the
Establishment of Peace, the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Liberty and Glory. Its Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
are Prudence, Justice and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
the principal Ornament and
Grace of valour is Worth and Goodness.
its Aids and Encouragements are insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52038:185"/>
it groweth Great and High, by
making use of all the Causes of Hope
and Confidence. Conflicts and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
are the Element in which it lives,
It owns its whole being to them; for
without Causes of Fear, there could
be no courage in all Nature. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of GOD is the root of Divine
Valour, and Fidelity to his Laws its
Commendation. The Assurance of his
Love, and all those Things that serve
to beget and confirm it, are subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to it. It draws in strength and
Encouragements form all Obligations
and Rewards, from all Great and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examples, from the Knowledge of
its own Sublimity, from the Greatness
of Felicity, from the Omnipotence, and
Omnipresence, and Providence of the
Deity, from his Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and from all those Things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he has manifested his Love above the
Heavens.</p>
               <p>OF all the Vertues in greatest Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
this is most renowned. For
its Prerogative is so great, that it is
simply called VERTUE. Vertue
being the Word to express and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:52038:185"/>
Valour among the Latines; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Force and Efficacy that is
in it, is most visible and Apparent, and
by that all other Vertues are secured,
vindicated, Exercised, and made Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
It is stiled <hi>Manhood</hi> among the
English, with a peculiar Emphasis.
As is the Essence of a man was founded
in Courage, because his Vigor is emas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated,
and his Dignity lost, that is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffeminate
and Timerous; for he is
scarce a Man that is a Coward.</p>
               <p>WHAT a Glorious and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Vertue this is, appeareth from
the Baseness and Ineptitude of its
Contrary. A Coward and an Honest
Man can never be the same; a Coward
and a constant Lover can never be the
same; a Coward and a Brave Man can
never be the same: Cowardice, and
Wisdome are as incompatible forever,
as Love and Wisdom were thought to<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
be of Old. A Coward is always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
and Wretched; because he
dares not expose himself to any Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
nor adventure upon any Great
Attempt for fear of some little Pain
and Damage, that is between him and
an Excellent Atchievment. He is
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52038:186"/>
baffled from the Acquisition of the most
Great and Beautiful Things, and non
plust with every Impediment. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
before he begins to fight. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sight of Danger makes him a Slave; He
is undone, when he sees his Enemy a far
off, and wounded, before the Point of the
Sword can touch his shadow. He is all
wayes a Terror and Burden to himself,
a Dangerous Knave, and an useless
Creature.</p>
               <p>STRANGE is the Vigour in a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Brave Mans Soul. The Strength of
his Spirit and his irresistible Power, the
Greatness of his Heart, and the
Height of his Condition, his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Confiedence and Contempt of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
his true Security and Repose in
himself, his Liberty to dare and do
what he pleaseth, his Alacrity in the
midst of Fears, his invincible Temper,
are advantages which make him Master
of Fortune. His Courage fits him for
all Attempts, renders him serviceable to
GOD and MAN, and makes him the
Bulwark and Defence of his King and
Country.</p>
               <p>LET those Debauched and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
men, that deny the Existence of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52038:186"/>
Vertue, contemplate the Reality of its
Excellency here, and be confounded
with shame at their Prodigious Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Their Impiety designs the Abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion, and the utter Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of all Faith and Piety, while
they pretend the Distinction between
Vertue and Vice to be meerly feigned,
for the Awing of the World; and that
their Names have no foundation in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but the Craft of Politicians and the
Tradition of their Nurses. Are there
no Base fellows, nor Brave Men in the
World? Is there no difference between a
Lion and a Hare? a faint hearted Coward,
and a Glorious Heroe! Its there Nothing
Brave nor vile in the world? What
is become of these <hi>Rodomontadoes</hi> wits.
Where is the boasted Glory of their
Personal Valour; if there be no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fference,
but Courage and Cowardize
be the same thing!</p>
               <p>HOW empty these Self, but shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
conceited Ranters are, is evident
by their short and narrow measures.
They place all Gallantry and Worth in
Valour: all the Vertue of a man they
think seated in this: They forget that
Policy, and Learning, and Prudence,
and Gratitude, and Fidelity, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52038:187"/>
and Industry, and compassion
and Bounty, and Affability, and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
and Modesty, and Justice, and
Honesty are Vertues, and that in every
one of these there is something fitting a
Man for the Benefit of the World. Nay
they have lost the Notion of Vertue,
and know not what it is. Those things
by which a man is made serviceable to
himself and the World, they think not
to be Vertues, but imagine<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chimeraes
which they cannot see, &amp; then deny they
have any Existence. A Man is capable
of far more Glorious Qualities then
one of them: And his Courage it self
may be raised to far higher Ends and
purposes then Buffoons and Thrasonical
Heroes can dream of.</p>
               <p>IT is to be noted here, that any one
of those Things that are called Vertue,
being alone, is not a Vertue. It is so
far from aiding and setting us forward
in the Way to Happiness, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it proveth a Great and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mischief, and is never safe, but when
it is corrected and guided by the rest of
its Companions. To stir no further
then Courage alone: What is Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in a Thief, or a Tyrant, or a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52038:187"/>
but like Zeal and Learning in a
pernicious Heretick.</p>
               <p>YOU may note further, that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is a principal Ingredient in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of this Vertue, tho it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
in its Nature from the Being of
Courage. A brave man will expose his
Life in an Honest cause, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and preservation of others, tho
not for the Dammage or Destruction of
any. He will slight his own safety,
and despise his Repose to make himself
a Saviour, and a Benefactor. A true
Courage holdeth Vertuous Actions at
such a Price, that Death, Imprisonment,
Famine, Dishonour, Poverty, Shame,
Indignation, all Allurements and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
are nothing, compared to the
Performance of Heroick Deeds. He
exceedeth all constraint, and walketh in
the Glorious Liberty of the Sons of
GOD.</p>
               <p>THE last note which I shall offer
to your Observation on this Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is this, (for the Illustration of the
Reason and excellency, of GODS
Dispensations:) The Great End for
which GOD was pleased not to seat
us immediately in the Throne, but to
place us first in an estate of Trial,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52038:188"/>
was the Multiplication of our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
For had we been seated in the
Glory of Heaven at the first, there
had no such Vertues as Patience, and
Courage, and Fidelity been seen, no
Faith, or Hope, or Meekness, no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance,
or Prudence, or self Denial,
in the World. Which Vertues are
the very clothes and Habits of the
Soul in Glory. The Graces and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Soul are founded in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of them. Actions pass not away,
but are fixed, by the permanent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of all Eternity, and tho
done never so long ago, shall appear
before the Eye of the Soul for ever in
their places, be the Glory of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
the Lineaments and Colours of
his Beauty, seen by GOD and his holy
Angels, and Delightful to all that love
and delight in worthy things. Our
Life upon Earth, being so diversified
like a Sphere of Beauty, so variously
adorned with all sorts of Excellent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
shall wholly and at once be seen
as an intire Object, rarely and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
wrought; a Lively Mirror of the
Nature of the Soul, and all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of which it is compounded, all
the Parts that conspire in its Symetry,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52038:188"/>
all the Qualities, Operations, and Perfections
that contribute to its Glory, shall afford won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and pleasure to all Spectators. While
every Soul shall be concerned more in its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then in its Essence; indeed its Essence,
(how ever considerable) is of little or no Value
in Comparison of its Operations. Every
Vertue being the Natural Off-spring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Soul, in which its Vigor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
appeareth, an effect discovering the
Nature of the cause, and the sole occasion of
its shame or Glory. For if the Essence of the
Soul be all Power and its power exerted in
its operation, the Soul must needs enter into
its Actions, and consequently be affected
with all that befalls its Operation. All Acts
are Immortal in their places, being <hi>enbalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
as it were by Eternity, till the Soul revive
and be united to them. Then shall it appear
in its own Age, and in eternity too, in its
last life enjoying the Benefit of its <hi>first.</hi>
And in that sence is that voice from
Heaven to be understood, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Divine to write <hi>Blessed are they
that die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea
saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their
Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 15.</note> For
the Glory of the place is nothing to us, if we
are not endued with those Glorious Habits,
which will make our Souls <hi>all Glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:52038:189"/>
We must be Glorious and Illustrious
our selves, and appear in Actions that will
Beautifie the Throne to which we are exalted.</p>
               <p>THAT these Actions may be Great and
Amiable, manifold and Excellent, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of every soul, the natural Wish and
Expectation both of Reason it self and of self
Love.</p>
               <p>HOW Glorious the Counsel and Design
of GOD is for the Archieving of this
Great End, for the making of all Vertues
more compleat and Excellent, and for the
Heightening of their Beauty and Perfection
we will exemplifie here in the Perfection of
Courage. For the Hieght, and depth, and
Splendor of every Vertue is of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to the Perfection of the Soul,
since the Glory of its Life is seated in the
Accomplishment of its essence, in the Fruit
it yeildeth in its Operations. Take it in

                  <l>The Angels, who are faithful while they view</l>

               <p>THE Beatifick Vision is so sweet and Strong
a Light, that it is impossible for any thing
that Loves it self, (and sees the Face of GOD)
to turn away to any vanity from so Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Strong a Blessedness. To Love
GOD in the clear and perfect Light is a cheap
and Easie Thing: The Love that is shewed
in a more weak Estate to an absent Object, is
more remiss perhaps, and Black in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
but far Deeper, if in the Lovers
Weakness, and its Objects absence; it be
Faithful to the Death; constantly Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and Careful to please, Laborious and
Industrious, Wakeful and Circumspect, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52038:190"/>
and immutable, and freely springing from
its own Desire, not out of bare pleasure;
but humble Obedience to the Laws of its
Benefactor. All the Courage which it shews
in such Occasions is more full of Mystery
and Divinity then is imaginable; far more
Moving and full of Vertue, while it strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
with Impediment, Disadvantages, and
Difficulties, then if without any such Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of shewing its Vertue, it did smoothly
and Peaceably proceed in the Highest Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Add to that the mysteriousness of its
Beauty in all the varieties of its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Different Sweetnesses that still
appear in all its several Effects upon new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.
The very Representation of Love
upon the stage, in its Conflicts and Agonies,
produces another kind of sence in the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator,
then that of Embraces. It is more
Tender and endearing, touches the Soul (of
its Beloved especially) in a more Vigorous
and lively manner, it makes all fruitions (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward)
more precious; by Fidelity, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and Immoveable Perfection it maketh
the Lover more Honourable, and Effects far
more Serious. Alterations in the Soul, solid
Joys and tender Compassions, moving and
Bleeding Resentments; all which, End in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
heightened with more Perfect
Complacencies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:52038:190"/>THUS you see Courage in the Root
made more Glorious by a Persons Exposure
and Abasement. In the fruit and Exercise it
is otherwise to be considered. Where there
is no Evil to be endured, or no Strength to be
resisted, there can be no Courage or Vertue
at all. Where the conflict is more sharp the
Victory is more pleasant, and the success of
the fight is far more Honourable. Where a
Giant is to fight with a Gnat, or a
Dwarf, the Disproportion of his Strength
takes away the Pleasure of its Trial, and a
Glory of the Combate. There is no Room,
or occasion for its Exercise. And tho it
might without any Trial be known by him
that sees all things in their hidden Essences,
yet without its Exercise it remaineth unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crted,
is wholly vain, especially when there is
no occasion for it in Nature, The Pleasure of
the Spectacle springeth from its Operation.</p>
               <p>TO see a Seraphim surmount one of
our Difficulties, in the midst of all his
Strengths and Advantages, is no more then
to see a Giant destroy a Gnat, or subdue a
Grass hopper. But in Man there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Degree of strength, that makes him
<hi>a fit Match</hi> for the appointed Encounter. In
the Estate of Innocency indeed his Enemies
and Difficulties were very few, just as
many as were needful for the trial of his
Obedience, Gratitude, Fidelity. All
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52038:191"/>
the Hardship he was to undergo, was to
cross his Appetite in an Apple, and
and tho, he did not as yet see which way
it was reserved for him, to be so Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as to hope well, so Grateful to GOD,
as to dare to confide in him, rather let
go the Knowledge he might gain by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, than break his Commandement.
All other Duties were his Pleasure and
Felicity: here lay his Trial, and his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
should have been crowned
with infinite Reward. All which would
in some Measure have risen out of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
discharged by him. For by this Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Self-Denial he had manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Obedience, and acquitted himself,
and shewed his Love, and his Prelation
of his Makers Pleasure above all other
Concernes, wherein he had been approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and Wise, and Holy, and well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to GOD, he would have put the
Crown upon all Gods Works in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
the End for which he was made,
and been very Delightful to all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
He had been crowned with Glory
and Honour in all their Complacency.
If that were too little, because he had
then no enemy but his Appetite, the
Dimness of his Sight maketh up the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
If his Clarity was too Great, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52038:191"/>
there was no Proportion between his
Strength and the Temptation; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
of the Tenderness of GODS
Love, which feared to adventure him
too far, and had rather something of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
should be endangered, then his Soul
lost, or thrust upon the Hazzard of too
great a Temptation. When the Angels
fell, the Devil was let loose upon man,
for the increase of his Honour and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion:
Yet like a Dog in his Chain so
far, and no further. He had but one
Way, and that was to perswade our first
Parents to do what was forbidden: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
he might, and try his Skill to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
but could not compell, nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
afflict, or hurt him in the least. He
had not Power so much as to diminish the
least Hair of his Head: yet so Gracious
was Almighty GOD, that upon this
Trial of his Prudence and Courage, the
Exercise of these Vertues had been infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
pleasing to his Eternal Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he infinitely delighted in the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and Preservation of what was so
precious to himself, as a Soul is, that is
infinitely Beloved. In that Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<hi>Adam</hi> had found little less then infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Glory. It did not become the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of GODS Love to expose him
to any Severer Trial.</p>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:52038:192"/>
                  <l>For there are certain Periods and fit Bounds,</l>
                  <l>Which he that passeth, all his Work confouds.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and brought more
Hazzards and Difficulties on himself
GOD might justly leave him to them,
for his greater Trial and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Glory. Now we are more blind
and Weak by Nature, yet infinitely Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
and more Precious: For the price
of the Blood of the Eternal Son of
GOD is laid upon the Soul as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to its interior Value. We are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in our corruption to Grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with Sin, and Hell, and Death, and
Sickness, and Poverty, and Fear, and
all the Devils, and Afflictions in the
World; nay which is worse then all,
with our own Errors, Lusts and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
more neer and Bitter Enemies: A
poor Clod of Earth is to overcome all
the World, to fight (as the Apostle

with the Rulers of the Darkness in this

Victories and Trophies into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

Hope and Assurance of triumphing, tho
<hi>Lucifer</hi> and all his Angels are to be

derive Strengths and Succours from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
and being aided by the Conduct
of so great a Captain as our Lord <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> who has taught us by his example
not to fear, because he has <hi>overcome the

where is thy sting? O Grave where is thy

Heaven, Earth, and Hell to the combat,
Which for one single person to do against
all the Creation, is the most Glorious
Spectacle which the universe affords.
<hi>Who shall separate us from the Love of
Christ? shall Tribulation, or Distress, or
Persecution, or Famine, or Nakedness,
or Peril, or Sword? as it is writen, for
thy sake we are Killed all the day

                  <p>To be Couragious is the Easiest thing
in the World, when we consider the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
success, which Courage founded on
Goodness must needs attain. For he that
makes his Fortitude subservient onely to
the excess of his Love, has all the Powers
of Heaven and earth on his side, and the
Powers of Hell that are already subdued
are the only foes that are to be vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him. To dare to be Good, is the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of true and Religious valour. And he
that makes it his Business to oblige all the
world, he whose design it is to be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to all mankind, has nothing to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
but their error &amp; bitterness, which
by meekness, and Kindness, and Prudence,
and liberality will easily be accomplished.
For they all love themselves, and cannot
chuse but desire those that are kind and
Serviceable to them, and must so far forth
as they love themselves, honor &amp; delight

               <argument>
                  <p>Of <hi>Temperance</hi> in Matters of Art, as
Musick, Dancing, Painting, Cookery;
Physick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the works of Nature;
Eating, Drinking, Sports and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
In occasions of Passion, in our
Lives and Conversations. Its exercise in
Self-denial, Measure, Mixture and
Proportion. Its effects and atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PRUDENCE giveth Counsel what
Measure and Proportion ought to
be held in our Actions, Fortitude inspires
Boldness and Strength to undertake,
and set upon the Work; but it is Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
doth execute what both of them
design. For Temperance is that Vertue,
whereby the actions of Prudence and
Power are moderated, when they come
to be exerted.</p>
               <p>IT is the Opinion of some, that as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
respects Afflictions, so Temperance
is wholy taken up in moderating our
Pleasures, and hath no employment but
in the midst of Prosperities. But since
there are certain bounds which Fear and
Sorrow ought not to exceed, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
hath its work in the midst of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52038:194"/>
and being needful to moderate
all our Passions, hath a wider sphere to
move in, than Prosperity alone; its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
is more large and comprehensive,
including all estates and conditions of
Life whatsoever.</p>
               <p>OTHERS there are that admit of its
use in all Conditions, but confine it to
one particular employment, even that
of enlarging or bounding the Measure
of every Operation: but in real truth
it has another Office, and that more deep
perhaps, and more important than the
former. For Actions are of two kinds,
either Mixt, or Simple. Where the work
is single and but one, it is exprest in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Measure of the Action,
that it be neither too short, nor too
long; too remiss, nor too violent; too
slow, nor too quick; too great, nor too
little: But where many things are mixt
and meet together in the Action (as they
generally do, in all the affairs of our
Lives;) there its business is to consider
what, and how many things are to enter
the <hi>Composition,</hi> and to make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
just and convenient. As in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
Medicines, the skill whereby we
know what is to be put in, and what left
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52038:194"/>
out is of one kind, and that of discerning
how much of every <hi>Ingredient</hi> will serve
the turn, of another. The skill of Ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is like the vertue of Prudence, but
the actual tempering of all together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
the vertue of <hi>Temperance</hi> to the
Life, because it reduces the Skill to its
operation. Its End is the beauty and
success of our Endeavours.</p>
               <p>OF what use and value Temperance
is in our Lives and Conversations, we
may guess by its necessity, force and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
on all Occasions.</p>
               <p>THE fit mixture and proportion of
the four Elements in all Bodies, is that
upon which their Nature, Form and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
dependeth. Too much of the
Fire, too much of the Water, too much
of the Air, too much of the Earth, are
pernicious and destructive. There is an
infinite wisdom exprest in the Mixture
and Proportion in every Creature.</p>
               <p>BEAUTY and Health, Agility, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and Strength, depend upon the due
Temperament of Humane Bodies. The
four Humors of Choler, Melancholy,
Flegm, and Blood are generally known:
But there are many other Juyces talkt
of besides, by the discreet and accurate
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52038:195"/>
mixture of which the Body of a Man,
or Beast, is perfected. Some great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
alwaies follows the excess
or defect of these. Disorder and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
go hand in hand, and are
attended by Sickness, and Death it
self.</p>
               <p>IN matters of Art, the force of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi>
is undeniable. It relateth not
only to our Meats and Drinks, but to all
our Behaviours, Passions, and Desires.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>All Musick, Sawces, Feasts, Delights and Pleasures,</l>
                  <l>Games, Dancing, Arts consist in govern'd Measures;</l>
                  <l>Much more do Words, and Passions of the Mind</l>
                  <l>In Temperance their sacred Beauty find.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>A Musician might rash his finger over
all his strings in a moment, but <hi>Melody</hi>
is an effect of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Order</hi>: It
springs from a variety of <hi>Notes</hi> to which
<hi>Skill</hi> giveth <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> in their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
A Painter may daub his Table <hi>all
over</hi> in an instant, but a Picture is made
by a regulated Hand, and by variety of
Colours. A Cook may put a Tun of
Sugar, or Pepper, or Salt in his Dishes:
but Delicates are made by Mixture and
Proportion. There is a Temperance also
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:52038:195"/>
in the Gesture of the Body, the Air of the
Face, the carriage of the Eye, the Smile;
the Motion of the Feet and Hands, and by
the Harmony of these is the best Beauty in
the World either much commended, or
disgraced. A Clown and a Courtier are
known by their <hi>Postures.</hi> A Dancer might
run into Extreams, but his Art is seen in
the measure of his Paces, and adorned
with a variety of sweet and suitable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours.
A Physician may kill a man

are those wherein every Simple

A Poem, an Oration, a Play, a Sermon,
may be too tedious, or too dull, or too
feeble and impertinent; but all its faults
are avoided by a fit Temperance of
Words and Materials. Temperance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where yields the Pleasure: And
<hi>Excess</hi> is as destructive as <hi>Defect,</hi> in any
Accomplishment whatsoever; Vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seated in the Golden Mean; It is by
an Artificial limiting of Power that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Thing is made as it ought to be, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and Perfect. All kind of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in every sort of Operation springs
from Temperance. A curious Picture,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52038:196"/>
a melodious Song, a delicious Harmony
by little invisible motions of the Pen or
Pencil, or by Ductures scarce perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the throat, or fingers, finisheth the
Work, where Art is the only power of performing.</p>
               <p>WE know that upon Mens Actions far
more does depend, than upon Dancing
and Painting: their Wisdom and Vertue,
their Honour, Life and Happiness. And
therefore more Care ought to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in the Actions of which their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is made up and accomplished.
In their Meats and Drinks, and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Nature changed; for instead of recrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
they consume ones Strength; and
instead of sitting a Man for it, devour his
Calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:52038:196"/>AN exact hand over all our Passions,
and a diligent Eye to extravagant Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tend much to our Welfare, Repose,
and Honour. Loose and impertinent
Laughter, excessive Cost in Apparel, a
Lascivious wandering of the Eyes, an
ungoverned Boldness which turns into
Impudence, an extremity of Fear which
degenerates into Baseness, a Morose and
sour Disposition, Anxiety and needless
Care, immodest and violent strivings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Things we too eagerly desire, inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Love, too keen and bitter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
a fierce and raging Anger,
a blockish Stupidity, a predominant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of Melancholy, too much Sloth
and too much Activity, too much Talk,
and too much Silence: all these are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
to be ordered and avoided: for
upon the right Temperament of these
we are made Acceptable and Amiable,
and being so, are full of Authority, and
can do within the compass of Vertue and
Reason, all that we desire, among our
Friends and Companions, for our own
good, or the benefit of others. And by
this means also we shall be admitted to
the society and friendship of Great men,
where a Nod or a Word is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52038:197"/>
more, than the strength of Oxen
and Horses among the dregs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But for lack of tempering these
Ingredients aright, and as we ought, we
become odious and insupportable, lose
all Esteem and Interest, are rejected, and
trampled under feet, as vicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>HERE you may observe, that all the
qualities and dispositions in Nature, are
ingredients and materials in our Lives
and Conversations, and for the most part
it is their Excess or Defect that makes
the miscarriage, when we erre in the
Measure. There is a certain mixture of
Gravity and Chearfulness, Remisness and
Severity, Fear and Boldness, Anger and
Complacency, Kindness and Displeasure,
Care and Carelesness, Activity and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Joy and Sorrow, Forwardness and
Reservedness; nay of Envy, Pride, and
Revenge in every Mans life, as well as of
Selfishness and flowing Courtesie, Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Policy; at least the grounds of
these things, which are neither Vertues
nor Vices in themselves, yet make <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi>
transcendently Vertuous, when
they are wisely tempered and united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:52038:197"/>I do not look upon Ambition and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice,
nay nor upon Envy and Revenge,
as things that are evil in their root and
fountain. If they be, Temperance has
a strange vertue in its Nature, for as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
make Antidotes of Poysons, so doth
this vertue turn the Matter of all these
into a Quintessential perfection. Nay
Selfishness and Pride it self escape not
its influence. A little touch of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like Pride, is seated in the true
sence of a mans own Greatness: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which his Humility and Modesty
would be contemptible Vertues. In all
baseness of Mind there is a kind of folly
and Cowardice apparent; and more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
follows an humble Man that is
sensible of his Excellency. An aiery Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
without something of the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
to ballast it a little, would be light
and trifling: And a melancholy Humor
without something of Air and Jovialness
in it, too sour and disobliging. Anger
without Softness is like untemper'd Steel,
brittle and destructive: and a plyant
Humor without some degree of stiffness,
too near to Flattery and Servility. Anger
is the matter and fuel of Courage, and
its appearance afar off puts a Majesty
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52038:198"/>
into Meekness, that makes it redoubted.
A sorrowful Humor neatly allayed with
a mixture of sweetness, begets a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and compassion in the Spectator,
that turns into a deeper and more serious
Love: A little Selfishness puts our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in mind of our own Interest, and
makes them perceive that we understand
it: which adds a lustre to our Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
and renders our Liberality more
safe and precious. Plainness without Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
is downright Simplicity, and Policy
without Plainness void of Honesty. The
one makes us Crafty, and renders us sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
the other exposes us, and makes
us <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> but both united are vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and prudent. By the appearance
of Revenge in its shady Possibility, a
man that never does other than Actually
forgive, does oblige for what is past, yet
threaten and discourage from the like
Offences. All these are the Subjects of
Temperance. A little spice of Jealousie
and Emulation are advantagious, in the
midst of our Security and Resignation.
They give a relish to our Confidence in,
and Prelation of others; and make our
Security and Civility taste of our Love
to the Person we prefer, and of our Love
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:52038:198"/>
to Vertue. There is not one Humor, nor
Inclination, nor Passion, nor Power in the
Soul, that may not be admitted to act
its part, when directed by Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>NOR is it unlawful to alter the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Complexion by Care and Study. I
know very well, that the Complexion of
the Body can hardly be changed by the
strongest Physick: and that Choler, and
Phlegm, and abundance of Blood, will,
where they are, have their Natural
Course without any remedy. But the
Humors of the Soul are more tractable
things; they are all subject to the Will
in their operations: and though they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
yet they cannot act, but by consent
and permission. I know furthermore
that Custom and Habit is a Second Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
what was difficult at first, becomes
at last as easie in its Exercise as if it were
<hi>innate</hi>; and that the Soul of a Vertuous
man does in process of time act by a new
<hi>Disposition.</hi> I know further that all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Operations are free and voluntary;
and that the office of Vertue is to correct
and amend an Evil Nature. Let no man
therefore be disgusted, because a <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up
man</hi> is Artificial, and not Natural: for
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:52038:199"/>
when the Conversation is sincerely gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to a good End, the more free and
voluntary it is, it is the more Noble: the
more Industry and Desire a man expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in attaining all these measures and
perfections, they are the more Vertuous:
and the Probity of his Will is to be the
more accepted. For Vertues are not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Nature, but Choice. Which how
free soever it may appear, is as stable as
the Sun, when founded on Eternal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
it secures any Friend in the good
and amiable Qualities he desires in his
Beloved, as much as Nature it self could
do, though they depend upon the Will,
which is capable of changing every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This of Temperance in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of our <hi>Humors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall add but one Note more, and
that is, That a wise man discards the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy</hi>
of all Humors, and will not
yield himself up to the Empire of any:
for he is to live the life of <hi>Reason;</hi> not
of <hi>Humor.</hi> Nor will he have any Humor
of his own, but what he can put off and
on, as he sees occasion. He will cleave
eternally to the Rules of Vertue, but will
comply in his Humor so far as to make
his conversation sweet and agreeable to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:52038:199"/>
every Temper. Religion and Charity,
as well as Courtesie and Civility, prompt
to this; and where these concur with
his Reason, and favour his Interest, he
may well do what S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught him,
<hi>become all things to all men, that he might
gain some.</hi> And this encouragement he
hath, A man by sacrificing his own, may
comply with the satisfaction of all the
World: and find his own far more great
and honourable, and sweet and amiable
in the End, far more high and blessed, in
the Love and Esteem he shall obtain
thereby, than if he had gratified his first
inclination without any respect to the
Prelation of others. It will bring him
to the fruition of Pleasures, far greater
than those he despised.</p>
               <p>TEMPERANGE in the full composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and use of Vertues, is far more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
and more immediately approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the end of Vertue, than any Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in Meats and Drinks: It is resident
nearer the Throne of Felicity, and seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us by her. You may see its Task as
it is prescribed in Prudence. But for
Example sake we will instance it in
Meekness, which of all the Vertues is the
most weak and naked. A meek Spirit
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52038:200"/>
receiveth its Temper, its encouragement,
strength, and facility, from the union
and concurrence of all the Vertues.
Knowledg is its light, and Love the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of its life and motion. Wisdom
guideth it to the highest End; Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is a great incentive thereunto,
while it teacheth us to esteem the favour
of God, and the excellency of those
Souls, whose value maketh us tender of
their Repose, and prone to honour them
with a due esteem, as well as to desire
their peace and salvation. Holiness ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
us to delight in our Duty. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
inclines us to sacrifice our own, to
the welfare of others. Mercy leads us to
pity their Infirmities, and more to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
their Misery, than to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
with their Distemper. Justice
makes us to pay our Saviours Love and
Merits, what we owe unto <hi>him.</hi> All these
establish the habit of Meekness in our
Souls. Fortitude does several waies
conspire thereunto, for it makes us to
adventure upon any Trouble that we can
fall into thereby, and puts a lustre upon
us in the act of Meekness. Patience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituates
the Soul to Afflictions, and
makes our sence of Injuries easie. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:52038:200"/>
minds us of other employments
than Anger and Revenge, even a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
Sorrow for our own Offences.
Humility gives us a sence of our own
Unworthiness; and a willingness to be
yet more low than our Enemies can
make us. It inclines us also to confess,
that we have deserved far worse, and
more bitter Evils; and to despise our
selves; which when we truly do, no
Injuries or Wrongs can move us. Faith
carries us up to higher Enjoyments.
Hope hath respect to the promised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Our Love towards GOD en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
us with Desire to please him, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to our Neighbour is prone to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him. Prudence teacheth us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no Figs from Thorns, nor better
entertainment from Briars and Brambles:
but rather to right our selves by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Wrongs, and to turn their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into our Vertues. Magnanimity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
the Courtship of Worms, and
scorneth to place its rest and felicity in
Trifles. Liberality is industrious to find
out occasions of Obliging and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
Contentment is fed by higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and beautifies our Meekness with
a chearful Behaviour. Magnificence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52038:201"/>
us to the most high and illustrious
Deeds, and by very great and expensive
Methods to multiply favours and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
on our Beloved: for all are our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
whether Friends or Enemies.
Temperance it self takes off the stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and sluggishness of our Meekness;
puts activity and vigour into it, that it
may not be a Sleepish, but Heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
nay, adorns, secures, and perfects
it by the Addition and Exercise of all
these; and by giving to every other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
its Form and Perfection, makes them
more fit and able to aid and assist us here.
It moderates our Passions, and puts a
better dose of Life into our Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If there be any other Virtue, it is
not so remote, but that it may lend us
its helping hand, and be subservient to
the perfection of our Love and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Which, however simple it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in Solitude, is very strong and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable,
amazing, as far from Contempt
as the Sun is from Darkness, when it is
animated with Courage, and made illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
by Love, enriched with Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and made bright by Knowledg,
guided by Wisdom to the highest End,
and by Prudence to well-known and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52038:201"/>
advantagious, tho inferiour Purposes.
When the Soul appeareth neither foolish,
nor Cowardly, nor base, nor soft, but
High and Magnanimous in its Operation,
Meekness is redoubted.</p>
               <p>IN the Throne of Glory all the acts
of Faith, and Hope, and Repentance shall
be for ever perfected, or swallowed up
in fruition. The fruit of all occasional
and transient Vertues shall remain, the
Divine Vertues shall be so firmly united,
that in their Act and Exercise they shall
be <hi>one</hi> for ever. By Knowledg we shall
see all that the light of Heaven and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
can reveal. By Love we shall
embrace all that is amiable before GOD
and his holy Angels. By Wisdom we
shall use the most glorious Means for the
attainment and enjoyment of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
End; which is GOD in all his Joys
and Treasures: in the use of those Means
we must actually enjoy all Blessedness
and Glory. Righteousness and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Goodness and Charity shall
with all the rest be the Lineaments and
Colours of the Mind, the Graces and
Beauties of the blessed Soul: They shall
shine upon its face, and it self shall be
glorious in the perfection of their Beauty,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52038:202"/>
as GOD is. Its Goodness shall make it
a fountain of Delights to all the other
Creatures. It shall be all Humility, yet
all Enjoyment: Amazed at its own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingness
and Vileness, yet ravished with
wonder and the height of its Felicity:
For the lower it is in its own Eyes, the
more Great doth the Goodness of GOD
appear, and the more transcendently
Sweet is its Adoration and Satisfaction.
By its Gratitude it sacrifices it self Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to the Deity, and taketh more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in his Glory than its own. It is all
Godliness and Contentment. All these
Vertues are exercised together in the
state of Glory, not so much by our own
Temperance, as by the Infusion of his
most Heavenly Grace, who fills us with
his own Fulness and Perfection by way
of Reward, and causing us to enter into
his Eternal Rest, maketh us <hi>to cease from
our own Works, as he also did from his,</hi> by
inspiring us with his own Wisdom, Life
and Strength, and actuating all our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by his own for ever: That we, by
vertue of his Grace infused, may live in
the Image of his Eternal Moderation,
and attain that extremity of Bliss and
Glory, which he hath (exceeding his
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52038:202"/>
Almighty Power) by an exquisite and
mysterious Temperance in all his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Divinely attained.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Temperance in GOD. How the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Almighty Power guided in its
Works by Wisdom, perfecteth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How it hath raised his own Glory
and our Felicity beyond all that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Power could effect by its Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF Moderation hath such happy effects
in Men, where the Strength is small,
the Wisdom little, the Matter base, the
Occasion low, as in divers Instances it is
manifest it hath: how glorious must this

               <p>IT would seem a strange Paradox, to
say, That Almighty Power could not
exist without Infinite Wisdom: but it is
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52038:203"/>
infinitely true: For the Wisdom and
Power of GOD are <hi>one.</hi> No Blind
Power can be Almighty, because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do all that is Excellent. That Power
would without Wisdom be Blind, is as
evident as the Sun, the want of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as great an impediment to its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the lack of Eyes is to a Man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth: which so Eclipseth and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his Power, that he cannot perform
those excellent Works, to which Light is
necessary. There is no Blind Power in
GOD, and therefore no Power distinct
from his Understanding.<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>By his Wisdom
he made the Heavens, by his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be established the Earth. By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Depths are broken up, and the
Clouds drop down the Dew.</hi> Wisdom is
the Tree of Life, which beareth all the
fruits of Immortality and Honour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial
Violence will never carry it:
There is a Mark to be hit; and that is in
every thing what is most fair and eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
It may be miss'd as much by shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over it, as by falling short of it. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Power cannot tell what to propose
as its Aim and Object. Only that which
is able to contrive, is able to effect its
Desire, in the Work it conceiveth most
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52038:203"/>
fit and excellent for its Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>IT is a stranger Paradox yet, That
Power limited is Greater and more Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
than Power let loose; for this
importeth, that Power is more infinite
when bounded, than Power in its utmost
liberty. But that which solveth the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and removeth the Inconvenience, is
our Assurance of this, That GOD can
do nothing but what is Wise, and that
his Wisdom therefore is all his Power.
And of this it followeth, That nothing
is possible with GOD, but what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Excellent: for to do any thing less
than the Best is unwise; and being so,
is contrary to the Nature of Wisdom
which is his Power.</p>
               <p>THE Will of GOD is his Wisdom:
By the meer Motion of his Will he Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all things, and therefore it is his
Power: his Power and his Wisdom meet
in his Will and are both the same. By
his Word he made the Worlds, and his
Eternal Word is his Eternal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>ALL this I speak because it is the
Office of Wisdom to propose the most
excellent End, and to pursue it by the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52038:204"/>
most efficacious Means: And because the
Wisdom of GOD will be found one with
his Eternal <hi>Moderation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE utmost End of all that is aimed
at, is indeed illimited: It is the Best and
Greatest Thing that infinite and Eternal
Wisdom could conceive: but being out
of all measure High and Excellent, it
includeth innumerable Varieties, that
are shut up in bounds for their greater
Perfection. Whereupon it followeth,
that GOD hath attained a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Effect, than if he had made any one
Thing singly infinite.</p>
               <p>HIS Love being Infinite and Eternal,
in sacrificing it self in all its Works for its
Objects welfare, became an infinite and
eternal Act; Which was not contented,
unless in all its Works, it added Art unto
Power, and exerted its Wisdom in all
its Productions. Had it made one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
some are of Opinion, it had exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it self; at least done all that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
both for it self, and for its Object,
and that one Infinite, being so Created,
must be its only Object. For more than
Infinite what can be? We are apt to
think that nothing can be beside. But
to shew that GOD is infinitely more than
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52038:204"/>
what we conceive, while we think him
infinite; and that we infinitely wrong
him, while we limit his Essence to one
single Infinity; Who is every way Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
in Himself, in all his Works, in all his
Waies, in all his Counsels, in every one of
his Perfections; He hath made every thing
either Infinite, or better than so. For by
variety of Effects he hath attained an
End in the Beauty and Correspondence
of all his Productions, far more Amiable
and Divine than any one Effect is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being. All Things by a kind of
Temperance are made and ordered in
Number, Weight and Measure, so that
they give and receive a Beauty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
every thing to, and from all the
residue, of inestimable value, in relation
to the Goodness and Love of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but GOD (would his
Wisdom have permitted such a thing)
could have made an infinite Object. For
whereever GOD is, he is able to Act;
and his Omnipresence is infinite Wisdom
and Power; which filling Infinity is able
to exert it self beyond all the bounds of
Space in an infinite Manner all at once.
If it so do, it cannot rest in a less Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52038:205"/>
than one that answers the measure
of its Operation: if it did, that Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be infinitely defective: For
infinite Wisdom could certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
one infinitely Better. But this I
will aver, that GOD hath wrought abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
more, than if he had made any
one single Effect of his Power infinite.
He hath wrought a Work that pleaseth
him infinitely Better, and so will it
please us, when we are Wise as he
is.</p>
               <p>HAD he made any one single Infinite,
it must be either Corporeal, or Spiritual:
Be it either, there is room enough in his
Understanding and Omnipresence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. Empty Space is an infinite Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in his understanding. But for the
Glory of his Moderation, it is evident
that he hath attained a far greater and
more perfect End.</p>
               <p>HAD he made an Infinite Object of
a Spiritual Nature, it must be a Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with illimited Power, to see his
Omnipresence and Eternity. And had
he made no more but only this, it is to be
feared that the Spectator would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
for want of Objects, in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which the Love of GOD should
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52038:205"/>
have glorified his Wisdom and Goodness
for its fruition.</p>
               <p>IF you say, the Omnipresence and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of GOD had been filled with
that Creature, it is evident that Spirits fill
no Room, though they see all things:
and that it had been much better if Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
had been prepared for its Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>HAD he prepared any one Corporeal
Object for the fruition of that Creature;
any Corporeal Object if infinite in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
would be wholly useless: nay
pernicious and destructive: for it would
exclude all other Beings to which it
might be serviceable, out of place,
and have nothing whereto to be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
               <p>IF you say it would be Beneficial to
GOD, or to that Spectator, or that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
Power, that Spirit for whom it
was made: It is apparent that no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Being can be serviceable to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but only by the Beauty of those Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
it performeth to other Corporeals,
that are capable of receiving them: and
that therefore all Corporeals must be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited

                  <l>But well proportion'd, makes the World compleat.</l>
                  <l>Power well-bounded is more Great in Might,</l>
                  <l>Than if let loose 'twere wholly Infinite.</l>
                  <l>He could have made an endless Sea by this,</l>

                  <l>A Sea that's bounded in a finite shore,</l>
                  <l>Is better far because it is no more.</l>
                  <l>Should Waters endlesly exceed the skies,</l>
                  <l>They'd drown the World, and all whate're we prize.</l>
                  <l>Had the bright Sun been Infinite, its Flame</l>
                  <l>Had burnt the World, and quite consum'd the same,</l>
                  <l>That Flame would yield no splendor to the Sight,</l>
                  <l>'Twould be but Darkness though 'twere Infinite.</l>

                  <l>And which is best, in Profit and Delight,</l>
                  <l>Though not in Bulk, he made all Infinite.</l>
                  <l>He in his Wisdom did their use extend,</l>
                  <l>By all, to all the World from End to End.</l>

                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:52038:206"/>In all Things, all Things service do to all:</l>
                  <l>And thus a Sand is Endless, though most small.</l>
                  <l>And every Thing is truly Infinite,</l>
                  <l>In its Relation deep and exquisite.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>THIS is the best way of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
things to the Service of each other,
for the fruition of all Spectators.</p>
               <p>MODERATION is not so called
from Limiting and Restraining, but from
Moderating and Ruling. If Reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that a Thing should be Great, it
is the part of Temperance to make it so.
Where Reason requires it is a point of
Moderation to enlarge and extend Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Nay to stretch it out to the utmost
of its Capacity if Wisdom order it, is
but equal. To moderate Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is to limit or extend it, as Reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
Reason requires that it should
be so limited and extended, as most
tends to the perfection of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
               <p>IF it be more Wise, and more tends
to the perfection of the Universe, that
Millions of intelligible Spirits should be
Created, and every one of them be made
in finite in Understanding, it shall be
done: If not, Temperance forbears.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52038:207"/>
If Sands and Atoms tend more to the
perfection of the World than Angels;
there where they do so, Sands and Atoms
shall be made, and Angels there where
they tend more to the perfection of the
World. So that every thing is best in
its proper place. Were there no Sands
or Atoms there would be no <hi>Universe</hi>:
For the Earth, the Sea, the Skie, the Air,
all Bodies consist of these, either united
or divided. If they had been lest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made,
and Angels had been created in
their Places, there had been no visible
World at all.</p>
               <p>TO make Visible Objects useful it
was necessary to enshrine some Spirits in
Corporeal Bodies, and therefore to make
such Creatures as <hi>Men,</hi> that might see,
and feel, and smell, and taste, and hear,
and eat and drink by their Bodies, and
enjoy all the Pleasures of the World by
their Souls: And by their Souls moreover
know the Original and End of all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the design of all, and be able
to celebrate the Praises of the Creator.
For by this means pure Essences abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from all Corporeity might enjoy
the World, while they delight in the
glory of its Uses, and especially in those
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52038:207"/>
compleat and amiable Creatures, for
whom it was prepared.</p>
               <p>IT was expedient also to make their
Bodies finite, that they might converse
together: but their inward Intelligences
of endless reach, that they might see the
holy Angels, delight in them, and by their
Love be delightful to them: that they
might also be able to search into the
depth of all Things, and enjoy Eternity;
Nay, that they might be fit Recipients for
the infinite Bounty and Goodness of
GOD, which is infinite in its Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>THAT they should be subject to his
Laws, and depend upon him, was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in like manner. For by that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
an infinite difference was between
him and them: that disparity being laid
in the foundation, though the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
they receive are altogether infinite,
the distance is still the more infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them: for the greater the Bounty
is, the deeper is the Obligation. The
Love and Service they owe is infinite, and
so is the Gratitude.</p>
               <p>TO see all his Glory is to be able to
admire it, and to adore it with infinite
amazement and joy, which is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:52038:208"/>
just unto it, and perfectly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing more, wherein
Almighty Power was by Wisdom infinite
to restrain it self for the perfection of his
Kingdom: And that is to create them free,
that were made to enjoy it. Not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
their Wills by a fatal Necessity,
but to make their esteem and fruition of
GOD and his Works their duty, and to
leave them to themselves for the more
free and voluntary discharge of their
duty. For by that means, it would make
them capable of Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in the Righteous distribution of
which the nature and the glory of a
Righteous Kingdom consisteth.</p>
               <p>THUS did GOD by infinite Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and by a sublime and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Temperance prepare his Kingdom,
and make every Thing exquisite in his
whole Dominion, to the praise of his
Glory, and the satisfaction of his infinite
and Eternal Reason. The similitude of
which Reason being the Essence of the
Soul, all these things fall out for our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and satisfaction also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:52038:208"/>NOW if GOD himself acquired all
his Joyes by Temperance: and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Kingdom is wholly founded in
his Moderation: We may hope that our
Moderation and Temperance in its place,
may accomplish Wonders, and lead us to
the fruition of his, by certain steps and
degrees, like those that are observed in
the Womb towards Manhood, and in
the School of our Childhood towards
perfect Learning.</p>
               <p>TOO much Rain, or too much
Drought will produce a Famine: the
Earth is made fertile by a seasonable
mixture of Heat and Moisture. Excess
of Power may overwhelm, but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is that which perfecteth and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Creation.</p>
               <p>ALMIGHTY Power is carried far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it self, or really is made Almighty,
by vertue of that Temperance, wherein
Eternal Wisdom is eternally Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>IF any thing be wanting to the full
demonstration of the perfection of
GODS Kingdom, it is the consideration
of his Delay: for we are apt to think, he
might have made it Eternally before he
did. But to this no other Answer is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52038:209"/>
(though many might be made)
then that all Things were from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
before his Eyes, and he saw the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Moments wherein to produce them:
and judged it fit in his Wisdom first to
fill Eternity with his deliberations and
Counsels, and then to beautifie Time
with the execution of his Decrees. For
were there no more to be said but this,
his Empire is eternal, because all Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nay and all Impossibilities are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to his Will. But if it be confessed
that Eternity is an everlasting Moment,
infinite in duration, but permanent in all
its parts, all Things past, present, and
to come, are at once before him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
together. Which is the true
Reason, why Eternity is a standing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
before the Eye of the Soul, and all
its parts, being full of Beauty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
for ever to be enjoyed.</p>
               <p>IF any man be disposed to cavil fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to urge, that GOD might at
the very first have placed Angels and
Men in the state of Glory, the Reply is
at hand: that GOD very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
the beauty of Proportion, that
Harmony and Symmetry springs from a
variety of excellent Things in several
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52038:209"/>
places, fitly answering to, and perfecting
each other: that the state of Trial, and
the state of Glory are so mysterious in
their Relation, that neither without the
other could be absolutely perfect: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Beauties would be lost, and
many transcendent Vertues and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
be abolished, with the estate of
Trial, if that had been laid aside, the
continual appearance and effect of which
is to enrich and beautifie the Kingdom
of GOD everlastingly: That GOD lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Man far more than if he had placed
him in the Throne at first, and designeth
more Glory and Perfection for him, than
in that dispensation he could have been
capable of: all which springeth from
the Restraint of his Power in some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
that it might more fully be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
in the perfection of the whole, and
of all things that were possible to be
made, might end in the Supream, and
most absolutely Blessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore upon the whole Matter, we
may conclude with</hi> solomon, Happy is the
man that findeth Wisdom, and the man that
getteth Understanding. For the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
of it is better than the Merchandize
of Silver, and the Gain thereof than of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:52038:210"/>
fine Gold. She is more precious than Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
and all the things thou canst desire
are not to be compared with her. Length
of Daies is in her right hand, and in her
left hand Riches and Honour. Her Waies
are waies of Pleasantness, and all her Paths
are Peace. She is a Tree of Life to them
that lay hold upon her, and happy is every
one that retaineth her. The LORD by
Wisdom hath founded the Earth, by Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
hath he established the Heavens.
My Son, let not them depart from thine
Eyes: Keep sound Wisdom and Discretion.
<hi>Wisdom is the principal Thing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
get Wisdom, and with all thy Get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
get Understanding. For the same
Wisdom which created the World, is the
only Light wherein it is enjoyed.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Patience. Its Original. How GOD
was the first Patient Person in the World.
The Nature, and the Glory, and the blessed
Effects of his Eternal Patience. The
Reason and Design of all Calamities.
Of Patience in Martyrdom. The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Reward of ordinary Patience
in its meanest obscurity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PATIENCE is a Vertue of the Third
estate; it belongs not to the estate
of Innocence, because in it there was no
Affliction; nor to the estate of Misery,
because in it there is no Vertue: but to
the estate of Grace it appertains, because
it is an estate of Reconciliation, and an
estate of Trial: wherein Affliction and
Vertue meet together. In the estate of
Glory there is no Patience.</p>
               <p>THIS is one of those distastful Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which GOD never intended. It
received its bitterness from Sin, its life
and beauty from GOD's Mercy. If we
dislike this Vertue we may thank our
selves, for we made GOD first to endure
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:52038:211"/>
it. And if all things are rightly weighed,
no Creature is equal to GOD in Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
We made it necessary for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
GOD-HEAD to be Incarnate,
and to suffer all the Incommodities of
Life, and the bitter Torments of a bloody
Death, that he might bear the Penance
of our Sins, and deliver us from eternal
Perdition.</p>
               <p>THE Corporeal Sufferings of our
Saviour are not comparable to the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his Spirit. Nor are there any
Sufferings or Losses so great as those we
cast upon the GOD-HEAD. He infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hateth Sin, more than Death: and had
rather be Crucified a thousand times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
than that one Transgression should
be brought into the World. Nothing
is so quick and tender as Love, nothing
so lively and sensible in resenting. No
loss is comparable to that of Souls, nor
any one so deeply concerned in the loss,
as GOD Almighty: No Calamity more
peircing, than to see the Glory of his
Works made Vain, to be bereaved of his
Desire, and frustrated of his End in the
whole Creation. He had rather we
should give him the Blood of <hi>Dragons,</hi>
or the cruel Venom of <hi>Asps,</hi> to drink,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52038:211"/>
than that we should pollute our selves,
or his Kingdom with a Sin. Nay it were
better (if without a Sin it could be done)
that the whole World should be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
than a Sin committed. For the
World might be Created again with
ease, and all that is in it be repaired
with a word: but a Sin once committed,
can never be undone; it will appear in
its place throughout all Eternity: Yet
is so odious, and so infinitely opposite to
the Holiness of GOD, that no Gall or
Wormwood is comparable thereunto.
To see his Beloved blasted, his Love
despised, and his Son rebellious; to see
the most amiable Law in the World bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
his Kingdom laid waste, and his
Image defaced; to see all his Labour
marred and spoiled, his Benefits slighted;
and his infinite Goodness abused and
undervalued; all Obligations imposed,
and all Rewards prepared, in vain: is
worse than to see ones Palace on fire as
soon as it is builded, or ones Wife smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with Leprosie, and ones only beloved
Son run mad. For a Child to trample
on his Fathers Bowels is nothing in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison!
He therefore that feels what
he made GOD to endure, what Grapes
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:52038:212"/>
of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Clusters of <hi>Gomorrah</hi> he
offered to his Teeth, how evil a thing
and bitter it is, to forsake GOD, how
the Scripture saith, <hi>He was grieved at the
Heart,</hi> when he saw the Corruption and
Impiety of the Earth; and how the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
inflicted was so sore, as to make him
<hi>repent that he had made Man</hi> in the
World: he surely will be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
at the Evil he hath <hi>done,</hi> than at
any Evil he can otherwise <hi>suffer</hi>: and
his Godly Sorrow (as <hi>Moses's</hi> Rod did
eat up all the Rods of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>)
will devour all other Sorrows whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>TO consider that GOD was the first
<hi>Patient</hi> Person in the World, must needs
sweeten the Bitterness of Patience, and
make it acceptable unto us: to consider
that we alone brought it upon our selves,
and may thank our selves for the folly of
its Introduction, must make us out of
very Indignation against our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to suffer, and in pure Justice,
quietly to digest it: but to consider yet
further, that <hi>GOD,</hi> by bearing our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
with Patience, took off the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of them from us, and by refusing to
ease himself of the greatness of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52038:212"/>
in pouring it back again on our
own heads, digested it so, as to turn our
eternal Torments into transitory Woes,
nay into his own Agonies and Pains on
the Cross: this will help our Reason to
rejoyce at <hi>our light Afflictions which are
but for a moment</hi>; especially since they
<hi>work</hi> out <hi>for us a far more exceeding, and
eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Impression of that abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mischief, which occasioned Patience
in <hi>GOD,</hi> made it a Calamity, but not a
Vertue. Detestation and Grief in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are but Sufferings, and meer Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
have no Vertue, nor so much
almost as Action in them. If his dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
and grief had broken out in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
we had all been destroyed:
Anger and Fury had been poured down
upon us. That which made it a Vertue
was the great and mighty Continence,
whereby it was kept in, and governed
for all our Benefit. For it was full of
Goodness, and Compassion, and Mercy,
and Love; and that was indeed the
vertue of Patience, in which so much
Magnanimity and Government did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
so much Wisdom, and Stedfastness,
and Immutability; and upon this vertue
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:52038:213"/>
of that Act whereby he retained his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
the whole Kingdom of Grace,
and the glory of his Mercy and Love,
and the blessedness and exaltation of
his Church is founded, it depended
upon it, and from his Patience it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>PATIENCE then is that Vertue by
which we behave our selves constantly
and prudently in the midst of Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and Troubles: That Vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we do not only forbear to break out
in Murmurings and Repinings, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
our selves from sinking under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
or suppress our Discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and refrain from Anger and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet;
but whereby we retain our Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the goodness of our Mind,
notwithstanding all the Confusions and
Disorders that would disturb us, and
demean our selves in a serene and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
manner, surmounting the Pains
and Calamities that trouble us, and that
would otherwise overwhelm us. While
we move in a quick and vigorous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
under our Burthen; and by a true
Courage improve our Afflictions, and
turn them into the <hi>Spoils</hi> of Invincible
Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:52038:213"/>IT is an easie Observation, that Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous
Times are the Seasons of Honour,
and that a Warlike-Field is the Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Plot
of great and Heroical Actions. Men
that live in quiet and peaceful Ages, pass
through the World as insensibly as if
they had all their daies been asleep.
Hazards, and Calamities, and Battles,
and Victories fill the Annals with Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and raise Great Men to an eminent
degree of Fame and Glory. It is Saint
<hi>Chrysostoms</hi> opinion, That a Man shews
far greater Bravery, that grapples with
a Disease, or surmounts his evil Fortune,
or behaves himself with Courage in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
bears the burning of his House,
or the loss of his Goods, or the death of
his Children with an equal Spirit, in the
midst of all Calamities retains his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
with Humility and Patience, and
Blesses GOD, chearfully submitting with
Resignation to his Will, and shews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Constant in all Estates: then he that
in the midst of a prosperous Condition,
buildeth Hospitals and Temples, shineth
in the exercise of Bounty and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and obligeth all the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Expence than that of his
Monies. A <hi>Pelican</hi> that feeds her young
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:52038:214"/>
ones with her Blood, is a more Noble
Bird than an Eagle, that fills her Nest
with <hi>Ravine,</hi> though taken from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:
For though that of a Sacrifice be
the more Sacred food, that of ones own
Blood is more near and costly.</p>
               <p>TIMES of Affliction are Seed-times
for a future Harvest. <hi>We are made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
through Sufferings</hi>: though the Way
be mysterious, and the Manner almost
incomprehensible, whereby the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
we endure conduce to our Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Consider the Patience of</hi> Job, how
great a spectacle his Sufferings made him
<hi>to GOD, Angels, and Men,</hi> and how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
he became by his Patience to all
<hi>Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Vertue has an Appearance, by
reason of its Objects and Materials, so
cross to its disposition, that if any thing
be difficult in all Nature to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
Patience is one, it being a thing
of the most deep and obscure value.
Its Nature and Effect seem contrary to
each other. It raises a Man by depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him, it elevates by overwhelming,
it honours by debafing, it saves by killing
him. By making a Man little and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
it magnifies and exalts him. No
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:52038:214"/>
Act of Love is attended with such bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Circumstances as that of Cruel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
in exposing our selves to all
Calamities that can befal our Souls, for
our Beloved's sake. It is the glory of
the good Shepheard that <hi>He laies down
his life for the Sheep.</hi> And for this very
Cause is our Saviour honoured by GOD
and Men, <hi>because being in the form of
GOD he made himself of no Reputation,
but took on himself the form of a Servant,</hi>
and died the most cursed <hi>Death of the
Cross,</hi> for the sake of the World: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
saith the Text (that is, <hi>For which
very Cause) GOD also hath highly exalted
him, and given him a Name which is above
every Name, that at the Name of</hi> JESUS
<hi>every Knee should bow, of things in the
Heaven, things in the Earth, and things
under the Earth.</hi> Nor is this Gift of <hi>GOD</hi>
so purely Arbitrary, but that it has a
foundation in Nature. Angels and Men
do not bow their Knees only because
they are commanded; but because they
see Reason to incline them to bow their
Knees. There is something in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Nature, Action, and Merit, that
deserves it at their Hands. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Love wherewith he loved us is
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:52038:215"/>
the Root, the Soul, and Glory of his
Passion. It is wonderful as it made him
willing to become Death, and Sin, and
a Curse for us. But the height of our
Extasie is in the Reality of his Passion,
and in the full accomplishment of all its
Purposes.</p>
               <p>IT is the Vertue of Love which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
into Patience, and the chief Elixir
of its Nature is founded in the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a Spirit, that Suffers for anothers
sake. This therefore we ought ever to
remember, That Patience when it is a
Vertue springs from Love; and that this
Love is chiefly towards <hi>GOD,</hi> and next
that to our Neighbour. When we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any thing for <hi>GOD</hi>'s sake, or for our
Neighbours good, we suffer in a Wise
and Vertuous manner. And the Honour
which follows such a Suffering is the
Crown of Glory which it shall for eyer
wear. It is a vain and insipid thing to
Suffer without loving <hi>GOD</hi> or Man.
Love is a transcendent Excellence in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Duty, and must of necessity enter
into the Nature of every Grace and
Vertue. That which maketh the solid
Benefit of Patience unknown, its Taste
so bitter and comfortless to Men, is its
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:52038:215"/>
                  <hi>Death</hi> in the separation and absence of
its Soul. We Suffer, but Love not. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
Love to the Person for whose
sake we Suffer, is its own support and
comfort; It makes the Action to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable;
and insuses a sweetness into all
the Affliction it can make us endure: A
Sweetness answerable to the Welfare and
Pleasure, which is either caused or secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
to our Object thereby. Our own
growth in the approbation and esteem
of the Person we love, is the desirable
Greatness which we covet to attain,
which can no way be confirmed, and
increased so perfectly, as by Suffering for
him. For our Fidelity, Sincerity, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Vigour, Life and Industry, can never
be made so fair and apparent, as when
we pursue our love, and are carried by
it to the utmost extremities of Death
and Misery, and labour through all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters,
Persecutions, and Calamities, to
obey, and honour, and please, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Object which in times of quiet
we pretend to love. In an easie and
prosperous Estate there is little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Friendship and Flattery:
but he that sticks firm in Calamity is a
Friend indeed. The Trial of Love
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52038:216"/>
consists in the difficulties it endures for
its Beloved.</p>
               <p>AND for this Cause it is, that <hi>GOD</hi>
will expose us to so severe a Trial: him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
ordaining some Trials in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
but permitting more, when we
brought them upon our selves: Many
also he suffereth to come, which we daily
bring upon our own heads by our own
folly. Some he inflicteth perhaps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for the Chastisement of our Sins, or
the Medicine of our Souls, to abate our
Confidence, and to excite our Care; to
awaken us out of our Lethargy, and to
quicken our sence both of our Miserable
Condition, and our need of his Favour:
to humble our Rebellion, to heal and
purge our Corruptions, to moderate our
Passions, to heighten our Penitence, to
abate our Pride, to increase our Ardour
in Devotion and Prayer; to make our
subjection to, and dependance on him
Clear; to stir us up to a more strict Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of our selves in our Thoughts,
Words, and Deeds, least some <hi>Jonas</hi> or
other should lie in the Ship, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
the Tempest upon us; to enkindle
our Compassion towards our afflicted
Brethren, and to enflame us with more
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52038:216"/>
perfect Zeal, and Love towards <hi>GOD</hi>;
It is like Wormwood that imbitters the
Nipple, to wean us from the World, and
augment our desire <hi>to be dissolved and
to be with Christ;</hi> to make us groan after
our <hi>Eternal Rest,</hi> and long for the <hi>glorious
Liberty of the Sons of GOD.</hi> Sometimes
he suffereth Tribulations and Trials to
come upon us, by the Perverseness of
Men, who being left at Liberty in their
dominion over the World, are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Authors of all the Troubles and
disorders in it. To know the several
springs and sources of Affliction is very
expedient; for our Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
much dependeth upon it. A
confused Apprehension makes us blind,
but a clear Sight distinguisheth between
the Will of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the Corruption of
Nature; which in our selves and others
is the principal Cause of all our distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances.</p>
               <p>BE it by which of all these Occasions
it will, or for which of all these Ends it
can befal us, it is evermore to increase
our Conquest, and to make us like the
King of Sufferings <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi> And
the Consideration of Gods over-ruling
Power and Providence therein, which
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:52038:217"/>
makes all these Things work to together
for our good, begetteth a grateful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
in us as well as a sence of our
dependance on his Goodness, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
the Fear of <hi>GOD</hi> in our Souls, and
animates us with great Wonder, that he
should put his hand to touch the vile and
evil Off-spring of our Sin, and turn all
into Good, and make it to rest in our
Exaltation and Glory by his Wisdom and
Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning</hi> GOD's <hi>End in bringing,
and permitting all these Evils, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is very frequent: It was one of</hi>
Job's<note place="margin">Job. 7. 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Contemplations,</hi> What is Man that
thou shouldest magnifie him, and that thou
shouldst set thine Heart upon him; and
that thou shouldst visit him every Morning,
and try him every Moment? <hi>Man is
magnified by his Trials. It was</hi> David's
<hi>Observation,</hi> The LORD is in his holy
Temple, the Lords Throne is in Heaven:
his Eyes behold, his Eye-lids try the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Men.<note place="margin">Psal. 11. 4, 5.</note> The Lord trieth the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
but the Wicked and him that loveth
Violence his Soul hateth. <hi>It was</hi> Daniel's
<hi>Prophesie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 35.</note> And some of them of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
shall fall, to try them, and to purge,
and to make them White, even to the time
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:52038:217"/>
of the End. GOD <hi>himself expresseth
his own Resolution,</hi> I will bring part of
them through the fire, and will refine them
as Silver is refined, and try them as Gold
is tried: They shall call on my Name and I
will hear them; I will say, It is my People,
and they shall say, The LORD is my
GOD.<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE meaning of all which places is,
not as if <hi>GOD</hi> did stand in need of all
these Trials to know what is in us: for
he knoweth what is in Man from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity:
before these Trials come he
<hi>searcheth the Heart, and trieth the Reins,</hi>
and discerneth the thoughts, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Soul: He seeth every Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the seed, every Grace in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
habit of the Mind, and every Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the Root. They lie in the Seed,
but yet he seeth a mighty difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
quiet Habits, and effectual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:
for they differ as much as the
Root and the Blossom, or the Blossom
and the Fruit. For Vertues to lie asleep
in the Soul, and for Vertues to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and fully perfected, is as great a
difference, as for a Vine to be of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
kind, and prone to bear, but to
remain without Fruit; or for a Vine to
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:52038:218"/>
bring forth, and to be really laden with
all the bunches of Grapes that beautifie
it. The Excellency of its Nature is
vain, if its Fruit be never brought to
perfection. There is a Glory in the
Work which the silent Habit is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of. It is the Life and Vigour of the
Exercise in which all the brightness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.
Even Diamonds in the Quarry
are dull and dim, they receive not their
full lustre and Price till they are cut and
polished. <hi>GOD</hi> hath placed our Trial
in sharp and bitter Atchievments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Love that is exprest in Agonies
and Conflicts, acquires other kind of
Beauties, that produce more violent and
strong Effects in the Mind of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and touch the Soul of the Beloved
with more quick and feeling Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
than any Love expressed in Ease
and Pleasure can pretend to. And since
all our Felicity consists in the violence of
Gods Love, his great and perfect Sence
of our Beauty and Honour, his full and
compleat delight and Complacency, all
that which affecteth his Soul with more
feeling and tender Resentment, must be

                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and precious to us, because

                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us more dear and precious to

him. We live in him more effectually,
and feel our selves rooted in his Love,
and crowned with his Com<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lacency
more abundantly, by how much the
more his Affection bleedeth, and his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(which enbalms Love) is stirred up to
receive us. And therefore it is that St.
<hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>We are in Heaviness for a
season through manifold Temptations, that
the Trial of our Faith being much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than of Gold that perisheth, though it
be tried with Fire, might be found unto
Praise, and Honour, and Glory at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 6, 7.</note> For as we have
before observed, Love is more effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in a condition of Repose, where all
is sweet and easie to our selves: there can
be no Fidelity, no Patience, no Fortitude,
no actual Sacrificing of all our Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Joyes to our Beloved; no
Victory over Death, and Hell, and the
Grave; no Self denial, no Endearments
springing from the same, no Prelation of
our Object above our selves; no loss of
Honours, Riches, Liberties, and Lives for
our Objects sake; and the more of this is
Actually done, the more of Necessity
must be the following Joy of Glory.
And for this Cause doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> further
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:52038:219"/>
exhort us, <hi>Beloved, think it not strange
concerning the fiery Trial which is to try
you, as though some strange thing happened
unto you: But rejoyce, in as much as ye are
Partakers of Christs Sufferings: that
when his Glory is revealed, you may be glad
also with exceeding Joy. If ye be reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
for the Name of Christ happy are ye,
for the Spirit of Glory and of God resteth
upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of,
but on your part he is glorisied.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12, 13, 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THIS he speaketh I confess of the
Persecutions, Imprisonments, and Flames
of the Martyrs, that were Gods Friends,
and the Champions of his Truth in the
World, that in vindication of his Glory
endured the Brunt, and received all the
Arrows of his Enemies in their Bosom:
but no Man has cause to be discouraged.
For where the greatness of the Cause is
wanting, and the apparent glory of the
Consequence unseen, as for the most part
it is in all our common and ordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
there to submit to the Will of
GOD, where there is so much Baseness
as in Poverty: in Sickness where there
is so much Unprofitableness, in private
Losses and Calamities where there is so
much Obscurity; meerly because it is
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52038:219"/>
GODS pleasure, and because in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things he hath infinitely obliged us,
and prepared infinite and eternal Joyes:
this hath a peculiar Grace in its nature,
that in ordinary occurrences makes our
Patience more rare and extraordinary.</p>
               <p>THERE are a thousand things that
may be said on this Theme, which for
brevity I must pass: All I shall observe
further is this, that as the Scriptures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the design of Patience, and unvail
the face of its mysterious Nature, so doth
Reason shew its invincible height and
magnanimity. Patience is a Vertue whose
element is in Miseries: it owes its being
to Pains and Calamities: were there no
Miseries there could be no Patience. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
are its Play-sellows, it feeds upon
Sorrows, thrives by Disadvantages, grows
rich by Poverties, it must needs sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
all Opposition, for the more it
endures the greater it is. It is impossible
for Calamity to hurt Patience: it is
made perfect by Sufferings. The more
Patient a man is, his Patience is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and the greater his Patience is, the
more strong and mighty his Soul is. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can quell him, or discourage, or
overcome him, that is compleat in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:52038:220"/>
He dareth all things, because he
can endure them. All his Martial and
Heroical Vertues are knit together in
Patience. Fortitude it self cannot win
the field without it. The most valiant
Souldier is but useless if he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
Hunger and Cold, and Heat and
Rain, the Incommodities of a March,
and lying on the Ground. VVhile he
that endures all things marches on, and
gets into the Field where Fidelity, Love,
and Loyalty are tried, and cannot be
hindered from the full and perfect exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of all these, because he can bear any
thing that is Evil, he can do any thing
that is Good: He will fight the good
fight with alacrity, and at last most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
attain the Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Kings favour.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Cause of Meekness is Love. It respects

object. It is the most supernatural of

Misery. Its manifold Effects and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.
Of the Meekness of <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Joseph.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>MEEKNESS is a Vertue of the Third
estate, as well as Patience. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
regards Calamities, Meekness
VVrongs. The Injuries that we receive
from others are its proper Objects. It
springs from Love, and tends to its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and Preservation. It hath
something peculiar in its nature, because
it gives Immutability to Goodness, and
makes our VVorth not to depend on
other Mens Deservings, but our own
Resolutions. It is fed by Charity, and
like a grateful Off spring of a Parent so
amiable, helps in its greatest extremity
to preserve it from its extinction. For
all Love by Nature dies into Distaste,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:52038:221"/>
when its Object hath offended: because
Approbation which is the first step to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
and Esteem it self which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to Love, have no other Object but
something that is Amiable and sit to be
beloved. And again every thing that is
divested of all its excellence, is common,
if not odious; and lost to our Affection,
till Meekness comes in to rescue and save
both our Love and it from its dismal
Period. Its End is the Recovery of
what has offended, Hope and Possibility
are the foundation of its exercise, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is the Guide by which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the satisfaction of our desire
in the restitution of Amity between us
and our Adversary.</p>
               <p>WHERE there is no hope that the
Beauty of what we love may be regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Meekness hath lost its <hi>Vertue,</hi> and
with that its <hi>Existence.</hi> For if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that an evil Person should ever
be reclaimed, it is to no purpose to be
Meek. He that can never be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
more, is utterly useless: Meekness
therefore which derives its solidity and
Power from its End, is in such cases
utterly abolished. For this cause it is
that we are to esteem our Saviours Blood
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:52038:221"/>
the ground on which it stands: since all
Nature without his Incarnation, Death,
and Passion, could never restore a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to the possibility of becoming Just
and Amiable. This Vertue of Meekness
respects the future beauty and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an Object that is now deformed;
It must needs be of transcendent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
since the practice of Meekness is
acquired by the price of our Saviours
Blood, and the first step to its exercise
did cost the death of the Eternal
GOD.</p>
               <p>IT is a transcendent Vertue, because
the Means of introducing it are wholy
Supernatural. It carries us above all the
Rules of Nature, above all the Principles
of Reason, and in that is Supernatural.
For by Nature we are to be Just and
Good towards all that are Innocent, and
kind to all those to whom Kindness is
due: but it is not by Nature either just
or rational that we should love any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is Evil: and how GOD came
to do it first is an infinite VVonder.
Though now since <hi>he hath first loved us</hi>
who are so vile, nothing is more natural
than that we should do as we are done
unto, imitate him, and love those whom
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:52038:222"/>
our Creatour loveth: With Pity and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
at first, that we may hereafter
do it, with full Complacency.</p>
               <p>That Humane Nature is infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
by the Incarnation of the Son of
GOD is confessed by all those, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Article of our Saviours Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
that the Earth how base soever
it seem is the Bride of Heaven, its own
quiet, and the embraces of the Skies,
that make it the Centre of all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
sufficiently demonstrate;
though few have observed that the Sun,
and Moon, and Stars dance attendance
to it, and cherish it with their Influences,
while the Earthly Globe is crowned with
the fruits of all their secret Endeavours:
That the Angels desire to look down
into those things which are done upon
Earth, the very Scriptures witness; and
yet for all this, it would seem a New
Doctrine, to affirm, that there are Works
done here upon Earth, that are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
above the Heavens. Yet all the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of the Holy Ghost, and all the
Good Works of Holy Men, especially
the Meekness and Patience of the Saints,
which are founded on the greatest Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in all Eternity, the Love of GOD to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:52038:222"/>
Sinners, and his stupendious Humiliation
and Passion for them, are set upon a
higher Basis than all Nature, except that
of the Deity, can afford unto us. Which
Note I make for our greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the works of Meekness. They
are all in Nature like the effects of our
Saviours Love to the greatest Offendors.
Reason it self is now exalted above all
its former heights, and there is reason
since our Saviours Death for the doing of
that which no reason, before he designed
to forgive, and Die for us, could lead us
to do.</p>
               <p>THAT GOD through the greatness
of his Love may condescend to such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
as are infinitely unworthy of
him, we see by the Examples of Kings
and Queens, and other high and delicate
Personages, that suffer their Children to
play with their Beards, and the Tresses
of their Hair; which other Persons
dare not so much as approach, for the
Reverence of their Majesty. I have
oftentimes admired at the mean Offices
to which Parents stoop, and the familiar
boldness they permit to their little ones,
to play with their Scepters, and Crowns,
and Eyes, and Lips, with their Breasts
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:52038:223"/>
and Jewels, and sometimes to pinch and
hurt, nay and to defile them too, being
unmindful of their State, and far from
all Anger and Indignation. But the free
Pardon, and desire of the Return of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and debauched Children, is a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
instance and resemblance of GOD, in
his gracious Dispensations, who suffers
all Nature still to attend us, though we
continually prophane his Name, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
his eternal Goodness by our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Transgressions.</p>
               <p>THIS Example of GOD, who died
for Sinners, in the Person of his Son, and
prayed for his Tormentors, in the very
Act of their Cruelty and Rage against
him, should prevail with us to esteem
all those whom he owneth for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as our own Bowels, and to be as
Meek and Condescending to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as Parents are to their Children.
The Reasons of which Duty are thus
variously offered to our Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>TO labour after those Principles only
that establish our repose in the estate of
Bliss and Innocency, is utterly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

                  <l>Ingratitudes, Calamities,</l>

               <p>NO Man but he that came down from
Heaven, and gave his Apostles power to
handle Vipers, and drink any deadly
thing without harm, was able to reveal
the way of Peace and Felicity to Sinners.
He, and only he that made them able to
trample Satan under feet, and taught
them how to vanquish all the Powers of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52038:224"/>
Darkness, was worthy to make known
this glorious mystery of Patience and
Meekness, by which in despite of all
the Corruptions and Violences in the
World, the holy Soul of a quiet Man is
armed and prepared for all Assaults, and
so invironed with its own repose, that in
the midst of Provocations it is undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and dwells as it were in a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
of Peace within it self, in a Paradice
of Bliss, while it is surrounded with the
howlings of a terrible Wilderness. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else can make us live happily in
this World, for among so many Causes
of Anger and Distaste, no man can live
well, but he that carries about him
perpetual <hi>Antidotes</hi> and <hi>Victories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE are two things absolutely
necessary to Felicity, outward <hi>Security,</hi>
and inward <hi>Contentment.</hi> Meekness is
as it were the <hi>Bulwark</hi> of <hi>Security,</hi> which
though it be as soft as <hi>Wool,</hi> is able with
more success to repel the violence of a
Cannon-Bullet, than the rough temper
of a <hi>Stone-Wall. Contentment</hi> springs
from the satisfaction of Desire in the sight
and fruition of all Treasures and Glories:
And as the Sun is surrounded with its
own Light, the felicity of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:52038:224"/>
becomes its own fortress and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For he that is throughly Happy,
has so much work to do in Contemplation
and Thanksgiving, that he cannot have
while to be concerned with other mens
disorders, he loves his Employment too
well to be disturbed, and will not allow
himself the thoughts of Revenge or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>IN two things Meekness is greatly
profitable to a Mans self, <hi>Possession</hi> and
<hi>Triumph.</hi> He that permits the Tumult
of the World to enter into his Soul, and
suffers the Temple of the Holy Ghost to
be defiled with Rage and Anger, makes
it an <hi>unfit</hi> habitation for the Blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Doves will not dwell in <hi>Pigeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houses</hi>
disturbed, or haunted with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min:
nor can Felicity be enjoyed but
by serene and quiet Thoughts that are
full of tranquillity. For <hi>where Envying
and Strife is, there is Confusion and every
evil Work. But the Wisdom that is from
above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle and
easie to be intreated, full of Mercy and good
Fruits. And the fruit of Righteousness is
sown in Peace of them that make Peace.</hi>
Which must of necessity precede fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as Triumph followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:52038:225"/>
WERE I for my life to interpret that
Text of our Saviour, <hi>The Meek shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Earth,</hi> I should in the first place
say, that every Knowing man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the beauty and glory of the whole
World, and by sweet Contemplations
delight in all the abundance of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and pleasant Varieties that are here
upon Earth, especially since by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Nature all men are to be his
peculiar Treasures. This he might do,
I say, did all men love him, and fill the
World with Glory and Vertue. But
since all is confounded by their perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and disorder, his Fruition is utterly
lost, unless he will forgive all Injuries,
and by the vertue of Meekness maintain
the quiet of his own Soul in the midst of
their distempers. The Meek man is not
fretted nor disturbed, but may enjoy all
Still: and the unspeakable Joy which
all the Glories of Gods Kingdom do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him, shall make him more meek,
and able also to pacifie, and rule, and
heal the minds of his Enemies, and even
by the love of Sinners to recover his
Right, and ancient Fruitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:52038:225"/>
TO be able to live at quiet, and enjoy
the felicity of Heaven and Earth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the attempts of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
makes them mad when they see
they cannot fret us, and so by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
a greater Revenge is seated in
Meekness than in Revenge it self. For
our Repose is their punishment and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that hate us. Their vexation falleth
on their own head, when they see they
miss of their aim, and cannot molest us:
but it is a joy to see our selves seated in
a throne of Repose, clean out of their
reach; it breeds a kind of triumph and
ovation in the Soul. The secret Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of its own Power is a glory and
satisfaction unimaginable.</p>
               <p>HE that masters his own Passion is
master of anothers mans, and seldom
falls into those Broils and Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that are the destruction of ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and hasty Spirits. Which made <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
to say, <hi>He that is slow to Anger is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the Mighty, and he that ruleth
his Spirit, than he that taketh a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HE that troubleth his own house shall
inherit the Wind;</hi> he that is nice and
exquisite in exacting all Faults shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:52038:226"/>
be beloved. They are disobliging,
angry, testy men that are hated; and
the Revengful that do frequently fall
into mischief. But to be kind to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
and the Evil, and to deal with
all men better than they deserve, is the
way to be beloved by the worst of men,
and admired by the best.</p>
               <p>MEEKNESS is the retreat of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the only force in the rear of
Liberality. He that does one Injury
after forty Kindnesses, blots out the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of all his Courtesies; and he that
revenges an Injury seems to do one. For
he that did the Wrong, seems innocent
to himself, because he felt it not; and
seeming innocent takes the Revenge as
an undeserved Injury, and is lost for
ever. Now some Injuries we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from our best Friends, which are
alwaies lost for want of Meekness. So
are all the Benefits we do, unless we will
forgive as well as give. But an Injury
forgiven is forgotten by him that did it,
and the Friendship continues at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and to the honour and comfort
of the Pardoner, as if no Offence had
ever been committed: Nay if afterwards
he comes to see the Candor of his abused
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:52038:226"/>
Friend, he that did the Injury loves him
better than before, because he pardoned
the Wrong.</p>
               <p>MEEKNESS as it preserves Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
between <hi>two,</hi> makes Goodness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
and unalterable in <hi>one.</hi> He shall
not be good long whose Goodness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
on others Merits. He is a
miserable weak man, that is of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptious
humor; he is a trouble to his
own flesh, and subject to the power of
every Wasp, whether he shall be good
or no. He is quickly stopt in his <hi>Careir</hi>
of Vertue, and easily turned out of the
way, that is apt to be infected with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Malice. He carries no Antidotes
about him, and for want of a Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
is in danger of the Contagion.
Meekness is a means of the health of the
Soul: a Passionate man being all over
<hi>sore,</hi> is covered with hot and angry Boils,
which cannot be touched.</p>
               <p>IT preventeth much mischief in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
An occasion of Anger is like a
spark of Fire, it is of great Consequence
where it falleth. If it falls into barrels
of <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> it blows up the World;
if into green Wood or watery places, it
does no harm. Penitent Tears, and the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:52038:227"/>
verdure of Humility prevent such flames,
and extinguish the quarrel. If <hi>Wild-fire</hi>
be thrown, I will put it out with my foot,
and not by throwing it back, give my
Enemy the advantage of retorting it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me. <hi>A soft Answer pacifieth much
Wrath,</hi> but virulent Speeches are a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
tossed to and fro, of them that
love Death.</p>
               <p>BY Revenge a man at best can but
preserve himself, by killing his Enemy:
but Meekness well managed, destroys
the Enmity, preserves the Person, and
turns the Enemy into an excellent
Friend.</p>
               <p>MEEKNESS is not the way to Peace,
and Repose, and Victory only, but to
Honour and Glory. As it is the strength,
<hi>it is the Glory of a man to pass over a
Transgression</hi>: He that is lightly angered
is quickly lost, and a fickle Friend is not
worth a farthing. A straw and a feather
shall forfeit all the Obligations in the
World, in some Tempers. Nay he that
is Revengful, is a dangerous Person:
and <hi>with an Angry man thou shalt not go</hi>:
He has the Plague upon him and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
Company. All this is dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
But a man that is a resolved and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:52038:227"/>
stable Friend, that cannot be alter'd,
that will not change, though he be
wronged, but forgive, and pity, and
continue to serve and love his Friend,
though he shews him some dirty Tricks;
he that will surmount all by invincible
Kindness, he is a solid and weighty
Friend, a rare Treasure, and exceeding
precious. Neither my Errors nor Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
are able to change him that
loveth me purely because he will love
me. When his Excellency be found out, he
will more highly be esteemed, not only
by his Friend, but by all that see him, and
note his Fidelity.</p>
               <p>INJURIES well forgiven are the
highest Obligations in the World: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if a man has been injured after
many Benefits. A Friend that will so
oblige, is more to be preferred than the
Gold of <hi>Ophir</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MEEKNESS brings a man into respect
with his Servants, and into power with
his Neighbours. <hi>Anger resteth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of Fools,</hi> but Meekness hath alwaies
this advantage, it is attended with Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and other Vertues, as Goodness
and Courage. A man that is prudent
in Affairs, and zealous of Good Works,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:52038:228"/>
faithful in retaining Secrets, and so full
of Love, that he is prone to do all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Good with industry, and is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
to expose himself to any Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
for the benefit of his Neighbours,
shall keep his Servants in awe, and yet be
beloved of them: He shall be able to do
among his Neighbours what he pleaseth:
He shall when known well, become the
Father of all their Families, they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
their Wives and Children in his
hands, as I have often experienced;
their Gold, their Bonds, their Souls, their
Affairs, their Lives, their Secrets, Houses,
Liberties, and Lands; and be glad of
such a Friend in whom to be safe, and by
whom to be assisted. But though you
have all the Vertues in the World, the
way to the use of them is blockt up
without Meekness: for your Neighbours
are few of them Wise, or Good; and if
you will be provoked by Injuries, you
will upon forty occasions so distaste
them, that they will never trust you.
You will look as like a Trifle, a Knave,
or a Fool, as one of them; and be as
very a Mad man. He that will not do
good but to deserving Persons, shall find
very few to do good to. For he shall
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:52038:228"/>
not be acquainted with Good men, and
from doing good to others he excludes
himself. But if all his other Vertues are
beautified by Meekness, such a man will
be like an Angel, and live above all his
Neighbours, as if he were in Heaven.
So that Meekness is his real exaltation.
And this made our Saviour to cull out
that Blessing for the Meek, <hi>The Meek
shall inherit the Earth.</hi> Even here upon
Earth the Meek are they that are most
blessed.</p>
               <p>TO do good to an innocent Person
is Humane, but to be kind and bountiful
to a man, after he has been Injurious, is
Divine. <hi>Philanthus</hi> gave Laws and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to the <hi>Parthenians,</hi> and was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
and banished: But he did them
good after the Injury, and was made
their God, as <hi>Justine</hi> recordeth.</p>
               <p>THE very nature of the Work en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
us to its exercise, because it
is GOD-like, and truly Blessed. But
there are many other Considerations mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us unto it.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>WHEN we understand the perfection
of the Love of GOD, the excellency
of immortal Souls, the price and value
of our Saviours Blood, the misery of Sin,
and the malady of distemper'd Nature,
the danger of Hell, and the Joyes of
which our sorest Enemies are capable,
the Obligations that lie on our selves,
and the peace and blessedness of so sweet
a Duty. Compassion it self will melt
us into Meekness, and the wisdom of
knowing these great things will make it
as natural to us as Enjoyment it self, as
sweet and easie, as it is to live and breath.
It will seem the harshest and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
thing in the World to sorbear so
fair, so just, so reasonable, so divine a
Duty.</p>

                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:52038:231"/>
NOR is it a small comfort, that the
more vile our Enemies are, the more
price and lustre is set upon our Actions.
Our Goodness is made by their Evil, the
more eminent and conspicuous: we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their Injuries and turn them into
Benefits, we make a Vertue of Necessity,
and turn their Vices into Graces, make
them appear more abominable and vile
if they continue obstinate; and the
greater their Perversness is, the more
great and honourable is our Vertue. It
was the praise of <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>the Man
Moses was the Meekest man upon all the
Earth,</hi> yet one passionate expression lost
him so much in the esteem of GOD,
that it hindered his entrance into the
Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> How great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
he was nevertheless in the
Conduct and Felicity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
how much he profited the whole Nation
by his Meekness Sacred story does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
How <hi>Joseph</hi> also dealt with his
Brethren, how he saved all the Family
of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Root by his Meekness,
and by Meekness purchased an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

               <argument>
                  <p>Humility is the basis of all Vertue and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
in all Estates, and for ever to be
exercised. As Pride does alienate the
Soul from GOD, Humility unites it to
him in Adoration and Amity. It maketh
infinite Blessedness infinitely greater, is
agreeable to the Truth of our Condition,
and leads us through a dark and mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
way to Glory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MEEKNESS respecteth others faults;
Humility and Penitence our own.
But Humility is more large than Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and is a distinct Affection of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature. Penitence is an exercise of
the Affection of Sorrow, and that only
for Sin. Humility is an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all our Vileness; it respects our
Original out of nothing as well as our
Guilt, our Weakness and Unworthiness,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:52038:232"/>
our dependance upon anothers Will, our
Debt and Obligation, the duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Allegiance which we owe,
and all the naked Truth of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It confesseth our homage, and is
sensible of our Smallness and Subjection.
All that a man hath received it distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
from what he is of himself:
And its Fruits or Effects are suitable to
its Nature. It is the Vertue by which
we think basely of our selves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
our selves in a lowly and submissive
manner. It makes us soft and pliant as
Wax, susceptible of any form that shall
be imposed on us by our Benefactour, and
prone to Gratitude. It is accompanied
with a high and mighty sence of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
received, and made Noble by the
honour which it inclines us to return to
GOD and Man for all the goodness
which they shew unto us. It is of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
use in our Felicity, because it
magnifies our esteem of all our happiness
and glory.</p>
               <p>IT is not through Ignorance, or want
of good Will, that we speak nothing of
Vices, the woful deformity of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exposed to view, near the excellence
of Vertue, would put a greater lustre on
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:52038:233"/>
all their brightness: but the abundance
of matter which Vertue it self doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
forbids us to waste our Time and
Paper in the description of their Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
The glory of their nature being
so full and perfect in it self, that it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the aid of those additional Arts,
which labour to set off the dignity of
imperfect things by borrowed Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.
And besides this, the mischief
and inconveniency of every Vice is so
great and manifold, that it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a distinct and intire Volume to
unfold the deformity of their destructive
nature, so fully as their baseness and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit
requires. It is sufficient therefore
here to observe, that Pride is of all other
things most odious to GOD; because it
puffeth up the Soul with Self-conceit, is
forgetful of its Original, void of all
Gratitude, and prone to Rebellion. Is
it not an odious and abominable thing,
for a Creature that is nothing in himself
to flie in his Creators face, and to usurp
a dominion over it self to the apparent
wrong of its Soveraign Lord, to rob its
Benefactor of all the glory of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to renounce and deny all dependance
on him, and to forswear its homage and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:52038:233"/>
allegiance, to ascribe all its Glories to
it self, and abhor all sence of honour and
gratitude, to look upon it self as the sole
original and author of all its Greatness,
and to be dazled so with the brightness
of its condition, as to forget the true
fountain of it, the goodness and the love
of him that first raised him to all that
Treasure and Dominion: to dote on its
own Perfections without any reflexion
on the Bounty of him that gave them!
All this is to act a <hi>Lie,</hi> and to be guilty of
apparent Falshood: It is as full of <hi>Fraud</hi>
and <hi>Injustice</hi> as is possible: and as full
of <hi>Folly</hi> as it is of <hi>Impiety.</hi> For Pride
aimeth at the utmost height of Esteem
and Honour; and is fed by its own beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and glory: yet foolishly undermineth
and blasteth the Person it would advance
with the greatest baseness and shame i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable,
it devours the Beauty which
ought to seed it, and destroies the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in which it delighteth. The higher,
the greater, the more perfectly glorious
and blessed the Person is that is exalted,
his Ingratitude (which is the dregs of
Baseness) is the more black and horrid,
and provokes the greater detestation.
It forfeits and renounces all the Delight
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:52038:234"/>
which the goodness of its Lord and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor
affordeth, it cuts off the Soul
like a branch from the root that gave it
life and verdure, it tends all to division,
alienation and enmity, it turns that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
which is its only bliss, into
wrath and indignation: And whereas it
delights in nothing more than appearing
highly amiable in the eyes of all Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
it falleth into contempt and extream
disgrace before all the Creatures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, that look upon it, and
behold its Unworthiness. No Toad has
so much deformity, or poyson, or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
as Pride, in its nature. It is the ruine
of all that is great, and turns the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of the Seraphims into the most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
of Devils.</p>
               <p>NOW if Pride be so pernicious, and
be by nature (though a meer Phantasie)
so destructive: what shall Humility be
which is full of truth and reality! How
forcible, how divine, how amiable, how
full of truth, how bright and glorious,
how solid and real, how agreeable to all
Objects, how void of errour and dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
how just and reasonable, how wise
and holy, how deep, how righteous, how
good and profitable, how mightily prone
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:52038:234"/>
to exalt us in the esteem of GOD and
Man! How agreeable to all its Causes
and Ends, how fit and suitable to all the
circumstances of Mans Condition! I
need not say more: It bears its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and carries Causes in it that will
justifie our Saviours words, <hi>He that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
himself shall be exalted.</hi> He that is
puffed up has but a counterfeit glory,
but Humility is full of solid glory. Its
beauty is so amiable that there is no end
of counting its proportions and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.
The Wise man that saw into
the nature of all things very clearly, said
long before our Saviour was born, <hi>Pride
goeth before a fall, but before Honour is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi>
He that exalteth himself must
needs be humbled, because the Colours
are envenomed wherewith he painteth
his face, which in a little time is discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and at the very first instant the
Painting begins to turn into a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Amiableness</hi> of Humility ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by its <hi>Excellency;</hi> on these two
the greatness of its beauty and success is
founded. It is so agreeable to all the
principles of Nature, and Grace, and
Glory, to all the desires of Angels and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:52038:235"/>
Men, to all the designs of GOD himself,
and to all the interests and concerns of
the Soul, that it cannot but be the most
advantagious Vertue in the vvhole
World. It is strange that a man should
look with the same Eye upon two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
so infinitely distant and different
from each other. But at the same time
he seeth GOD and Nothing, Heaven and
Earth, eternal Love and Dust to be his
Original. Self-love and Justice, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness, Joy and Gratitude
have the same Objects, but look upon
them in a several manner: and are very
differently affected with them. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
regards all Objects high and low,
Good and Evil: but with a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
and notice of its own. It takes them
in in another light, and discerns them all
with another kind of sence. It is in some
manner the taste of the Soul. Their
Truth appeareth to the eye of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
their Goodness is apprehended
by the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>fe of Love, the perfection of
their serviceableness to the most perfect
End is discerned by Wisdom, the benefit
which all Spectators receive is the delight
of Goodness, the incomprehensible
depth and mysterious intricacy of their
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:52038:235"/>
frame and nature is the peculiar Object
of our Wonder and Curiosity: they
help our Faith as they shew a Deity, and
the truth of all Religion and Blessedness.
As they are the gifts of GOD they are
the provocations of Gratitude, and as
they are aggravations of Sin they are
respected by Repentance. As they are
the means of our Glory, and our proper
Treasures, they are the Objects of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;
but Humility looks upon them
in relation to its Unworthiness, compares
them with it self and its own deserts, and
admires the disproportion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. It useth them all as grounds
of a deeper and profounder Lowness in
the esteem which it ought to have of it
self, and as the incentives to Love and
Gratitude; which it paies in the depth of
a more profound Acknowledgment and
Adoration.</p>
               <p>THIS habit or affection of the Soul is
not inconsistent with its Joy and Glory
(as by some foolish people, that are by
Ignorance and Errors far from GOD, is
generally supposed) but highly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
and subservient to its perfection. It
gives us the tenderest and greatest sence;
it passeth <hi>thorow</hi> all things, embraceth
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:52038:236"/>
the <hi>Poles,</hi> and toucheth all <hi>Extreams</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The <hi>Centre</hi> it self is but the
middle of its profundity: it hath a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dir</hi>
beneath it, a lower point in another
Heaven, on the other side opposite to its
Zenith. In its own depth it containeth
all the height of Felicity and Glory, and
doubles all by a mystery in Nature. It
is like a Mirror lying on the ground with
its face upwards: All the height above
increaseth the depth of its Beauty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
nay turneth into a new depth, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Heaven is in the glass it self; at
the bottom of which we see the Skie,
though it be not transplanted, removed
thither. Humility is the fittest Glass of
the Divine Greatness, and the fittest
Womb for the conception of all Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for it hath a double Heaven. It is
the way to full and perfect Sublimity.
A man would little think, that by sinking
into the Earth he should come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
He doth not, but is buried, that
fixeth and abideth there. But if he
pierceth through all the Rocks and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
of the inferiour World, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
on to the end of his Journey in a
strait line downward, in the middle of
his way he will find the Centre of Nature,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:52038:236"/>
and by going downward still begin to
ascend, when he is past the Centre;
through many Obstacles full of gross and
subterraneous Darkness, which seem to
affright and stifle the Soul, he will arrive
at last to a new Light and Glory, room
and liberty, breathing-place and fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>air
among the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and by passing
on still through those inferiour Regions
that are under his feet, but over the head
of those that are beneath him, finally
come to another Skie, penetrate that,
and leaving it behind him sink down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the depth of all Immensity. This he
cannot do in his Body, because it is gross
and dull, and heavy and confined: but
by a Thought in his Soul he may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is subtile, quick, aiery, free, and
infinite; Nothing can stop or exclude
it, oppress or stifle it. This local de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
through all the inferiour Space and
Immensity, though it brings us to GOD,
and his Throne, and another Heaven full
of Joyes and Angels, on the other side
the World; yet is it but a real Emblem
of the more spiritual and mysterious
flight of Humility in the mind. We all
know that the way to Heaven is through
Death and the Grave, beyond which we
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52038:237"/>
come to another Life, in Eternity: but
how to accommodate this to the business
of Humility, few understand. By this
Vertue we are inclined to despise our
selves, and to leave all the garish Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Earthly bliss, to divest our
selves of the splendors of Temporal
prosperity, and to submit to all Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Contempts and Miseries, that a good
Cause can bring upon us. In the eyes of
other men we are beneath their feet, and
so we are in our own, till we are gone a
little further: but on the other side of
all this Baseness, we find a better Life in
Communion with the Deity. <hi>For asmuch
then,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter, as Christ hath suffered
for us in the flesh,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> arm your selves likewise
with the same mind: for he that hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the flesh hath ceased from sin: That
he no longer should live the rest of his time
in the flesh, to the lusts of Men, but to the
will of GOD. For the time past of our life
may suffice us to have wrought the will of
the Gentiles, when we walked in Lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Lusts, Excess of Wine, Revellings,
Banquettings, and abominable Idolatries;
wherein they think it strange that ye run
not with them to the same excess of Riot.</hi>
There is a motion from Vice to Vertue,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:52038:237"/>
and from one degree of Grace to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
by which we leave the phantastick
World, with all its Shews and Gaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and through many Afflictions and
Persecutions, come to the real and solid
World of Bliss and Glory.</p>
               <p>WHAT hand Humility has in leading
us through all Afflictions, and in facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the way of Pressure and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I need not observe; I shall note the
Errour which men incur, by their Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Haste; who because they do
not immediately see the Bliss of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Patience, if they do not curse,
yet they boggle at all Calamity. These
men ought to be informed, that the
middle of the Way is not the place of
Rest and Perfection. They must pass
thorow all these things to the further
Regions of Clarity and Glory. Men are
not to stick in Calamities themselves:
but if Humility lead them to suffer all
Indignities with Patience, it must lead
them further to the bottom of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and condition; to the true light,
and to the clear and perfect sight of their
own Vileness: In which they shall see
their Original, their Misery, their Sin,
their Glory; their GOD and themselves,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:52038:238"/>
their Bliss and their Forfeiture, their
Recovery and their Saviour, their Hope
and Despair, their Obligations in the
height of eternal Love and Bounty, and
their shame and confusion in the depth
of their Apostasie and Ingratitude; their
infinite demerit, and GODS infinite
Mercy; the riches of free Grace, and
their own Unworthiness: And in all these,
<hi>the length, and breadth, and depth, and height
of the Love of GOD which passeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that they might be filled with all the
Fulness of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HUMILITY makes men capable of
all Felicity. All deep Apprehensions
and great Resentments, all extents and
distances of things, all degrees of Grace
and Vertue, all Circumstances that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the guilt of Sin, all Adorations,
Prostrations, Admirations, Debasements,
Thanksgivings, Praises, Exaltations, are
founded in Humility. All the Fulness of
all Estates, all Honour and Obedience,
all Devotion and Worship, all the beauty
of Innocence, all the deformity of Sin,
all the danger of Hell, all the cost of
our Redemption, all the hatred of our
Stupidity and Perverseness, all the hope
of Heaven, all our Penitence and Grief,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:52038:238"/>
all our Fear and Expectation, all our Love
and all our Joy are contained in Humility:
there they are expressed, there they are
exercised: There they are enlarged, and
beautified in like manner: There they
grow deep, and serious, and infinite:
there they become vigorous and strong;
there they are made substantial and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
All the Powers of the Soul are
employed, extended and made perfect
in this depth of Abysses. It is the basis
and foundation of all Vertue and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
whatsoever. It is in some sort the
very fountain of Life and Felicity it self.
For as nothing is great but in comparison
of somewhat less; so nothing is sweet
but what is New and Eternal. All Life
consists in Motion and Change. The
pleasure of Acquiring is oftentimes as
great, and perhaps alwaies greater than
that of Enjoying. The long possession
of that which we have alwaies had,
takes away the sence, and maketh us
dull: Old and Common things are less
esteemed, unless we rub up our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with some helps, to renew them and
our sences together. Gifts are alwaies
sweeter in the coming, than in the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with us. And if what I observe in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:52038:239"/>
the course of nature be of any force,
there is no possibility of enjoyment, at
least no perfection in fruition, without
some relation to the first Acquisition.
Old things are apt to grow stale, and
their value to be neglected, by their
continuance with us. I have noted it
often in the joy that young Heirs have,
when they first come to their Estates, and
the great felicity which Lovers promise
to themselves, and taste also when they
meet together in the Marriage-bed. The
pleasures of all which pass off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
not solely by reason of our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and stupidity, but far more from a
secret in the nature of things. For all
Delight springs from the satisfaction of
violent Desire: when the desire is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
the delight is abated. All Pleasure
consists in Activity and Motion:
While the Object stands still, it seemeth
dead and idle. The sence of our want
must be quick upon us to make the sence
of our enjoyment perfect. The rapture
proceeds from the convenience between
us, the marvellous fitness that is in such
Objects to satisfie our Capacities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.
The misery and vacuity must
needs be remembred to make that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:52038:239"/>
                  <hi>live,</hi> and to inspire a sence of it
perpetually into us. The coming of a
Crown, and the joy of a Kingdom is far
more quick and powerful in the <hi>surprize</hi>
and novelty of the Glory, than in the
length of its Continuance. We perceive
it by the delight which Lovers taste in
recounting their Adventures. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing makes the <hi>memory</hi> of
their first Amours more pleasant, than the
<hi>possession</hi> of the last. There is an instinct
that carries us to the beginning of our
Lives. How do Old men even dote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
lavish discourses of the beginning of
their lives? The delight in telling their
old Stories is as great to themselves as
wearisom to others. Even Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
would they give themselves the
liberty of looking back, might enjoy
their Dominions with double lustre, and
see and feel their former Resentments,
and enrich their present Security with
them. All a mans Life put together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
a perfection to every part of it,
and the Memory of things past is the
most advantagious light of our present
Condition. Now all these sparkles of
Joy, these accidental hints of Nature,
and little raies of Wisdom, meet together
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:52038:240"/>
in Humility. For an Humble man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendeth
to look into his Wants, to
reflect upon all his Vices, and all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
with far deeper designs than is
ordinarily done.</p>
               <p>WE recount these ordinary discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the inclination of Nature, because
Humility is (if I may so speak) the
Rendezvous of their perfection. All the
stirrings of Grace and Nature, all the
acts of GOD and the Soul, all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descensions,
and beginnings to advance
us, all his Gifts at their first coming, all
the depths and changes of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all our Desires, all our primitive and
virgin Joyes, the whole story of our
Creation, and Life, and Fall, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
in all the newness of its first
appearance, all our Wants and Dangers,
Exigencies and Extremities, all our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
and Delights are present toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our Humility; and are so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
near and present thereunto, so
sweet and vigorous in their mixture, so
strangely powerful in their influence,
that they inspire our Hearts, enter our
Thoughts, and incorporate with our
Souls, and are as near and sweet, as our
present condition, be it never so blessed:
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:52038:240"/>
All put together is far more sweet than
our present Condition, a great part of
our felicity and glory is in it, while we
take it in by our Conceptions here, and
apply it to our Souls, in an humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but it will be much more our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in Heaven. It is of so much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that a Great Divine in our <hi>English</hi>
Zion said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> 
                  <hi>The greater part of our eternal
happiness will consist in a grateful Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
(not of our Joyes to come, but) <hi>of
Benefits already received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW look into the office and work
of Humility. I will not tell you how
here upon Earth it shunneth all strife and
contention about Places; and all the
Mischiefs consequent thereto; nor of the
Unity, and Peace, and Honour it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.
These are all but Temporal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.
It has ten thousand other Walks
and Circuits, and periods of Revolution.
I will tell you how it behaves it self in
Paradice and in Heaven.</p>
               <p>HUMILITY by leading us to the
bottom of our Condition, sets our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
before our eyes, considers that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
abyss of Idleness and Vacuity out
of which we were taken, that miracle
by which we were made of Nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:52038:241"/>
How destitute we should have been in
our selves had not GOD created the
World, had he not been pleased to
communicate himself and his Glory to
us. How weak and unable we were to
devise or desire any Felicity, yet how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
necessary the preparation of it
after we were created. How great our
desires and expectations were, how sore
and urgent our wants and necessities:
how much we needed infinite Wisdom,
and almighty Power to fill Immensity
with the omnipresence of their Glory,
and to fill their omnipresence with Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and Treasures: How gracious and
good GOD was to do all this for us,
without our asking: and how justly
<hi>Davids</hi> rapture may be taken up by the
Soul,<note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>The King shall joy in thy strength,
O Lord, and in thy Salvation how greatly
shall he rejoyce! Thou preventest him with
the blessings of Goodness, thou settest a
Crown of pure Gold on his head! His
glory is great in thy Salvation, Honour and
Majesty hast thou laid upon him. For thou
hast made him most Blessed for ever; thou
hast made him exceeding glad with thy
Countenance!</hi> We might have been
made, and put, in the condition of Toads;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:52038:241"/>
who are now created in the Image of
GOD, have dominion over all his Works,
and are made capable of all Eternity.
The infinite condescention of GOD is
the amazement of the Soul: The depth
of its low estate increaseth the height of
its exaltation. All that it wanted in it
self it findeth in the goodness of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour,
and the joy of being so Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
is greater than that of having all
these things of our selves for ever. For
the Love of GOD alone, and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Giving, is our last, and best, and
proper Felicity. Hereupon follows the
extinction of all Envy, Regret, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment;
the sacrificing of our selves,
the annihilating of our selves, the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our selves; And the Exaltation
of GOD, and the Adoration of GOD,
and the Joy of adoring the Greatest of
all other; The Amity and Friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
GOD and his Creature, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of both, and their happiness for ever.
Without this Humility of looking into
the <hi>bottom</hi> of our first Condition, all this
is impossible: And for this cause is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
an eternal Vertue, in all estates
for ever to be enjoyed; (I might have
said) exercised.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:52038:242"/>
THUS in the estate of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
all the odiousness of our Guilt,
all our despair and deformity, all our
shame and misery, all the necessity of
Hating GOD and being hated of him,
comes before the eyes of an humble
Soul, with all the mercies and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of eternal Love in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>AND in the state of Glory it self all
the particular Sins, Neglects, Rebellions,
Apostasies, and Villanies we committed
against GOD after all his mercy and
goodness in the Death of his Son; how
infinitely base we were in despising all
his Bounties and Glories; how infinitely
those Offences made us unworthy of
Heaven, and the eternal Glory we now
enjoy; how marvellous and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his Love was, in pursuing us with so
much Long-suffering and Patience; how
amiable he is, and how vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
we are in all this, it is the office
of Humility to feel and ponder. Thus
you see its work, and you may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
at its eternal Reward. All things
are in it, in the utmost height and depth
of Resignation and Contentment, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:52038:242"/>
I need not observe that sweetness of
Conversation, that Civility, and Courtesie,
that springs from Humility. The Meek and
Lowly are the same men: the Kind, and
Charitable, and the Affable and the
good are all of them Humble, and so are
all they that prefer others above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and render themselves amiable by
honouring their Inferiours, and giving
place to their Equals. At least they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Humility as Complemental Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
do, for their advantage. And it is no
small token of its excellency, that the
greatest enemies of Humility and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
are forced sometimes to flie to it for
succour; as those that well know they
can never thrive, nor prosper in the
World without Esteem, nor gain Esteem
without covering their Vices under the
mask of Vertue. All the advantages and
effects of this will be enjoyed eternally.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That Contentment is a Vertue. Its Causes
and its Endi: Its Impediments, Effects,
and Advantages. The way to attain and
secure Contentment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THOUGH we have not named it,
in our first distribution of Vertue
into its several kinds, yet the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
which Contentment hath in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
imports it to be a Vertue: so does
the difficulty of attaining it, and the
great and mighty force it is of in our
Lives and Conversations. <hi>Having Food
and Rayment,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>let us
therewith be content: For Godliness with
Contentment is great Gain.</hi> Where he
fitly noteth, that Godliness is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of true Contentment, and that the
Gain of so great a Vertue is inestimable.
The truth is, it is impossible to be happy,
or grateful without it. A discontented
Mind is exceeding prone to be peevish
and fretful, and throws a man into all
the indecencies of Avarice, Ambition,
Envy, Treason, Murther, Contention,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:52038:243"/>
Turbulency, Murmuring, Repining, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
and Sowrness, Anger, Baseness
and Folly, into all the Malevolence and
Misery which can disorder the Soul, or
disturb the World. Suspicion, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
Enmity against GOD, Fear and
Cowardice, Barrenness in good and
praise-worthy Employments, Weariness
and Complaint, hatred of Retirement,
Spiritual Idleness and Ignorance are its
Companions, followed by Debaucheries,
and all the sorts of vile and wicked Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions.
For Man is an unwelcome
Creature to himself till he can delight in
his Condition, and while he hates to be
alone, exposeth himself to all kind of
Mischiefs and Temptations, because he is
an active Creature, and must be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
something, either Good, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TRUE Contentment is the full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of a Knowing Mind.</hi> It is not a
vain and empty Contentment, which is
falsely so called, springing from some one
particular little satisfaction, that however
Momentany it be, does for the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
our Humour: but a long habit of
solid Repose, after much study and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Consideration. It is not the slavish
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:52038:244"/>
and forced Contentment, which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
among the <hi>Heathen</hi> did force
upon themselves; but a free and easie
Mind attended with pleasure, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
rising from ones present Condition.
It is not a morose and sullen Contempt
of all that is Good. That Negative
Contentment, which past of Old for so
great a Vertue, is not at all conducive to
Felicity, but is a real Vice: for to be
Content without cause, is to sit down in
our Imperfection: and to seek all ones
Blis in ones self alone, is to scorn all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Objects, even GOD himself and all
the Creation. It is a high piece of Pride
and stiffness in a man, that renders him
good for nothing, but makes him Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
and Presumptuous in the midst of
his blindness, his own slave and his own
Idol, a Tyrant over himself, and yet his
only Deity. It makes a man to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
GOD in the World, and cuts him
off from the Universe. It makes him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
either of Obligation or Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
his own Prison and his own Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntour.
It shuts up the Soul in a Grave,
and makes it to lead a living Death, and
robs it of all its Objects. It mingles
Nature and Vice in a confusion, and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:52038:244"/>
makes a man fight against Appetite and
Reason. Certainly that Philosopher has
a hard task, that must fight against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and trample under foot the essence
of his Soul, to establish his Felicity!</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Contentment is a sleepy thing!</l>
                  <l>If it in Death alone must die;</l>
                  <l>A quiet Mind is worse than Poverty!</l>
                  <l>Unless it from Enjoyment spring!</l>
                  <l>That's Blessedness alone that makes a King!</l>
                  <l>Wherein the Joyes and Treasures are so great,</l>
                  <l>They all the powers of the Soul employ,</l>
                  <l>And fill it with a Work compleat,</l>
                  <l>While it doth all enjoy.</l>
                  <l>True Joyes alone Contentment do inspire,</l>
                  <l>Enrich Content, and make our Courage higher.</l>
                  <l>Content alone's a dead and silent Stone:</l>
                  <l>The real life of Bliss</l>

                  <l>Where all Enjoyment is</l>
                  <l>The Soul of Man is so inclin'd to see,</l>
                  <l>Without his Treasures no mans Soul can be,</l>
                  <l>Nor rest content Uncrown'd!</l>
                  <l>Desire and Love</l>
                  <l>Must in the height of all their Rapture move,</l>
                  <l>Where there is true Felicity.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:52038:245"/>Employment is the very life and ground</l>
                  <l>Of Life it self: whose pleasant Motion is</l>
                  <l>The form of Bliss:</l>
                  <l>All Blessedness a life with Glory Crown'd.</l>
                  <l>Life! Life is all: in its most full extent</l>
                  <l>Stretcht out to all things, and with all Content!</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The only reason why a Wise and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man is satisfied with Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is because he sees himself made
possessour of all Felicity, the image of
the Deity, the great Object of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Love, and in another way far more
Divine and perfect, the Heir of the
World, and of all Eternity. He knows
very well, that if his honour be so great,
as to live in Communion with GOD in
the fruition of all his Joyes, he may very
well spare the foul and feeble Delights
of men: And though the Law be not
so severe, as to command him to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
without Food and Rayment: yet if
for GOD's sake he should by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Men be bereaved of both, he
may well be Patient, nay and die with
glory. And this indeed is that which
maketh Contentment so great a Vertue.
It hath a powerful influence upon us in
all Estates; to take off our Perplexity,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:52038:245"/>
Sollicitude and Care, and to adorn our
lives with Liberty and Chearfulness, by
which we become acceptable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
to the Sons of Men. It makes
us prone to be Kind and Liberal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we become Obliging and full of
good Works. For it delivers us from all
servile Fear, and gives us Courage and
Confidence in GOD. For well may we
dare to trust him in such little Matters,
who has manifested his Friendship and
Bounty in such infinite good things, and
made it impossible for us to be Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if we are pleasing to him. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and full Contentment elevates
the Soul above all the World, and makes
it Angelical: it instills a Divine and
Heavenly Nature, enflames the Soul with
the love of GOD, and moves it to delight
in Devotion and Prayer. The sweetness of
his Thoughts, and the beauty of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
draws a Lover often into Solitudes.
And a Royal Man in a strange Country
(especially when he has heard tidings of
his Fathers Death, and the devolving of
his Crown and Throne on himself) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be alone, that he may digest these
Affairs in his Thoughts a little: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in being retired, because he can
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:52038:246"/>
find nothing worthy of himself in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Magnanimous Souls are above
Garlands and Shepherds: And there is
no greatness of Soul like that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Contentment inspires.</p>
               <p>BUT that which above all other
things makes me to note the Vertue of
Contentment, is its great influence, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy,
and power in confirming our
Faith. For when I see the <hi>Beauty</hi> of
Religion I know it to be <hi>true.</hi> For
such is its excellency, that if you remove
it out of the World, all the things in
Heaven and Earth will be to no purpose.
The business of Religion is the Love of
GOD, the Love of Angels and Men,
and the due esteem we owe to inferiour
Creatures. Remove this Love, this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
this Due Esteem, this delight that
we should take in all amiable Objects;
Life and Pleasure are extinguished. I
see Nature it self teaching me Religion:
And by the admirable Contexture of the
Powers of my Soul, and their fitness for
all Objects and Ends, by the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Excellency of the Laws prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and the worthiness and Beauty of
all the Objects for which my power are
prepared, see plainly, that I am infinitely
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:52038:246"/>
Beloved: and that all the cross and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
things, that are now upon Earth,
are meer Corruptions and depravations
of Nature, which free Agents have let
in upon themselves. All which since they
are reducible to the Government of
Reason, and may be Wisdom be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to my higher happiness, I am sure
I am redeemed, and that there is some
eternal Power that governs the World
with so much Goodness for my felicity,
since I my self was not able to do it.
That all Ages are beautified by his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for my enjoyment I hope in like
manner: nay I see it plainly. And of all
these Joyes the Cross of Christ is the
Root and Centre.</p>
               <p>I confess it is difficult to gain this high
and divine Contentment, because its
measure and value is infinite: Nay there
are other causes both Temporal and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
that may seem to be impediments.
One was a business which David did
experience, <hi>The prosperity of the Wicked.</hi>
They live in so much Splendour, Pomp,
and Grandeur, have so much Respect and
Reverence paid unto them, and reign as
it were in the high Esteem of all that are
round about them in such a manner, that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:52038:247"/>
a Poor good man is hardly lookt upon
among them. His condition seemeth
Servile, and he is little regarded. <hi>David</hi>
carried the Temptation far higher, <hi>yet</hi>
triumphed over it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 1, &amp;c. <hi>Truly
GOD is good to</hi> Israel, <hi>even to such as are
of a clean heart. But as for me my feet
were almost gone, my steps had well nigh
slipt. For I was envious at the foolish,
when I saw the prosperity of the Wicked.
For all the day long have I been plagued,
and chastened every morning.</hi> Whether
it be through Nature, or its Corruption,
I cannot tell (at least I will not stand to
dispute it) but it is somewhat grievous,
to see men of the same mould with our
selves so highly magnified, and our selves
slighted, and unable to appear with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
among them: because the true
Greatness of our Souls is hidden, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and buried as it were in the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Condition. But yet we have
excellent Company, <hi>David</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles, and all
the Martyrs, that are now so glorious.
And if you please you may consider,
what these Great men do when the <hi>shew</hi>
is over: We when we come <hi>abroad</hi> are
weak and despised, and they when they
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:52038:247"/>
                  <hi>are alone.</hi> A Vertuous man is Great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and glorious in his Retirements, is
honoured also among men in Truth and
<hi>Reality;</hi> the rest make an outward shew,
and are honoured in <hi>Ceremony.</hi> We are
accepted in the eyes of GOD and his
holy Angels, and they are condemned:
Their Life is a Dream, and ours is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
We expatiate over all the World
with infinite Joy and Pleasure in our
Solitudes, and they are nothing when
they return to themselves. That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the greatest difficulty of all doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
is the boundless desire and ambition
of the Soul, whereby we are tempted to
envy any thing that is above us, and for
ever to be displeased unless our glory
and blessedness be Eternal; I do not
mean Immortal only, but of everlasting
Extent, and infinite Beauty. We soar
to the Best and highest of all that is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
And unless in all Ages and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
our Satisfaction be compleat, and
our Pleasure exquisite; we are prone to
be tormented with the perfection of our
Desires. But GOD having given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and all his Kingdom and Glory to
us, there is no room for Complaint. All
his Power being glorified by his Wisdom
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:52038:248"/>
and Goodness for our advancement, we
need nothing but a clear sight of the
face of Truth, and a lively sence of our
Condition, to ravish and transport us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Extasies, and Praises.</p>
               <p>THE happiness of a Contented Spirit
consists not alone in the fruitions of its
Bliss, but in the fruits and effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
in our Lives. It gives us many
advantages over Sin, Temptation, Fear,
Affliction, Poverty, Sickness, Death, and
all other Casualties to which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious,
by reason of our frail and fickle
condition. But all these I shall pass over,
and only mention two, which are worth
our care and desire; <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS there is a vain and empty Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so there is a rash and foolish Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
For a man to wink at all Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
to which he is exposed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any consideration of what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
him, to give himself up to his ease
and pleasure, is as great a madness, as it
is for a <hi>General</hi> environed with Enemies
to sleep without his <hi>Guards,</hi> or be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
negligent of his <hi>Camp,</hi> and his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
But when he has Conquered all his
Enemies, then to be filled with <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:52038:248"/>
fears, and <hi>Pannick</hi> terrours, is as
great a weakness, as a man of Worth can
be capable of. Even in the midst of
them, when he has surveyed all their
strengths, and made full provision for
their incursions; he may take his rest
with liberty: provided he be moderate
and wary in his proceedings. This last
is our Condition. We must not live as
if there were no Sickness and Death in
the World. We must remember there
are Calamities of every kind, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our selves with Principles and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against them all, <hi>put on the whole
Armour of GOD,</hi> which is called some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>the Armour of Light,</hi> and stand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for all Assaults whatsoever. When
we have so done, as it is a terrible thing
to be surprized, so it is a glorious thing
with open eyes to see and know all the
Evil that is in Death, Imprisonment, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
Shame and Poverty, Famine,
Banishment, Pain and Torment; and
yet to be secure in the midst of our frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
There is a worthless, and there is
a divine Security: It is a poor business
for a man to be secure, that has nothing
to lose. A Beggar sings upon the Road
without any fear of Thieves. But to be
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:52038:249"/>
full of Gold and Jewels, yet safe
from danger; to be secure in a Palace
of Delights; in the midst of a Kingdom,
and in the possession of all its glory to
rest with safety, this is a valuable and
sweet Security, a safety enriched with
solid Enjoyments, much more is it here
upon Earth to have the bliss and security
of Angels. Among Wolves, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and Bears and Dragons; among
Thieves and Murtherers, Bloody Men
and Devils; among Dead-mens Bones,
and Graves and Sepulchres, when show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Arrows fall round about us, and
Hell is beneath us; this is something
more than to be secure where no danger
is near, no Calamity possible. It is a
kind of triumph in Security, and hath a
peculiar glory in it which the very secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Heaven is incapable of. And
yet poor frail Man obnoxious and liable
to all these destructions is safe among
them all, when he is once gotten into
the heart of GOD's Kingdom, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Felicity. Its very Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are its Strengths. He knows himself
beloved of the eternal GOD, and that
the King of Terrors is but a disguised
Bug-Bear, a dark and doleful passage to
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:52038:249"/>
the Ignorant, but to him a bright and
transparent way to the King of Glory.
This Blessedness is of stable, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
nature, which nothing can destroy.
It digesteth all kind of Evils, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them into nourishment. There is a
Wisdom above us, and a Wisdom within
us, that maketh <hi>all things work together
for good to them that love GOD,</hi> and
nothing is able to hurt us but our
selves.</p>
               <p>Now for Power which Felicity gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth:
There is an intrinsick power in
the enjoyment it self, for which Felicity
is to be admired: in comparison of
which all other Powers are but poor and
feeble. To speak with the tongue of
Men and Angels, to move Mountains, or
turn them into Gold, to raise the Dead,
to command the Sun, are common
things: The power of creating Worlds
is but vain, without the power of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
them. All Honour, Pleasure and
Glory are shut up in Felicity. Had we a
power of Creating and enjoying all
Worlds, it were infinitely short of the
power of enjoying GOD, because he is
infinitely greater and higher than all.
the Creating Power is superfluous to us,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:52038:250"/>
because all is most exquisite and perfect
already. The fools Wishing Cap, and
the Philosophers Stone are but trifles:
All things (that are not gold) are better
than gold. Felicity giveth us the power
of enjoying all, even GOD himself, all
Angels and Men, and all Worlds, nay all
their Riches, Splendors and Pomps in
their places, which is the most amiable
and desirable, the most sweet and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Power of all other.</p>
               <p>BUT when we are Contented, there
is another Power worth the having,
which Felicity giveth us. It enables us
to despise the Menaces and Angers of
Men, it setteth us above their reach, and
inspires us with a comely boldness to
dare to do any thing that is good, as
well as with ability to dare to suffer any
thing that is evil. He that is secure, and
he that hath enough, is independant, and
<hi>bold as a Lion</hi>: And besides all this he
has a certain lustre in his Actions, that
gives him authority and power over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to intercede and prevail in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
to live in honour and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
and to make many subservient to
his best occasions. He is great in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and whatever he asks of his eternal
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:52038:250"/>
Father in his Sons Name, with Wisdom
and Piety, shall not be denied him. He
can touch the hearts of millions by his
Fathers Mediation: <hi>For the hearts of
Kings are in the hands of the Lord, to turn
them as the Rivers of water.</hi> He made
his people to be pitied of all them that
carried them away Captive, and gave
them favour in the sight of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
And this secret alone is of more value
then we can well describe.</p>
               <p>To receive power from Heaven to be
Vertuous, to delight in Vertue, to be
irresistible and invincible in the practice
of it, is a very divine and glorious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Felicity it self is the fountain of
this Power, and the knowledge of its
greatness that which enflames us with
the love of it. Felicity is excellent not
only as it is the end of Vertue, but the
encouragement of it. He that is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
has a great advantage above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, because he moves with greater
ease, and passeth through all difficulties
with greater pleasure. A general of an
Army, that works with the Common
Souldiers in the Trenches, does the same
work, but with more honour and less
labour. He is not servile in it as the rest
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:52038:251"/>
are, but his pleasure is to do it for all
their encouragement. He does it in
the quality of a Prince, and with less
molestation; he has higher Incentives,
and more sublime Rewards. Yet he
does it too with greater merit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.
A man that sees and knows
the glory of his high and heavenly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
does all things triumphantly. The
sweetness of his Bliss alters the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Fights and Battles. He does
all things in the light, without groaning
and reluctancy: He marches on with
dancing and melody, and chearful looks,
and smiles, and thanksgivings: whereas
they that know not the glory of Felicity
groap in the dark; they that are discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
move heavily, and are in
all their proceedings lame and maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>THE way to attain the felicity of
Contentment, is to attain Felicity that
we may be contented. True Felicity
is the source of Contentment, and of all
Vertue. It is never to be gotten but by
digging after Knowledge as for hidden
Treasures. Praying for it is a good
way, but Prayers without Industry is
a meer mockery. Industry on the other
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:52038:251"/>
side without Prayer is loose Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For a man to pray to GOD to
make his Field fruitful without plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and sowing is madness, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
all from his own labour, without
GOD's Blessing, impiety. But GOD
never yet said to any of the seed
of <hi>Jacob, Seek ye my face in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN Contentment is gotten, it
must be secured by the same means by
which it was obtained. Care in fencing
is as necessary as Care in ploughing, and
there is Labour too but sweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
even in reaping in the Harvest.
But all the work is reduced into narrow
room: Thou hast no charge over any
other than thine own <hi>Vineyard.</hi> When
thou hast gotten the knowledge of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
and thy self, the grand means of
Contentment is continually to enjoy it.
With all thy getting get Wisdom, and
with all thy keeping keep thy Heart;
<hi>For out of it are the Issues of Life and
Death.</hi>
Nothing can waste thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
but Sin, and nothing trouble thy
Repose, but what disturbs thy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Let Vertue and Felicity be thy
only good, and believe firmly that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can hurt thee but SIN alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:52038:252"/>
One evil action done by thy self, is more
mischievous to thee, then all the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Sufferings in the World.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Of Magnanimity, or Greatness of Soul.
Its Nature. Its Foundation in the vast
Capacity of the Understanding. Its
Desire. Its Objects are infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
Its Enquiries are most profound
and earnest. It disdaineth all feeble
Honours, Pleasures and Treasures.
A Magnanimous Man is the only Great
and undaunted Creature.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAGNANIMITY and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are very near allyed, like
Brothers and Sisters they spring from the
same Parents, but are of several Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Fortitude and Patience are Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
too to this incomparable Vertue.
Moralists distinguish Magnanimity and
Modesty, by making the one the desire
of greater, the other of less and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Honours. But in my apprehension
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:52038:252"/>
there is more in Magnanimity. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all that belongs to <hi>a Great Soul</hi>:
A high and mighty Courage, an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Patience, an immoveable Grandeur
which is above the reach of Injuries, a
contempt of all little and feeble Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and a certain kind of Majesty
that is conversant only with Great things;
a high and lofty frame of Spirit, allayed
with the sweetness of Courtesie and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
a deep and stable Resolution
founded on Humility without any base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
an infinite Hope; and a vast De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
a Divine, profound, uncontrolable
sence of ones own Capacity, a generous
Confidence, and a great inclination to
Heroical deeds; all these conspire to
compleat it, with a severe and mighty
expectation of Bliss incomprehensible.
It soars up to Heaven, and looks down
upon all the dominion of Fortune with
pity and disdain. Its aims and designs
are transcendent to all the Concerns of
this little World. Its Objects and its
Ends are worthy of a Soul that is like
GOD in Nature; and nothing less than
the Kingdom of GOD, his Life and
Image; nothing beneath the Friendship
and Communion with him, can be its
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:52038:253"/>
satisfaction. The Terrours, Allurements
and Censures of men are the dust of its
feet: their Avarice and Ambition are
but feebleness before it. Their Riches
and Contentions, and Interests and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
but insignificant and empty trifles.
All the World is but a little Bubble, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
and Eternity the only great and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
things wherewith it converseth.
A Magnanimous Soul is alwaies awake.
The whole globe of the Earth is but a
Nutshell in comparison of its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The Sun is its Lamp, the Sea its
Fishpond, the Stars its Jewels, Men, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
its Attendance, and GOD alone its
soveraign Delight and supream Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
The Earth is its Garden, all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
its Summer houses, Cities are its
Cottages, Empires its more spacious
Conrts, all Ages and Kingdoms its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means,
Monarchs its Ministers and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Agents, the whole Catholick Church
its Family, the eternal Son of GOD its
Pattern and Example. Nothing is great
if compared to a <hi>Magnanimous Soul,</hi>
but the Soveraign Lord of all Worlds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:52038:253"/>Mistake not these things for arbitrary
flourishes of Luxuriant fancy: I speak
as I am inspired by Felicity. GOD is
the Cause, but the knowledge of a Mans
self the Foundation of Magnanimity.
<hi>Trismegistus</hi> counteth thus, <hi>First GOD,
secondly the World, thirdly Man: the
World for Man, and Man for GOD. Of
the Soul that which is sensible is Mortal,
but that which is reasonable Immortal. The
Father of all things being full of Light and
Life, brought forth Man like unto himself,
whom he loved as his proper Off-spring: for
he was all Beauteous having the Image of
his Father.</hi> This in his <hi>Poemander.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
he saith, <hi>Man is a divine and living
thing, not to be compared to any Beast that
lives upon the Earth, but to them that are
above (in the highest Heavens) that are
called Gods. Nay rather if we shall be bold
to speak the truth, he that is a MAN IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEED
is above them!</hi> He is infinitely
greater than the gods of the Heathen:
And a God like unto himself (as the
Wise Man observes) he cannot make.
<hi>At least,</hi> saith <hi>Trismegistus, they are equal
in Power: For none of the things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will come down upon Earth, and leave
the limits of Heaven: bur a Man ascends
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:52038:254"/>
up into Heaven, and measures it. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what things are on high, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
And that which is the greatest of all,
he leaveth not the Earth, and yet is above:
so mighty and vast is the greatness of his
Nature! Wherefore we must be bold to say,
that an Earthly Man is a Mortal God,
and the Heavenly GOD is an Immortal
MAN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIS is the Philosophy of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Heathen: wherein though there be
some Errors, yet was he guided to it by
a mighty sence of the interiour Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Soul of Man, and the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he assumes is not so profane, but
that it is countenanced here and there
in the Holy Scripture. GOD himself
said unto</hi> Moses, Lo, I have made thee a
God to <hi>Pharoah. Again he telleth him
concerning</hi> Aaron, He shall be to thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a Mouth, and thou shalt be to him
instead of God. <hi>And again concerning
all the Great men of the World in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
I have said ye are Gods, but ye shall
die like Men. <hi>But let us see the Reason
of the Heathen a little, on which he
foundeth his great Opinions. In one
place he maketh his Son</hi> Tatius to say,
I conceive and understand, not by the sight
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:52038:254"/>
of mine Eyes, but by the intellectual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am in Heaven, in the
Earth, in the Water, in the Air: I am
in the living Creatures, in Plants, in the
Womb: every where. <hi>Whereupon he
asketh him,</hi> Dost thou not know (O my
Son) that thou art born a God, and the
Son of The One as I am? <hi>And the ground
of this Question he unfoldeth in another
place thus;</hi> Consider him that contains all
things, and understand, that nothing is
more Capacious than that which is <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,</hi>
nothing more swift, nothing more
powerful: but (of all other things) it is
most Capacious, most swift, and most strong.
And judge of this by thy self. Command
thy Soul to go into <hi>India,</hi> and sooner than
thou canst bid it, it will be there. Bid it
pass over the Ocean, and suddenly it will be
there: not as passing from place to place,
but suddenly it will be there. Command it
to flie into Heaven, and it will need no
wings, neither shall any thing hinder it;
not the fire of the Sun, nor the AEther, nor
the turning of the Sphears, nor the bodies
of any of the Stars, but cutting through
all it will flie up to the last and furthest Body.
And if thou wilt even break through the
Whole, and see those things that are without
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:52038:255"/>
the World (if there be any thing without)
<hi>i.e. if the World be confined,</hi>] thou
maist. Behold how great Power, how great
swiftness thou hast! Canst thou do all these
things, and cannot GOD? After this
manner therefore contemplate GOD to have
all the whole World in himself, as it were
all Thoughts or Intellections. If therefore
thou wilt not equal thy self to GOD, thou
canst not understand GOD. For the like
is intelligible by the like. Increase thy self
to an immeasurable Greatness, leaping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
every Body, and transcending all Time,
become <hi>ETERNITY;</hi> And thou shalt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
GOD. If thou belive in thy self
that nothing is impossible, but accountest
thy self Immortal, and that thou canst un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all things, every Art, every Science,
and the manner and custom of every living
thing, become higher than all Height, and
lower than all Depth, comprehend in thy
self the qualities of all the Creatures, of the
Fire, the Water, the Dry and the Moist, and
conceive likewise that thou canst at once be
every where, in the sea, in the Earth; at
once understand thy self not yet begotten,
in the Womb, Young, Old, Dead, the things
after Death, and all these together; as also
all Times, Places, Deeds, Qualities, Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:52038:255"/>
thou maist, or else thou canst not yet
understand GOD. But if thou shut up thy
Soul in thy Body, and abuse it; and say,
I understand nothing, I am afraid of the
Sea, I cannot climb up into Heaven, I
know not who I am, I cannot what I shall
be; what hast thou to do with GOD? For
thou canst understand none of those fair
and good things, but must be a lover of the
Body and Evil. For it is the greatest evil
not to know GOD. But to be able to Know,
and to Will, and to Hope, is the strait Way,
and the divine Way proper to the Good. It
will every where meet thee, and every where
be seen of thee plain and easie, when thou
dost expect, or look for it. It will meet thee
Waking, Sleeping, Sailing, Travelling, by
Night, by Day, when thou speakest, and when
thou keepest silence. For it is nothing,
which is not the Image of GOD. <hi>His Close
is most divine;</hi> And yet thou sayest, GOD
is Invisible; but be advised: for who is
more manifest than he? For therefore he
made all things, that thou by all things
mightst see him. This is the Good of GOD,
his Vertue is this, to appear, and be seen in
all Things. <hi>This is the bottom of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Greatnesses whatsoever: GOD is
infinitely communicative, infinitely prone
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:52038:256"/>
to reveal himself, infinitely Wise, and able
to do it. He hath made the Soul on
purpose that it might see him: And if
the Eye that was made for the World,
being so little a ball of Earth and Water,
can take in all, and see all that is visible,
if the sight of the Eye be present with
all it beholdeth; much more is the Soul
both able to see, and to be present with
all, that is Divine and Eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know very well that a Man divided
from GOD is a weak inconsiderable
Creature, as the Eye is, if divided from
the Body, and without the Soul: but
united to GOD a Man is a transcendent
and Celestial thing. GOD is his Life,
his Greatness, his Power, his Blessedness
and Perfection. And as the Apostle
saith, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one
SPIRIT.</hi> His Omnipresence and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
fill the Soul, and make it able to
contain all Heights and Depths, and
Lengths and Breadths whatsoever. And
it is the desire of the Soul <hi>to be filled with
all the fulness of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Magnanimous desires are the natural
results of a Magnanimous Capacity. The
desire of being <hi>like Gods, knowing Good
and Evil,</hi> was the destruction of the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:52038:256"/>
World. Not as if it were unlawful to
desire to be <hi>Like GOD</hi>: but to aspire to
the Perfection in a forbidden way, was
unlawful. By Disobedience, and by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
our own Inventions, by seeking
to the Creature, to the stock of a Tree,
to make us <hi>Like GOD;</hi> that is erroneous,
and poor, and despicable: but to know
our selves, and in <hi>the strait and divine
Way</hi> to come immediately to GOD, to
contemplate him in his Eternity and
Glory, is a right and safe Way: for the
Soul will by that means be the Sphere of
is Omnipresence, and the Temple of
the God-head: It will become ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY,
as <hi>Trismegistus</hi> speaketh, or ONE
SPIRIT with God, as the Apostle. And
then it must needs be present with all
things <hi>in Heaven, and in the Earth, and in
the Sea,</hi> as GOD is: for all things will be
in it, as it were <hi>by Thoughts and Intellecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Magnanimous Soul then, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
its Capacity, is an immovable sphere
of Power and Knowledge, far greater
than all Worlds, by its Vertue and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
passing through all things, through the
Centre of the Earth, and through all
Existencies. And shall such a Creature
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:52038:257"/>
as this be contented with Vanities and
Trlfles, Straws and Feathers, painted
Butterflies, Hobby-horses and Rattles.
These are the Treasures of little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!
but you will say a Man delighteth
in Purses of Gold, and Cabinets of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
in Houses and Palaces, in Crowns
and Scepters. Add Kingly Delights, and
say he delighteth in Armies and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Triumphs and Coronations.
These are great in respect of <hi>Play-things.</hi>
But all these are feeble and pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
to a great Soul.<note place="margin">Tully in Somn. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</note> As <hi>Scipio</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to Heaven, the Earth it self seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a Nutshel, and he was ashamed of
all his Victories and Triumhs, amazed at
his madness in Quarrelling, and fighting
about Territories and Kingdoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to a Star, and lost into nothing.
the whole Earth is but one invisible
Point, when a man foareth to the height
of Immensity, and beholdeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
its everlasting Circumference,
which is infinite every way beyond the
Heavens. It is the true and proper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity
of the Soul: Which can no more
be contented with the narrow confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this World, no more rest in the
Childishness of all the noise of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:52038:257"/>
of Men, be no more satisfied with
its Earthly Glories, than the SUN can
be shut up in a <hi>Dark-Lanthorn.</hi> It is
true indeed it would desire to see, as the
Angels do, the least and lowest of all
the Creatures full of the Glory and
Blessedness of GOD, all Wisdom and
Goodness in every thing, and is apt to
complain for want of some eternal and
Celestial Light wherein to behold them:
but if all the expansions of Time and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
should be void, and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and out-goings of Infinity empty
round about them; though things upon
Earth, nay and things in the Heavens,
should be never so Rich, and divine, and
beautiful, yet such is the Magnanimity of
a Great Soul, that it would hugely
be displeased: its loss and its distaste
would be alike Infinite. Infinite Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
infinite Treasures, infinite Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
things endless in number, value,
and excellency are the Objects of its
Care and Desire; the greatness of its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
leads it to consider and enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the spaces above the Heavens, and
all the parts of GOD's everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be full of Joyes, whether there be
any end or bound of his Kingdom; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

his Laws are as to their nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency?
Whether his Love be really

Such things as these are the Concerns
and Inquiries of a Magnanimous Soul.
And if its expectations and desires are
absolutely satisfied, it will easily appear,
and break forth upon all Occasions, into
the most high and Magnanimous Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trismegistus</hi> (or whoever else was the
Author of that Book) saw the deep
Capacity of his own Soul, but if a
Conjecture may be made by the residue
of the discourse, did not understand the
end (at least not clearly) for which it
was implanted. Some knowledge he
had, that all the things in Eternity were
the Objects of that Power, by reason of
which he calls them <hi>Fair and Good</hi>: but
that they were to be the <hi>Treasures</hi> and
<hi>Enjoyments</hi> of the Soul I do not find him
affirming. He that knows this must needs
be of our Saviours mind, who when all
the Kingdoms of the World, and the
Glory of them were shewed him by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
in a moment of time, despised them
all. For the divine and Celestial King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:52038:259"/>
is infinitely greater, and in a far
more perfect manner to be enjoyed.</p>
               <p>HE that knoweth the Honour which
cometh from above, will despise the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which men can pay, and in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of that Honour which cometh from
GOD only, esteem all the Honour of
this World but false and feeble. Not
as if Men were in the truth of Nature
vile and despicable Creatures; a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
man knows all others to be by
Nature like himself, and is apt to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
all of his kind as sublime and
Celestial Creatures. But he is a Man
of a clear and discerning Spirit, and the
Corruption of Nature makes him to
slight all that is defiled. He sees that
Men are generally Evil, deformed and
blind, erroneous, perverse and foolish,
poor and miserable: And that all the
Honour which they generally give is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
and feigned. A little colour in
the face, a gay Coat, a fine Horse, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
and a Coach, an Exchequer full of
Gold, or some such light and superficial
Causes, are all the grounds of the respect
that they pay us.</p>

                  <l>And if the Glory and Esteem I have,</l>
                  <l>Be nothing else than what my Silver gave;</l>
                  <l>If for no other ground</l>
                  <l>I am with Love or Praises crown'd,</l>
                  <l>'Tis such a shame, such vile, such base Repute,</l>
                  <l>'Tis is better starve, than eat such empty Fruit.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>IF a King be dejected from his
Throne, it is but a poor comfort that he
is admired by Persons condemned to
die, and praised by Beggars. The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and power of the Persons that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
us, is of great consideration, in the
love and delight which they take in us.
They all must vanish and perish as a
Dream: no Honour is truly great, but
that which is continual and endless too.
A great and mighty Soul can care for no
Honour but that which comes from wise
and amiable Persons, that are themselves
great and honourable, most rich and
powerful, holy, just, blessed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Honour from GOD and his holy
Angels, from the eternal Son of GOD
and all his Saints, is marvellous and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial.
That Honour which is paid
upon great and solid causes; because a
Man is well-pleasing to GOD, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to his Throne; because he is the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:52038:260"/>
very true Image of GOD, and has do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over all the Creatures; because
he is infinitely beloved of GOD, and
all Angels and Men are commanded to
love him; because he is redeemed by
the Blood of Christ, and made a Temple
of the Holy Ghost; because he is a Priest
and King to his eternal Creatour, because
he is full of Goodness and Wisdom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with all kind of Vertue, and
made an Heir of eternal Glory; because
he is Faithful and True, and Just and
Holy; because he hath conquered Death,
and Hell, and Sin, and the Grave, and
triumpheth over them, this is being paid
by such Persons, Honour indeed: and
to desire this Honour is the Property
and the Vertue of a Magnanimous
Soul.</p>
               <p>An Eagle cannot stoop at Flies. An
<hi>Alexander,</hi> or a <hi>Caesar</hi> cannot debase or
confine their Souls to the pleasures of a
Cottage in a Wilderness. Infinite Hopes
and infinite Desires, infinite Fears, and
Despairs, and Sorrows, infinite Joyes,
and Delights, and Glories, infinite Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Praises and Thanksgivings, infinite
and eternal Objects are the only fit and
proper Concerns for the Affections of a
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:52038:261"/>
Great and <hi>Magnanimous</hi> Soul. The very
signification of the word is <hi>Greatness of
Soul,</hi> or if you please, <hi>of Mind</hi>: For a
distinction may be made between the
<hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>Mind.</hi> The Soul of Man is the
immutable essence, or form of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unimployed. His power of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
is alive, even then when it is quiet
and unactive; and this is his Soul. It is
one and the same in all men, and of it self
equally inclined to all great and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
things: but in the most it is
misguided, baffled and suppressed, and
though it be never so great it is to no
purpose. This greatness implanted by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not <hi>Magnanimity</hi>: It is a Natural
disposition, not an acquired habit, as all
Vertue is. A Man is then said to be of
such a <hi>Mind,</hi> when he determines, or
thinks in such a manner. His mind is
Good that intendeth well, his mind is
Evil that designeth mischief. So that
the Mind is the Soul exerting its power
in such an act: and the greatest Soul in
all the World is but <hi>Pusillanimous</hi> that
mindeth little things. A great Soul is
Magnanimous in <hi>Effect,</hi> a <hi>Mind</hi> applyed
to mighty Objects. Some men have a
Magnanimity infused by the power of
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:52038:261"/>
Education, and are led by Custome to
Great things, and in a manner by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
for such is their Place and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that they are frequently led to
greater Objects than other men. Of this
sort are the most eminent rank of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,
and Princes: Kingdoms, and
Thrones, and Privy Councils, and
Queens, and Armies are their natural
Dialect. This is no Vertue, for though
it be not innate by <hi>Nature,</hi> yet they are
<hi>born</hi> to it, and it is given by <hi>Fortune.</hi>
Others consider what they have to do,
and make an election, and though they
are born in a poor and despicable estate,
are not Magnanimous by Nature, or
Fortune, but by <hi>Choice</hi> and voluntary
Election. Not to satisfie the humour of
a high Blood, choler and fire, nor to
answer the necessities of a higher Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
but to discharge the office of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Wisdom. And this is the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of the <hi>Will,</hi> the true and genuine
<hi>Vertue.</hi> Which as it is far more worthy
than any of the rest, is guided to far
better and more glorious Objects, and
more diffusively given by the Bounty of
GOD to all kind of Men in all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
In the Poor it is more marvellous
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:52038:262"/>
than in the Great and Rich: It has such
an undaunted property in its Nature,
that though the disproportion between
them and their Assurance, or Hope, or
Desire seem infinite, and the end which
they aim at by their Magnanimity is
judged impossible: though their attempt
appear a ridiculous madness to them to
whom the Verities of Religion appear
incredible, yet they are no whit discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
or disheartened at the matter, but
stoutly march on, being animated by the
alarum of such a Trumpet, such a Drum
as Magnanimity is. His Faith is more
Divine by conquering the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World, than if he met with
no censure or opposition.</p>
               <p>IF you would have the Character of
a Magnanimous Soul, he is the Son of
eternal Power, and the Friend of infinite
Goodness, a Temple of divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Wisdom, that is not imposed upon
by the foul and ragged disguises of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but acquainted with her great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
and Principles, more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
sensible of her interests, and
depths, and desires. He is one that has
gone in unto Felicity, and enjoyed her
beauties, and comes out again her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:52038:262"/>
Lover and Champion: a Man whose
inward stature is miraculous; and his
Complexion so divine, that he is King of
as many Kingdoms as he will look on:
One that scorns the smutty way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
things like a Slave, because he
delights in the Celestial way, and the
Image of GOD. He knows that all the
World lies in Wickedness; and admires
not at all, that things palpable and near,
and natural, are unseen, though most
powerful and glorious; because men are
blind and stupid. He pities poor vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Kings that are oppressed with heavy
Crowns of Vanity and Gold, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
how they can content themselves
with such narrow Territories: yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in their Regiment of the World,
and paies them the Honour that is due
unto them. The glorious Exaltation of
good Kings he more abundantly extols,
because so many thousand Magnanimous
Creatures are committed to their Trust,
and they that govern them understand
their Value. But he sees well enough
that the Kings glory and true repose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the Catholick and eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
As for himself he <hi>is come unto
Mount Sion, and to the City of the living
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:52038:263"/>
GOD, the Heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
innumerable Company of Angels, to the
General Assembly and Church of the First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
which are written in Heaven, and
to GOD the Judge of all, and to the Spirits
of Just men made perfect, and to JESUS
the Mediatour of the New Covenant</hi>: And
therefore receiving a Kingdom which
cannot be moved, he desires to serve
GOD acceptably with reverence and
godly fear: And the truth is he can fear
nothing else, for GOD alone is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
fire. He very well understands
what the Apostle saith, and dares believe
him: <hi>I cease not to give thanks for you,
making mention of you in my Prayers, that
the GOD of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit
of Wisdom and Revelation in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him, the eyes of your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being enlightened, that ye may know
what is the HOPE of his Calling, and what
the RICHES of the GLORY of his IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HERITANCE
in the Saints. And what is
the EXCEEDING GREATNESS of his
POWER to us-ward who believe, according
to the WORKING of his Mighty Power:
which he wrought in Christ when he raised
him from the dead, and set him at his own
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:52038:263"/>
RIGHT HAND in the HEAVENLY places:
far above all Principality, and Power, and
Might, and Dominion, and every Name
that is named, not only in this WORLD,
but in that also which is to come: And
hath put ALL THINGS under his feet, and
he gave him to be HEAD over all Things
to the</hi> CHURCH <hi>which is his BODY,</hi> THE
FULNESS OF HIM THAT FIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LETH
ALL IN ALL. <hi>Now to him
that is able to do exceeding abundantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all that we ask or think, according to
the Power that WORKETH in us, Unto
him be Glory in the Church by Christ Jesus,
throughout all AGES, World without end.
Amen.</hi>

               <p>A great and a clear Soul knoweth that

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Modesty. Its Nature. Its Original. Its
Effects and Consequences.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MODESTY is a comely Grace in
the Behaviour of a Man, by which
he piously dissembleth his own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and blusheth at his Praises. It sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
from a certain fear and sence of his
Imperfection. 'Tis the shadow of Guilt,
and a beautiful cover of Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
It is sometimes Natural, and,
which is contrary to all other Vertues,
more truly vertuous for being so. For
then it is Simple, Genuine, and Real;
but studied Modesty is affected and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial:
yet where Nature has not been so
obliging as to give the endowment, 'tis
not altogether to be condemned, since
it is agreeable to the best of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this World, and supplies a
defect in his Nature, that is born without
it.</p>
               <p>IT is akin to Shame, yet increases the
honour of him that wears it; it is the
shade of Vertue, yet makes it brighter:
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:52038:264"/>
It is a tincture of Humility, visible in a
vermilion and deeper die; and the more
natural and easie, the more sweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>
               <p>IT charms the Envy of those that
admire us, and by seeming to extinguish
our worth gives it a double beauty. It
reconciles a man to the Enemies of his
Grace and Vertue, and by a softness ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
wins a Compassion in all Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators.
It is a Vertue which by refusing
the honour that is due unto it, acquireth
more; a real Counterfeit, and the only
honest and true dissimulation. It is an
effeminate, yet a laudable quality; a
spice of Cowardice, more prevalent than
Courage; a Vertue by which we despise
all meaner Honours, while we are ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
carried to the highest Glory. It
seemeth inconsistent with Magnanimity,
yet is her youngest Sister.</p>
               <p>IT hath not many Objects, nor are
its Aims apparent, nor its Ends conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
It is the Mother of fine and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Resentments; its strength consisteth
in tenderness and fear. He that is Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
in one respect, may be modest
in another. Praises and Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the fuel of its Nature, it feedeth
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:52038:265"/>
upon them, while it grows by rejecting
them. It delights in what it feareth;
and is full of discords, but more full of
harmonies. It is pleased in its displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and alwaies fighteth with its own
Repugnancies. It is a Vertue mixt of
Sence and Reason; its region is in the
Body more than in the Soul, and in all its
Spiritual motions it is attended with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
impressions. The Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
dance in the Veins, as if Nature were
delighted with its own Confusions. By
captivating the favour of Men upon
Earth, it affecteth the very Angels in
Heaven, with much of pleasure. It put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
us in mind of Guilt and Innocency
at the same time, and by confession of
the one adds lustre to the other. By
making way for the acceptance of a
mans Person, it giveth more esteem, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and efficacy to his other Vertues.
And by this means it hath much of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in a little.</p>
               <p>HE that hath it not, must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
something like it; and if he be
elaborate in expressing it, must hide his
Art under the vail of Nature. Though
it be remote from the highest End, it
may be guided to it, and when so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:52038:265"/>
is alwaies innocent. It is very just,
for while other Vertues make it a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
it is a Grace unto them all. You may
look upon it as a tangible flame and see
it in others, but must feel it in your self
before you can understand it. It is old
in Children, young in middle Aged men,
at last an Infant. It is greatest in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our life, it decayeth in Youth,
in Old Age it vanisheth; at least chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
its dwelling, for it ceaseth to be in
the Body of an Aged man, and turneth
into Courtesie or Civility, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
When it dieth, it is buried in
Humility, and liveth in its Tomb, being
empaled in as it were with Meekness,
and waiting daily for its Resurrection.
Much cannot be said of it precisely: but
it is best commended, when left to your
Practice. It is the only tender Infant
of all the Vertues: like <hi>Cupid</hi> among
the gods: it appeareth frequently, and is
much exercised, in the School of <hi>Venus</hi>:
but is capable of more high and more
noble uses.</p>
               <p>MODESTY in Apparel is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Scriptures. It implies Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Chastity together. It is
sometimes opposed to Lasciviousness,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:52038:266"/>
sometimes to Excess, sometimes to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence:
And is a great Vertue, if for
nothing else, but the exclusion of these
abominable Vices.</p>
               <p>THE other Vertues seem to be the
Members, and substantial parts of the
Body of worth: Modesty like the Air,
and Meen of them all. It is the guard of
the Soul against Loosness and Pride, a
Vertue repressing the sumes of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit,
and a kind of silent restraint of
all that Arrogance, that delights in
pomps and superfluities.</p>
               <p>THOUGH it be a little Vertue, its
Reality is apparent: for unless it be made
up with some other supplies, the want
of Modesty is pernicious and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
               <p>IT is exercised in small things, but is
of long extent in the vertue of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence;
and because of the multiplicity
of its uses and occasions, amounts to a
considerable degree of <hi>Goodness.</hi> It
hath something like Love in its nature,
for it preferreth another above it self,
and in that its magnetical and obliging
quality much consisteth. <hi>In honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
one another.</hi> It fulfils that Law,
wherein our most near and tender In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest

               <p>LIBERALITY, in the common use
and acceptation of the Word, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from Magnificence, as Modesty from
Magnanimity. There is much of liberty
and freedom in its Nature. For Avarice
is a strict and sour Vice, and they that are
guilty of it are called Misers; but a

free from Anxiety, as he is free in disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.

makes a man a Beggar, at least threatens
to make him so, by wasting his Estate,
the Scripture saith, <hi>The Liberal Soul shall
be made fat. The Liberal Heart deviseth
liberal things, and by liberal things shall be
stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MEN are almost in all things contrary
in GOD. For since they tumbled out of
<hi>Eden,</hi> they have lost their wits, and their
heads are downwards: They think it
wisdom to keep their Mony <hi>against a
rainy day:</hi> and to lay it up for fear of
Poverty. But <hi>Solomon</hi> adviseth them to
the direct contrary, and maketh it an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
why they should be Liberal, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
they know not what evil may come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:52038:267"/>
the Earth.</hi> We cannot put our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
into safer hands, than into GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's:
Nor can we make any use of
Gold and Silver, comparable to that of
Charitable uses. By this it is that we <hi>lay
up a good foundation against the time to
come</hi>; and oblige others to receive us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Mansions here, into everlasting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
hereafter.</p>
               <p>MY Lord <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> late Lord Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
confessed himself in his Will to be but
a Steward of his Estate, and prayed
GOD to forgive him all his offences, <hi>in
Getting, Mispending, or not Spending it as
he ought to do</hi>: And that after many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and Pious works, perhaps sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
his Estate, though concealed
from the notice and knowledge of the
World.</p>
               <p>I have heard of a smart obliging Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fastned on a Great Man of <hi>France,</hi> by
one that had largely tasted of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for having been in his House honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
entertained for some space of time,
and observing how much the Palace was
frequented by all kind of Learned Men:
and how Liberal the Master of it was, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
to men of Worth and Vertue;
he charges the Man with the greatest Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnes
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:52038:268"/>
in the World: <hi>because he turned
all his Riches into Obligations</hi>: As if he
had put all his Estate and Monies to Use:
But to covet affections, and be rich in
hearts is no deformity.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, when the waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Love is begotten in the Soul are well
examined, and the happiness of being
truly beloved, and delighted in, is
known; no man is so wise as the Liberal
man. He is his own end, while he thinks
not of it. For nothing is more conducive
to his <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, than the bounty
of Munificence which enriches his Soul.
There are three things which beget
Love, <hi>Beauty, Benefits</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi>: They
are all three shut up in Goodness, which
is the fountain of Liberality. The beauty
of the face is a silent Oratory, a high stile
of Commendation without an Epistle:
yet by doing Benefits it prevaileth more,
than by any of its Charms; and maketh
it self great by enriching others. Love
inspires it with an amiable Soul; and if
others are delighted with their own Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he that is liberal in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns Vertues, and giveth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Worthy, is full of musick in
his words, of a sweet and pleasing beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:52038:268"/>
agreeable in his deeds, and fraught
with the Honour which he imparteth so
freely. A Liberal man is cloathed like the
Sun with the Raies of his own glory, and
establishes himself in the hearts of his
Neighbours, and reigns like a King by
the sole interest of Vertue and Goodness.
<hi>Every man is a Friend to him that giveth
many Gifts.</hi> He may be as holy, and as
temperate, and as wise as an Angel, no
man will be offended at him, because he
beautifies his Religion with so much
goodness. He enjoys himself, and his
Riches, and his Friends, and may do what
he will (with perfect liberty) because he
delights in the felicity of all that accost
him. He puts embroideries on Religion
by the chearfulness of his Spirit, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
a light wherever he goes, that makes
men to reverence his Person, and esteem
his Censures. He moves in a sphere of
Wonders, his life is a continual stream of
Miracles, because he is alwaies sacrificing
himself and his Possessions, to the benefit
of the World, and the comfort of others.
Benefits and Blessings are his Life-guard,
like his guardian Angels alwaies atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
on him. His House is the habitation
of joy and felicity, and yields a spectacle
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:52038:269"/>
of Contentment to every beholder. His
Neighbours are his Security, not his Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion;
and other mens Houses the forts
and ramparts about his own. No man will
hurt him, because they extinguish their
own contentment and benefit in him.
Theytender him as the apple of their eye,
because he is a greater comfort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
than that unto them. The ancient
custome of <hi>Paradice,</hi> so long since lost and
forgotten in the World revives in its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
where all men are entertained as
Brothers and Sisters, at the expences of
GOD and Nature. He taketh care, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Thrift is the suel of Liberality; and
is Frugal, that he may be Bountiful. All
his aim and labour is that he may <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Good Works; and make</hi> his <hi>light so shine
before men, that they seeing his good works
may glorifie his Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
There is a generous Confidence discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in all his Actions, and a little glimpse
of Heaven in his Behaviour; for he lives
as if he were among a company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
All mens Estates are his, and his is
theirs: If he had them all he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
them, and restore them to supply
their Wants; perhaps not with so much
wisdom as GOD hath done, but with as
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:52038:269"/>
much pleasure and contentment, as his
goodness can inspire, in the exercise of
power so kindly and well employed. But
because the designs of GOD are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deeper than he can well apprehend,
and laid all in eternal Wisdom, he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and delighted, that his Care is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;
and that GOD hath done that
for other men, to which his own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would readily prompt him were it
left undone. If it were permitted him
to wish whatsoever he listed, of all other
things he would chiefly desire to be a
Blessing to the whole World; and that he
is not so, is his only discontentment. But
for that too there are remedies in Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
when he knows <hi>all,</hi> his desire is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For a Life beautified with all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is the greatest gift that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to GOD, Angels and Men. And
when all Secrets shall be revealed, all
hidden things brought to light, his life
shall be seen in all its perfection, and his
Desires themselves be the enjoyments
and pleasures of all the Creatures. There
is a certain kind of sympathy that runs
through the Universe, by vertue of which
all men are fed in the feeding of one:
even the Angels are cloathed in the Poor
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:52038:270"/>
and Needy. All are touched and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in every one. Like the Brazen
Pillars in the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> if one
be smitten all resound the blow through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Temple: or like the strings of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Lutes skrewed up to <hi>Unisones,</hi>
the one is made to quaver by the others
motions. If Christ himself be fed in the
Poor, much more may Angels and Men.
At the last day we find no other scrutiny
about Religion, but what we have done
or neglected in Liberality. <hi>Come ye blessed
of my <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

World, for I was hungry and ye gave me
meat, thirsty and ye gave me drink, naked
and ye cloathed me, a Stranger and

I was in Prison and ye came unto me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
much as ye have done it to the least of
these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
LOVE it seems will sit in Judgment on

                     </gap>ssors.</hi> And
every act of Cruelty and Oppression in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
odious in all their eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THERE was a certain King which
would take account of his Servants: and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:52038:270"/>
when he had begun to reckon, one was
brought unto him, that ought him 10000
Talents. But for asmuch as he had not to pay,
his Lord commanded him to be sold, and all
that he had, and payment to be made. The
Servant therefore fell down and worshipped
him, saying, Lord have patience with me,
and I will pay thee all. Then the Lord of
that Servant was moved with Compassion,
and loosed him, and forgave him the Debt.
But the same Servant went out, and found
one of his fellow-Servants which ought him
100 pence, and he laid hold on him and took
him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou
owest. And his fellow-Servant fell down at
his feet and besought him, Have patience
with me and I will pay thee all. And he
would not, but went and cast him into Prison
till he should pay the Debt. So when his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants
saw what was done, they were
very sorry, and came and told to their Lord
all that was done.</hi> Every neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of our fellow Brethren is injurious
and grievous to GOD, Angels and Men:
for there is one common Principle in all
Nature, to hate evil Deeds, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those of Rigour and Severity, when
we our selves stand in need of Mercy,
and have received Favour. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:52038:271"/>
principle of Sympathy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
intitles us to all the good, that
is done to any Man in the World. The
love of Equity and Reason, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inclination that carries us to delight
in excellent Deeds, gives us an interest
in all that are performed. The beauty of
the one is as sweet and blessed as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of the other is odious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastful.
And if we our selves are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
obliged, and live by the bounty
and goodness of another, after we have
forfeited the Kings favour, have received
it again with pardon and forgiveness, nay
and with more and greater benefits; if
we shall not be liberal to one another, it
is a strange inequality. But the discharge
of our duty will make us amiable and
delightful.</p>
               <p>That the King of Glory is so concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the welfare of his Subjects, were
there nothing else in the Duty but that
consideration, is an infinite encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me,</hi>
is such an obligation, that as it is all
Goodness in it self, so is it all Motive unto
us. Eternity will scarce be sufficient to
fathom its depth. Do we feed GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in feeding the Poor, and his eternal
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:52038:271"/>
Son Jesus Christ? Are these Needy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the Representatives of the GOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HEAD,
in whom we are to shew all our
affection, love and gratitude to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all Life and Happiness? How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
ought our Liberality to be, when
we consider the excellency of our Bliss
and Benefactour? Are they beloved, are
they all his Sons, the very express image
of himself; all disguised and concealed
Kings; all Temples of eternal Glory?
What measure can confine or shut up
our bowels? Are the Spectators so innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
so divine, so blessed, so nearly
allyed to our selves, so rich, and great,
and beautiful, are they so deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the welfare of others, and does
every act of Charity extend to all; shall
we appear in the very act it self eternally
before them? What a vast ambition of
pleasing all these glorious Persons, should
be exprest in every operation of the Soul?
As every Thought is seen throughout all
eternity, and every Word that is spoken
here on Earth) heard in the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of immensity; so is there a kind of
Omnipresent greatness in the smallest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for it is vertually extended through
all the omnipresence of Almighty GOD:
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:52038:272"/>
even as every Centre, wherein it can be
done is eternally near, nay and within
him in the remotest part of his omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
'Tis dilated in a moment, and fills
the immensity of GOD with its nature.
According to its kind it affecteth all his
Essence in all spaces whatsoever.</p>
               <p>YET is there a Rule for the bounding
of all external acts of Charity, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for improving it. Intelligence is the
light wherein Alms-deeds ought to shine,
and attain their glory: Love is the soul
of Compassion, and Zeal the fervour of
Perfection: without which <hi>though a man
bestow all his Goods to feed the Poor, and
give his Body to be burned, it profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
Where this great abyss of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is, Prudence may dispence it, as it
seeth occasion. All other Vertues attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it, it is impossible to destroy it
self here on earth, unless the case be so
urgent, that it is better die, than to live
in the World. <hi>For a good man sheweth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and lendeth</hi>; but it is added, <hi>He will
guide his affairs with discretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Rule is, to secure the life and
growth of the tree, by causing it so to bear
one year, that it may bring forth fruit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
It is no good husbandry to cut it
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:52038:272"/>
down: nor any charity to make it wither
and expire. And on this very account
a Charitable man must preserve himself,
that he may do more good, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
longer able to do it.</p>
               <p>HE that will examine the proportions
and measures of his Liberality may take
this Rule for the second: Let thy Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities
give place to other mens Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
thy Conveniencies to their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
thy Necessities to their Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p>A third Rule is this; Our Riches must
be expended according to the several
Circumstances and occasions of our lives.
A Liberal man will not pinch and starve
his Servants. For it is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Bounty to oppress any, to hurt
any, to trample upon any. He will be
good to all, and to those most, that are
near unto him. GOD hateth robbery for
burnt Offering, or that Strangers should
eat the Childrens meat, or that Beggars
or Riotous persons should devour the
right of a mans Servants. He that does
brave acts abroad, but is a Niggard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doors, has a glorious train spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
like a Peacock, but stands upon
black feet; and may bear that unlucky
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:52038:273"/>
bird for his Crest, which is the emblem of
Pride and Vain-glory. So is it with young
Prodigals that oppress poor Tradesmen,
by defrauding them of their Debts, yet
are lavish enough to the Poor and Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
This is a defect with which Goodness
is inconsistent, and it blasteth their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It is better take off 100 pound a year
from ones benevolence to the poor, than
wrong a Servant or Creditour of a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
The Rule therefore is this, First se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the works of Necessity; have food
and rayment for thy self: keep out of
debt. Next render to every man his due
in point of Justice, and employ no man
thou canst not pay; rather perish thy self
than oppress another. If thou art able,
and hast any thing to spare, then let the
miseries of the Needy be supplied in the
works of Compassion and Charity: but
let not all be swallowed up here, thy
Neighbours, and Acquaintance, and
Friends, and Kindred claim a share; and
thou must secure something for the works
of Courtesie and Hospitality. So order
all both in thy Estate and Life, that the
kindness of GOD may shine in all. So do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy Stewardship shall be acceptable
to the whole World, and thy Memory
blessed among men and Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:52038:273"/>
Our Saviour when he wrought his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as he opened the eyes of the
blind, healed the sick, cast out Devils,
raised the dead, gave food to the hungry,
tongues to the dumb, ears to the deaf,
and legs to the lame: so did he give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the ignorant, and interpret all
his design, by those Parables and Sermons
which attended his Cures. Good Counsel
is oftentimes a greater gift than a Trunk
of Mony. While the Iron is hot it is time
to strike. Good Counsel is like a bitter
Pill, that must be gilded with Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If the Word of GOD be like <hi>good
seed,</hi> the heart in which it is sown is sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
by Sorrow, and ploughed up by
affliction, and prepared to receive it by
the husbandry of Providence. And the
properest Season that can be chosen for
Instruction is the time of Obliging. He
that intendeth the welfare of the Soul
by all the good works he doth to the
Body, is deep and perfect in Charity.
A wise man will improve his advantages,
and enrich his Gifts with pious discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
A Benefactour has authority to talk
what he listeth, and bribes his Auditor
to patience by his Bounty. Since <hi>He that
winneth Souls is wise,</hi> a profound Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:52038:274"/>
will not let slip a golden Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
nor suffer his Gift to be dark and
insignificant. He will make mention of
the glory of GOD, and the Love of
Christ, the guilt of Sin, the danger of Hell,
and the hope of Heaven, and alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make his Love apparent to
that GOD, for whose sake he pities the
Poor, and is kind towards all. For as much
as man hath two parts, and his Body is
without the Soul but a putrid Carkass;
he will put life into his Mony, and inspire
his Munificence with all his Reasons, that
his Bounty may consist of two parts in
like manner, and have a Soul for its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.
Liberality to the Soul is the
Soul of Liberality. Paradice and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are better to be given than Gold and
Silver. And every Good man will imitate
the Apostle, who was ready not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Gospel of GOD only, but his
own Soul to the benefit of those for
whom Christ died.</p>
               <p>THIS one thing further I desire you
to note, <hi>He that soweth sparingly shall reap
sparingly, but he which soweth bountifully
shall reap also bountifully.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6</note> In the Kingdom
of Heaven every man receiveth his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
because all their Joyes are common
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:52038:274"/>
and equal. Their <hi>Treasures</hi> shall be the
same, but they will differ in <hi>Glory.</hi>
The same GOD, the same Angels, the
same Men, all the same Objects shall be
round about every man. Every man shall
see and enjoy all the Glory of his eternal
Kingdom, because every ones life and
felicity shall be perfect. But yet their
works follow them; and every man shall
be cloathed in the beauty of his own
actions, Vertues and Graces. There may
be twenty Children in the same family,
yet all of several Features. There may
be a thousand Trees in the same Orchard,
yet all of different kinds. The same
brightness and glory may be round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, the same skie cover them, the
same Earth support them, the same Stars
serve them, the same Sun shine upon
them, the same Sea, the same Dew, the
same Air and Nourishment feed them,
and yet the one be more fair, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and excellent than the other. All
the World does know that a Tree laden
with Fruits and Blossoms is far more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
than a Tree that is barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful.
And the degrees of Beauty are
according as the Fruits are, more or less.
And as the Fruits they bring forth adorn
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:52038:275"/>
them, so do their own works praise them
in the Gates. Heaven as it is a Kingdom
of Light and Knowledge, is a Kingdom
of Perfection; Righteousness and Justice
flourish there in their fulness: and every
several degree of excellence is entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an answerable degree of esteem:
according to the number and greatness
of their Vertues every one is honoured
by Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>NOW least these Fruits should receive
any impediment by the Vices and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of men, order is taken, <hi>that we
should love our Enemies, bless them that
curse us, do good to them that hate us, pray
for them that despightfully use, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
us.</hi> By which means it is that a Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man surmounts all obstacles whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
lives among Dragons as if he were
surrounded with Doves, and though he
be environed with Devils, is as if he
were conversant with Angels: Because
he takes no notice of any Vice in any
man, to stop him, but is as Liberal as if
all were full of worth and vertue. Nay
he is more good and more miraculous.
Their Vices, their Provocations, their
Disorders cannot stain or imbitter his
Nature: but he will be alwaies chearful,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:52038:275"/>
and bright, and fair, and free and perfect.
To love the amiable, and be kind to the
beautiful is natural and easie. It is not
given to the Angels but to visit the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and the Penitent. But to love the Evil,
to be kind, and good and serviceable to
the Deformed and the Odious, to the
Injurious and Ungrateful, is somewhat
more than Angelical. We learn it not of
them but of GOD, and of his eternal Son:
who hath commanded us <hi>to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of our Father which is in Heaven; for
he maketh his Sun to rise on the Evil and
on the Good, and sendeth rain on the Just
and on the Unjust.</hi> Even Publicans and
Sinners do in some manner as much as
Angels, love them that love them. In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
they have no malignity, or malice, or
wrong to overcome, all that they love is
Beauty and Goodness: unless they learn
of Jesus Christ, and imitate him here on
Earth towards us Sinners. But our duty
is far greater, and our opposition more.
Which is intimated also in our Saviours
words: <hi>For if ye love them which love you,
what reward have you? Do not even the
Publicans the same? And if ye salute your
Brethren only, what do ye more than others?
Do not even the Publicans so? Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:52038:276"/>
perfect even as your Father which is in
Heaven is perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Close of all, I beseech you to
consider this one most cogent and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
expostulation. It is the beloved Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,

Our Neighbours are not only the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives
of GOD, but they are here
upon Earth, are visible, are present with
us, are Corporeal as we are, and alwaies
near us, our actions among them are pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
and our Conversation with them
real. GOD is invisible, and absent from
us, he is afar off in the highest Heavens,
Incorporeal, and Incomprehensible: If
we are remiss and careless in our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Neighbour, all our devotion
towards GOD will be but imaginary, our
Religion will degenerate into an idle and
vain <hi>Chimera,</hi> become a weak and feeble
shadow, be seated in the fancy, and
dwindle away into an aiery Speculation.
The reality of Religion consists in the
solid practice of it among the Sons of
men that are daily with us. The difficult
and serious actions of our Lives abroad,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:52038:276"/>
feed our Meditation in all our retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and infuse a reality and strength
into our Devotions, which make them so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and substantial.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Magnificence in GOD. Its resemblance
in Man. The chief Magnificence of the
Soul is Spiritual. It is perfectly expressed
in the outward Life, when the whole is
made perfect, and presented to GOD.
GOD gives all his Life to us: and we
should give ours all to him. How fair
and glorious it may be.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>GOD being proposed as the Pattern
of our Liberality and Kindness by
our Saviour, the nature of his Bounty is
sit to be considered for our Information:
which is great, and publick, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to many. In some of his private
dispensations it walks under the notion
and form of Liberality, as it giveth food
and Rayment, Gold and Silver, Houses
and Lands to particular persons: But in
other effects of his eternal love, which
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:52038:277"/>
are great and publick, its nature is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into the highest Magnificence.</p>
               <p>MAGNIFICENCE is a Vertue scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be found, but in Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
It is busied in erecting Temples
and Triumphal arches Magnificent The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres,
Colledges and Universities, Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
and Palaces, Royal Momuments
and Pyramids, Marts, Havens, Exchanges,
and all those other great and mighty
things wherein the glory of Imperial
Power is made conspicuous, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
whole Nations are benefited, and
Kingdoms adorned.</p>
               <p>GREAT Power, Riches, Wisdom and
Goodness must concur in the effect which
is truly Magnificent. It must be of great
lustre and glory, as well as of publick
use and benefit; and as it is wrought
with great labour and expence, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
by a great Soul, and freely given
to the good of the People. For Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
implies Greatness and Bounty
united.</p>
               <p>THE Creation of the Universe was a
great and Magnificent work, because the
lustre and beauty of the WORLD is a
sublime and wonderful Gift imparted to
millions. The bounty of GOD in adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:52038:277"/>
all ages with Cities and Empires, for
the benefit and enjoyment of all the
World is another piece of his Royal
Magnificence. The infusion of a Soul
so divine and everlasting into the Body
of a Man is an act of love transcendently
greater than all the Aquaeducts and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
in the World. For such a Celestial
presence, such a sublime and illimited
power, such a vast and noble Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as that is, which can see and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
all Eternity and Time together,
extend to all Objects in all Worlds, and
fill Immensity with life and joy, and love
and knowledge, with light, and beauty,
and glory, with adorations and praises;
though its essence be invisible, and all
its splendour within, is next under GOD
the highest Object of all the admiration
of Men and Angels: It is a being as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
as the Sun, the great occasion of all
the extasies of the Seraphims, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and the rapture of all the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,
the glory of GOD communicated
to the World in so divine a Creature; a
miraculous effect of his eternal Power,
and the resemblance of his Godhead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:52038:278"/>
THE Incarnation of his Eternal Son,
and the giving of the Holy Ghost was
another Magnificent effect of his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Power: so was the preparation of his
Word, with the Gifts he gave unto Men
in the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles,
adorned with all the varieties of their
Labours and Vertues, Wisdom, Courage
and Patience, Lives and Examples, Deaths
and Sufferings, Oppositions and Successes,
Miracles and Revelations. The <hi>Jewish</hi>
Nation alone is a Magnificent gift to the
whole World. The Apostle phraseth the
Regiment of it as a matter of Bounty:<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 12.</note>
                  <hi>Now if the Fall of them be the Riches
of the World, and the diminishing of them
the Riches of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>how much more
their Fulness!</hi> And again, <hi>When he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up on high, and led Captivity captive,
he gave Gifts unto Men, some Apostles, and
some Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. When he presented
all Nations and Kingdoms as a token of
his love to the Angels; when he gave
all those glorious Hosts in the Heavens
to the vision, service and pleasure of
Men; much more when he gave all these
in their marvellous order and amity u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
to every Soul: When he filled
the Heaven of Heavens with Joyes;
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:52038:278"/>
and gave all the glory of his Kingdom
to one (and that one to every one) he
manifested the glory of his Magnificent
power, in that of his great and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
goodness. And in relation to this
we may cry out with the Apostle (more
than for the mysterious Regiment of a
little Nation, as he doth upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of GODS dealing with the <hi>Jews</hi>)
<hi>O the depth of the riches both of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

For all the Ornaments and Riches
of a Bride are given with her Person:
her Palace and Attendants are her Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
upon the Marriage, as well as she:
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:52038:280"/>
and all things that magnifie, or make her
amiable, are subservient to his enjoyment,
and really his that is her Husband. So
that GOD giving us his Church to be our
Mother and our Bride, hath intended us
in all the things whereby he benefited
her in all kingdoms and ages: and hath
loved us in all the Love which he hath
exercised towards her: and all the fruit
of all his Love to the whole World
resteth in our Exaltation. This is the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of Almighty GOD to every
Soul in his Kingdom. And for this it is
that the Church is called, <hi>The Assembly of
the First-born,</hi> because all her Children are
the perfect Heirs, and Kings, and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms,
every one compleatly, and more
to his satisfaction, than if he were so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
For as GOD is wholly every where,
and the more here for being in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and infinitely here because he is
Omnipresent: So does he wholly see and
intend every one, as if him alone; and
love him far the more, by loving every
one; for his Love being infinite, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
towards him in all the parts of his
Kingdom: and the more rich and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
he maketh all things, the more great
and happy he maketh <hi>Him,</hi> according to
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:52038:280"/>
the immeasurable All-sufficiency of his
infinite Wisdom.</p>
               <p>THERE is in the Goodness of GOD
an infinite Greatness that makes it Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent:
for he gives <hi>Himself.</hi> When a Queen
gives her self, whether it be to a Beggar,
or to one of her Courtiers, or to another
King, if it proceed from an ardent Love
the Gift is full of sweetness within; but
it is alwaies attended with great Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
without: together with her self
she gives him her Palace, her Exchequer,
Gardens of Pleasure, her Crown and
Throne, her Soveraignty, her Nobles, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
and all her Kingdom. GOD
doth infinitely more. He gives himself by
Loving, and with himself gives us all his
Wisdom, Goodness and Power, by making
them full objects of Complacency: by
doing with them for us, all that we could
devise, or desire, or effect with them, had
they been our own and seated in our
selves. His bounty in giving himself is
attended with infinite advantages, innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
wonders of love and goodness;
a care to make himself (as a Bridegroom
does) exceeding amiable and glorious,
a care to purifie and fit his Queen for
himself with all kind of greatness and
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:52038:281"/>
beauty: a care to adorn his Palace with
all kind of delectable things, Riches, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
magnificent Furnitures, Perfumes,
Musicians, Pictures, Jewels, Dainties,
Feasts, Attendants, Nobles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all
which he infinitely exceedeth all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
of the World. His Kingdom is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
by <hi>David</hi> with great Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 145.</p>
               <p>NOW if we would be Magnificent as
GOD is, we must have a love within our
Souls, that is willing to impart all these
incomprehensible Treasures and Glories
to every Soul, and to all his Hosts; and if
it be possible, to out-do all this, to give
all these Worlds, nay GOD himself, and
every Soul to all with greater ardour, and
joy and gratitude: Angels and Men, our
selves to all, and all to every one. For that
Love which is the fountain of all is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than all, a greater Gift, and a greater
Treasure. And that love which imitates
the first is in its place the only desirable
and excellent thing that is possible.
GODS love in its place is infinitely better
then all. Removing it you shake and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish
all. But in such a Creature he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be beloved. He made him free,
that he might be capable of Loving, for
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:52038:281"/>
it is impossible to love by constraint or
necessity: and having made him free and
left him to himself, infinitely desires to be
beloved of him. All his own love unto
him, and all the glories of Heaven and
Earth which are prepared for him, are
means for the obtaining of that end, Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
Motives, Allurements, Incentives
of that Love which GOD desires. If he
will not return Love, all are imbittered
and made distastful. Infinite Love infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
desires to be beloved, and is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
displeased if it be neglected. GOD
desires to take Complacency in all, to see
the beauty of his Bride, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of his design, in the Love of his
Beloved. And nothing in all Worlds but
the love of that Person can be his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
For nothing can supply the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
or denial of that Love which is his
end. For in its place it is the only needful
and proper thing, far more desired than
all that went before: All that went before
was but the Means, this is the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
and endeavoured by them. For
upon this Return all the sweetness of
the rest dependeth. All is made sweet and
compleat, and delightful, if this Soul doth
love GOD in all these things; if not, they
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:52038:282"/>
are all made vain, and his love is turned
into sour displeasure. All the other things
are so far from <hi>alleviating</hi> that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his displeasure; the glory and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of them is so far from making
him to despise this Love, that in respect
of these things he the more desires it;
because he would not have his labour
vain; and his own infinite Love makes
him more to esteem the love of this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is (in its place) his Soveraign
object; and for that very cause so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
and admired by all Angels and
Men. Is not then the Love which a man
returneth a Magnificent thing! Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if it answers all these preparations and
obligations as their end, and be lookt
upon as that without which all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is vain and frustrate, it is the most
great and marvellous thing in all the
World, and is <hi>in its own place</hi> of all other
things most highly desired by all Angels
and Men; and is the greatest Gift which
(in, and by that Soul) can possibly be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It is esteem of, honour paid to, and
delight in, all these great and most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things. It contains in it self a <hi>desire</hi>
to see GOD pleased with more than the
fruition of all Worlds, and of becoming
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:52038:282"/>
it self the greatest Treasure to his eternal
essence of all that is possible. And if this
<hi>desire</hi> be not satisfied, all the grandeurs
of his eternal Kingdom are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But <hi>the desire satisfied is a Tree of Life.</hi>
What the Sun is to the Eye, that is Love
to the Desire. GODS infinite desire of
our Love makes it infinitely delightful to
him. <hi>Davids</hi> purpose to build the <hi>Temple</hi>
was more accepted than <hi>Solomons</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
And if one Contrite groan be
better than all Sacrifices, to love GOD
with all the Soul and Understanding is
better than to give him all Worlds. We
sacrifice all by Loving him as we ought.
We see the Beauty and Glory of all, and
offer it all up to him, with infinite Desire,
our selves also with infinite Gratitude.
Could we make millions of Worlds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
greater and more perfect than
this, they should all be his. No delight, no
joy, no pleasure can be greater to us, than
to see him reigning. He gives all to us,
that we might give it all to him: In our
Affection and with our Love it is most
delightful. Our Affections are the flames
and perfumes that enrich the Sacrifice.
He is a Spirit to be served in a Spiritual
manner: all that we <hi>would</hi> do, we do.
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:52038:283"/>
Infinite desires and intentions of Pleasing
him are real objects to his Eye. The
Goodness of the Soul, and the Greatness
of his Goodness consisteth in them. A
Will enlarged with an infinite Fancy is a
prodigious depth of goodness when it is
all Love. It would do millions of things
for its Object! But GOD is incapable
of more Worlds: and all that are possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he can make himself: our Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
must be shewn in something he
cannot do, unless he were in our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and which of all things in the
World he knows most fit to be done,
were he in our places. He cannot be the
Soul of any of his Creatures: but would
be the Soul of that Soul: the joy and
delight of that Soul; the life and glory
of that Soul: and that he cannot be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
that Soul will delight in him, and
love and honour him. It is not he must
honour himself: but that Soul: His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is, that that Soul would freely turn,
and delight in him freely, of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
would incline it self to consider
his Excellencies, and dedicate it self to
love and honour him. This is one way
for the Soul to be Magnificent towards
Men too: who by Nature delight to see
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:52038:283"/>
GOD beloved, and satisfied in a point of
such infinite importance.</p>
               <p>IT is true indeed, that GOD can be
full of Indignation and punish: but for
love to turn into anger is no compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the pleasure it lost by our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage:
and to punish is a strange and
troublesome work, in which Love is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,
or else afflicted. Infinite
Love puts an infinite value on the Gift.
And I think it is Magnificence to give a
Gift of infinite value.</p>
               <p>OUR Magnificence towards Men
must be laid on a deep and eternal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
We must be willing to give our
selves to their comfort and satisfaction.
And that we cannot do, but by imitating
GOD in all his Goodness, studying their
felicity, and desiring their love with the
same earnestness to the utmost of our
power: doing in all places, in all things,
in all Worlds, the things they desire:
supposing them to be what they ought to
be, like Gods themselves.</p>
               <p>THE best Principle whereby a man
can stear his course in this World, is that
which being well prosecuted will make
his Life at once honourable and happy:
Which is to love every man in the whole

                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:52038:285"/>
World as GOD doth. For this will make
a man the Image of GOD, and fill him
with the mind and spirit of Christ, it
will make every man that is, the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
of GOD and of all the World
unto him. It will make a man to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
GOD in all Mankind, and lift him
up above all Temptations, Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Fears. It will make him to
meet the love of GOD, Angels, and Men,
in every Person. It will make a man
truly glorious, by making him pleasing
to GOD, and universally good to every
one; diffusive like the Sun, to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to all, and wise to enjoy their
compleat Felicity. If there were but
one, the Case is evident: supposing more
than one, his duty is to love every one the
more for all their sakes. For since he must
love all, and they are all to love one,
and every one, he must please them all
by gratifying their love to one, and by
doing so to every one, they are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the welfare of one, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the love that is born to every one.
This in the state of Glory will be clear,
where every one like the Sun shall be
clearly seen extending his love to all;
though here upon Earth, where our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:52038:285"/>
is imperfect, by reason of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of our Knowledge it doth not
appear. Our actions are limited: for
being finite in our outward demeanour,
they must needs be regulated by Justice
and Wisdom. But two things come in
here to the assistance of Magnificence,
whereof the first is the inferiour perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of our Love to all, the second is
the universal Satisfaction which the
beauty of our outward life will afford at
last. Concerning the last, two things are
fit to be considered. First, that as GOD
has communicated the Sun, by making it
visible, to all; and there is not a Star but
is seen by all Nations and Kingdoms: so
has he communicated the Soul, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it visible, to all; and there is not a
Thought that shall remain uncovered;
nor an action, but it shall be seen by all
for ever. Secondly, that as GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is admired for his <hi>Inward Love,</hi> so is
he for the operations of his <hi>Outward Life,</hi>
I mean for his <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Judgments.</hi>
When they saw his <hi>Works</hi> finished, <hi>The
Morning Stars sang together, and all the
Sons of GOD shouted for joy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job.</note> The Elders
are represented before his Throne, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down their Crowns, and saying, <hi>Thou
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:52038:286"/>
art worthy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, to receive Glory, and
Honour, and Power, for thou hast created
all these things, and for thy pleasure they
are, and were created.</hi> Where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of GODS Pleasure in the GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY
of the <hi>Creation</hi> is evidently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
to be one of the <hi>Joyes of Heaven</hi>;
a great matter of their Contemplation,
an eternal cause of their Praises. His
infinite and eternal Love is that by which
he is <hi>All Glorious within</hi>: all the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Essence, and all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Soul is there: but yet his
Saints in the Church Triumphant, sing
the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Song of the
<hi>Lamb,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 15. 3, 4, 5.</note> saying, <hi>Great and Marvellous are
thy WORKS, Lord GOD Almighty, Just
and True are thy WAYES thou King of
Saints!</hi> His Works are the substantial
Creatures in Heaven and in Earth: his
Waies are his proceedings and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
among them in all ages. For all
shall appear together for ever, the one
being <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Marvellous,</hi> the other
beautified with <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi> So
that neither of these doth swallow up
the other, but both are distinct and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Our Love may be infinite on the
Inside, and yet our Life be diversified
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:52038:286"/>
with many limited and particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now if our Life be like GODS,
eternally to be seen; and our Actions in
passing pass not away, but in the sphere
of our life abide for ever, <hi>our Life all at
once</hi> is a mysterious Object, interwoven
with many Thoughts, Occurrences, and
Transactions; and if it be to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to GOD like a Ring, or a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
we had need to be very choice in
the mixture of our Flowers, and very
curious in the Enammel of so <hi>rare a
Token.</hi> Perhaps it is his Crown, nay
our own; His and our Royal Diadem.
It shall shine like a glory about our Souls
for ever. That there should be any dirt
or blemish in it, is inconsistent with our
Felicity: but it is a Magnificent Present
if it be enchased with Jewels, well chosen
and curiously set, I mean with the most
pure and fit elections, the most Wise, and
Just, and excellent Actions, the most
bright and clear Apprehensions, the most
divine and ardent Affections. The last
are like Gold, the ground work of the
Crown: but the work it self is a mixture
of elaborate Distinctions that sparkle in
their lustre like Gems of several cuts
and colours. An imperial Crown is a
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:52038:287"/>
Magnificent Present from a King to a
King: But a Life like GODS in a sphere,
for which Time was lent that it might
be well wrought, and presented before
him when made perfect, as far surpasseth
the most glorious Crown that did ever
sit upon Monarchs brows, as that can be
supposed to excel a dull <hi>Clod</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi>
or a piece of <hi>Rusty Iron.</hi> There all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
and Laws, and Duties, and
Occasions are interwoven, all our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and Graces, and Vices, all our
Tears, and Devotions, and Prayers, our
Servants, the Poor, the Rich, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
Parents, Friends, Magistrates and
Ministers are set, and exhibited in their
proper places; they appear to the life
with all our Behaviors towards them: and
though we did deny a Poor mans Request
for the sake of another, and this and that,
and the other particular action did not
at present extend to all: but the Soul was
feign to use much wisdom in contracting
its operation for the greater advantage,
in finding out its Duty, in moderating
its Behaviour, in ballancing its occasions
and accounts; yet in the result of all,
it will be found full of Bounty and
Goodness to all, by taking care to be
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:52038:287"/>
just and pleasing to all in the beauty of
its Conversation. When two things it
desires to do, are incompatible to each
other; it studies which of the two was
more just, and fit, and necessary; which
tends most to the full and final perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of its Life; the interest of a Child
sometimes carries it from another man, a
debt of Necessity is paid with that we
would give, for a work of Charity: yet
when all is Obedience, Duty, and Love,
that life is a most Magnificent Gift. A
Wife, a Sister must be respected in her
place, a Son, a Servant, a Friend, before
a Stranger; if the case be such that one
of them only can be relieved. All in
the Family, being made in the Image of
GOD, as well as the Beggars without
doors, are Objects of our Charity. But
so much <hi>Goodness</hi> being in the bottom of
the design, and so much <hi>Prudence</hi> and
<hi>Justice</hi> in the denial: Where his Gold
and Silver faileth, his affection may be
infinite, and the restraints he sets upon
his Actions, be the several cuts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
in the Work, the very true
Engravings that make the Jewel, or the
Crown <hi>Glorious.</hi> Its <hi>Matter</hi> is <hi>Life</hi> it
self, yet the <hi>Workmanship</hi> far excess the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:52038:288"/>
                  <hi>Matter,</hi> when it is as <hi>Accurate</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi>
as it ought to be. This great and deep
Thought makes every little act of Life
magnificent and glorious, a better Gift
to GOD in its place, than the Creation
of all Worlds before him. While a mans
Love is really infinite towards all, and
he is ready to sacrifice himself with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for the good of the
World: but is fain to set a restraint upon
himself for the sake of others. The very
grief which true <hi>Goodness</hi> conceives at
the deficiency of its power, and the
force that lies upon it in so <hi>ungrateful</hi> a
Necessity, where it must be an Umpire
and a Judge between its Bowels and its
Children, is a molestation which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
in the midst of his duty, filling all
Spectators with as much pleasure as him
with pain. All shall be remembered,
and all these things which are now so
grievous, shall themselves become a part
of our future Glory.</p>
               <p>REMEMBER alwaies thou art about
a Magnificent work: and as long as thou
dwellest here upon Earth lay every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
right in its place. <hi>Let</hi> not <hi>Patience</hi>
only, but every Vertue <hi>have her perfect
work.</hi> Let Wisdom shine in its proper
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:52038:288"/>
sphere: let Love <hi>within</hi> be infinite and
eternal, in the light of true Knowledge
it is impossible to exceed: be right in
all thy Conceptions, and wise in all thine
Elections, and righteous in all thy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and just in all thy Actions; let
the habits of Compassion and Mercy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
and break out fitly upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
and the severity of Justice too
for the preservation of the World! Let
all be underlaid with solid Goodness, and
guided with Prudence, and governed
with Temperance, ordered with Care,
and carried on with Courage: lay hold
on thy Incentives by a lively Faith, and
on all the strengths of Eternity by a
glorious Hope, let all be sweetened with a
gracious Charity, fortified and secured
with invincible Meekness, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
concealed, and vail'd over with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;
let thy Contentment put a lustre
and grace upon all: let Magnanimity
and Modesty appear in thy actions, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
and Liberality act their part;
let Resignation to the Divine Will, and
Gratitude, come in to compleat all these,
and thy Life be beautified with the sweet
intermixture of Obedience and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Thy GODLINESS will be so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:52038:289"/>
that all Angels and Men will be
perfectly pleased, especially when thou
hast wiped out the Miscarriages by the
bloud of the Lamb, which in a little
chrystal Vial pure and clear thou ought'st
alwaies to carry about with thee, when
thou hast washed away the defilements
contracted in the work, with the Tears
of Repentance: Those Tears too he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in his Bottles, and they will turn into
Jewels. There is not one drop so small,
but it shall turn into a Precious Stone,
and continue for ever as it were frozen
into a Gem.<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 5.</note>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Gratitude. It feeds upon Benefits, and
is in height and fervour answerable to
their Greatness. The Question stated, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are able to love GOD more than
our selves. It is impossible to be grateful
to GOD without it. A hint of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Consequences of so doing.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHAT GOD has made us able to
do by way of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> you must
see in the Chapter of <hi>Magnificence.</hi> The
Love wherewith all these things ought to
be done, shall be so great in the estate of
Perfection, our Charity and Wisdom so
directly intend all Angels and Men, and
especially GOD above all blessed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
our Gratitude and Goodness make
us so zealous for their satisfaction, that no
pleasure in the whole World shall be
comparable to that of being Delightful to
them. To receive all is sweet, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all (adorned thus within the
sphere of our own lives) is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all that can be sweet in the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both for our glory and satisfaction.
There is ever upon us some pressing want
in this World, and will be till we are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:52038:290"/>
satisfied with varieties and degrees
of Glory. Of that which we feel at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
we are sensible: when that want is
satisfied and removed, another appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
of which before we were not aware.
Till we are satisfied we are so clamorous
and greedy, as if there were no pleasure
but in receiving all: When we have it we
are so full, that we know not what to do
with it, we are in danger of bursting, till
we can communicate all to some fit and
amiable Recipient, and more delight in
the Communication than we did in the
Reception. This is the foundation of real
Gratitude, and the bottom of all that
Goodness which is seated in the bent and
inclination of Nature. It is a Principle so
strong, that Fire does not burn with more
certain violence, than Nature study to
use all, when it hath gotten it, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
its <hi>Treasures</hi> to the acquisition of
its <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Holiness of all the work consists
in the Fervour wherewith it is done, and
if our Love shall in Heaven answer all its
Causes, it will be equal to all its Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Rewards, and as infinite in a
manner as the excellencies of its objects,
the very love of GOD towards all things
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:52038:290"/>
will be in it, our Love shall be in all his,
and his in ours. And if we love GOD, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, all Vertue, Grace and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
as they deserve; we shall so delight
in excellent actions, and in appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
and glorious before them, that we
would not for all Worlds miscarry in a
tittle: And therefore every defect (even
after pardon) will be an infinite <hi>disaster</hi>
as well as <hi>blemish.</hi> This is one effect of
<hi>Gratitude</hi> in Nature. And if it were not
for the Satisfaction of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the
efficacy of Faith and Repentance in his
Blood, the least Sinner in all Nature
would be eternally miserable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the advantages of <hi>Christs</hi> blood.
It is the desire of the Soul to be spotless
in it self. And if it be so prophane as to
build upon these advantages, without
taking care to be as excellent as it is able,
it is the most ungrateful Creature in the
World, and is too base and dirty, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in Glory.</p>
               <p>TO talk of overflowing in the disburs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and effusions of Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
till our emptiness and capacity be
full within, is as impertinent and unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
as to advise a Beggar to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a Kingdom, or a dead man to breath,
or one that is starving to give Wine and
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:52038:291"/>
Banquets to the Poor and Needy. But
when a man is full of blessedness and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nothing is so easie as to overflow unto
others: to forbid, or hinder him, is to sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
and destroy him. Breath with the same
necessity must be let out, as it is taken in.
A man dies as certainly by the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the want of it. To shut it up and
deny it are in effect the same. When a
man hath the glory of all Worlds, he is
willing to impart the delights wherewith
he is surrounded, to give away himself
to some amiable Object, to beautifie his
Life, and dedicate it to the use and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Spectators, and to put life into
all his Treasures by their Communication.
To love, and admire, and adore, and
praise, in such a case are not only pleasant,
but natural, and free, and inevitable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
It is then his supream and only
joy to be amiable and delightful. For the
actions of Love and Honour belong in a
peculiar manner to a plentiful estate:
Wants and Necessities when they pinch,
and grind us in a low condition, disturb
all those easie and delicate Resentments,
which find their element in the midst of
Pleasures and Superfluities. Hence it is,
that high-born Souls in Courts and Palaces
are addicted more to sweet and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:52038:291"/>
excesses, than Clowns and Peasants.
The one spend their life in Toil and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the other in Caresses and soft Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.
Amities and Bounties, Obligations
and Respects, Complements and Visits are
the life of Nobles: Industry and Care is
that of the meaner People. Honours and
Adorations are fit for the Temple not for
the Market. Soft and tender Affections
are more in the <hi>Court,</hi> than in the <hi>Shop</hi> or
<hi>Barn.</hi> There is some difference in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
even between the City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
But <hi>Heaven</hi> is the Metropolis of all
Perfection. GOD is a mighty King, and
all his Subjects are his Peers and Nobles.
Their life is more sublime, and pleasant,
and free, because more blessed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Their very Palaces and Treasures
are infinite Incentives to the works of
honour and delight, and they cannot rest
either day or night, but continually cry,
<hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord GOD of Hosts, Heaven
and Earth are full of the Majesty of thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
Their Beauties and Perfections en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
one another. Their very Joyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
them with eternal Love: and as all
Care and Labour are removed, so are all
delights and extasies established. Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Caresses, Adorations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies,
all the force and violence of
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:52038:292"/>
Love, Charms, Allurements, high Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
all the delicacies and riches of
sweet Affection, Honours and Beauties are
their Conversation. Towards GOD, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
themselves, towards each other,
they are all Harmony, and Joy, and Peace,
and Love: they flie upon Angels wings,
and trample upon Spices. <hi>Aromatick</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs
and Flowers are under feet; the
very ground upon which they stand is
beset with Jewels. Such you know were
the foundations of the Walls of the <hi>New
Jerusalem,</hi> and the pavement of the Street
was beaten Gold. GOD and the Lamb
were the Light, and the Temple of it.</p>
               <p>THAT we are to <hi>Enjoy</hi> all Angels and
Men by communicating our selves unto
them, is a little <hi>mysterious</hi>: but may more
easily be understood, than a thing so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
as <hi>The Enjoyment of GOD by way of
Gratitude.</hi> That we are to love GOD
more than our selves is apparently sure, at
least we ought to do it, but whether it be
possible, is a question of importance. That
we gain infinitely by his Love, is certain;
but that we gain more by our own, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiousl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
It is our duty to love him more
than our selves, but whether it be our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or no, is doubtful. It is impossible to
ascend at the first step to the top of the
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:52038:292"/>
Ladder. Even <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder will not
bring us to Heaven, unless we begin at the
bottom. Self-love is the first round, and
they that remove it, had as good take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all: For he that has no love for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
can never be obliged. He that cannot
be obliged cannot delight in GOD:
He that cannot delight in him cannot
enjoy him: He that cannot enjoy him,
cannot love him: He that cannot love
him cannot take pleasure in him, nor be
Grateful to him. Self-love is so far from
being the impediment, that it is the cause
of our Gratitude, and the only principle
that gives us power to do what we ought.
For the more we love our selves, the
more we love those that are our Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.
It is a great mistake in that arrogant
<hi>Leviathan,</hi> so far to imprison our love to
our selves, as to make it inconsistent with
Charity towards others. It is easie to
manifest, that it is impossible to love our
selves, without loving other things: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is crippled (or if it has her feet, has
her head cut off) if Self-preservation be
made her only concern: We desire to live
that we may do something else; without
doing which life would be a burden.
There are other principles of Ambition,
Appetite, and Avarice in the Soul: And
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:52038:293"/>
there are Honours, and Pleasures, and
Riches in the World. These are the end of
Self-preservation. And it is impossible for
us to love our selves without loving these.
Without loving these we cannot desire
them, without desiring canot enjoy them.
We are carried to them with greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and desire by the love of our selves.
Preservation is the first, but the weakest
and the low'st principle in nature. We feel
it first, and must preserve our selves, that
we may continue to enjoy other things:
but at the bottom it is the love of other
things that is the ground of this principle
of Self-preservation. And if you divide
the last from the first, it is the poorest
Principle in the World.</p>
               <p>TO love another more than ones self is
absurd and impossible. In Nature it is so,
till we are obliged; or perhaps till we see
it our interest, and find it our pleasure: It
is a surprize to an Atheistical fool; That
it should be ones interest to love another
better than ones self: yet Bears, Dogs, Hens,
Bees, Lions, Ants do it: they die for their
young-ones. Nurses, Fathers, Mothers do
it. Brides and Bridegrooms frequently do
it; and so do Friends. All valiant Hero's
love their Country better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
<hi>Moses</hi> would have his Name blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:52038:293"/>
out of the Book of Life rather than
the <hi>Israelites</hi> destroyed. St. <hi>Paul</hi> could
wish himself accursed from Christ for his
Brethren the <hi>Jews</hi>: and they both learnt
it of their <hi>Master, who made himself a Curse,</hi>
and even Sin <hi>for us.</hi> And it was his interest
to do it! If we are immortal, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be blessed, it must needs be our
interest to love him that is more blessed
than we, better than our selves; because
by that love we enjoy his blessedness,
which is more than our own, and by that
Love it is made ours and more than ours.
Is not all our Glory, and Vertue, and
Goodness seated in the excess of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
love! Do not all brave and heroical
deeds depend upon it? and does not the
man deserve to be burnt as an enemy to
all the World, that would turn all men
into Knaves and Cowards, and destroy
that only principle which delivers them
from being Mercenary Slaves and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains;
which is <hi>the Love of others!</hi> That
alone which renders a man useful to the
World is <hi>the Love of others.</hi> He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
this would pluck up all Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
by the roots: all Worth, Goodness,
and Honour! No wonder therefore he
should be an Atheist, since Nature is so
base and abominable before him. But its
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:52038:294"/>
Principles are oftentimes so generous, in
Truth, that they are too great for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Nothing is so ordinary in the false
way, as that of loving others better than
our selves. Even Dogs have starved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to death upon the absence of their
Masters. How many Fathers have gone
down with sorrow to their Graves, and
lost all the comfort of their lives in the
death of their Sons! How many Mothers
have broken their hearts for the death of
their Children! How many Widows have
buried themselves alive for the loss of
their Husbands; I mean, by sequestring
themselves from all the delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the World! How many Lovers
dote, and wax pale, and forget their
Meat, Sleep, and Employment, and run
mad for their Mistresses! Are there no
such Examples; or is there no strength in
such Examples as these? But to love GOD
better than ones self seemeth more unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
Ah vile! the more base, and more
wicked we! How we should love GOD
better than our selves is easie to unfold by
the principles of Self love, and Self exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Take it in the manner following:
(and when you have seen its possibility,
consider the glory of doing it, the benefit,
and felicity, and honour that is in it. For
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:52038:294"/>
it is all worth and pleasure, goodness and
beauty, Gratitude and Vertue, wisdom
and security, perfection and excellency.
We love our selves more in doing it, than
it is possible to do without it.)</p>
               <p>IT is natural to all them that love
themselves, to love their Benefactors, and
all those things that are conducive to
their welfare, pleasure, satisfaction: And
the more they love themselves, the more
apprehensive they are of the benefit they
receive, and the more prone to love that
which occasions it. The more goodness
we find in any thing, the more we are
prone to love it; and the more we love
it, the more to take pleasure in it. And if
we find it highly convenient, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
delightful, we had (not seldom)
rather die than part with it: we love our
selves only that we might live to enjoy
that glory, or delight, or beauty, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
that we find so agreeable. It
often falls out, for want of acquaintance
with delightful things, that we think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so powerfully sweet, as to engage
our Soul, beyond the possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving
it self: and that nothing can
cleave so strangely to our minds, as to be
nearer and dearer than Life it self. Yet
oftentimes we find men of this opinion
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:52038:295"/>
changing their minds, when they have
chanced to taste some sweetness in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they were not aware of, and then to
become such miraculous Converts, that
they love not themselves but for the sake
of that delight which they have found in
the World. I make it a great Question,
would men sink into the depth of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
Whether all Self-love be not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the love of other things? And
whether it be not utterly impossible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it? Only the love of those things is so
near and close to the love of our selves,
that we cannot distinguish them, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
them for one and the same. If the
Sun were extinguished, and all the World
turned into a Chaos; I suppose there
are few that love themselves so, but they
would die, which plainly shews that the
love of the World is inseparably annexed
with the love of our selves, and if the one
were gone, the other would be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
especially if the sweetness of the
Air, and its freedom and ease, were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into fire and torment. For then we
would surely desire to die, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it: which shews that the love of ease
and repose is greater than the love of
our very Beings, though not so perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
till we have examined the business.
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:52038:295"/>
But if there be any pleasure, or goodness,
or beauty truly infinite, we are apt to
cleave unto it with adhaesion so firm, that
we forget our selves, and are taken up
only with the sence and contemplation,
of it. The ravishment is so great, that we
are turned all into extasie, transportation
and desire, and live intirely to the object
of our fruition. The power of infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and sweetness is as irresistible, as it
is ineffable. And if GOD be all beauty
and delight, all amiable and lovely, truly
infinite in goodness and bounty, when we
see him, and taste the grace of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
the blessedness and glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are amazed, possesseth us intirely
and becometh our sole and adaequate
concern. After that sight it is better perish
and be annihilated, than live and be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
of it. The fall from so great a
height would fill the Soul with a cruel
remembrance, and the want of its former
glory and bliss be an infinite torment.
Now if it loved nothing but it self, it
could endure all this; rather than forsake
it self, or lose, or be bereaved of its essence,
it would endure any misery whatsoever.
Or to speak more correct and accurate
sence, it would be incapable of any Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Patience or Misery, but only that
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:52038:296"/>
which flow'd from its abolition. Nothing
could prejudice it but the change of its
Being.</p>
               <p>THAT is not likely to love it self after
the way which some conceive proper to
Self-love, which is willing to forsake it self
upon any Misery, and apt to forget it self
upon any great felicity. It loves it self
that it might enjoy such a pleasure, but
loves that pleasure so much beyond it self
that it is ready to go out of it self, and is
almost beside it self for the fruition of it.
Loving it self only for that end, and that
chiefly and for its own sake, it loves that
far more than it loves it self. And there is
no limit nor bound, when it once begins
to love any thing more than it self, it may
proceed eternally: and provided its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be infinitely more excellent, it will
easily and greedily love it infinitely more
than it can it self, and value the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of its own life only for the sake of
that which it so infinitely esteems and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in. It is true indeed it presupposes
its Capacity: but what would that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
be worth, were it not for Objects.</p>
               <p>WERE there no SUN it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for so fair an <hi>Idea</hi> to be conceived in
a Mirror, as is sometimes in a Glass, when
it is exposed to the skie. The Mirror is in
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:52038:296"/>
it self a dark piece of Glass; and how so
much fire, and flame, and splendor should
come from it while it is a cold Flint or
piece of Steel, how it should be advanced
by any Art whatsoever to so much beauty
and glory, as to have a Sun within it self,
and to dart out such bright and celestial
beams no man could devise. Yet now there
is a Sun, the Matter is easie, 'tis but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to the face of the Sun, and the Glass
is transformed. And if GOD dwelleth in
the Soul as the Sun in a Mirror, while it
looketh upon him, the love of GOD must
needs issue from that Soul, for <hi>GOD is love,</hi>
and his love is in it. The impression of all
his Beauty swallows up the Being of the
Soul, and changes it wholly into another
nature. The Eye is far more sensible of the
Day, and of the beauty of the Universe,
than it is of it self, and is more affected
with that light it beholds, than with its
own essence. Even so the Soul when it sees
GOD is sensible only of the glory of that
eternal Object: All it sees is GOD, it is
unmindful of it self. It infinitely feels him,
but forgets it self in the Rapture of its
Pleasure.</p>
               <p>BUT we leave Illustrations, and come
to the reason of the thing in particular.
The Soul loving it self is naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:52038:297"/>
in its own happiness, and readily
confesseth it oweth as much love to any
Benefactour, as its bounty deserveth. And
if the value of the Benefit be the true
reason of the esteem, and Reason it self the
ground of the return, A little Kindness
deserveth a little love, and much deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more. Reason it self is adapted to the
measure of the good it receiveth, and for
a shilling-worth of Service, a shilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
of Gratitude is naturally paid. For
a Crown or a Kingdom the Soul is enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with a degree of affection that is not
usual. Now GOD created and gave me
my self; for my Soul and my Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I owe him as much as my Soul and
Body are worth: and at the first dash am
to love him as much as my self. Heaven
and Earth being the gifts of his Love
superadded to the former, I am to Love
him upon that account as much more as
the World is worth; and so much more
than I love my self. If he hath given all
Angels and Men to my fruition, every one
of these is as great as my self, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of those I am to love him as
much as that Angel or Man is worth. But
he has given me his Eternity, his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Power, his Omnipresence, his Wisdom,
his Goodness, his Blessedness, his Glory.
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:52038:297"/>
Where am I? Am I not lost and swallow'd
up as a Centre in all these Abysses? While
I love him as much as all these are worth,
to which my Reason, which is the essence
of my Soul, does naturally carry me, I
love him infinitely more than my self;
unless perhaps the possibility of enjoying
all these things makes me more to esteem
my self, and increases my Self-love for
their sake more than for my own. Thus
when I see my self infinitely beloved, I
conceive a Gratitude as infinite in me, as
all its Causes. Self-preservation is made
so natural and close a Principle, by all the
hopes and possibilities to which I am
created. Those Hopes and Possibilities
are my tender concern: and I live for
the sake of my infinite Blessedness. Now
that is GOD: And for his sake it is that
I love my self, and for the glory and
joy of delighting in him, I desire my
continuance; and the more I delight in
him, my Continuance is so much the more
dear and precious to my self. Thus is
GOD infinitely preferred by Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
my self, and my Love to my self,
being thoroughly satisfied, turns into the
Love of GOD, and dies like a grain of
Corn in the Earth to spring up in a new
and better form, more glorious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:52038:298"/>
more great and verdant, more
fair and delightful: more free, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and noble; more grateful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The Love of GOD is the sole and
immediate Principle upon which I am
to act in all my Operations.</p>
               <p>NOW if you enquire what Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
accrue by this Love, to the Soul of
the Lover, we are lost again in Oceans
of infinite Abundance. The strength, and
brightness, and glory of the Soul, all its
Wisdom, Goodness and Pleasure are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by it, founded in it, derived and
spring from it: as we have before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon the Nature of Love. The solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that one Question will open the
mystery, Whether we gain more by his
Love, or our own? All that we gain by
his Love amounts to the <hi>Power</hi> of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
the <hi>Act</hi> of Loving we gain by our
own, and all that depends upon it.</p>
               <p>BY his Love he existeth eternally for
our Enjoyment, as the Father of GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY
which is begotten by it self: but we
do not gain all this by his Love; but by
our own. Some man would say, We gain
our Souls and Bodies by the Love of
GOD, all Ages and Kingdoms, Heaven
and Earth. Angels and Men, infinite and
eternal Joyes, because all these were
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:52038:298"/>
without our care or power prepared by
him, and his love alone. They were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
indeed by <hi>his</hi> Love, but are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
or enjoyed by it. <hi>He so loved the
World that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi>
and with him all the Laws and Beauties
of his Kingdom: but unless we love him,
unless we are sensible of his Love in all
these, and esteem it, we do not enjoy our
Souls or Bodies, Angels or Men, Heaven
or Earth, Jesus Christ or his Kingdom:
Rather we trample upon all, and despise
all, and make our selves deformed. All
these do but serve to increase our Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and aggravate our Guilt, unless
we love and delight in their Author, and
his Love it self will eternally confound
us. So that we gain and enjoy the Love
of GOD by ours. Now Love returned for
Love is the Soul of Gratitude. In that
act, and by it alone, we gain all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent:
And beside all these become il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Creatures. It is more to our
avail to be Divine and Beautiful, than to
see all the World full of Delights and
Treasures. They would all be nothing to
us, without our Love. Nothing does so
much alienate and estrange the Soul
from any Object, as want of Affection.
All the Kingdom of Heaven is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:52038:299"/>
and made ours by Love alone. The
inferiour perfections of our own Essence
are gained by Love, and by it we accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
the end of our Creation. We receive
and enjoy all the benevolence of GODS
former Love by ours; are made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in our selves, and delightful to GOD,
which can never be brought to pass any
other way, but by our Love alone. By
Loving him as we ought to do, we enable
him to take pleasure in us! And this is of
all other the greatest benefit. We cloath
our selves with the similitude of all his
Attributes, and shine in his Image by
Love alone. Our Love, as it acquires,
crowns our Perfections with his infinite
Complacency. <hi>This is my beloved Son in
whom I am well pleased,</hi> is a voice that
can be directed to none, but him only
that loveth GOD with an eternal Love.
He cannot rest satisfied in any that hate,
or despise him. The eternal complacency
and delight of GOD, whereby we are
crowned with eternal Glory is acquired,
and receives its Being in a manner by
Love alone.</p>
               <p>NOW to love GOD is to desire Him
and his Glory, to esteem him and his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
to long for him and his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to be pleased with him in all his
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:52038:299"/>
Qualities and Dispositions, or (more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly)
in all his Attributes and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to delight in all his Thoughts and
Waies. It is to love him in all his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.
And he that is not resolved to
love every Excellency in him, as much as
it deserveth, does not love GOD at all:
for he has no design to please him. But
he that purposes to do it, must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
love GOD more than himself, because
he finds more Objects for his Love in
GOD, than in himself; GOD being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more excellent than he. But if this
seem a grievous task, it is not a matter of
<hi>Severity,</hi> but <hi>Kindness.</hi> We mistake its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Duty does not spring from any
disorder in GOD, not from any unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
or arrogant <hi>Selfishness,</hi> as base and
foolish men are apt to imagine, but from
his Excellency: it <hi>naturally</hi> springeth from
the greatness of his <hi>Worth</hi>: And it is our
<hi>freedom,</hi> when we see his infinite Beauty,
to love it as it <hi>deserveth.</hi> When we so do,
we shall infinitely love it <hi>more</hi> than our
selves: because it is infinitely <hi>better</hi>: And
indeed, shall find it so conveniently seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Deity for us, that could it be
transposed or remov'd, it would no where
else be fit for our fruition. It is that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
act of Love and Goodness that made
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:52038:300"/>
all the Kingdom of Glory for us: that
Care and Providence that governs all
Worlds for our Perfection, that infinite
and eternal Act that gave us our Being.
That Beauty is it self the Deity, and
wherever it appeareth there GOD is, The
GOD HEAD is the Beauty in which we
are all made perfect. And because we
<hi>were</hi> nothing, we must be infinitely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that he <hi>is</hi> Eternal; because it is his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Act that gives us a Being: and the
Act, Oh how Divine! It is his Beauty and
Glory. Can we chuse but love that Act,
which is all Goodness and Bounty! Which
prepares for, and gives to, us, infinite feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city!
If we love our selves we must needs
love it, for we cannot forbear to love the
fountain of all our delights, and the more
we love it, the more ardently we delight
in it, the sweeter and more transporting
will all our Raptures be, the more feeling
and lively, the more divine and perfect
will our Souls and our Joyes be: When
we know GOD, we cannot but love him
more than our selves: and when we do
so, his Blessedness and Glory will be more
than ours; we shall be more than Deified,
because in him we shall find all our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and be eternally Crowned. We
must of necessity sit in his Throne, when
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:52038:300"/>
we see him enjoying all his Glory, because
his Glory is his Goodness to us, and his
Blessedness our Felicity: Because in the
acts of our Understanding we shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
be with him, and infinitely
be satisfied in all his Fruitions.
That Excellency which obliges us, will
enable us to love him more than our
selves: and while we delight in him for
our own sakes, we shall steal insensibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a more divine and deeper Delight,
we shall love him for his. And even in
point of Gratitude adore his Glory.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Adore</hi> and <hi>Maligne</hi> are opposite
things: to <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Adore</hi> are inconsistent.
Self-love is apt to leap at all advantages,
and the more we love our selves, the more
prone we are to covet and wish whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we see Great and Excellent in another.
But he hath conquered our Envy by his
infinite Bounty: and made us <hi>able</hi> to adore
him by the Perfection of his Essence. To
cover the Perfections of him we adore, is
impossible. It is impossible to adore him
whom we would spoil, and rob of his
Perfections. For Adoration is a joyful
acknowledgment of the infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of an <hi>Adorable</hi> Object, resting sweetly
in them with acquiescence and rejoycing.
It is prone to add and to offer more. An
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:52038:301"/>
adoring Soul is in the act of sacrificing it
self to the Deity, and with infinite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
admiring and adoring all his
Glories.</p>
               <p>HIS Glories will be inspired into the
Soul it self, for the healing of that Envy
to which it is otherwise addicted. And
instead of Robbery, and Discontentment,
and Blasphemy, and Covetousness, the
Soul shall be full of Honour and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and Complacency: and be glad to
see its GOD the full and eternal act of
Perfection and Beauty. It was from all
eternity impossible there should be any
other but he; and he from all eternity has
so infinitely obliged us, that were it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for any other to have been, it would
not be desirable. He hath obliged us, and
we love him better than any other. Should
we fancy or conceive another, a Power
from all Eternity acting, should we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it possible that a Power besides him
might have bin; it must be just such a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as this is, and act just in such a manner as
this hath done: or it would be displeasing.
This hath done all that we can desire, all
that all Powers infinite and eternal can
do <hi>well</hi>: and therefore all possible Powers
are conceived in him. He is the full and
adaequate object of all Desire; because
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:52038:301"/>
the Fountain of all the most Glorious
things, and the sole perfect cause of all
Enjoyment whatsoever.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Beauty of Gratitude. Its principal Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Amity and Communion are the great
effect of its Nature. The true Character
of a Grateful Person. GOD'S Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
Attributes enjoyed by Gratitude.
All Angels and Men are a Grateful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's
Treasures, as they assist him in Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
He sacrifices all Worlds to the Deity,
and supreamly delighteth to see him sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Throne of Glory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>GOD having prepared the way to
Gratitude by infusing generous and
noble Principles into the Soul, beautified the
Exercise of it by divers other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that conspire to make it amiable and
delightful. By the one he made it <hi>Possible,</hi> by
the other desirable.</p>
               <p>ONE of the greatest ornaments of this
<hi>Vertue,</hi> is the <hi>Grateful Sence</hi> of Benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
For in it the Felicity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
consisteth; on it his Grateful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
dependeth; by it he is made
<hi>Grateful,</hi> or <hi>Acceptable;</hi> and it is one of the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:52038:302"/>
great Ends intended in the Gift bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Donor, whose Satisfaction
ought to be regarded highly by every
honest and worthy Receiver. That Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sence is the crown of the Gift, the
Light wherein its Beauty appears, the
Temple of its Honour as it were, the
Womb wherein it is conceived, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
its life and value perfected.</p>
               <p>SHOULD we stand upon the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these, we should have little room
for the Fruits and Effects of Gratitude,
which are the principal things intended
in this Chapter. But in short you may take
this account. The greatest Benefits we can
receive, are but <hi>Abortive,</hi> or rather turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Curses,</hi> without a Grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of them: All Gifts are but
<hi>Carkasses</hi> devoid of Life, unless inspired
with that <hi>Sence,</hi> which maketh them <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</hi>
For as Causes without Effects are
not Causes; of Blessings, if they Bless not,
are falsely reputed Blessings. No Benefits
can be Blessings, unless they are <hi>crowned</hi>
with our Complacency. They must be
conceived in the Mind before they can
be transformed into Joy, and be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into Joyes before they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
those Praises which are the musick
of the Benefactors Soul, as well as of the
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:52038:302"/>
Receivers. They are not <hi>conceived,</hi> unless
they are <hi>quickened</hi> with the <hi>Life</hi> of the
Receiver, nor are they reputed Blessings,
till they are had in <hi>Reputation.</hi> An <hi>interior
Sence</hi> is the Life and Soul of every Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
without which a whole World of
Delights would be but a <hi>Chaos,</hi> the very
Kingdom of Heaven but a Confusion to
him for whom it is prepared, and a Soul
among the Angels but a <hi>Fool</hi> in Paradice.
An Ungrateful Person bereaves himself
of the Pleasure, that should spring from
his Enjoyment, for the stifles the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Gift he receiveth. He <hi>Eclipses</hi>
and extinguishes his own blessedness by
the <hi>dulness</hi> of his Soul, and the perversness
of his Behaviour. He may be surrounded
with <hi>Causes</hi> of Delight, but is not blessed,
that is not full of the <hi>Joyes</hi> wherewith he
is surrounded. When he is full of Joyes he
must needs overflow with Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
which are the very element of
Thanksgiving, the matter and fuel, as well
as the Soul of Praises. Were there nothing
in a Grateful Sence but this, Gratitude
were an incomparable Vertue, because all
the effects of infinite and eternal Bounty
are by vertue of that Grace applyed to
the Soul, and enjoyed thereby, but are lost
without it. That certainly must be a great
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:52038:303"/>
Vertue, by force of which we inherit all
things.</p>
               <p>AS for the Beauty of the Receiver, it
is evident that a <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>heavy</hi> Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the disgrace of his Nature. His Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
makes him a worthless piece of
<hi>Clay,</hi> that cannot be improved to any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
A carelessness and contempt of
Benefits springeth from his Sottishness,
which maketh him <hi>Ingrateful,</hi> that is, <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>:
because he cannot be won by Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
nor wrought upon by Gifts. But he
is more deformed, because he acts in a
bruitish manner, <hi>against Reason</hi>; while he
faileth to do what is fit and proper on
such occasions. It is a base and dirty Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
that cannot be enflamed with the
Love of a Benefactor. It is incapable of
high and generous <hi>Sentiments</hi>; is dull
and dry, insipid and untractable, as dead
as a Log of Wood, a crabbed and knotty
piece of matter, that cannot be wrought,
and only fit for the fire! But a quick and
lively Perceiver, a tender Sence, and
sprightly Intelligence, is all honour and
delight upon the Reception, all activity,
life, and vigour, Angelical in his nature,
sweet and heavenly; apt to come up to the
Benefactor, and answer his desires: He is
rich and abundant in amiable Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:52038:303"/>
and prone to make Returns suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Kindness wherewith he is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
He has a strange kind of Beauty
lodged in his Soul; there is a sweet Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,
and a delicate Convenience
between his Nature and his Benefactors.
All his Inclinations are Purity and Praise,
he is a great encouragement to the Love
of his Benefactor, an ornament to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
an admirer of his Worth, an appendix
of his Honour, and a pleasure to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
all Life and Goodness. He is
capable of Amity in the heights of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</p>
               <p>A wise and worthy Benefactor designs
the felicity and contentment of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to whom he imparteth his Bounties:
and if he were able, would do that for
him, which above all other things is most
to be desired; not <hi>compel</hi> him to be Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
whether he would or no; for that
would but spoil the beauty of his Return,
but make him capable of the best and
highest Resentments; that he might have
the Joy of seeing his Benefits work kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
All which are lost and thrown away
upon an ungrateful Person. This GOD
hath done. He has put brave Principles
and Inclinations into the Soul of Man,
and left him freely to exert them, with
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:52038:304"/>
infinite desire to see him act freely, but
generously and nobly. For by this means
only, is he made capable of Honour, and
the essence of Gratitude consists in the
freedom of its operation. Having so made
him, and desiring nothing more than a
lovely Behaviour, his Joy is as great as his
Goodness can inspire, when he sees that
sweetness which attends the Operation
and the work of Reason, in a Grateful
Person; and the Joy which he occasions
is his own Joy, in the Soul of his Creature.
Of which to rob GOD is a kind of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Sacriledge,</hi> and a cruel Murther
committed on our selves. For we have an
inclination to delight in the Joyes, of
which we are the Authors, and by a kind
of Eccho, or reflection, find the Pleasure
doubled which we take, and which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the communication of our Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And in this there is founded a certain
sympathy of Delight, which carries us to
feel and be affected with anothers Joy,
and makes <hi>it</hi> an Object, and a Caufe of
ours, nay almost the very Form aud Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of ours, when we are the Authors
of it. A Grateful Soul holds Intelligence
with GOD; as it receives his <hi>Bounties,</hi>
it delights in his <hi>Complacencies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="543" facs="tcp:52038:304"/>
THE great effect of Obligation and
Gratitude, is Amity and Communion. A
Grateful Soul is deeply concerned in the
Honour of his Benefactor; in his Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
Pleasure, Life, and Safety, in all his
Successes, Prosperities, Advancements; in
all his Felicity and Glory! He is afflicted
in all his Afflictions, he is delighted in all
his Enjoyments, he is crowned in all his
Promotions, he is wronged and injured
in all his Affronts, he is touched with the
least Displeasure that can befal him: Nay
he is more tender of his Benefactors Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
than his own: The apple of his Eye
is the tenderest part in himself, yet he had
rather have it touched, than the Person
of his Benefactor. No wounds can wound
him more than those which his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
receiveth, and he in him. His
own wounds may kill his Body, but these
destroy his Contentment. A thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and Calumnics against himself he
can forgive, and is never provoked but
when his Friend is offended. He slights
himself, and prefers his Benefactor: He
would make his Face a Stepping stone to
his Benefactors Glory. He exposes his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to Swords, and Spears, and Arrows,
for his Benefactors safety: He would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be torn to pieces, and suffer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:52038:305"/>
Deaths, than permit his Benefactor
to be slain or dishonoured. Now all this in
time of Trial and distress, would seem
disadvantagious. But besides the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there is Sence of Honour that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> a
man thereunto, and a certain beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the act of Gratitude, distinct from
the goodness of the Benefit, that is so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
sweet to the goodness of the Soul,
that it is better to die than renounce it.
And a certain Baseness on the other side,
an odiousoess in <hi>Ingratitude</hi> (in the very
act) so abominable, that it blasts any Safety
and Repose that can be gotten by it.</p>
               <p>WHERE the Benefits are small, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Gratitude is less powerful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
for its strength depends upon its
food and nourishment. A thin and spare
diet is not very healthful for it. Though
all the benefits that are done upon the
Earth by Men to Men are infinitely mean,
if compared to those which the Godhead
does to the least of his Creatures; yet the
World is full of the praise of this Vertue,
and an Ingrateful man is the most hateful
Object living. Former Ages afford us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rare and glorious Examples of the
power of Gratitude, and its sacred Zeal
for, and tenderness of its Object. The u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
between the Body and the Soul is
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:52038:305"/>
nothing comparable to the union of Love
and its Beloved, though the Causes are
but slight upon which it is founded. The
Soul will often forsake its mansion to
dwell with its beloved. It esteems all its
beauties and Members only for its Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds
sake. Yet Colours and Features, a
little red and white, a sparkling Eye, a
brisk Conversation, and a delectable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
are all that breed it, all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this mighty effect, this prodigy of
Nature. There is something more, where
the Life and Honour of a man has been
saved, by the kindness of a Benefactor: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if he be rich and amiable that
has delivered us. If he be great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
that was the Author of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
the obligation is the greater. For the
Worth of the Person enters into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the act, and enhances its value.
Yet all this put together is exceeded by
the Gratitude of a worthy Soul, because
his own Worth inclines him to be more
<hi>Generous</hi> than the Cause requires, and to
magnifie the benefit, by the mighty addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own goodness. It is the natural
property of Goodness to communicate it
self, any occasion of doing it, is instead of
a Cause. But when there is a Cause, it is
like a spark to Powder, it enkindles
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:52038:306"/>
a flame in his <hi>Inclination.</hi> All acts of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
have a great deal of sweetness in
their own nature, and for the sake of that
beauty which is seated in themselves will
not be rigorous and exact in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
since it is a beautiful thing to
exceed in Goodness. Its own disposition
prompts it to do more than is deserved
by the Kindness it receives, and if not to
conceive it self more obliged than it is,
yet to be more honourable in its Returns,
than the meer goodness of its Benefactor
can exact; because it conceives it self by
its own Vertue obliged to be Noble and
Munificent, in all its acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>BUT however slow Gratitude may be
in the Returns which it maketh for smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
benefits, it is infinitely prone to exceed
all measure, when it is <hi>infinitely</hi> obliged.
Praises are not fed by mean Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but by sublime ones. The acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
is cool, where the benefits are
small; and the Contentments imperfect,
where they are limited and restrained:
Full Satisfaction hath another kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on the Soul of Man, than single
Kindnesses, or some few particular Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.
An infinite Bliss produces more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and joyful efforts, than bare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments.
Here upon Earth there
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:52038:306"/>
are disquiets, and destres, and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Complaints, and defects, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
fears and interests to be still
secured, that lame and darken our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and Gratitude. But in Heaven
all these admixtures of alloy are remov'd.
The glory of the light in which our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
appeareth, adds lustre and beauty
to the increase of its Perfection. In the
utmost height of our Satisfaction there is
such an infinite and eternal <hi>force,</hi> that our
Gratitude breaks out in exulting and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
Effusions; all our Capacities, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and Desires being fully satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we have nothing else to do, but to
Love and be Grateful. An infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Kingdom given to him that was
taken out of Nothing, by a King that is
infinite in greatness and beauty; all his
Joyes, and all his Treasures! it makes the
Soul a fountain of Delights, whole nature
is to receive no more, but overflow for
ever. When the Soul cometh once to love
GOD so infinitely above it self, as the
cause requireth, its only delight is to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
him and to see him blessed. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and sweetness of its own Gratitude is as
rich and divine as all <hi>his</hi> Gifts. It is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
here infinitely more to exceed its
Causes than ever before. Amazements,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:52038:307"/>
Admirations, Affections, Praises, Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs,
Raptures, Extasies, and Blessings are
all its delights: The pleasure of Loving
is its only business; it is turned all into
flame, and brightness, and transportation,
and excess. It infinitely passes Light and
Fire in quickness and motion: all Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
are devoured, and GOD alone is
its Life and Glory. The more Great, the
more high, the more excellent he is; the
more blessed is it self, the more joyful, and
the more contented. Its Nature is to shine,
and burn, and admire; to offer, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
up it self to its Joyes: And GOD
is its soveraign Joy, its perfect happiness.
To suspend its beams were to act against
Nature. All overtures of Pleasure, Beauty,
Glory, Power, Exaltation and Honour it
would have added to its happiness. The
more Great, the more Good, the Wiser
GOD is, the greater is its Happiness. The
more he is admired and praised, the
greater is its Happiness. The more he is
magnified and pleased, the greater is its
Happiness. All the Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in its Objective bliss, though they
are not locally removed, are removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Soul of him that enjoyes it; and
there express themselves far more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
and effectually, than if they were
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:52038:307"/>
there alone. No joy can be like that of
seeing its Creatour adored, no Service
like that of magnifying its Beloved, no
pleasure like that of delighting its Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
no melody like that of praising its
Benefactor, no honour like that of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its
Preserver. All Worlds are its Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
because they manifest his Power
and Glory; all Angels and Men its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
because they see and acknowledge
the beauty of its Soveraign, and eternal
<hi>Perfection</hi>; all Creatures the Instruments
of its Joy, that celebrate his Praises! In
him it enjoyes the glory of all Eternity,
the infinite beauty of all Immensity, the
innumerable riches of all Worlds, the
pleasures and adorations of all the Angels,
the state and magnificence of all Empires,
the splendour and perfection of all Ages;
all which it has in it self, by his infinite
Bounty, as its own immediate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Possessions; but far more divinely
and sweetly enjoyes them, by vertue of
its Gratitude and Love, to him, whose
they originally are, and from whom they
proceeded. For the very true reason why
it enjoyes <hi>it self,</hi> and all its <hi>own</hi> Treasures,
is because it loves <hi>it self</hi>: And the more
it loves <hi>him,</hi> the more it will be delighted
with <hi>his</hi> fruitions. It is more concerned,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:52038:308"/>
it feels more, it sees more, it tastes more,
it possesses more, it rejoyces more in its
Object than it self. The imagination and
fancy that is in Love frames all the
thoughts of its Beloved, in it self; it has
an exquisite and tender sence of every
change and motion in the mind of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.
<hi>Stir not up, nor awake my Love, till
he please,</hi> is the song of a feeling and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
Soul. Every prick with a Needles
point in its Object, is a stab with a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to it self. Its heart bleeds in every
drop of its Objects finger. It loves his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
ten thousand times more than it
self: and is infinitely more pleased with
its exaltation, than its own. The happiness
of its Object is most its own. True Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is crowned in its Benefactor, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned
in its benefactor, admired in its
benefactor, adored in its benefactor. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in all the World is so easily ravished
as Love, nothing is so lively as Love, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so lovely! Nothing so violent in its
grief or joy, nothing so capable of pain
or pleasure: All the Victories and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of its Saviour are its own. My Joy,
my Life, my Crown, my Glory; my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great Reward, my Love, my
Soul, my Idol, nay the GOD of my Soul!
my All in all! This is the language of
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:52038:308"/>
Love in its Rapture. Seraphick Love!
It is Altar, Heart and Sacrifice, Angelical
Love! It is Priest and Temple: All Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Freedom, Duty, Reward, Desire, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,
Honour, Praise, Adoration,
Thanksgiving, Extasie, Pleasure, Bliss and
Happiness. It is all Goodness and Beauty,
Paradice, Heaven; the life and Soul of
Heaven! All that is incommunicable in
GOD, Eternity, almighty Power, supream
Dominion, independent Majesty, infinite
Immensity, with all the adorations and
praises of all the Creatures, are by such
a Love and Gratitude enjoyed. Loving
GOD more than it self, it is more happy
in GOD, than if it were a GOD. Could
Is Deity be taken away, and seated in it
self, the Soul of a Grateful Creature
would be grieved at the exchange. Even
GOD in his place is perfectly enjoyed.
All Envy is by perfect Gratitude remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
All Discontentment at any thing in
its Object, especially at its Objects Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
is abolished. It is carried above
all Thrones, Dominions and Powers, and
still ascends eternally higher, the higher
its Object is exalted. Could it be misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in it self, it would be happy in its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
but the higher it is exalted, the more
is its Creatour delighted. If the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:52038:309"/>
be wholly Spiritual, the Soul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be transformed to Gratitude, as
Gratitude is to Contentment, and Praise,
and Thanksgiving. But it will have no
Body, no frail and corruptible Flesh, no
bones or members to look after. All its
operations are of one kind, all its works
and concernments are the same. It has
no Fear, or Care to divert it; no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or danger, or distraction. Pure
Gratitude is so divine a thing, that the
Soul may safely wish to be turned <hi>all</hi> into
Gratitude. Its Employment and Nature
are all one, acknowledgment and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
united together. It sacrifices all
Worlds to the Deity, and with infinite
delight desires to offer all Honour and
Glory to him. It is very sensible, that it
can never pay so much Honour to GOD
as is his due, unless it be assisted with all
the Tongues of Men and Angels. It goes
along with their Joyes, and consents to
their Praises. In them it adores, and by
them it admires, with them it conspires,
and takes in all their powers and divine
affections. It fees with all their Eyes,
hears with all their Ears, speaks with all
their Mouths, and useth all their Hearts
in loving and adoring. All the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and operations of Universal Nature
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:52038:309"/>
are subservient to its desires. It surmounts
the Songs of <hi>David,</hi> and yet we know
how earnestly he exhorted all Creatures
to praise him. <hi>Praise ye the Lord: Praise him
in the Sanctuary; Praise him in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Power; Praise him in his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Acts; Praise him according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Greatness. Praise him in the Heights;
Praise him all ye Angels; Praise him all
his Hosts: Praise him Sun and Moon, Praise
him all ye Stars of light. Praise him ye
Heaven of Heavens!</hi> And when all is
done, it still confesseth, that <hi>his Name is
exalted far above all Blessing and Praise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE that praiseth GOD only for his
Health, and Food, and Rayment, and
for his blessing on his Calling (as too
many only do) either is very ignorant,
or upon a strict scrutiny, will be detected
for upbraiding GOD, for the meanest of
his bounty. For his Love must infinitely
be defective, that is able to bestow Gifts
infinitely more, yet giveth us none but
these. He that sees not more Causes of
Joy than these, is blind and cannot see
afar off: The very truth or Religion is
obscure to him, and the cause of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unknown. He wanteth ten thousand
demonstrations of the Love of GOD,
and as many Incentives to coflame his
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:52038:310"/>
Soul in the Return of Love, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with these high and mighty
bounties. No man can return more Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
than he receiveth: nor can his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
exceed the number (and greatness) of
his Joyes. A House is too little, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is too narrow for a Soul to move in.
The World is a confinement to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that is able to see Eternity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Immensity of Almighty GOD!
He that can look into infinite Spaces,
must see them all full of delights, or be
infinitely displeased. How like an Angel
doth he soar aloft, how divine is his life,
how glorious and heavenly; that doth
converse with infinite and eternal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
intermeddle with all the delights
of GOD, assume the similitude of his
knowledge and goodness, make <hi>all his</hi>
Works his Riches, his Laws his Delights,
his Counsels his Contemplations, his
Wayes his Joyes, and his Attributes his
Perfections! He that appropriates all the
World, and makes it his own peculiar is
like unto GOD, meet to be his Son, and
fit to live in Communion with him. The
Kingdom of GOD is made visible to
him to whom all Kingdoms are so many
Mansions of Joy, and all Ages but the
streets of his own City. The man that
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:52038:310"/>
sees all Angels and Men his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,
and the whole Family of GOD
in Heaven and Earth, his own Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
is fit for Heaven. As he hath more
encouragements to believe in GOD, and
to delight in him, so hath he more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
to engage his fear, more allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to provoke his desire, more incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to enflame his love, and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to compel his obedience: More
arguments to strengthen his Hope, more
materials to feed his Praises, more Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to make him Humble, more fuel for
Charity to others, more grounds of
Contentment in himself, more helps to
inspire him with Fortitude, more rewards
to quicken his Industry, more engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Circumspection and Prudence,
more ballast to make him Stable, more
lights to assist his Knowledge, more
sails to forward his Motion, more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
in which to spend his Time,
more attractives to Meditation, and
more entertainments to enrich his Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
He hath more aids to confirm his
Patience, more avocations from Injuries
to Meekness, more wings to carry him
above the World, and more Gates to
let him into Heaven. He hath more <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders</hi>
to keep him from Sin, more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:52038:311"/>
to increase his Guilt, more
odious deformities in every Vice, more
waters to augment his Tears, more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to Repentance, and more Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
upon his Reconciliation: More
hopes to relieve his Prayer, more
bounds to secure his Prosperity, more
comforts in Adversity, and more Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah's
in all Estates: More delights
to entertain his Friends, more sweetness
in his Conversation, more arts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
his Enemies, more Feasts in abste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious
Fasts, more and better sawce than
other at his Feasts, innumerable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
night and day, in Health, in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in Death, in Prison; at his Table,
in his Bed, in his Grove, in his Garden,
in the City, in the Field, in his Journy,
in his Walk, at all times, and in all places.
He hath more antidotes against Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
more weapons in his Spiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
more balsom for his Wounds, and more
preservatives against the contagion
of Worldly Customs. From this Spring
of <hi>Universal Fruition</hi> all the streams of
Living Waters flow that refresh the Soul.
Upon this Hing all a mans Interests turn,
and in this Centre all his Spiritual Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
meet. It is the great Mystery of
Blessedness and Glory, the Sphere of all
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:52038:311"/>
Wisdom, Holiness and Piety, the great
and ineffable Circumstance of all Grace
and Vertue, the Magazine and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
of all Perfection.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of Enmity and Triumph: Of Schism and

            <p>I Should here have ended all my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
on Vertue, had it not been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to speak something of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Since there was never any man so
Wise but he had some, it is not to be
expected that the most Vertuous Man
living should be altogether without
them. <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> and
<hi>Daniel</hi> had Enemies, so had our Lord
Jesus Christ himself: <hi>Joseph</hi> had some in
his younger daies, and <hi>Solomon</hi> some in
his Old age: Of all the Prophets I find
<hi>Samuel</hi> the most clear and exempted
from them. But this I observe, that
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:52038:312"/>
Men of great and transcendent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
of staid and well-govern'd Passions,
of meek and condescending Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
highly kind and serviceable in
their Age, free from the spots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
of the World, have frequently
arrived to an universal Applause and
Honour, and moved in a sphere so high
above the Nation in which they lived,
that as if they had been Creatures of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
World, they have enjoyed a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
above their Degree, and been
surrounded with a repose, that makes
them look like Angels in a kind of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
that that Heaven which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
upon Earth, was the Work, and
the Reward, and the Crown of Vertue.
Thus <hi>Moses</hi> after his long Meekness, and
invincible Fidelity to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation,
was in the close of his life most exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour'd by all the People, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after his death by a million of Persons,
that felt the disastre of so great a loss. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
suffered much by the Envy of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the beginning, and the Lust and
Slander of his Mistress. But after he had
once been the Saviour of the Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and of his Fathers Family, his Vertue
being known, he enjoyed a long life of
Glory and Honour, and of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:52038:312"/>
of his own peace and tranquility,
communicated a repose and prosperity
to his Nation. <hi>Joshua</hi> did run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of being stoned for crossing the
perverse humour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he
returned from searching the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>:
but from <hi>Moses's</hi> death, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all his life afterwards was an absolute
Prince among his own People, and a
glorious Victor over all their Enemies.
<hi>Samuel</hi> was from his Infancy chosen of
GOD, and from <hi>Dan</hi> even to <hi>Beersheba</hi>
they knew he was established to be a
Prophet of the Lord. The honour of
his Communion with Heaven joyned with
his great Integrity and Gravity on Earth,
gave him a Reputation that made him
Greater than all the Elders in the Land.
And it is very apparent, that the eminent
Holiness, and Goodness, and great Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of these Men made them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
with GODS blessing on their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and to reign like Benefactors, and
magnificent Patriots of their Country.
<hi>Solomon</hi> was by his Wisdom exceeding
glorious, till he revolted from GOD:
and those Mischiefs which befel <hi>David</hi>
after he came to the Throne did spring
from his Fall in the matter of <hi>Urias.</hi>
These things I note to encourage Men
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:52038:313"/>
to Vertue. For though our Lord Jesus
Christ, and his Apostles, were persecuted
to the Death, yet two things are very
considerable: First, that their Glory
surmounted the Rage of all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and continues immortally shining
throughout all Kingdoms and Ages:
Next, That they were born to trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Times, and were to break the Ice
for all their Followers. For their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was extraordinary, to change the
state and condition of Kingdoms, to
alter the publick Rites of Religion both
among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and therein
to shake and dissetile the Secular Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests
of Millions, as well as to touch and
offend the Conscience, in defaming that
for which so many Ages had so great a
Veneration. This created all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in their Lives. But where the
publick Rites of Religion are approved,
and a Man is born in peaceable and quiet
Times, I do not see but the most Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Men inherit all the Honour and
Esteem of the People, and whatever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and degree they are of, reign in
the fullest and freest Prosperity. Nor
has the Death of Christ of little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon Earth, but that all the
World does now take notice of the
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:52038:313"/>
Glory of his Doctrine, and far better
understand the excellency of Vertue
than they did before: They feel and
admire its influences. Insomuch that as
fome Vertuous Men grow contemptible
by their Vices; so do the most debanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and vicious Men, find a Necessity of
appearing Vertuous, if they mean to be
Honourable; for as all Errours receive
their strengths from some Truths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by Hereticks, so do all Vices and
vicious Persons owe their supports to
the powerful strengths of those Vertues
on which they lean, and which they use
(though in a wicked manner) for their
own security. For they cannot rise and
thrive in the World without some Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
or shew of Vertue at least, to cover
and help out their Vices. Three things
I desire you to note seriously, when
you have first observed, that it is a very
hard matter to hate an Excellent Man,
or contemn him, when he is known.
The one is, that Enmities and Disgraces
are like the pangs and throws of the
New-Birth, they fall like Storms and
Showers upon budding Vertues in their
spring and greeness: When a Man first
begins to be Vertuous he is despised,
suspected, unknown; it may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:52038:314"/>
and hated: But when he has made
himself eminent and conspicuous, is a
man of tried and approved Vertue, well
known for a Person of Honour and
Worth; the first Envies and Censures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
and if he constantly exercise all
Honesty and Goodness with great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
courage, and prudence, he shall
conquer all his Enemies, and inherit the
benefit of his own Vertues in the peace
and tranquility of his happy Condition.
Note also, that it is not so much the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of the World, as some Vice of
the Proficient, or some occasion that
Religious men give the World to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
Religion by some Infirmity or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that makes them to be hated. And
this I note, because I would have you
not cry out of other Mens Corruptions,
so much as of your own. There is a
little Pride, or Covetousness, or Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or Scorn, or Anger, or Revenge,
some one Deformity or other, that gives
Men advantage against us, when they
deride at our Profession: but under the
Name and Notion of Vertue no Man
was ever yet upbraided. As a Fool
perhaps, and a Coward (but not as a
Wise and gallant Man) he may be
scorned. Thirdly, Some Secular Interest
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:52038:314"/>
may put People together by the Ears,
but no Man is hated for being perfectly
Vertuous. Misapprehensions, Slanders, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
Quarrels about Estates and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
may arise; but where the Land
is at peace, and the True Religion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
no Man is hated for being
Wise, and Good, and Holy, and Chaste,
and Just, and Liberal, and Honest, and
Merciful, and Meek, and Couragious,
but the more admired for being Holy
and Blessed, when he joyns all GODS
Vertues together. A man may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and turbulent, a Schismatick and
a Heretick,<note place="margin">Of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> and by a rash and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Zeal bring many Enemies and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
on himself, while he rails against
the Magistrates, and reviles the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Pastours of the Church,
breaks the Laws, and disturbs the
Kingdom, prophanes and blasphemes
GODS publick Worship, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to overthrow the established Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Discipline among us. But
all the Troubles which a man brings on
himself by any such means as these,
are not to be fathered on Vertue, but
rightly to be ascribed to their proper
Causes Had he that suffered them
been more Vertuous, he had been less
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:52038:315"/>
miserable. And truly this I may say for
the glory of Christianity, Where it is
freely and purely Professed in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Kingdom (as at present in
Ours) a Man may be as divine and
heavenly as an Angel. And if he be
Liberal, and Kind, and Humble, and
Cheerful, especially if withal he be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
and Couragious, most exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
Honest and Faithful in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
the more Holy and Divine he is,
the more he is commended and valued
in the Land: but if he have any <hi>flaw</hi>
the greater stir he makes in Religion
the more he is hated. He loses his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and undergoes the Censure of a
supercilious Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>AS for all the Enemies which Strife
and Contention about Worldly Goods
occasion to a Vertuous Man, he is no
more liable to them than other persons:
And yet when he meets them, he has
far more advantages over his Enemies
than other Men. For being full of
Courage, he dares do any thing that
is fit against them, and that sparkle of
the Lion makes them to dread him:
whereas a Coward is baffled and run
over in a moment. Being full of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Humility, he is not apt to exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:52038:315"/>
them, and make them mad, as
hot and angry Spirits are apt to do.
By Kindness he obliges, and wins, and
softens them: By Prudence he knows how
to manage them, and all his other Vertues
come in as so many strengths against
them. Being Just he never quarrels but
in a <hi>Good Cause</hi>; being Good and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
he is not apt to make an Enemy:
Being Wise and Holy his Soul is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, and it is no trivial Injury
that can make him <hi>contend</hi>: Being Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
and Magnanimous he is prone to
do Heroical things, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Venerable to his very Adversary:
And above all to tender and to love
his Soul, and to steer all the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to both their benefit. We rail on
the World when the fault is in our selves.
The most of Men professing Vertue are
but Children in Worth; very weak,
and very defective: And too timorous
too, GOD knows. They neither trust
GOD enough, nor carry Vertue to the
height. Vertue is base and not Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
while it is remiss: It never shineth
gloriously and irresistibly, till it be
acted almost in a <hi>desperate</hi> manner. He
only is the <hi>Great</hi> Man, that contemns
Danger, Life, and Death, and all the
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:52038:316"/>
World, that he may be supreamly and
compleatly Vertuous.</p>
            <p>ENEMIES may sometimes spring
from Envy. And indeed there alone
lies the Core of the Matter: when some
Men imperfectly Vertuous, abhor others
for being more Excellent than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
at least for being more Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and more Prosperous. Here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
Temporal Interest is the ground
of the Enmity. For thus our Saviour
was hated by the Scribes and Pharisees.
<hi>Pilate</hi> knew that they delivered him for
Envy. But the main pretext and Cause
of his Condemnation, was the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of those that heard him say, <hi>He
would destroy the Temple</hi>: Without
which, and his imputed <hi>Blasphemy</hi> they
could hardly have killed him. But he
came to die, and was the less solicitous.
Where these publick Cases are away:
They that envy Vertuous Men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
Men of equal rank and degree
with themselves; but a Man truly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
will out-strip them, as far as a
Swallow will a Snail, all his Inferiours,
and all his Superiours that understand
him, and the most also of his Equals,
and all they too, if he invents wayes
and methods to oblige them, will at
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:52038:316"/>
last be won to confess and acknowledge
him. But in the mean time he grows,
and thrives, and enjoyes their very
Enmity. He never speaks ill of them
behind their backs. He is not a jot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
nor exasperated, he pities
<hi>their</hi> Weakness, and is humble under
the sence perhaps of his <hi>own</hi>: He is
careful to give them no advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: He confides in GOD, and
strengthens himself in hope of Divine
assistance: He rejoyces exceedingly that
he has the opportunity of Forgiving,
and considers how many Vertues he has
to exercise upon that Occasion. It
makes him to exult, when he considers
that these Enemies are the Instruments
and Materials of his greater Glory.
He foresees the Victory, and delights
in the Triumph. And besides all this,
He is obliged by Jesus Christ to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
greater Wrongs than these, and
gladly yields some Trials of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
He has an infinite felicity in
daily View, and remembers he is a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
in a strange Country. He is dead
to the World, and alive unto GOD.
The Moon is beneath his feet, and so
are all fickle and transitory things. He
is cloathed with the Sun, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:52038:317"/>
in the Light, environed with the
beams of his own Enjoyments. If his
Enemy be able to do him a Mischief;
(which to a man perfectly Vertuous
seldome happens) he turns it into
Good, which a Foolish and a Vicious
Man cannot do: He sinks not under it,
but plunges out again, and furmounts
it altogether: immediately forgives it,
and can after cheerfully serve his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
For his part he will be an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
 to no man in the World. He knows
his Duty and his Master: the value of
Souls, and the excellency of Vertue:
His very Gratitude to GOD and Jesus
Christ is enough to make him go through
a thousand greater and more terrible
brunts than these.</p>
            <p>I would not have Men ingrateful to
Jesus Christ; not blind to themselves.
I know very well that the Age is full
of Faults, and lament it: but withal
I know, it is full of Advantages. As
Sin abounds, so does Grace also super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound.
Never so much clear Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in any Age: Learned Ministers,
multitudes of Sermons, excellent
Books, translated Bibles, studious
Gentlemen, multitudes of Schollers,
publick Liberty, Peace and Safety:
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:52038:317"/>
all great and eminent Blessings. There
were many disorders in the Church of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> and yet the Apostle tells them
of their <hi>Reigning,</hi> and wishes, Would
to GOD he did reign with them!
after their City had a little flourished
in peace, and received Religion: and
makes his Comparison between them
and himself after such a manner, that
when it is considered, it would make
one apt to think the Reigning of the
Saints, which is spoken of in the Book
of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> were either now
<hi>present</hi> or already <hi>past. Now ye are full

                  </note> that we also might
reign with you. For I think GOD hath
set forth us the Apostles last, as it were
appointed to Death: for we are made a
spectacle to the World, and to Angels, and
to Men: We are sools for Christs sake,
but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak,
but ye are strong: Ye are honourable, but
we are despised. Even to this present hour
we both hunger and thirst, and are naked,
and are buffeted, and have no certain
dwelling place.</hi> A small matter will make
a Saint to Reign, by reason of the
greatness of his interior Bliss. If he be
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:52038:318"/>
not buffetted and cast out of doors;
having Food and Rayment, with his
Godliness it is <hi>Great Gain.</hi> Especially
when Kings and Princes <hi>yield a professed
subjection to the Gospel of Christ.</hi> For
then <hi>all the Kingdoms of the World become
the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his
Christ</hi>: When the Cross is exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Crown, and the Kings Palaces
surmounted by the magnificence of our
Saviours Temple, and there is no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
nor Poyson in the Church, but a
pure publick worship, when the very
Laws and Magistrates countenance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and those Apostles that were
once persecuted and cast out as Vile,
are now glorified and admired for their
Sanctity. Men may be Christians pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and in the face of the Sun, it is
horrible ingratitude to be unsensible of
the advantage, to calumniate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
 and disturb the Church, as if it
were a sink of <hi>Paganisme.</hi> Rather we
should admire and adore GOD Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>that other men laboured, and we are
entered upon their Labours.</hi> We inherit
the blood, and toyl, and sweat of the
Martyrs, they bore the burthen and
heat of the day, and we enjoy the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
and the peace they acquired.
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:52038:318"/>
This is one, but not one of the least of
GODS Mercies for which we should be
Grateful.</p>
            <p>THAT all the business of Religion
on GODS part is Bounty, Gratitude on
ours, and that this Gratitude is the
sphere of all Vertue and Felicity, easily
is discerned after the first intimation.
Gratitude is all that is to be expressed
here upon Earth, and above in Heaven.
All our Complacencies in his infinite
Highness, all our Delights in his eternal
Praises, all our Adorations, Extasies,
and Offerings, all our Joyes and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,
are but the Feathers and the
Wings of that Seraphim in Glory. All
the Acknowledgment, and Faith, and
Hope, and Repentance, all the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Resignation of a Sinner upon
Earth, all his Care and fear to offend,
all his Desire and Endeavour to please,
all his Worship and Charity, all his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and Perseverance, and Patience,
all his Fidelity, Devotion, and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
are but Gratitude in several dresses,
as Time, Place, and Occasion require.
Sermons are to inform and assist our
Gratitude, Sacraments to revive and
exercise its vertue. Vertues themselves
are our Aids to bring us thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="572" facs="tcp:52038:319"/>
Upon Sabbaths it enjoyes a Rest, that
hath something in it of Heaven; and
it is a hard matter to be wicked in the
Sanctuary. But in ordinary Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in Shops and Taverns, in the
Camp, in the Navy, at a Feast, or in a
Journey, to retain the Sence of all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and to carry all these Vertues and
Graces about a Man, is not ordinary for
a Common Christian. But that which
does realize our Gratitude, and make
it perfect, is a true Fidelity to GOD and
our selves, which is an acquired habit,
or a Grace infused, by vertue of which
we keep all those Promises which we
made to GOD in our holy Meditations,
and all those holy Resolves which in
our best Retirements we put upon our
selves to do his Will, even in the midst
of all Assaults and Temptations. It is a
Vertue by which we remain Constant
in all Persecutions and Allurements; not
warping, or moving aside on any Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
neither melting with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
nor flinching at Distresses; but
continuing <hi>faithful to the death, that we
may obtain the Crown of Life.</hi> He cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that sees himself a King of all
Worlds, and Brother to our Lord
JESUS CHRIST (who hath said,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:52038:319"/>
               <hi>He that doth the will of my Father, is my
Mother, Sister, and Brother</hi>:) will not
be wrought on to forsake or hazard so
great a Bliss. His knowledge of its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
will animate his Soul with all
<hi>Fidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT will draw him from the World
too, and make him desire to be much
alone, that he may be much with GOD.
A Covetous man will be telling his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
an Ambitious man aspires to be
alwaies near the Kings Person, an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
is for his Wine, or Women, or
Feasts continually. A Vertuous man is
more Covetous, more Ambitious, more
prone to Celestial Epicurisme, if I may
so speak, than all the World besides:
And so art thou, if thou art really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the study of Felicity. A Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man has greater Treasures, higher
Honours, more pure Pleasures, sincerer
and truer Delights, a more glorious
Friend than all the Earth beside. Why
should we not enjoy him, why should
we not retire to adore him, why not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Devotion and Communion with
him? There a Man is to feed by sweet
Contemplation on all his Felicities: He
is there to pray for open Eyes, and a
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:52038:320"/>
pure Heart, that he may see GOD.
There thou art to exercise thy strengths,
and acquaint thy self with him, to look
into all Ages and Kingdoms, to consider
and know thy self, to exp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ciate in the
Eternity and Immensity of GOD, and
to gain that GODLINESS, which with
real Contentment is <hi>Great Gain.</hi> There
thou art to stir up thy self, <hi>by way of pure
Remembrance,</hi> to recollect thy scattered
and broken Thoughts, and to cloath
thy self with all thy necessary Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>FOR Godliness is a kind of <hi>GOD-LIKENESS,</hi>
a divine habit, or frame of
Soul, that may fitly be accounted <hi>The
fulness of the stature of the Inward Man.</hi>
In its least degree, it is an Inclination to
he Like GOD, to Please him, and to
Enjoy him. He is <hi>GOD-LIKE</hi> that is
high and serious in all his Thoughts,
humble and condescending in all his
Actions, full of love and good-will to
all the Creatures, and bright in the
knowledge of all their Natures. He
delights in all the Works of GOD, and
walks in all the Wayes of GOD, and
meditates on all the Commandements
of GOD and covets all the Treasures
of GOD, and breaths after all his Joyes!
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:52038:320"/>
He that hates all that <hi>GOD</hi> hates, and
desires all that <hi>GOD</hi> desires, and loves
all that <hi>GOD</hi> loves, and delights in all
his delights, is <hi>GODLY</hi>: He that aspires
to the same End, by the same Means,
and forms himself willingly to the same
Nature. Every Like in Nature draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to its Like, the Beautiful, and the
Wise, and the Good, and the Aged;
but especially the <hi>GOD-Like.</hi> There is
more reason why they should delight in
each other. They have more Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
and Incentives. <hi>GODLINESS,</hi>
or <hi>GOD-LIKENESS</hi> is the cement of
Amity between <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>MAN.</hi>
Eternity and Immensity are the sphere
of his Activity, and are often frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and filled with his Thoughts. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than the Wisdom of <hi>GOD</hi>
will please the <hi>GOD-LIKE Man</hi>: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less content him, than the Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Glory of his Great Creatour.
He must enjoy GOD, or he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
himself. That is, he must rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in him, as the Creatour, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
the Lord and Governour of the
World; and for that end must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
satisfied with the Glory and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of all his Works, and Laws, and
Wayes. He must delight in all his
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:52038:321"/>
Counsels, that he may enjoy him as the
Great Counsellour of all Nature; and
see the Beauty of his Mind, that he may
take pleasure in him as the Blessedness
of the Angels, the Redeemer of Men,
the Sanctifier of his Elect People, and
the Soveraign End of all things. He
must enjoy him as his own supream and
eternal Object, his King, his Father,
Bridegroom, Friend, Benefactour, All
in all. Which he can never do, till he
sees <hi>GOD</hi> to be the best Father, the best
King, the best Benefactour, Bridegroom
and Friend in all the World: Nor
that, till he sees the Beauty of the
whole Creation, the great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things of his Law, the marvellous
glory of his All-wise dispensations, the
Sacred perfection of his Decrees, and
the nature of his Essence: And all these
must be as sweet and satisfactory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as they are to the Deity. To be
GOD-Like is a very sublime and most
glorious Perfection: which no man can
attain, that is not either <hi>curiously</hi> satisfied
in all these things, or <hi>humbly</hi> confident of
their Beauty and Perfection. And for
Cause have we thus written upon all the
Vertues, that all that need it, and read
the Book may be elevated a little higher
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:52038:321"/>
than the ordinary Rate, have something
more erect and Angelical in their Souls,
be brought to the Gates (at least) of
GODS Kingdom, and be endued with
GODLINESS a little more compleatly
by their Care, than hitherto they have
been; because they know, both <hi>that
GOD is, and is a Rewarder of them that
diligently seek him.</hi>
