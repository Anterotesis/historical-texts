            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

particular iniuries her Highneſſe hath receiued from forraine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and home diſloyaltie; and the particular daungers that haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her thereby, to the hazard of her ſafetie in perſon, and the good eſtate of her whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; I might geſſe at very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and come ſhort of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; &amp; I might point at very great wrongs and dangers, and yet miſſe thoſe that bee farre greater. And therefore for the benefits we haue receiued by her moſt happie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to ſit in this regall ſeate, as the annoynted of God, to bee the ſoueraigne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander vnder him, ouer vs his people of <hi>England,</hi> I wil onely tye my ſelfe to one, as the fountaine and well-ſpring whence all the reſt (being an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) doe iſſue and flow.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19029:5"/>
the iniuries and daungers depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon, to her perſon and kingdome, I will tye my ſelfe to no number, but aime at them as I can; and they ſhall be ſuch all, as from which alſo doe ſpring what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hath been offered, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt her ſacred perſon, and this peaceable, and flouriſhing Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>It is not vnknowne to many yet liuing, neither can it be altogether hidden from the yonger ſort that liue with them, what a darke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie clowde of ignorance (which brought in Popiſh idolatrie, and al maner of ſuperſtition) did ouer-ſhadow the whole land; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto was added, and wherewith was mixed all bloodie and ſauage crueltie againſt thoſe that deſired knowledge, and were any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19029:6"/>
(by Gods grace) with a glimmering, or ſmall inſight into true religion. For though it were but only a deſire to reade vpon the holy booke of God, either the old, or new Teſtament; then Heretike was his title, hereſie was his fault; and for this was he called before the Romiſh Cleargie, to receiue their cenſure: and ſuch neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from their clutches, till they had branded them to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But becauſe the Romiſh ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue perſecuting Chriſt in his members, may maske vnder the Iewiſh vaile perſecuting Chriſt himſelfe, who thirſting after Chriſts blood, yet would ſeeme to ſpill no blood, crying, <hi>It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death:</hi> therefore the ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt be their butcher to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19029:6"/>
their bloodie decree, and to the ſtake they muſt goe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fire. Of this their blood-thirſtie humour how many hundreds haue taſted, ſtories doe record, and many yet liuing can in parte remember.</p>
            <p>In theſe dark and clowdy daies, leaſt the Sunne-ſhine of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould diſperſe the miſts of ignorance, and giue light to the dimme of ſight, whereby they might be able to diſcouer the iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and falſhood, which in that time of darknes they vſed; this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was ſet down for their Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or rule infallible, that <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the mother of deuotion:</hi> And that ſacred worde of God, which was giuen from God to be a lanterne to all our feete, and a light vnto all our ſteps, was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19029:7"/>
to the lay ſort (for ſo they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them) as matter vnfit for them to looke into. By which meanes they kept them blind-fold, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them none other guides but themſelues, being as ſtarke blinde as beetles in all Chriſtian and true religion: and when the blind doe leade the blind, both are in hazard to fall into the ditch.</p>
            <p>When they thus had ſetled this blinde courſe to keepe the people from knowledge, and had deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to fill their eyes with dumme ſhowes to gaze vpon, and their cares with bare ſounds of wordes, farre from their capacitie to reach vnto, or profitably vnderſtande: (much like to <hi>Caligula,</hi> who bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many gueſts, cauſed to be ſet before them golden diſhes, and golden cups, and bad them eate.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:19029:7"/>Then they offer another poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was not for lay men to meddle with matters of religion, that belonged wholly and only (as a priuiledge) to the Prieſts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making them ſecure and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of God, and all godlines. Only if he came diligently and deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to heare Maſſe, and once a yere to confeſſe his ſinnes to his ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father (how ſlenderly ſo euer his ſayde Confeſſor were furniſhed with gifts of the holie Ghoſt in himſelfe to inſtruct him) all was ſafe: and he that ſo did, was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as religious a man <hi>(ſecundum vſum Sacru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> as could be wiſhed. And though he were tainted, and to bee taxed with the groſſeſt ſins, <hi>Rome,</hi> by the authoritie from their Vicar generall, had a tricke to hale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the rabble of their ſaints,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19029:8"/>
and ſo to canonize him; as wee haue example of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, whoſe treaſons to his Prince were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and manifeſt: and yet after his death was he canonized a ſaint by the Pope, and an holy day was commanded for him.</p>
            <p>Theſe two irreligious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane grounds being layd, they proceed to a third, and ſet it down for a popiſh ground, that it was a dangerous and deadly ſinne for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to diſobey the Pope, and his Cleargie, in any of their orders enioyned and commaunded. In ſuch reuerence and regarde muſt he and all his Cleargy be had, that the meaneſt Maſſe-prieſt (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with authoritie from him) muſt bee obeyed, vnder paine of damnation; though he command
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19029:8"/>
that which is blaſphemous before God in Chriſtians, or diſloyall to men in ſubiects.</p>
            <p>And hauing thus made an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen paſſage (without ſtop) to the marke and matter he aymed at, and ſo hemmed them in, as they could not ſee which way to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape danger, but by them that had layd the ſnare for them; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto them a meanes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie from all daungers, (euen when they ſinned immediatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God) which is, A pardon from his holines, and abſolution from his holy prieſts. But if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and ordinances of their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſynagogues were tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hardly any mercie was to bee had.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you the blind courſe they ſought to breede vs in, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19029:9"/>
vs the cleere light of the holy written word of God, and the careleſnes they ſought to ſettle in vs of all religion, by making it a thing impertinent to vs, as though wee had no ſoules to care for; or the narrow way that leadeth to ſaluation were ſo eaſily found out, as we neede no light to guide vs, or no furniture to arme vs with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the dangers of our paſſing. And yet, <hi>Search the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> is a watch-word to all that deſire to bee the ſeruants of God: and, <hi>Put on the whole armour of God,</hi> is a direction to all the true children of God here vpon earth: the ſeuerall parts of which furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to what vſe all of it muſt ſerue vs, you ſhall eaſily finde, if you will take paines to looke into and reade the place. And further
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19029:9"/>
you fee the terrour and feare they caſt vpon vs, if we offend the Pope and his Maſſing prieſts: and then the end is, our abſolution and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don muſt come from themſelues, which mony muſt purchaſe: and ſo the beſt purſe (by their rule) did ſpeed beſt in their religion. Yet our Sauiour Chriſt telleth vs, that <hi>It is as eaſie for a Camell to goe through the eye of a needle, as for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heauen.</hi> But the fatteſt purſes are fitter for the Popiſh ſynagogue than the poore in ſpirit.

all the groſſe corruptions of the Romiſh religion: ſo it is no part of my meaning to ſearch curiouſlie into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; they are already (through Gods fauour and goodnes) by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned, more ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, diſcouered and confuted, than I can, and to their learned workes I referre you; I onely touch thoſe few, that by theſe you may ſee the blacke darknes and groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wee were brought into, by ſuch as ſought more their owne pompe &amp; enriching, than to ſet vs in the right way to ſauing health and ſaluation, of which they ſought to bereaue vs.</p>
            <p>And hauing giuen you this taſte of thoſe miſerable times, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous eſtate we were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by them, I haſten to put you in minde of our moſt bleſſed, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19029:10"/>
happie deliuerance out of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall pit, and thraldome of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and ſuperſtition, whereinto we were deeply plunged: for which wee owe all dutifull and heartie thankes to our God, as the author; and all reuerence, loue, and loyalty to our moſt gracious Soueraigne Ladie Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as the inſtrument: whoſe perill and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, before ſhe came to that abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to performe this holie worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, I may not paſſe ouer. For by Gods goodnes onely and wholly ſhe was preſerued, her life being malitiouſly, and with great cunning ſhot at by the Romiſh Cleargie, then in place of credit. For <hi>Gardiner,</hi> that moſt proude and bloodie monſter, left no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his wit vnſought (being wiſe enough to worke miſchiefe)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19029:11"/>
but ſet all his skill and cunning on worke to ſhorten her dayes, and to preuent her (by bloodie ſlaughter of her ſacred perſon) from euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Queene. And no reach of man can yeeld me a reaſon of her deliuerance, but the mightie God in power, and moſt rich God in mercie, did (beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of popiſh malice) deliuer her from many dangers, and preſerue her, to free vs from al the moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thraldome of this Romiſh <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> &amp; to bring vs into the ſweete and ſincere libertie of Chriſts true religion and Goſpell: euen as hee did miraculouſly preſerue <hi>Moſes</hi> (being deſtined to deſtruction) to deliuer his people of Iſraell from the miſerable taxes and torments they ſuſtayned vnder the Egyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:19029:11"/>Thus you ſee that theſe their bloodie practiſes would take no place: but that the God of Iſraell (who neuer fayleth his) hath brought this his religious hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayden, our deare Soueraigne, to the royall throne of this flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdome: and, by her happie entrance into this ſeate of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath baniſhed the Popiſh ordinances and decrees, which held vs in ſlauerie of conſcience: and in ſtead of this, hath brought home vnto vs the cleere Sunne-ſhining light of his glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and reſtored vs into the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of conſcience long wiſhed for, and often prayed for by all his Saints and children. He hath alſo eſtabliſhed a courſe of teaching by learned miniſters and paſtors, by whom the glad tydings of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

is pronounced and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to his people, her ſubiects, whereby they may be trayned vp in all true knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And ſurely the moſt ſimple now may learne to poynt out the vanitie of that ſuperſtitious religion, which was ſent, and brought to vs from <hi>Rome;</hi> and may ſee and feele how ſweet the Lord Ieſus is in the voyce of his Goſpell: which is a bleſſing that many haue longed for, and haue not yet attained vnto. For this and all the reſt we owe our continuall thankes vnto God, and are bound (euery mothers ſonne of vs) to pray to him for our Soueraignes life and raigne long to continue; and with all heartie willingnes to ſhew the loyall loue of our hearts to her Maieſtie, by yeelding our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19029:12"/>
lands, goods, and liues, to be ſold, ſpent, and hazarded for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For of how much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious account the ſoule is than the body, of ſo much greater price and eſtimation ought wee to reckon this ſpirituall deliuerance out of this ſpirituall bondage, brought vpon vs by poperie and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we haue obtayned by her Maieſties moſt happy entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and enioying this ſeate of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in which I pray God ſhe may long ſit, to his glorie, the quiet &amp; profit of her people, both in ſpirituall and earthly things, and the euerlaſting comfort to her owne ſoule and conſcience.</p>
            <p>But when this our deare Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladie Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was fullie poſſeſſed of this her princely place, and had receiued
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19029:13"/>
the royall Diademe and Crowne, with the applauſe and liking of al true hearted Engliſhmen, both Nobles, Cleargie and Commons; (as a due by right belonging vnto her) then began Sathan to rage, and his miniſters to fret and chafe; in ſo much as euen in the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament holden after her moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie coronation, Doctor <hi>Story,</hi> that blood-ſucker, who had bathed his hands in the blood of ſundrie Gods ſaints, doubted not, without bluſhing, openly in that moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Senate and Councell, to bewaile that his counſell was not followed; and that they had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the right courſe of ſtopping vs from ſeeing, and beholding theſe <hi>Halcyon</hi> and bleſſed daies; which he ſayd to bee, the not ſtriking at the roote when time ſerued; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

the not bereauing of our deare Soueraigne of her life. A bloodie ſpeech of a bloodie tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who would not conteine to vtter out the poyſonfull conceiued malice of his heart to her Maieſtie, though it were when his malice could not reach (praiſed be God) to doe her the leaſt harme.</p>
            <p>In this arch-traytor there is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a moſt notable obſeruation of Gods iuſtice and iudgement. For euen this <hi>Story</hi> paſſing ouer the ſeas after this, without touch, and there exerciſing his lewd wit to inuent all ſlaunders againſt her Maieſtie, and the whole ſtate; and (boyling in the bloodie malice of his heart) did burſt out into all practiſes that he could, whereby to diſturbe our peace, and to indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger her perſon; it pleaſed our God
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19029:14"/>
to aſſigne the time when he ſhuld enter into an Engliſh ſhip, deuoid of all feare to bee intrapped, and without all hope in the owner of the ſhip that he ſhuld carrie home ſuch a gueſt. Yet finding (by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine intelligence) whom he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and the winde (by Gods prouidence) being proſperous to take way for <hi>England,</hi> hee hoyſed vp his ſayles, and tarrieth for no better fraught, arriueth with good ſpeede in <hi>England,</hi> and preſenteth this his merchandiſe to the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lords, by whom hee was committed to the place moſt fit for him, and ſhortly after being indicted, arreigned, found guiltie, and condemned, hee receiued his iudgement at the ſeate of iuſtice, and was executed accordingly, as he had well deſerued, at Tyburne:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19029:14"/>
and ſo may they al ſpeed that wiſh to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as he did.</p>
            <p>After this then commeth out the thundring Bull of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication againſt her Maieſtie, and her whole land, from that impious Pope <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> wherein her Maieſtie is not allowed the title of lawfull and rightfull Queene, but is termed <hi>The pretended Queene of England;</hi> and all her ſubiects are abſolued from the oth of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which they had taken, and by right is due from them vnto her.</p>
            <p>And from this Bull bellowing out theſe monſtrous ſounds, as out of another Troian horſe, by which all <hi>Troy</hi> was betrayed) all the troubles, rebellions, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons plotted againſt her Maieſtie haue proceeded.

Rebels did take their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and grounds, though it were before the ſetting of it vp by <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> at the Biſhop of Londons gate by Paules Church, as ſhall appeare plainly. For by this Bull theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels thought themſelues to haue a ſtrong immunitie and freedome from all daunger, when ſuch a plackard was publiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore doubted not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come traytors to their Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of their Countrie, and to offer it for a ſpoyle to forrenners and ſtrangers. As though it were in the power of any one mortall childe of man to diſpoſe of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, to depoſe Princes, or to diſpence with ſubiects for not only diſobeying, but rebelling againſt their lawfull Soueraignes. In deed that worthie Doctor <hi>Saunders,</hi> the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19029:15"/>
Popes Legate, to comfort the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> doubteth not to defend this Bull of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be iuſt and lawfull, in his book intituled, <hi>Of the viſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie.</hi> And to prooue that this Bull was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> encourager of our two infortunate Earles, <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> to take armes againſt their lawfull Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and liege Lady. This <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> affirmeth that Doctor <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was ſent to ſollicite ſuch Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Noble men as he could, that <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who then was in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Crowne, was an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, and for that cauſe to haue fallen from al dominion &amp; power, and that ſhe may be had, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them as an Ethnicke, and they are not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to obey her lawes and commandements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:19029:16"/>A noble embaſey and meſſage to be ſent from a Pope, very fitting for his fatherhood; and this olde doting Maſſe-prieſt was a very fit ambaſſadour for his turne, who doted ſo much vpon his Maſſe and Mattens, vpon his Dirges &amp; Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and ſuch other traſh (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his corrupt heart was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) as he did forget how farre it was againſt the law of God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Nations, to ſtir ſubiects to rebell againſt their rightfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne: and he was ſo beſotted with his holy Dad, ſitting as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſucceſſour in his <hi>pontiſicalibus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> as neither law of God, Nature, nor Nations, could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſatisfying the Popes holines, in this his vnholy and moſt diuelliſh direction and errand; far contrary to our Sauiour Chriſts
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19029:16"/>
direction to <hi>Peter,</hi> whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to put vp his ſword into his ſheath.</p>
            <p>And if it were reckoned a fault in <hi>Peter</hi> to ſtrike off the high Prieſts ſeruants care; how ſhall it not be a fault in <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor to ſtrike at the head, not of a ſeruant, but of an annoynted Prince, onely becauſe ſhe wil not forſake Chriſt and obey Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>If Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> had neuer read ſo farre in Gods booke; or had liued ſo long as to forget that he had read; the Lord from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen commanding this to all men on earth, that <hi>euery ſoule ſhould be ſubiect to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and euery power is ordeined of God:</hi> yet hee could not but remember himſelfe to bee an Engliſh man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19029:17"/>
borne, and that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the rightfull owner, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſer of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> by right of birth, by right of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and by right of ſucceſſion: and therefore by the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Nations, there was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and loyaltie due vnto her from him. But he was ſo bewitched with the Popes primacie, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authoritie ouer kings and kingdoms, as he thought the Pope might depoſe when hee would, and diſpoſe Crownes and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes vpon whom he would; as if he had quite forgotten himſelfe to be an Engliſh man.</p>
            <p>Whence this priuiledge ouer kings and kingdoms ſhould come vnto this proude Prieſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot finde, vnleſſe he fetcheth it from that ſpirit, <hi>that brought our

Sauiour Chriſt vnto the top of an high mountaine, ſhewing him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glorie of them, and ſayd, All theſe will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip mee:</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as much authoritie to diſpoſe of them, as Popes haue to depoſe Princes.</p>
            <p>But you ſee what was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and commaunded to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> by the Pope; and how faithfully <hi>Morton</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his faithles errand, to the preiudice of his Prince, and danger of his Countrie. I wiſh with all my heart the two Earles had been more wiſe, than to be miſled by ſo wicked a meſſenger; and more loyall, than to bee miſcarried into rebellion by ſo treaſonable a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Notwithſtanding they ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19029:18"/>
embraced the meſſenger, and ſo farre followed the direction of the meſſage, that they fell into flat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and marched vnder the enſigne of trayterous ſubiects: for which the one receiued his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment, and the other eſcaped by flying, remaining a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue from his Queene and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and not daring to ſhew his face in his owne natiue ſoyle, for that hee had diſloyally rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the one, and vnnaturally ſought the deſtruction of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I finde ſome bluſhing in ſome of this popiſh crew. For a Romiſh diſcourſer, in a booke publiſhed, and printed <hi>againſt the execution of Justice in England for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of publike peace;</hi> ſeemeth to wiſh that <hi>Saunders</hi> and <hi>Bristow</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:19029:18"/>
(which both do defend, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes Bull againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to bee lawfull and iuſt) had ſpared to ſpeake ſo much in defence thereof. And yet he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not to affirme that theſe two learned men, of great zeale and excellencie, had their ſpeciall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to doe ſo; which he will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defend nor reproue.</p>
            <p>He further laboureth to ſmooth ouer this fault of theirs, by a kinde of retractation in both: the one leauing this out of his booke in his ſecond edition; and the other by ſuppreſſing to his liues end, <hi>A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned booke made in defence of Pius Quintus his ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Maiestie.</hi> Marke the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitheton he giueth to it. For he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it a very learned booke: ſo as neither his reproofe, nor their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19029:19"/>
doth condemne the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which is the maine poynt) but ſome other reaſons did mooue a moderation in them, and all the reſt of our nation (to vſe his owne wordes) which was neither their condemning the ſeditious Bull, nor their approuing of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties right to the royall ſeate ſhe ſate in, which the Bull ſought to impeach both amongſt forrainers and home ſubiects.</p>
            <p>The ground and cauſe of the moderation ſpoken of by this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh politike diſcourſer, appeareth by the ſuite made by <hi>Campion</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> vnto <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. then Pope; wherein they deſired that this Bull of excommunication might not reach to touch the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes for performing obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to her Maieſtie, which was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19029:19"/>
to them; and the very wordes of the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are theſe. <hi>Where in the Bull of Pius Quintus all her ſubiects are commaunded not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey her; and ſhe being excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and depoſed, all that doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey her, are likewiſe innodate and accurſed: (which point is perilous to the Catholikes: For if they obey her, they are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Popes curſe; and if they diſobey, they are in the Queenes daunger:) therefore the preſent Pope, to relieue them, hath altered that part of the Bull, and diſpenſed with them to obey, and ſerue her, without perill of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: which dispenſation is to endure, but till that it pleaſe the Pope otherwiſe to determine.</hi> And theſe good fathers (ſo called by this popiſh diſcourſer) are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied &amp; commended, and thought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19029:20"/>
worthie of great thankes, both of the Queene, and countrie: and yet you ſee that euen in this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as in the Bull, our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued by this Pope excommunicated, and curſed, as farre as the hand of ſuch a curſed creature can reach; and ſo are all her true hearted ſubiects. But by this they doe diſcouer their groſſe cunning.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſer would faine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that this was done for the Queenes good, both for the ſafetie of her perſon, and quiet of her countrie. Notwithſtanding reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend father <hi>Saunders</hi> could, after this, bee the Popes Legate, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, and comfort Iriſh ſubiects to rebell againſt her Maieſtie: where, if the mightie God had not giuen a couragious heart, and a ſtrong
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19029:20"/>
hand to that moſt vertuous and valiant gentleman, the noble Lord <hi>Arthur Gray,</hi> then her Highnes Deputie in that place, <hi>Saunders</hi> perſwaſion had made a ſtrong partie; and Spaniards had ſetled too ſtrong a footing for vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer in haſte.</p>
            <p>Further to diſcouer the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hearts of all theſe confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, the conſpiracie of <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Barnewell, Titchborne,</hi> and the reſt iumping together in one minde, and combining together to performe one bloodie action, which was, to lay violent hands vpon Gods annoynted: whence came it, but from <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rhemes,</hi> following the impious rules of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> in his curſed Bull? Beſides this, who ſet <hi>Parry</hi> on worke to come hither with an
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19029:21"/>
impudent and ſhameles face, and here to court it; to bee one of the high Court of parliament; and to intrude himſelfe into the houſes, and to the tables of her Maieſties chiefeſt Counſellors; yea very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to her Maieſties owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and too often, &amp; too neere, with allowance and liking; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with her Highnes large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and long conferences, but that fiſher of <hi>Rome?</hi> who fiſheth not for mens ſoules, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, to winne them to God; but after kingdomes, and ſegniories, that they may be tributarie to him, and that hee may haue authoritie to diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure. For from this, <hi>Parry</hi> came reconciled, and, forſaking his obedience to his rightfull Soueraigne, became ſubiect to him; and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe parts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19029:21"/>
he came ouer with this bloodie purpoſe to kill our dread Queene, To aſſure this, he gaue his word to ſundrie to vndertake it; he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Sacrament to doe it; and he confirmed his bloodie promiſe with his hand, in a letter ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring therein his holines allowance for the doing of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy act, and crauing full remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for all his ſinnes: which was performed to him by this holie Vicars commandement, in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent to him from a Cardinall in <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein his purpoſe was ſayd to be honorable, the fact me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious before God; and kinde requitals are promiſed to him for vndertaking the matter, and for his care had in the buſines.</p>
            <p>Therefore notwithſtanding the fine ſmoothing of this diſcourſer,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19029:22"/>
who would beare the worlde in hand, that after this Bul publiſhed, the peaceable gouernment of our gracious Queene was not by any diſturbed; you ſhall finde it moſt falſe and vntrue. For if I ſhould ſtand to reckon vp all the ſtirres, that troubleſome, and trayterous ſpirits (as the vipers brood) would haue raiſed in the bowels of their natiue countrie, I ſhould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loade you with too many odious and loathſome examples.</p>
            <p>For what mooued <hi>Frauncis Throckmorton</hi> to enter into a new practiſe? What was the cauſe of <hi>Charles Pagets</hi> going out of <hi>England?</hi> of the two vnhappie Earles commitment? the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arraigned, and tried by his Peeres, and (being condemned) ſpared to liue by the wonderfull
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19029:22"/>
mercie of her moſt milde Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: the other preuenting his trial, by laying violent &amp; bloody hands vpon his owne perſon: was not all this, and much more than this, to depoſe, or (ſome way or other) to diſpatch our moſt gracious and lawfull Queene? And yet, after the publiſhing of this Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> (ſayth our diſcourſer) our Catholikes (committing nothing againſt her Maieſtie, or her lawes) remained quiet, and did all acts of homage and honor vnto her. But, to proue this his owne cleering of them not to be ſo cleere, he ſayth preſently after, that <hi>the moſt part of all ſorts of Catholikes, both in England and Ireland, haue done this; onely a very few Nobles of both countries taking armes for their defence:</hi> ſo as to an excuſe of

all he addeth an accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome; and, if the matter of this excuſe were liked of by himſelfe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; he muſt needes condemne theſe ſome, that were ſo raſh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take armes againſt their Queene, and country; and if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed theſe ſame in thus dooing; then his great paines taken to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe all Catholikes to be free from ſtirring diſloyallie, was but a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh floriſh of diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>He proceedeth to excuſe all the preeſts, and ſtudents beyond the ſeas, and all ſuch as came ouer, and faith, that al of them <hi>ſince that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his holines</hi> (to vſe his owne words) <hi>did vſe all reuerence, and respect to her Maiestie, vttering in no preaching, ſpeech, or booke, no not at the houre of their death, and martyrdome</hi> (as he calleth it,

though hee ſhall neuer proue a traytor to be a martyr) <hi>nor euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any their confeſſions</hi> to the Magiſtrate, any diſloyall word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Maieſtie. But for many proofes againſt this, take one for all, to diſproue him; and this one proofe being from ſuch a one; as the whole packe of them did high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuerence, and regarde, being a Cardinall; and Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> it was.</p>
            <p>This Engliſh traytor, though he were a Cardinal at <hi>Rome,</hi> hath ſent vs from thence many ſlaunderous, and ſeditious pamphlets. Amongſt the reſt he vndertaketh the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that falſe faithles Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Syr <hi>William Stanley,</hi> in his treaſonable parte played againſt her Maieſtie, in deliuering vp the towne of <hi>Deuenter,</hi> contrarie to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19029:24"/>
the truſt repoſed in him; and in that booke he bluſheth not to ſet downe theſe words, that, <hi>ſince her excommunication, and depoſition by the Pope, ſhe hath no iust title, or interest to her crowne, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and that no act done by her authoritie ſince the publiſhing of that excommunication, and depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath been, or can be lawfull by the law of God, or man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that no man may lawfully ſerue her in any action, be it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neuer ſo iust.</hi> From which he ruſheth into an earneſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reuolte, to withdraw her ſubiects from her ſeruice; and to exhort them to the ſeruice of the Romiſh catholike party, and her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>Now let Maſter Diſcourſer tell me, whether this be to vtter in no
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19029:24"/>

And if he will be ſilent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dare not ſpeake the truth, to contrary, and controule his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lye; yet let all true hearted Engliſh-men tell me whether this iugling companion (the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer I meane) bee not an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſhameles diſſembling lyar, in perſwading vs by a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pamphlet, that <hi>all Catholikes were ſory that Saunders, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow did write in allowance, and defence of the Bull, and wiſhed that ſuch an offenſiue matter had neuer been touched,</hi> (they are his owne words) <hi>and that all Catholikes, both Preests, ſtudents, and others, did conteyne themſelues from all diſloyall ſpeeches, or actions;</hi> when as Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate,

(on whoſe iudgement all the Engliſh Papiſts liuing did rely as reſolutely, as the Heathen could poſſibly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Oracles ſent from their Gods) durſt, like an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traytor,</hi> thus villanouſly ſtuffe his booke with blaſphemous ſlanders, diueliſh perſwaſions, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lyes againſt her Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>There is no ende of this humor in them; their practiſes are peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, their perſwaſions perilous, and their platformes trayterous; and to ſerue their turne, they want not cunning to execute all: ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent they are in their villanies, and treaſons; and ſo ſhameles they are in their falſehood, &amp; diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>I haue dwelt long in this vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and vnpleaſant argument of treacheries and treaſons, and in the enumeration of our godleſſe,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19029:25"/>
and vnnaturall traytors: wherein I haue touched many matters, and poynted out many perſons: yet could I very eaſilie adde many more: but I holde it needeleſſe, becauſe the purpoſe of my labour is onely to giue a taſte to my deare countrymen in this ſtirring world, wherein <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Hell it ſelfe; are ſet on fire againſt our rightfull Queene, and her kingdome; that by this taſte they might ſee the brutiſh villanies of our baſtard countreymen, and might vnderſtand what iuſt cauſe there is for them to deteſt both the traytors, and treaſons. And ſurely the traytors themſelues (if God iuſtly had not blinded them) by many ſtories, and examples might knowe, that <hi>proditio placet, non proditor,</hi> though it light vpon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19029:26"/>
forreyners againſt a nation.</p>
            <p>We reade of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who intending to beſiege <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> a rich, but ſeditious Citizen, goeth to him, and promiſeth to procure the gates to bee ſet open for him, if hee would promiſe to giue him his daughter in mariage with a rich dowry. <hi>Mahomet</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, the other performed his deuiſed treaſon. And comming after to demaund his wages; It is but thy due, ſaith <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and ſo commaunded a great maſſe of treaſure to bee layed before him: But becauſe thou requireſt my daughter (ſaith hee) thou being a Chriſtian, thou muſt put off thy olde skinne, that thou maiſt be fit to company with a wife of a new, and ſtrange religion to thee; and withall commaunded him to bee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19029:26"/>
flayed, and hot imbers, and ſalte to be caſt vpon the raw fleſh, and ſo to be layed in a bed, till a new skin might growe; where he ended his miſerable life, with a iuſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous puniſhment for his treaſon.</p>
            <p>At home, and amongſt our ſelues, Earle <hi>Edrick,</hi> to ſettle this kingdome in the handes of the Danes, ſetteth on his ſonne by ſome trayterous plot, or other, to diſpatch king <hi>Edmunde,</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Iron ſyde,</hi> out of the waye. Which hee indeede ſhortly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, murthering the king, as hee for neceſſities ſake was ſitting in a ſecret place. The father, with good hope, but ill ſpeede, haſteth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane, of this exploite performed for him. But as was his worke; ſuch was his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Trayterous was his acte; and a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19029:27"/>
ſhamefull death was his end; euen by <hi>Canutus</hi> appoyntment, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the traytor, though he got the kingdome by his treaſon. Much more ought we to be ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed with a deteſtation of our traytors; the treaſon being againſt <hi>England;</hi> &amp; the traytors being borne Engliſh. For in ſuch a caſe what true harted Engliſhman can brooke either? I will now haſten to thoſe, to whom the treaſon was, &amp; is pleaſant; and that is, the ambitious <hi>Spaniard;</hi> whoſe minde is neuer quiet from aſpiring, nor neuer will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with leſſe than the poſſeſſing of an whole worlde of kingdomes; whoſe ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath touched vpon many dominions, &amp; territories; &amp; where they preuaile, and can once ſet a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quering foote, they gouerne not in the mildenes of a rightfull
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19029:27"/>
king, but rule with the crueltie of a bloodie tyrant. Examples hereof there are many; &amp; ſundry printed bookes amongſt vs doe publiſh, and diſcouer particulars of it.</p>
            <p>This proud <hi>Spaniard</hi> was bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with all the ayde that poſſiblie <hi>Rome</hi> and all the <hi>Romanists</hi> could affoord him, and encouraged to go on with great hope of ſucceſſe; and offereth an inuaſion vpon this little Iſland of <hi>England;</hi> and ſtrengtheneth himſelfe to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with as great choice of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as poſſibly he could; the ſhippes being huge, great, and ſtrong; the men, both ſouldiers and marriners, well choſen; the guides, both for land and ſea, of great skill; the furniture ſtrong, and good; the munition for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſhot plentifull; the victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19029:28"/>
ſufficient, and ſeaſonable, and all the prouiſion fit and neceſſarie for ſuch an exployte vndertaken. And in this Nauie ſuch truſt was repoſed by <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Spayne,</hi> and by our home-borne traytors, that it was called <hi>The inuincible nauie.</hi> Yet they found that it had been good counſell, that <hi>Ahab</hi> gaue to <hi>Benhadad, Let not him that gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelfe with his armour, boaſt, as he that putteth it off.</hi> For when fleſh and blood will bragge of his greatnes, glory in his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, and vaunt of his victories before hand; there is a God in heauen that watcheth ouer his choſen; and, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked meane moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe againſt his annoynted, can diſappoynt their purpoſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow them in their own turne.</p>
            <p>So fell it out to this ambitious
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19029:28"/>
               <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who promiſing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a victorious conqueſt ouer <hi>England,</hi> was conquered himſelf, without any blow, or not many blowes ſtriken; the Lord of hoſts ſetting the boyſterous windes, and ſurging ſeas to fight againſt him; by which many of them were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and drowned: not vnlike vnto the victory of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Alpes,</hi> for whom the ſtorie ſayth, that the great windes were ſent from God to ſight, and he had a great victorie; whereupon <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deanus</hi> writeth theſe verſes:
<q>
                  <l>O nimium dilecte Deo, cui mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat aether,</l>
                  <l>Et coniurati veniunt ad claſſica venti.</l>
               </q>
And ſo may we ſay to our Queene in her victory againſt this boaſting proud <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:19029:29"/>
               <l>O bleſt of God, for whom the skie it ſelfe doth fight,</l>
               <l>And boyſterous winds againſt thy foes do band to ſhew their might.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He is taught hereby what it is to fight againſt God, though he thinke neuer ſo baſely of <hi>Englands</hi> ſtrength, or reſpect neuer ſo little of the abilitie thereof to encounter and reſiſt him. For was not this his ouerthrowe almoſt matchable with that, that young <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> gaue to the <hi>Arcadians?</hi> For they made warre againſt the <hi>Spartans,</hi> when <hi>Archidamus</hi> was aged, and not able to goe into the field, and he did ſend his ſonne <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who ouerthrew the <hi>Arcadians</hi> with ſmal loſſe, or none at al; and it was called <hi>The teare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les battaile.</hi> And, with praiſe to God be it ſpoken, he had cauſe (to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19029:29"/>
his ſorrow and ſhame) to thinke that our milde &amp; mayden Queene wanted not ſhips, mariners, and ſouldiers to encounter him; nor yet noble, and valiant conductors; to ſtop his attempt, and reſiſt his furie; and (I truſt) ſhe ſhall euer be able to man out ſhipping to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter his malice, and to abate his pride; and I reſt aſſured of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his, and the Popes malice to her, is not becauſe ſhe is daughter to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8. and ſiſter to Queene <hi>Mary;</hi> but becauſe ſhe hath baniſhed the Pope, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her ſelfe to the obedience of Chriſt Ieſus, in the voyce of his Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Pope ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and beſtirreth himſelfe with his curſes, and ſendeth his pupills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19029:30"/>
amongſt vs, to draw chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from Gods truth, to his falſe religion; and to withdraw ſubiects from obedience to their lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne; a worke well beſeeming <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and all his adherents. Againſt whom the heathen ſhall riſe in iudgement, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them; who thought it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, and vnhonorable, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to plot, and deuiſe treaſons, but euen ſo much as to hearken to any treaſon offered them, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much for their benefit. For in the warre betweene <hi>Fabricius</hi> the <hi>Romaine,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> the phiſition of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> did offer for a ſumme of mony to poiſon <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> that ſo <hi>Fabricius</hi> might get the victorie: but <hi>Fabricius</hi> was ſo farre from accepting the offer, as he ſent backe the traitour to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:19029:30"/>
and bad him take heede how hee entertayned ſuch traytors ſo neere him. But the king of <hi>Spayne</hi> deale not ſo with the Queene our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres, when her poyſonfull <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> phiſition <hi>Lopus</hi> would haue poyſoned her. For, from ſuch hopes hee taketh hearte, and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie offered to inuade vs; and hath been, and is ſtill buſied with vs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did carry a full purpoſe this laſt ſpring, to trye the vttermoſt of his ſtrength to get footing heere, had not her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie moſt prouidently foreſeene in her princely wiſdome how fit it was to ſpeake with him at his own home, thereby to diuert his forces from his intended inuaſion vpon vs, to defend him ſelfe; and to that end ſhee ſent out a <hi>royall nauye</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct and commaunde
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19029:31"/>
of two honorable Generalls; who diuiding themſelues the one to keep the ſeas, and the other to ſet foot vpon the ſpaniards ſayle. He that deſired to land, left his hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companion with the greateſt parte of the fleet, and himſelfe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth with the companies agreed vpon, to the ſhore, and with the extraordinarie forwardnes of a Generall, he ſtayed not the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of many before him into the towne, but to the encouragement of all, both before him and behind him, he ſhewed little to reſpect the ſafety of his own perſon; and more regarding the honour of his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, his countrey, and himſelfe, then his owne life, hee entred the towne with a ſmall number at the firſt, and would not be daunted or driuen backe by the fiery furie of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19029:31"/>
Spaniſh ſhot, ſetled in euery houſe to annoy him: but continued his courſe, till he poſſeſſed the Market place, where he proceeded in his moſt valorous and victorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, to the winning of the towne: which done, he ioyned himſelfe to his moſt honorable companion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, who no doubt was preſt and readie to performe what belonged vnto his place, if occaſion had been offered. And all <hi>England</hi> hath iuſt cauſe to praiſe God, for this blow of diſhonour giuen to <hi>Spayne,</hi> and for the ſafe returne of both the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Generals againe: who ſo ſpeedily by their diligence, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently by their gouernment, and ſo forcibly by their courage arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon his coaſt, approached an attempt, and followed it with ſuch magnanimitie, as (by the goodnes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19029:32"/>
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Almighty) they had moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſſe, without any great loſſe of men, or ſhipping; &amp; retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſafe home, by the aſſiſtance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame God, being as ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs from inuaſion, as they haue ſhewed themſelues forward to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him at his owne dore. And no doubt this biting blow, lately giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by theſe two noble Generals, hath no whit abated his anger, but ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed him more: ſo as we are not to doubt, but that he wil no longer ſtay fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offering a reuenge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, than he can furniſh himſelfe ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his liking. And herein ſhall he not want the helpe of al his popiſh confederates, both forreine, and at home. For I doe not heare that the Popes holines is ſo purged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or ſo reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to religion, as he meaneth not to continue his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19029:32"/>
claime for the <hi>Supremacie:</hi> or wil ceaſe to ſettle the dregs of his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſuperſtitious doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs. I cannot conceiue that the thirſt of <hi>Parſons,</hi> and his pew-fellowes is yet quenched, from ſeeking the blood of our deare So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, and (in her) the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vs all; the cauſe remayning ſtil, for which heretofore they haue ſought it; neither can I be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Spaynes</hi> malice to <hi>England</hi> is yet abated, but that the Queene our miſtris, &amp; her kingdome, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted with him a pray worth the enioying. Therefore I doubt nothing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes malicious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes to incite it, and to adde all the ſtrength he can to it; nor of our Engliſh traytors harty diſpoſition to further it; nor of the Spaniards ambitious deſire to take it in hand, and his willingnes to do the worſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19029:33"/>
he can. And his worſt let him doe. For the God of heauen is with vs, who is a iuſt defender of all thoſe that haue a iuſt cauſe: and as it was ſayd of <hi>Constantius:</hi>
               <q>Et cauſa<expan>

So may we ſay of our Queene:
<q>
                  <l>Her cauſe is better that ſhe takes in hand;</l>
                  <l>Her force more ſtrong, <hi>Spaynes</hi> malice to withstand.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For whether we reſpect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, the fugitiue, and home-traytors, or the King of <hi>Spayne;</hi> our cauſe is moſt iuſt. With the Pope we ſtand for Gods ſacred and ſincere truth, againſt his ſuperſtitious and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous falſhood. With the fugitiue and home-traytor, wee ſtand for our Soueraigne, and countrie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt barbarous, vnnaturall, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19029:33"/>
moſt monſtrous bloodie harted treaſons. With the ambitious King of <hi>Spayne</hi> wee ſtand for our rightfull Queene, againſt an vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping tyrant. And therefore there is no Chriſtian heart ſo ſenceles, that wil not ſtand for God, againſt the Diuell; for Chriſt, againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; for trueth, againſt falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: neither is there any true Engliſh heart ſo voyd of loyaltie to his Soueraigne, and loue to his countrie, but that hee will ſtand for both, againſt practiſes &amp; plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes of fugitiues, againſt the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and madnes of home-traytors; and againſt the inuading humour of a bloodie tyrant.</p>
            <p>Now, deare countrymen, you haue a taſte of the black darknes, that this our natiue, and naturall country was in, when the Popiſh
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19029:34"/>

For <hi>Romiſh</hi> malice is not eaſilie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; and the thirſt of a kingdome will hardly be quenched.</p>
            <p>To meete with this proud po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh champion, our carefull Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and her prouident Councel conſult daylie, and commaund daylie. They conſult of the beſt meanes to reſiſt him, and defend vs; and they commaund all thinges neceſſarie to be prouided by vs, that wee may ſtand ſtrongly for

God, for Queene, for countrie, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the life, and liberties of our ſelues, and all belonging to vs. It behoueth vs therefore to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our places alſo, that as her Maieſtie, &amp; her honorable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell conſult, and command for the beſt; ſo we ſhould obey, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the beſt.</p>
            <p>It is ſayd of a learned man, that the felicitie of a Common-wealth conſiſteth in well commaunding, and well obeying. For if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders doe their parts, if obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience faile, their commanding is vaine: but if well commanding be anſwered with dutifull obeying, then is religion ſafe, the Queene is ſafe, the Common-wealth is ſafe, and we are all ſafe. For <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his time ſayth, that, <hi>Quae hoc tempore habemus bona, ob nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19029:36"/>
aliam cauſam adepti ſumus, quàm ob praestitam obedientiam principi.</hi> So ſacred and holy a thing is obedience to Princes, before God himſelfe, who commandeth vs to obey: nay whom in this point none can diſobey, being a true Chriſtian; and ſo reuerend a thing was obedience to ſuch as knewe not God, who were drawne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the light of nature, and by experience of their owne feeling the ſweete thereof. Now herein we haue an aduauntage aboue them: for wee haue both knowledge of God, who commandeth vs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and him we may not diſobey; and we haue no leſſe cauſe to feele the benefit of godly and Chriſtian obedience to our Chriſtian prince, than euer had, or hath any nation of the worlde: and to ſhewe our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19029:37"/>
ſelues ſenceles of this, were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Gods ordinance, to be ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our deare Queene, and to ſhake off all care to continue the peace and proſperitie of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; and conſequently to neglect our owne priuate good.</p>
            <p>I hold it a ſound ground, &amp; not to bee controlled, that euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to ſtriue to keep theſe three things ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d within his breaſt; his conſcience before God, his loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie to his Prince, and his loue to his countrie. All which three for my part I account ſo neerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned each to other, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iuſtly be ſeuered. For in vaine do wee ſpeake of conſcience to God, if we be ſhort in loyaltie, and obedience to her Maieſtie: in vaine doe we brag of loyaltie to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, if we carrie not a loue to our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19029:37"/>
countrie: and in vaine do we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt loue to our country, if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme not all loue, loyaltie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to our Soueraigne, &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not in ſome meaſure to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the dutie of a good conſcience to our good God.</p>
            <p>Our conſcience cannot but tell vs, that all obedience is due to the ſoueraigne Magiſtrate. For we are taught it out of the booke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the holy Scriptures; which teach vs that wee muſt ſubmit our ſelues to <hi>all manner of ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake; whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, &amp;c.</hi> Our loyalty ſhould tel vs, &amp; teach vs, that the ſafetie of her Maieſtie conſiſteth in loyall, and true obedience fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſubiects: for obedience proceedeth of loue; and <hi>Amor ciuiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt regi inexpugnabile
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19029:38"/>
munimentum,</hi> ſayth <hi>Seneca.</hi> And our loue ſhould tell vs, that the Common-wealth is moſt happie, where obedience is moſt heartilie performed. For, as one ſaith verie notably, <hi>Nihil eſt, quod regnum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquod reddat potentius, firmins, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renius, aut durabilius, quàm obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia ſubditorum.</hi> Whoſoeuer therefore hath any conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, any ſparke of a loyall heart to her Maieſtie, or the leaſt ſound loue in his boſome to his countrie; he cannot but embrace this obedience, euery way in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſeeke to expreſſe it, and with others earneſtlie labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it.</p>
            <p>Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we haue ſome, and too great a ſumme of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, that ſhake off this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and are ſo vehemently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19029:38"/>
with a prepoſterous blinde zeale to popiſh Idolatrie, that the Romiſh Antichriſt challenging to bee Chriſtes Vicar vppon earth, (though it bee plaine that in ſtead of Chriſt his ſimple and naked truth, he ſetteth vp his vnchriſtian, and carnal forgeries, and vntruths) is had in more reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, by thoſe recuſant Engliſh-borne ſubiects, than is our moſt Chriſtian, and moſt rightfull Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For although the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be giuen from God, that wee ſhould obey her: yet dare they couer and cloake their diſobedience vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable name of conſcience: whereas it is nothing els, but a vaine, and ſuperſtitious conceit, wrought in them from <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotting them with a blinde loue
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19029:39"/>
of their dregges, and making them (like to the fooliſh Iſraelties) to preferre the leekes and onyons of <hi>Egypt,</hi> before the ſweete <hi>Manna,</hi> wherwith the Lord fed them from heauen. So that in them the olde verſe is fully verified:
<q>
                  <l>Quiſquis amat ranam, ranam pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat eſſe Dianam.</l>
                  <l>The foole that to a frog his fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy ties,</l>
                  <l>As faire Diana thinks it in his eies.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſcience muſt be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon knowledge; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to guide the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce muſt bee fetched out of the ſacred and holie worde of GOD; the triall whereof they can no more abide, then can the owle the light.</p>
            <p>I note three things in this kinde of people, worthie to bee knowne and obſerued. Firſt, the hurt they continually do: ſecondly, the hurt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19029:39"/>
they would doe: and thirdly, their deepe diſſimulation. For the firſt, it would aske a large diſcourſe to diſcouer all the hurts done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are ſo many and manifold; I will onely touch ſome. My owne experience telleth me, that where the gentleman, and man of wealth refuſeth to come to the Church, and is in any ſort borne withall; there the meaner ſort receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and draw back from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For,
<q>
                  <l>A boue maiori diſcit arare minor.</l>
                  <l>Of elder oxe the yonger ſteere doth learne.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If the men come to Church, and their wiues refuſe (which is a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tricke much practiſed of late yeres) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> houſhold, both chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp; ſeruants, in daunger whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee corrupted. And ſure it is,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19029:40"/>
that the wiues of the meaner ſort are infected greatly by them; and the night crowes perſwaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth much; and in mint owne knowledge, within theſe three yeares, many of the meaner ſort are fallen away, and doe fall away daily:
<q>Impunitatis ſpes, magna peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di illecebra.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the hurt they would do, who doubteth but they would gladly haue vp their Maſſe againe, and baniſh the ſincere worſhip of God? Their whole catholike go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and religion, I am ſure, they long for. And yet, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe men to carrie hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hearts to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is thought to bee an vncharitable ſentence. But I pray you tell me, Can God and Mammon; Chriſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19029:40"/>
and Boliall; the table of the Lord, and the table of diuels agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Scripture ſayth they cannot; and it becommeth vs to beleeue it, no more can the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together: and yet muſt I beleeue that theſe men carrie loyall hearts to our Soueraigne, though they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Pope, and diſobey her. For my part I ſee no reaſon at all to beleeue them; and I wiſh all my countrimen to beware of them, for they are a dangerous breede; and the more dangerous, becauſe many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew to haue a good outward ciuill carriage in ciuill matters. But let not that poſſeſſe you with too great a regarde of them: and to deliuer you from the danger of ſuch deceitfull baytes, I muſt aſſure you that this is a true
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19029:41"/>
poſition, that, without the true feare of God there can bee no true religion; and vnles the religion be ſound, the face, and ſhew of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honeſtie (ſeeme it neuer ſo glorious in the eyes of fleſh and blood) is but a deceitfull viſour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a crabtree face, couering the moſt vile, and cankered partes of a moſt deceitfull heart; and ſo I come to their diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>Theſe ciuill honeſt men, that vnder pretence of conſcience rebel againſt God in religion, and refuſe to yeeld a loyall obedience to their liege Lady, and Soueraigne (as in religion, and policie they ought, in her moſte iuſt, and chriſtian lawes and commaundements) ſeeme to carry a moſte lamentable reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lurking in their boſomes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Queene, Country, &amp; vs all,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19029:41"/>
when, they will ſeeke the life of their, and our Queene, the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their, and our countrie, and the ruine of vs all, that profeſſe the goſpell, to haue their popiſh prieſthood, and maſſing ſacrifice vp againe; and if this be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I know not what conſcience meaneth. And yet this conſcience they fetch from <hi>Rome;</hi> and, by the plaine profeſſion of them that are fledde the realme, and haue, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought them ſelues out of reache) ſhewed them ſelues in their colours, wee may iuſtly doubt the affection of thoſe, that remayne with vs; how demurely ſo euer they will ſhewe to behaue them ſelues. For they are of the horſeleach kinde; and ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect when they may glut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the blood of Gods ſaints: without which they cannot
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19029:42"/>
haue their <hi>Dagon</hi> vp againe.</p>
            <p>The Recuſants of our age can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profeſſe, nor make greater ſhewe of loyaltie, and loue to our dread Soueraigne: neither can ſerue her outwardly with greater apparance of faithfulnes; nor can proteſt more deepely by wordes and oathes, their true and good meaning to her, than did <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Boner,</hi> and <hi>Tonstall,</hi> to her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble father, and brother; which they did confirme by printed bookes. For <hi>Gardiner</hi> he wrote his booke <hi>De vera obedientia,</hi> and <hi>Boner</hi> added his epiſtle before it; And <hi>Tonstall</hi> publiſhed a flat treatiſe againſt the Pope. But when theſe two noble Princes were called to their laſt, and euerlaſting home, and kingdome in heauen, and Queene <hi>Marie</hi> poſſeſſed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of this kingdome vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19029:42"/>
earth; then <hi>Gardiner</hi> did teare off his glorious viſour, and ſhewed him ſelfe in his right colours, and ſhape. For he, and his complices neuea reſted, till they had brought in the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and had matched him in marriage with the Queene; by which they betrayed God, her, and the whole realme.</p>
            <p>This bloudie intention by this linck thus ſtrengthened, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Gardiner</hi> out publikely in pulpit with this ſentence, <hi>Hora eſt iam nos ê ſomno ſurgere:</hi> peruerting the ſacred ſcripture moſt profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and blaſphemouſly to his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die purpoſe; and what hauock he, and <hi>Boner,</hi> and the reſt made of Gods ſaintes, and our deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and countrymean, ſtories make mention. Yea further, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue ſet downe, this bloodie monſter <hi>Gardiner</hi> did put hard at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19029:43"/>
the life of our deare Soueraigne, and miſtres, by whom (next, and immediatly vnder God) wee all liue in peace, and ſafetie, both of ſoule, and body; prayſed be the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie for her deliuerance, and long may ſhee liue, to rule and raigne ouer vs, to the waſting of poperie to the leaſt dramme of that religion (or rather ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) amongſt vs; and to the rooting out, and vtter ruinating of all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and traytors; and let all, that truly feare God, cary loyall hartes to our deare Queene, &amp; loue their countrey vnfeignedly, as faithfull chriſtians, loyall ſubiects, and true harted Engliſh-men, ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the reſt, ſuch of them, as are to be conuerted, I wiſh them true, and ſpeedie conuerſion, with all my heart; otherwiſe, rather than Gods true religion ſhoulde bee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19029:43"/>
darkened, her Maieſties leaſt fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerake by treacherie, and treaſon; or my countrey ſuſtaine the leaſt harme by their vnnaturall practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I wiſh their ſpeedie confuſion, and ouerthrow. For we may well ſay of them, as <hi>Tullie</hi> ſaide of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi> the conſpiratour, in one of his orations, In all, or moſt of theſe happie yeres of her Maieſties moſt proſperous, &amp; peaceable gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there hath been no trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practiſe againſt her perſon, or our countrey, but it came alwayes from them, and by them; whome neither ſhame of their villanies, nor feare of puniſhment, nor any ſound reaſon out of Gods booke, or the rule of true chriſtian policie could withholde from purſuing their traiterous purpoſes, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes. And to ſee, or heare, that the royall perſon of our Soueraigne
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19029:44"/>
Ladie was in danger, was pleaſing to them; as contrariwiſe, the news of her happie eſcape, was yrkſome; ſo that, where there is onely the bare ſence of a true Engliſh heart, theſe Popiſh Recuſants cannot bewitch, or deceaue with their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall holines, or ciuill hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: and ſo I leaue them.</p>
            <p>Now my deare countrymen, to you, whome God hath ſeaſoned with a better ſpirite of knowledge, and whoſe hearts he hath taught to honor, and loue your rightfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, and Queene; and whom nature it ſelfe hath inſtructed to holde your natiue ſoyle and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey deare vnto you; and to haue a ſenſible feeling of many miſeries threatned againſt yourſelues, your wiues, &amp; children; plucke vp your ſpirits, and bee couragious in the Lordes quarell, in the Queenes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19029:44"/>
quarell, in your countries quarell, and in your owne quarell; know, and acknowledge this common quarell of GOD, Queene, and Countrey, to be your owne quarel in deede. For in this buſie bending of diueliſh wits together to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire; and this ioynt-banding of huge, and ſtrong forces to execute; your ſoules are hunted after, that they may bee impriſoned in the darke dungeon of Popiſh Idolatrie (which is the ready way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for the cheines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for euer:) your bodies are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after, to be expoſed to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage, and intolerable torments; and here with your wiues to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred, your daughters to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed, your ſonnes to bee made ſlaues, and all of you to be tyed to a lingring tormenting life, or a bloody cruell death; your landes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19029:45"/>
and goods are hunted after; not for ranſomes to bee accepted for your deliuerance out of their ciuell hands, but for prayes, and rewards to the tormenting Souldier, and proude tyrannicall Spaniard.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore labour to bee inſtructed daylie more and more in the knowledge of Gods trueth, that our conſciences being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon true knowledge, wee may be armed againſt all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſleights of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and his <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> inſtruments; and with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and with boldenes ſtand to Gods infallible, and eternall truth to our liues ende; that when the time of our diſſolution commeth, we may enioy the crowne of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie; propounded to, and prepared for all thoſe that make a bleſſed entrance into the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practiſe of true religion;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19029:45"/>
continew therein with a chriſtian proceeding; and holde on with perſeuerance to the end.</p>
            <p>Let vs with all willingnes ſtraine our ſelues to our vttermoſt habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to fight for God, for Queene, for Countrey, and for our owne ſelues. For, what benefite ſhall we receiue of our wealth, if the raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spaniard catch holde on vs? And what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort ſhall our wealth yeelde vs, though we poſſeſſe it, if our bodies be in bondage? And what pleaſure can we take of our liues, if wee ſee our wiues, and daughters rauiſhed, and deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and our ſonnes tyed to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſlauerie.</p>
            <p>For although the ground (in ſhewe) of the Spaniards comming to inuade vs, is his care to obay the Popes commaundement, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this land to his obedience, in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19029:46"/>
taking holde of, and receauing his Romiſh religion, and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and our ſimple Recuſants rae ſo ſottiſh, and ſo bewitched with the inchauntments of Popiſh ſuperſtition, as they beleeue this to be true; and the rather, becauſe one of our Arch-runnagate traytors, ſworn to the Popes pantable, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a ſeditious pamphlet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt inuaſion, to perſwade it; yet if you will giue me leaue to call to your rememberance the maner, and meaning of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into England, when hee came, not as an inuader, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; but as a freind, to faſten a ſtrong league of amitie by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, I doubt not to diſcouer the treacherous crueltie of his hearte.</p>
            <p>For this marriage was ſought for, and intended alſo in ſhewe onely to ſtrengthen the hand of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19029:46"/>
Queene of <hi>England,</hi> to bring in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion, and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into this land; and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it with continuance, with purpoſe, and meaning to adde ſtrength to all the corners of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, to continue poperie where it was; and to bring it in, where it was not; that ſo the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> might holde the ſcepters, and power of all princes, and potentates of chriſtendome in his hand, to diſpoſe at his pleaſure. But the plots, and practiſes, layed, and purſued by the Spaniſh King, had made a wofull proofe to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of a further marke ſhotte at (which was diſcouered in a letter to ſome of our nobles from a true harted Engliſhman in <hi>Spaine)</hi> had not God almightie, in his riche mercie, preuented their purpoſes, and defeated them in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19029:47"/>
as it ſhall appeare hereafter, if I firſt remember to you that it is recorded of the Spaniard, that in diffimulation he ſurpaſſeth all nations, till he haue attained to his purpoſe; and when he can once preuaile, he goeth beyonde them all in oppreſſion, and tyrannie; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he diſdayneth all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that in pride, and carnall voluptuouſnes no nation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neere him, and theſe bee his qualities.</p>
            <p>Now to proceede to laye open the right marke, that in deede hee ſhotte at, though when hee made waye to ioyne in marriage with Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> hee made ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of greate conſcience to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion, and greate care to bring the whole land into the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof; and ſeemed to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much, when it was brought to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19029:47"/>
paſſe; as his letter to his holy father at <hi>Rome</hi> written out of <hi>England</hi> doth make ſhewe: wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth what a worthie worke he had done, when he had drawen the nobles, and commons of the lande to ſubmitte them ſelues to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, as their cheefe (thoſe are the very wordes) yet little did the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and commons knowe what was intended towardes them by this Catholike child of <hi>Rome.</hi> For vnder this colourable name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion, was hidden the ambitious humor of a moſt proud vſurping tyrant; whoſe reſolution was, vppon mature deliberation, and conſultation with his <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auellian</hi> counſellers, to ſeeke, by all the poſſible kind meanes he could, to winne the principall of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to affect him, and in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to poſſeſſe him of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19029:48"/>
crowne, and ſo to eſtabliſh him in an abſolute power ouer poore <hi>England;</hi> &amp; to bring this to paſſe, hee decreed to ſpare neither coſt, nor kindneſſe.</p>
            <p>If once hee had obtained the crowne, and regall power into his clutches, then (as in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> letter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie is layed open,) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell table muſt bee filled with his counſellers; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The hauen townes muſt be poſſeſſed with gouernours of his appointing; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Fortifications muſt be made by his direction; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> &amp; Souldiers of his owne muſt bee placed in garriſon, at places moſt apt for ſtrength to himſelfe, and annoyance to this poore nation; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Then muſt the common law of this land bee altered, by which Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is truely taught to al ſorts; the Prince to gouerne, the people to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay; the nobles to liue of their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19029:48"/>
owne, with out wronging the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours; the inferiours to liue vnder the nobles, with al loue, reuerence, and dutie, the riche to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore without oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the poore to dwell with the rich without diſorder; the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to bee puniſhed without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie; and the well diſpoſed to be defended, without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This the law of the land doth offer vnto vs, to our comfort; and from this he purpoſed to make an exchange to his Spaniſh lawes; which beeing no better than his Spaniſh Inquiſition (as in deede they are not) we could not (out of queſtion) receiue great comforte by the exchange. For the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition conuenteth without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en cauſe; compelleth to accuſe without reaſon; condemneth without proofe; committeth to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19029:49"/>
torture without colour; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neuer ceaſſeth till harte bloud bee ſucked out of ſuch, as make their wofull appearance. Which vnholy Inquiſition he did moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagely ſettle in moſt partes of his dominions; and this bloudie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition would he not haue failed to bring into our land, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his lawes, and ordinances ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſame. Their intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable taxes alſo we muſt haue been peſtered with; being ſuch (as my author reporteth, who knew them well) as <hi>England</hi> (thankes bee to God) was neuer yet acquainted with, neither, I truſt, euer ſhalbe. A taſt whereof I will giue you, as, that for euerie chimnie, and other places to make fyre in, as ouens, fornaces, ſmithes forges, and ſuch others, a french crowne was yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payed to him. Hee had alſo
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19029:49"/>
powling pence for all manner of corne, bread, beefe, mutton, capon, pigges, gooſe, hennes, ducke, chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, butter, cheeſe, egges, apples, peares, nuttes, beere, wine, and all other thinges whatſoeuer the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple feedeth vpon. Yea no farmer, yeoman, or huſbandman durſt eat a capon in his houſe, if his friende came to him. For if he did, it muſt coſt him ſixe ſhillings eight pence though the capon was not worth twelue pence and ſo <hi>ioties quoties.</hi> Theſe bee the benefites, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges, that this Catholike kinge ſought to bring in hither by this abſolute authoritie ſought for.</p>
            <p>My author doth further vnfolde his treacherous purpoſe towardes this land, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> by diſcouering vpon his own knowledge, and hearing, this kings intention to be, by little and little to roote out the nobilitie:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19029:50"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> to keepe the commons in begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and not to ſuffer one to liue heere, that was borne in twentie yeares before; but either to deſtroy them, or to make them ſlaues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Moores. The colour whereof was, becauſe they were borne out of the faith of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church of <hi>Rome:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhewed a very conſcionable regarde of their ſoules health, and ſaluation, by killing them, before he ſought to conuert them; or by ſending them where no inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be had for them.</p>
            <p>And, to make vp the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of al impietie, the faſter to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his crowne vpon his head from remouing (if he had gotten it) hee layed his plotte to deſtroye out deare ſoueraigne Lady, Queene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> hauing decreed with himſelfe, that neither ſhee nor any
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19029:50"/>
of that curſed nation (ſo hee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, and yet the Popes holynes had abſolued it) ſhould gouerne <hi>England</hi> any more. But bleſſed be God, who hath bleſſed vs with the life, and raigne of our bleſſed Queene; who, (I truſt) ſhall liue to giue him ſuch a deadly blowe, as neither his curſed ſelfe, nor any of his curſed nation, (iuſtly ſo to bee called, becauſe the Pope, that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man of ſinne, hath bleſſed them) ſhall euer ſee the day to rule in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whiles this plot was layde, and the practiſe was in hand, to ſet the crowne vpon the Spaniards head, the Spaniards them ſelues did, in my authors hearing (as he reporteth) often curſe the time, that euer their kinge maryed Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> vnleſſe they might get the crowne; but if that might bee
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19029:51"/>
brought to paſſe (which was ment by making of the marriage) they ſhould then do well enough. Thus you ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnder the colour of this marriage, ſaluation of ſoules ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſought for; but in deede deſtruction both of our bodies and ſoules was purſued: Loue to the nobles, and our whole nation, was manifeſted in ſhewe, but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ruine both of nobles, and nation was intended: Strength was ſaide to be added by this match to our kingdome; but it is apparant they ſought to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them ſelues, by weakening vs, and our kingdome. For without regarde of ſexe, age, or degree, all were deſtined to ſlauerie, and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage at the leaſt; howſoeuer they eſcaped with life. To knitt vp this; If marriage (the ſtrongeſt bonde of amitie to a true religious chriſtian
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19029:51"/>
heart) could not drawe the leaſt ſparke of true loue from him to this noble Queene, who ſo louingly made choice of him to be her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; nor the honorable accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him by the nobles, could worke any ſound loue in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them; nor his comming in tearmes of loue to our countrie, coulde yeeld better fruites, but to ſeeke the ruine, and deſtruction thereof; what ſhall our deare ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and all her people looke for now at his handes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in open hoſtilitie, with banner diſplayed, ſhippes manned, ſwordes drawne, ordinance charged, myndes fully bent to roote out Queene, nobles, and people; and to make this flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing kingdome a praie to his ambitious bloudie deſire?</p>
            <p>I looke for little ſoundnes from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19029:52"/>
thoſe, that are fugitiues of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I could wiſh all Engliſh home dwellers ſhould be ſo farre from all ſenceleſſe feeling of their countries miſerie (wherein their owne ſhare is, of what profeſſion ſo euer they be) as to be not onely free from treacherous combining with the enemye; but alſo forward to ſtretch forth their handes to reſiſt his force. I would haue none of <hi>Metius Suffetius</hi> his mynde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs; who beeing required by <hi>Tullus Hostilius,</hi> to ayde him in his warre againſt his enemies, he promiſed to come (becauſe he durſt not deny him) but he ſtood a loofe off, and beheld the fight, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to ioyne to either partie, till he might ſee what waye the victorie would go. But <hi>Hostilius</hi> perceiuing his cunning, and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, cauſed him to be drawne in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19029:52"/>
peeces with wylde horſes. You maie reade alſo in the booke of Iudges, that <hi>Meroz</hi> was curſed for not helping in the warre againſt <hi>Siſera;</hi> and <hi>Jael,</hi> for her forwardnes therein was bleſſed. And ſurely the curſe of the Almightie muſt needs light vpon al ſuch Engliſh-men, as will either by falſehood betraye their Queene, &amp; countrie, for loue to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spayne;</hi> or bee colde in prayer to God, or faint in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt the enemie, or pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in purſe, to make all requiſite prouiſion for the defence of their Soueraigne, and countrie, againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spayne.</hi> Neutralitie, in matters concerning chriſtianitie; or loyaltie, ſauoureth neither of a true hearted chriſtian, nor ſubiect. And <hi>Solon</hi> made a lawe, that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtirre, or tumult, all the Citizens ſhould ſtand on one ſide, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

he would haue no neuters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
            <p>Our Soueraigne, and Countrey hath been aſſaulted many wayes; and they both (through Gods great goodnes) haue eſcaped many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; And ſurely it behoueth vs to know, and vnderſtand, that a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger paſt requireth hearty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall thankes to be giuen to the author thereof; and a perill depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, exacteth both prayer, and prouidence. It is true, that wee all, euery mothers childe of vs, are very ſlacke both in prayer, and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing. Yet we are more ready to beg of God thoſe things we want, than to giue him thankes for that we haue already receaued. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non eſt dignus dandis, qui non eſt gratus de datis.</hi> Wee are eaſilie intreated in ſicknes to praye for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19029:53"/>
health; in danger to pray for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance; and in any aduerſitie to cry for helpe; but how ſoone ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is forgotten, when health is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; How eaſily dangers fall out of memorie, when deliuerance is obtained; How little aduerſitie is thought of, when helpe is once graunted; many examples doe proue. It is recorded for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and warning, that <hi>tenne Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pars were clenſed by our Sauiour Christ; but onely one came backe, to giue thankes.</hi> Againe wee reade that the Iſraelites were in miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage vnder cruel <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and whileſt the croſſe was vpon them, they cryed hard for help, and deliuerance; but being releaſed of their miſerie, and deliuered from the intolerable burdens of <hi>Egypt;</hi> they are ſo farre from being thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, that they fall to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19029:54"/>
againſt God; and in ſteede of ſeruing him, that had ſaued them, they fall to Idolatrie, and falſe worſhip.</p>
            <p>Let this warne vs to beware we be not ſlacke in thankfulnes to our God, who hath beſtowed ſo many bleſſings and benefits vpon vs, and hath freed vs from many perils, by ſo many ſtrange deliuerances. For <hi>thankefulnes for a benefite recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, draweth on a new bleſſing.</hi> And if euer this thankfulnes were needfull to appeare in vs, it is now, when, beyond the policie and wit of man, the life of our gracious Queene hath been ſundrie times preſerued; and in her Gods true religion, our owne liues, and our countries liberty both in ſoule and bodie prolonged. Let vs know for truth, that our God hath not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d himſelfe to continue a God of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19029:54"/>
and defence to vs, vnles wee continue thankfull to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> let vs ſay, <hi>Benedictus Dominus, qui non dedit nos in captionem denti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus eorum.</hi> But is this enough? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no. For if our thankfulnes come from a feeling heart, as it ought, it will not onely ſound in words, but will alſo ſhew it ſelf in action; and that in our continuall care, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, both by practiſe &amp; paines to ſeeke the glorie of God, and the good of his Church. The proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and welfare thereof ought to be more deare vnto vs, than our own liues. For no Common-wealth hath promiſe from God of peace, and tranquilitie, but in the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of religion, and true beautie of the Church: and in deede here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the ſaluation of our ſoules, and the ſafetie of our Queene doth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19029:55"/>
depende: and it is moſt certaine, that if the Queene bee in daunger, we cannot looke to ſit ſafe.</p>
            <p>I finde amongſt the learned, that ſinceritie of religion, and loue of the people, are two eſpeciall props and pillers of the ſtate of a Prince. For ſincere religion teacheth to loue ſoundly; and ſound loue quencheth all ſparkes of diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Therfore I hold it for certaine, that religion, and the Queenes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie cannot bee ſeuered. For if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion flouriſh, the Queene muſt needes be ſafe: and, if the Queene bee ſafe, religion muſt needs flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: and, as I thinke them to deale vnſoundly, that ſeeke to ſettle her ſafetie, without care of religion; ſo muſt I deeme them to deale hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically, that ſpeake much of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without care of her ſafetie. For he that ſhall carrie a right and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19029:55"/>
ſound care for Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> ſafetie, muſt firſt loue religion, and feare GOD: according to that, which <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour ſayd, who (grieuing at his peoples reuolt from true religion, vpon triall that he made of them) plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted, They that will not be true to God, can neuer bee true to man. And therefore ſuch of them as had any office, he putteth them out; ſuch of them as were neere about him, he diſplaced, and freed himſelfe from the daunger of ſuch hollow-hearted ſubiects, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
            <p>Religion then is the true guide to euery mans conſcience, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euery mans conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of true obedience; and this obedience containeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good ſubiect within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of true loue and feare: and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19029:56"/>
where theſe two meete together, they make a ſweete harmonie in the heart of euery true ſubiect. For loue nouriſheth all care to pleaſe, and obey; and ſuch feare expelleth all diſpoſition to offend; and both ioyne together with a feeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to yeeld continuall thanks to the almightie, for deliuering our Soueraigne from daunger, and to pray daily and hourely to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, that hee will in mercie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect vs ſtill.</p>
            <p>This perill depending, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to bee prouident. For as warre is denounced, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from forraine parts; ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies lye and lurk cloſely at home in our owne boſomes. <hi>Foris</hi> they prepare; <hi>intus</hi> they conſpire, and all to giue a deadly blowe to the ſtate we liue in; and to the perſon, whom (next vnder God) wee liue
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19029:56"/>
by. For I ſay it againe, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay it too often, theſe preparers abroade, and theſe conſpirers at home, ſhoote al at one marke: our religion they would alter, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring our conſciences into thraldome: our gouernment they would change, and thereby bring our bodies into ſlauerie: and, to effect theſe the more eaſily, the life of our ſacred Soueraigne they would ſhorten, and thereby bring all miſerie and miſchiefe vpon vs.</p>
            <p>Theſe bee high poynts, and of great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence. For who would not rather dye, than loſe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his conſcience? Who would not depart with any thing that hee hath, to preuent the bondage of his bodie? and who would ſpare the beſt blood in his bodie (much leſſe his purſe) to redeeme all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from his religious, louing, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19029:57"/>
lawfull Soueraigne? I doubt not (deare countrimen) but that you are men of wiſedome, and can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceiue what daunger wee ſtand in, by that hath bin ſet down before. You are men of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and therefore can eaſily conſider, what furniture is fit for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of vs, to preuent ſuch a danger (knowing treaſure to bee the finewes of warre) and you are men religious, louing, and loyall; and therefore will not refuſe to ſtraine your purſes farre, rather than the religion of our God, the libertie of our Countrie, and the perſon of our Soueraigne ſhall be expoſed to the deſire of Popiſh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, Spaniſh tyrannies, and bloody traytors.</p>
            <p>It is no time for vs now to plead pouertie; the cauſe requireth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie; and we muſt bee liberall;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19029:57"/>
the life of religion, of Queene, and countrie, is at the ſtake. He that is ſicke of a dangerous diſeaſe, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not into his abilitie what hee can ſpare; but looketh into the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of his caſe, what hee muſt ſpare, to worke himſelfe recouery. And in this caſe hee that would ſpare any coſt, al men would hold him a very ſauage, and vnnaturall miſer. I hope therfore being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians, loyall ſubiects, and true hearted Engliſhmen; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and trueth of God, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of our countrie, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie of our Soueraigne is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter price with vs, than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande liues; and none of vs will make dainty to ſpend the laſt drop of blood in our bodies, to ranſome any of theſe; much leſſe therefore will he ſpare to ranſacke the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our purſes, to adde ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19029:58"/>
to preuent the danger. Peny thirſt in this caſe may bring pound pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill: and (to ſpeake plainly) with what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort can a religious Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman liue; I ſaye, a religious man: for I ſpeake not of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Papiſt, the godleſſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, nor the ſchiſmatical Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt) when he ſhall loſe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his conſcience? with what ioy ſhall a man enioy his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when he is brought into bondage and ſlauerie? and what ſafetie can there bee to a right Engliſhman, when Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> is in danger?</p>
            <p>Seeing then they ſeeke to bring their Popiſh Idolatrie to vs againe from <hi>Rome,</hi> wee muſt ſeeke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine, and holde faſt the religion of Chriſt Ieſus ſent to vs from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and ſeeing they ſeeke to tye vs againe in the chaines of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19029:58"/>
Romiſh bondage, we muſt ſeeke to holde faſt, and increaſe the libertie we enioy, in the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Chriſt his goſpell; ſeeing <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Romanists</hi> ſeeke enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and trayterouſly the ruine, and ouerthrow of our Queene, and countrey; wee muſt ſeeke religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly by obedience, and aſſiſtance, to vpholde, &amp; maintaine the right, quiet, and proſperitie of both.</p>
            <p>It is not in vs, or our power, to effect this; but it becommeth vs to ſhew our forwardnes, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to effect it; our lands, goods, and liuings muſt not be reſpected, in regarde of this; all prayer, all prouidence, and all endeuour that can be, is little enough to follow, and finiſh ſo holy, and heauenly a worke; and this is our ſpeciall comfort, the Lorde himſelfe is on our ſide, for it is his owne cauſe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19029:59"/>
who is of power ſufficiently able to defend vs; who in his mercy is forward, and willing to defend vs: and if wee can call vpon him in faith, and will walke before him in feare, and trembling, he will neuer fayle vs. For <hi>The Lord is nigh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all thoſe, that call vpon him in faith, and veritie.</hi>

For it is ſayd, <hi>The Lorde was found of them, and gaue them reſt round about.</hi> Here is a bleſſed watch-word

word from the Prophet; a bleſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience both from king &amp; people; a bleſſed comfort ſent from God; &amp; this happie iſſue followed; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ouerthrow giuen by <hi>Aſah</hi> to the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who was ſet vpon by <hi>Zerah</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with an hoaſt of ten hundred thouſand, &amp; three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred chariots (as it is recorded in the former chapter) and it is there ſaid, that <hi>Aſah</hi> did goe out before him, and ſet his battaile; and <hi>Aſah</hi> lift vp his voyce vnto the Lord his God, and ſayd,<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>O Lord, it is nothing with thee to helpe with many, or with no power: helpe vs, ô Lord our God; for we reſt on thee, and in thy name are we come againſt this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God, let not man preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.</hi> And the text ſayth, that <hi>The Lord ſmote the Egyptians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Aſah, and before Iudah, and the Ethiopians fled.</hi>

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:19029:60"/>Here is a liuely paterne of our ſtate and cauſe. <hi>Aſah</hi> deſtroyeth Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and baniſheth falſe worſhip: he is maligned by the Idolatrous <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians,</hi> who ſend out forces againſt him; he prepareth, and ſetteth out againſt them; he putteth his whole and onely truſt in the Lord; he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto him; the Lord heareth him; the Lord ſcattereth his enemies, and giueth him the victorie. Is not this the very cauſe of our liege and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne? who hath baniſhed Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Idolatrie, and hath eſtabliſhed the true, and ſincere worſhip of God; and for this is maligned by the Anti-chriſtian Pope, by the ambitious King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and by al the popiſh confederates of Chriſtendome. And did not <hi>Spayne</hi> man out a huge Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie by ſea vpon <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> did ſend out an armie by land, to ſet vpon <hi>Iudah?</hi> They prayed, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19029:61"/>
we prayed; the Lord heard them, and the Lord heard vs: the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> armie the Lord of hoaſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted, and the Spaniſh Nauie the Lord of hoaſts did diſperſe and ouerthrow. Vpon this victorie the Prophet <hi>Azariah</hi> warned <hi>Aſah,</hi> and all <hi>Judah;</hi> and both king and people hearkened and obeyed: and ſince our victorie, the Prophets and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of our time haue often warned vs; and it becommeth vs to hearken and obey: which if we do, then muſt we make the like couenant with our God that they did; ioyne in the like oth that they did, and ioy when wee haue done it, as they did. Then ſhall the ſame bleſſing bee promiſed and performed vnto vs, that was vnto them; <hi>The Lord will be found of vs, and will giue vs reſt round about vs.</hi> And if the Lord for his owne glorie, and our triall, giue a way to <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:19029:61"/>
and <hi>Spayne,</hi> to ſet vpon vs againe (as they bragge, and threaten that they will) let vs beleeue with <hi>Aſah,</hi> that the Lord is of power ſufficient to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe great and huge armies with a ſmal number; and let vs pray to him with <hi>Aſah,</hi> that he will ſtand with vs, and for vs, in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile; and then, no doubt, neither <hi>Spayne,</hi> Pope, nor Diuell ſhall haue power to preuaile againſt vs.</p>
            <p>I finde it recorded, that King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the 8. her Maieſties moſt noble father, in the 19. yeare of his raigne, (before the Lorde had touched the eyes of his heart, and pulled away the ſcales that darkened his ſpirituall ſight) ſhewed ſuch zeale to that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> which in the time of his blindnes he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that vpon warre threatned, and purſued by the Emperour againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> for the ſacking thereof, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19029:62"/>
the Cardinall to inioyne his whole land and kingdome, that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Proceſſions, and faſts ſhould bee ſolemnelie helde (after their blind maner) for the deliuerance of <hi>Rome</hi> from his ruine intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; in ſo much as this one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſpecially is added to their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie, <hi>Sancta Maria, &amp;c. ora pro Clemente Papa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily I could wiſh that not onely commandements, and examples Canonicall out of the book of God, (whereof we haue plentie) ſhould of conſcience moue vs to ſuch holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes in theſe times, becauſe our ſins haue prouoked the iudgement of God; but alſo that this zeale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge in a falſe religion, ſhould euen for ſhame incite, and ſtir vs vp with ſeruent zeale to ſeeke the glorie of our God; and by ſuch godly religious neceſſarie exerciſes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19029:62"/>
to humble our ſelues before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne of his maieſtie, to beg either releaſe of theſe troubles threatned againſt vs, and haſtening vpon vs; or his arme of aſſiſtance to defend vs from the furie, and deliuer vs from the danger.</p>
            <p>For if they could be drawne in a ſuperſtitious blinde zeale, to fall to their ſuperſtitious praiers for a prieſt; I ſee not how, with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we can be ſlacke to fall to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and harty prayers to our God, for our Chriſtian religious Prince. If they could be ſo forward in <hi>England</hi> to fall to prayers for an Italian ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; much more ought wee in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for our naturally borne Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. If they were ſo readie to pray to God for him, to whom they could not ſubiect themſelues, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a true, and holie obedience to their God; much more ſhould wee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19029:63"/>
haſte to runne to powre forth our prayers to the Almightie for her, to whom wee ought to performe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; vnleſſe we will ſhew our ſelues to rebell, and wage warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>I will enlarge this no further, but leaue it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religious care of ſuch as carrie the chief place in our Church, who (I doubt not) will play <hi>Azarias</hi> part in warning our <hi>Aſah;</hi> and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe, our <hi>Aſah</hi> will hearken to it, and her whole people will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with willing and moſt ioyfull hearts: which God grant, that ſo this extraordinarie attempt threatned, may haue ſuch extraordinarie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of faſting and prayer, as were (with the fruite of a bleſſed ſucceſſe) vſed in the yeare 1588. when the Spanyards laſt attempted inuaſion; and thoſe not formall, but zealous; euen ſuch as may inſtruct the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19029:63"/>
to humble the heart, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſinnes committed, to meete the Lord by repentance; and then no doubt the Lorde will heare vs, and our victorie will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>God giue vs repentant hearts for our ſinnes, carefull and ſincere hearts to our Soueraigne, louing hearts to our country, and charitable harts one towardes an other. No doubt then, out religion ſhal flouriſh, our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſhall liue long, and our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſhall euer proſper, maugre the malice, and practiſes of all Tyrants and Traytors. For this ought wee all to pray; and for this all, that truly feare the Lorde, and ſincerely affect his truth, and goſpell, will daylie, and hartely pray. But for this the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious papiſt hath no will to pray; and the ſcorning Atheiſt knoweth not how to pray. From the malice,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19029:64"/>
and madnes of both theſe, God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie deliuer her Maieſtie, and this flouriſhing kingdome; that God, and his truth may be wholly, and only reuerenced, and regarded; and ſuch, as oppoſe them ſelues againſt him, either by corrupting his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or flatly denying him, and al reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may either by ſeueritie of lawe be corrected, and reformed, or elſe by chriſtian iuſtice be remoued from amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt Gods people; that our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſoyle may not be ſtayned with blaſphemous Papiſts, or prophane Atheiſts.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing aduentured to make this rude collection of a matter moſt neceſſarie to be vnderſtoode, and thought of, by al true chriſtian harted Engliſh-men; I will knit it vp with this earneſt requeſt to al my countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that my endeuour may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, beauſe I haue vndertaken it of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19029:64"/>
loue; that my defects may be borne withall, becauſe my heart carrieth a good meaning; and that the truth of the matters herein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no diſcredit through my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rudenes in the collecting; nor the cauſe it ſelfe (requiring a ſpeciall, and great regarde) ſtand ſubiect to any diſgrace by want of good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode in mee to diſpoſe it. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, I deſire no more, but wiſh the growing of Gods truth, and religion amongſt vs, by mightie increaſes; the prolonging of our deare Soueraignes dayes with bodily health; and home quiet, and the preſeruation of this little Iland of England from Popiſh ignorance, forraine inuaſion, and home treaſon.</p>
            <p>God onely can worke this; and to God onely I pray for this; and vnto God alone I commend his owne cauſe, which is, religion, the ſafetie of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19029:65"/>
his annoynted (by whome, as the meane, Religion ſtandeah with vs) and the defence of our Countrie, which, without religion, and her Maieſties ſafetie, cannot long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper.</p>
