         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There was formerly a certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
or neck of land lying in
this Country, called the <hi>Cape</hi> of
<hi>Good Hope,</hi> but time has so utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defac't it that there is hardly any
sign thereof now remaining: The
Temperature of the Soyl is as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as you may imagine any Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
to be that lies under so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
far distant Meridians, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so cold (especially when it
feels the refreshing influences of
Wealth and Youth decay, that
Winter is more kind, nay the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hearts of the people will be
frozen, and a Cart loaden with
whole Canon may go over the
streams of their former affection,
nothing but Ice of Disdain, hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones
of Malice, and most bitter
storms of Reproach: sometimes
so hot again, that a man had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be let down in a basket in at
the great hole of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi>
than travel in some parts of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51868:4"/>
Country, but touch it sometimes
and you shall lose a Member; it
is worse than the Church-yard in
<hi>Paris,</hi> which consumes dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases
in four and twenty hours, for
if a man make a hole in some part
of the mould, and put but an
inch of his flesh in, it will raise
such a flame in his body, as would
make him think Hell to be upon
Earth: to say truth, the nature
of the Soyl is very strange, so
that if a man do but take a piece
of it in his hand, 'twill cause (as
it were) an immediate <hi>Delirium,</hi>
and make a man fall flat upon his
face upon the ground, where if
he have not a care, he may chance
to lose a limb, swallowed up in
a whirl-pit, not without the Effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the choycest part of the
blood: But for Tillage the Soyl
is so proper, and so delightful it is
to manure, that be it fruitful, or
be it barren, men take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51868:4"/>
pleasure in the world to plow
it and sow it, nay there are some
men that take it for so great a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime,
that they will give some a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>housand some two thousand
pound a year for a little spot in
that Country, not so big as the
palm of your hand: Herein it is
of a different nature from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Soyls, for tho it be fertile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
yet after you have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
plowed it and sown it, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
neither showres nor the
dew of Heaven, nor puts the
husbandman to the troublesome
Prayers for the alteration of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yet if the husbandman be
not very careful to tend it and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it himself every night, once
or twice a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight, as they do Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
after Sun-set, he will find a
great deal of trouble all the year
long, tho there be a sort of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
that understand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Soyl very well, who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51868:5"/>
say that that kind of Husbandry
is very unnatural and very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the Soyl, and that it
were far better for a provident
Husbandman to have 3 or 4 or
half a dozen farms one under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to spend so much time,
toyl and labour altogether in vain,
for thereby many times the Crop
comes to nothing, and tho it may
be very well got off the ground
and seem fair for the time, yet
when you think to have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of it, you shall see it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
come to nothing, and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
away like a rotting Orange:
If the Soyl be barren, all the dung in
the world will never do it any good,
yet the more barren it is, the more
will the Soyl cleave and gape for
moisture, the sands of <hi>Arabia</hi> are not
so thirsty, and yet as if there were
a kind of witchcraft in the Soyl,
there are thousands of Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
so strangely besotted, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51868:5"/>
when they have hap'ned upon such
a barren spot as this, yet they will
not stick to lay out their whole
stock upon it, tho they know it
to be all to no purpose, whereby
many Husbandmen come to ruine,
not being able to pay their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords;
if the Soyl prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fruitful,
then they are as mad again on the
other side, then they so overstock
it with variety of Flowers and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
so tyre out Art with Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to beautifie nature, that when
winter comes there is hardly a leaf
left to cover the ground; as to the
colour of the Soyl you shall have
it very much vary, for in some
places you shall meet with a sandy
mould which is generally very
rank and very hot in its tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so that it requires the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
labour of all to manure it,
sometimes you shall light upon a
kind of a white Chalk or ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly
kind of a Soyl not so difficult to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51868:6"/>
manure, and besides the heart of
the ground will be soon eaten out;
sometimes you meet with a brown
mould which is of two sorts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
light brown, or dark brown.
Husbandmen generally take great
delight in manuring either of these,
for the Air is there generally whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and not so much annoyed
with morning and evening Fogs
and Vapours as the former, besides
that, the husbandman shall be sure
to have his penny-worth out of
them, for they will seldom lye fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
take which you will, but if you
meet with a black Soyl, be sure you
take short Leases, and sit at an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
Rent, lest your back pay for
the Tillage, for you must labour
there night and day and all little
enough: To tell you the truth,
choose which of them you will,
'tis a cursed expensive thing to
manure any of them all according
as the Soyl requires, especially in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51868:6"/>
the Northern parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where the generality of the
Husbandmen seem to have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their discretion in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as if the very Air of the Soyl
in those parts had a kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
Charm to deprive 'em of
their sences. These Soyls if they
prove very fruitful indeed, shall
sometimes bring you 3 Crops at a
time, sometimes 2, but generally 1,
a strange sort of Harvest, for it
consists chiefly in Mandrakes, they
bring forth both Male and Female,
which are very tender when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
first above ground, and must
be tended more diligently than
Musk-Melons in cold weather, but if
they overcome their first tenderness,
they grow as hardy as Bur Docks,
and will over-run a Country like
<hi>Ierusalem</hi>-Artichoaks. These Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes
are very much esteemed by
the generality of husbandmen, who
do very much lament the loss of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51868:7"/>
Crop, which many times miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
after it is come out of the
Earth, for it is very often blasted
and sometimes (through the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
of idle huswifes their maid
Servants) swept out of doors, and
thrown into houses of Office, where
(though Man's dung be counted
the best of all dungs) these Plants
will never thrive afterwards; these
Husbandmen that delight in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
find many Flowers there
growing very agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of every one of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soyls; among the rest, they
bear <hi>Batchelors Buttons</hi> very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly,
there is also great store
of <hi>Love lies a bleeding,</hi> but above
all <hi>sweet Williams,</hi> and <hi>Tickle me
quickly</hi> are to be found there in
great abundance, sometimes (tho
very rarely here and there) you
may find some few slips of Patience,
flower Gentle, and Harts-ease,
but Rue grows up and down as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51868:7"/>
thick as Grass in <hi>Ireland;</hi> there
are also great quantities of Time,
but the people of the Country
slightly esteem it and make very
little use of it. Fowl th<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

in great plenty, but above all, the
most infinite flights of Wagtailes
that ever were seen in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the world. Beasts they have
none but what are horned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Hare and Coney, but
these are enough to stock the
Country as large as it is, were it
as large again.</p>
            <p>There is but one great River
to water the whole land, besides
two standing Pools which they
can upon any occasion, let out
and drown all the Country, which
is the reason they have very little
Fish, only some few Maids, but
infinite numbers of Crabs, as for
their Carps they are grown so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
they are hardly worth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of, and indeed there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51868:8"/>
is little need of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ish, for the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
being given to labour,
have good stomachs and are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for Flesh. the great River
is over-look't by a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
which (strange to tell at some
seasons of the year) will swell at
such a rate that it is admirable to
behold it, the swelling continues
near ¾ of a year, and then upon a
sudden it falls as strangely again;
the Husbandmen accompt the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of this Mountain very omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
for it generally portends a
very dear year: they that have
not taken a Lease of their Farms,

to swell, will run quite away for

Country of <hi>Betty-land</hi> shews you a
very fair prospect, which is yet the
more delightful the more naked it
lies; it makes the finest Landskips
in the world, if they be taken at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51868:8"/>
the full Extent; and many of your
rich husbandmen will never be
without them hanging at their
bed sides, especially they that
have no Farms of their own, meerly
that they may seem to enjoy what
they have not: some there are that
so really believe they possess the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
by the sight of the shadow,
that they fall to till and manure
the very Picture with that strength
of Imagination, that it is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds to a penny they do
not spoil it with their Instruments
of Agriculture: others never so lazy
or never so tyr'd before, upon the
sight of one of these Landskips, shall
revive again and go as fresh and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to their labour as if they never
had been weary: I could wish
these Customs were left off of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
these Landskips by the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen's
bed sides, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
thereof are very mischi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
seeing that it causes them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51868:9"/>
to desire and covet one anothers
Farms with that eagerness, as if
they were in open Hostility with
the Tenth Commandment, so that
where they cannot get the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it self, they will have a Land|
skip and occupy one anothers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
in conceit: In a word, the
prospect of <hi>Betty-land</hi> is so grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
so pleasing to the Eye, that
the Country would be over-run
with Inhabitants, had not wise
Nature put a stop to that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
which she foresaw in Man
by the badness of the Air, which
is universally not so dilicious in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Region of <hi>Betty-land,</hi> as it is in
<hi>Arabia Faelix;</hi> for neither in spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
which is the time whereof
we now discourse, nor in summer
time can the Air be very much
commended, especially if the wind
be any thing high, which has made
many Men admire why the Poets
should be such Lyers and Sycophants
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51868:9"/>
to talk as they do; for some have
not stuck to affirm that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
of <hi>Betty-land</hi> are beyond all
the Odors of the East, which how
true it is, I will appeal to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Noses of the Poets themselves,
who I know are as well skilled in
the Country of <hi>Betty-land</hi> as any
Husbandmen in the world; nor can
any body have the confidence to
contradict what I say, that shall
stay but a quarter of an hour in
any place where the Thrashers have
been lately at work. This was
the reason that the Poets would
never let the Gods (who were as
great Farmers as ever liv'd in <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-land)</hi>
lie upon any other beds
than beds of Roses, and always
persum'd the Air as they went with
the richest Odors they could think
of, but in the Winter and Autumn
seasons there is no enduring the
Country: The Prospect is not
worth one farthing, the ways grow
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51868:10"/>
deep and rugged, the land grows
barren; there is little or no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in tilling the ground, and the
unwholsomness of the Air encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which is very bad for those
that hold their Farms by long leases,
yet so severely are some Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
tyed by their Leases, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Northern parts of this
Country, that there is no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, yet some there are that
will for all that, privately hire a
new Farm, perhaps such a one
where neither Spade or Dibble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
before, and then they let
the old only lye fallow, wherein
if they act cautiously, they may
do well enough; but if the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
of the old Farm come to know
of it, and sue upon the Covenant
of the old Lease, Heavens bless us!

Landlady enters upon the new Farm
in the Devils name, tears down all

of the Prospect, and digs up
the very surface of the Soyl it self
with so much indignation, havock
and destruction, that you would
think her to be quite raving mad,
yet there shall be no impeachment
of wast against her, so strictly is
the husbandman bound by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
of his Lease and nonsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Custom of the Country, at
which time if ye chance to tell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

not be amiss to take notice by
what Tenures the husbandmen

hold their Farms most usually in
this Country, some therefore you

true it is, that there are v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e soon weary of
it, for it puts them to very hard
duty, and however they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a Lease hand over head or for
covetousness of a good Bargain,
yet it many times falls out that they
meet with many Incumbrances
which they never thought of, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
concealed common sewers,
and filthy nusances which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
expected, so that the Landlords
(as they do many times allow the
husbandmen considerable summs
of mony to enter upon the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and to begin the world withal)
had better have given the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
for all this, the conditions of the
Lease are so hard, that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
is obliged to hold it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51868:11"/>
life, which makes many of
them turn ill husbands: and tho
they cannot throw up their Leases,
yet they neglect their Calling and
let their Farms lie fallow: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all possibility of Issue or the
hopes of any Fruit of his labour
becomes Extinct. Thus a Tail spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
is not always the most special
Tail, and to cut it off would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the destruction of the whole
Title, besides that there lies such
an Impeachment of wast against
the Husbandman that should do it,
that it would undo him for ever;
and therefore it is the Opinion of
many, that a Tail General may be
as good as a Tail Special, which
tho it be the first Tenure in order
in <hi>Betty-land,</hi> yet some there are
that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efer a Tail General before
it. All men must confess that a
strict property in a Tail Special
is a very good thing, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Inconveniences that do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51868:12"/>
attend it, a general Tail may be
esteemed the better Tenure, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accompanied with greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
for it requires not half
the fealty and homage which the
other does, neither if the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
will have a private Farm
to himself for his divertisement i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
there half so much notice taken of
it, and therefore they that can
brook the freedom of a Tail Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
live very happily, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times acquire large fortunes.</p>
            <p>Others there are that holds by
Knights Service in the Courtesy of
<hi>Betty-land,</hi> these are notable Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
indeed, jolly, brisk fellows
that will spend with ever a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in the Country of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pound a year, and make them
pawn their Credit and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to boot to bear up with
them: these men as they have the
greatest pleasure in the world to
manure their Grounds, so they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51868:12"/>
reap a world of profit by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
nay tho the Soyl be never
so long worn and out of heart,
yet they will make something on't,
for they seldom lose their pains.
There are a fort of nice people
that would fain disallow these Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures,

no ways to be pitied, because they
submit to their Calamity: others
there are which are always deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Reversions and Remainders,
a very necessary sort of husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
indeed, for they support the
Reputation of many a Farm pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
by being over-occupied,
which else would lie upon the
Landlords hands; true it is, they
run a very great hazard, but they
are generally very poor men, and

            <p>Reversions and Remainders are

where the husbandmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Yeomen of the best rank hold

upon any rate: They
make no more of the Lord of
the Manner than of a Jack-a-Lent,
and if they be summoned to
Court, they bid the Bayliff kiss
their back-sides, yet are they as
industrious as any when they
meet with a Farm to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
but the truth on't is, they
are great spenders, even as fast
as they get it; happy are those
Farms which they manure, for
they'l spare for no cost to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their own content: The
mischief on't is, they must
have great stocks or else they
can never go through with what
they undertake, nor must they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51868:14"/>
have only good Magazines to
spend high, but good store of
discretion to boot, or else they
may chance to bring an old house
over their heads for all their
great substance, for the world is
full of Eyes and Ears, full of
prying busie-bodies and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in every Corner; so that a
husbandman let him hold by
what Tenure he pleases, cannot
be too wary or too cautious.
Two Philosophers meeting upon
the Road fell into a Discourse about
these three last sorts of Tenures,
says one of them who was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Cynick, I approve none of the
three last sort of Tenures; You are
a fool, reply'd the other, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the nature of <hi>Betty-land</hi>
no more then a horse, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in that Country are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given to love freedom and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
naturally prone to change
and variety, and therefore as long
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51868:14"/>
as you may find these Tenures in
<hi>Littleton,</hi> as I am sure you may,
they cannot be bad; can you change
the nature of the Soyl? no more
can you change the nature of the
Husbandmen, for tho you thrust
Nature back with a fork she will
push forwards again: if they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
their Farms well, and you see
the fields full and fair and swelling
with Grain, if they make them
bear their Crops in season, what
is it to you how many Farms they
have, how long or how little they
hold them, especially when there
are so many gaping after Reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
were it in a Country where
there are more Farmers then Farms,
I grant you there were some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for what you say, but every
man of reading knows that <hi>Betty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is a Country where there are
ten Farms for one Farmer and it
is great pity that any Farm should
lye fallow for want of manu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51868:15"/>
Now when one Farmer takes one
Farm for pleasure, another for
profit, that Farmer takes two;
when another Farmer takes one
farm for profit, another for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and another upon good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
he takes three, and so all
the Farms come to be occupied:
As for being Tenants at Will, and
so leaving their Farms when they
will, 'tis not a farthing matter, for
let one husbandman have a Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m
to day, another will take it tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
on the other side, you must
consider, that tho a husbandman
have one, two or three Farms to
himself, yet there is no Farmer in
<hi>Betty-land</hi> can enclose his own
ground all the year long by the
custom of the Country, but that
from <hi>Lammas</hi> to St. <hi>Pauls</hi>-tide, it
must lie common for the benefit
of his neighbors, which is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Law, and is called common
because of neighborhood: nay
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51868:15"/>
more then that, there is hardly a
Farm in <hi>Betty-land,</hi> where there
is not some ground that lies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
all the year long; so that if
the poor husbandman had not some
private Enclosures to relie to, his
case were the worst case of all the
cases in the world: to say truth,
there is such a world of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in <hi>Bettyland,</hi> that a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is not to be blamed to get as
much Enclosure as he can: and
more than this, when the ground
begins once to lie common, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
all the Beasts in nature, not
excepting Swine, Geese and Goats,
which all other Commons admit
not of.</p>

as <hi>Markham</hi> among us wrote of

            <p>
               <hi>Saturn</hi> also was a great Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman

the whole World, for he had
Farms in both <hi>Betty-lands,</hi> and

that he left no stone unturn'd of
which he could make any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
And therefore <hi>Aratus</hi> who

            <p>Thus you see Opinions were
always at war one with another,
and it is only the Clue of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that must lead you
through the vast Labyrinths of
national Customs. The native
Shepherdesses of <hi>Betty-land</hi> desire
vehemently, Love but indifferently
and very unconstantly: yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they Love, or whether they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51868:31"/>
hate, they will dissemble with
the most politick Shepherd that ever
was known in all <hi>Arcadia.</hi> But where
they do Love out of Affection
(which is very seldome) they will
venture through fire and water: I
have known, said <hi>Eumolphus,</hi> when
a Shepherd has been cast into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for a Crime that deserved
Death; his Partner Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess
has workt his Escape, and
been condemn'd in his stead, as the
Law in some part of <hi>Betty-land</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
Their Tongues are the
most certain Evidence of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
motion, if a thing may be
said to move that never lies still:
and the subjects of their Discourse,
the highest Secrets in nature. Such
are the Mysteries of combing and
shading Hair, of Washes for their
Faces, large Comments upon new
Gowns; Censures upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Dressing and Behaviour:
Punctilio's of Ceremonies when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51868:32"/>
to give the Lip, when the Cheek,
descants upon the warmth or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Shepherds Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
when they grow old, then
they'l spend their time in telling
how handsome they were when
they were young. How many <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintases</hi>
courted them, and how
many poor Shepherds broke their
Hearts for them: but if a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
displease them, they will
sing him such Cromatique descant,
will make his Ears tingle; they
will ring him such peals that he
had better sit in a Steeple with
the noise of six Bells about his
Ears: but on the other side, they
are very good natur'd, for if you
do but now and then, that is, once
in a month<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or so give them a fine
Gown, a rich Petticoat, a rich
Looking-Glass, a rich set of Chairs,
or any such Bauble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you shall win
their very Hearts: give them but a
Neck-Lace of Pearl, and look how
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51868:32"/>
many Pearls there be upon the
string, they shall give you so many
kisses for them; which is a great
sign of a tender Disposition. They
have an excellent Art of making
of Horns, at which they are very
industrious, so that many of them
get very good Livings by it; And
as for Astrology, there's none of
your <hi>Bookers,</hi> or <hi>Lillies</hi> could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come near them; for they'l
tell a Shepherd his fortune to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
hairs breadth: to which purpose
they will lye an hour together
sometimes upon their backs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the motions of the Stars.
Many of your <hi>Betty-land</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdesses
are deeply Learn'd, for
having nothing else to do as they
sit upon the Plains, they are always

Authors; by which they are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51868:33"/>
mightily improv'd both in Practice
and Discourse. Put them to their

Ah! says the poor Soldier in <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
that had neglected his Duty,
to comfort a poor Shepherdess that
had been bewailing the death of
her dear <hi>Melibeus</hi> for three weeks
together: Here while I have been
spending my time to comfort thee
the most distressed Shepherdess in
the world, they have stole the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
from the Cross whom I was
set to watch, and now must I be
Crucified for him: But she reliev'd
him presently. Rather than so, quoth
she with tears in her Eyes, here
take my poor beloved Shepherd
and hang him up in the others place,
death makes no distinction of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
No less witty was the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdess
in <hi>Boccace,</hi> who loving a
Shepherd, yet knowing not how
to let him understand it, went to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51868:33"/>
one of the Priests of <hi>Pan,</hi> telling
him it was his Duty to rebuke
such Shepherds as should attempt
the Chastity of any Shepherdesses
in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> Look here, quoth she,
such a Shepherd sent me this Purse
of Gold, but I defie him and his
Gold; call him Father and school
him severely. The poor Priest
did so, the cunning Shepherd smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Rat smiled to himself, but
outwardly promis'd to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sist, when
the Shepherdess next day comes
again and tells the Paiest, She won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
he would be so neglectful in
his Duty: Why, quoth the Priest,
I call'd him, chid him, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
never more to Molest your
quiet. Alas, quoth she, but the last
night, he got in o're the Garden,
climbes a Fig Tree that grows under
my Window, and had got into my
Chamber had I not happily espy'd
him and shut the Casement. The
Shepherd was call'd again, rebuk't
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51868:34"/>
and chid, but you may easily guess
at the end of his sorrow: but
you must not think I have a Lords

Experience, and who had been
great Travellers in the Country of
<hi>Betty-land,</hi> g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that had received—<hi>Istum telis Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not long e're I discovered
to them the great desire I had to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51868:38"/>
know the Country of <hi>Betty-land,</hi>
of which I had heard and read so
much. They asked me what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
my friends had left me to
bear Expences, for the Journey
would be tedious and chargeable.
I bid them take no care for that,
for I had Lands to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell, and as long
as that lasted there would be no
want; telling them withal, that
Knowledge is better than fine
Gold. Then, replyed <hi>Eucolpius,</hi>
the place where we now are, is
one of the most remarkable Cities
in all <hi>Betty-land,</hi> and therefore
dear <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> rest thy self assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the best Assistance I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
thee with: so in the depth of
the Winter-quarter within an hour
after day-light shut in we set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
To remember the several
by-ways and turnings through
which we went, it is as impossible
as for a man to remember thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

done before he was born, at length
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51868:39"/>
we came to a good large Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which seemed like an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
Castle: for tho we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that there were many of the
Inhabitants of <hi>Betty-land</hi> in the
house, yet there was as a deep silence
as in a Temple. We were no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
entred (for the doors of these
houses are seldom shut, as being
haunted with a continual sort of
Strangers) but there appeared to
us a young Syren, which put us
in mind of that Verse in <hi>Ovid,
Monstra maris Syrenes erant.</hi> The
Syrens were strange Monsters bred
out of the froth of the Sea, or
rather Monste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of the Sea,

                  <l>Seeing that there are none of all</l>
                  <l>That walk on Land which they can

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>She was as black as a Lobster
before 'tis boil'd, and instead of
hands had much such kind of Claws,
and her head lookt like a <hi>Gorgons</hi>

               </gap>iwig with Snakes, she lookt as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51868:39"/>
if she had been eaten and spew'd
up again, or as if she had been
one of those upon whom the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifices</hi>
of <hi>Betty-land</hi> were wont to
try their Potions; and yet she
had the confidence to invite us
to drink of her Cups. <hi>Eumolpus</hi>
did not much mind her Courtesie,
but askt <hi>Eucolpius</hi> whether that
were not the <hi>Cumaean</hi> Witch that
accompanied <hi>Aeneas</hi> through Hell:
How, reply'd <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> does she
look old enough to be a <hi>Sybil?</hi>
yet there are some of the poor
labouring Mechanick Inhabitants
of <hi>Betty-land,</hi> will be glad of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
worse than that Syren. With that
calling her by her name, <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla,</hi>
said he, where is <hi>Thelxinoe?</hi>
for so was the old Syren called.
She knew his Voice, and streit
appears the Great—<hi>Bellua Leinae
—Horrendum stridens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ruinous piece of Antiquity with
a Voice as hoarse as if her throat
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51868:40"/>
had been lin'd with Seal Skins:
she had as much flesh below her
Chin, as would have serv'd to have
made another Face: she was pufft
up like a shoulder of Veal blown
up with a Tobacco-Pipe, yet was
her Language as soft as Lambs-Wool
to <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> who enquir'd
of her, where such and such Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
were, and how they did:
shall I send for such a one, quoth
she? do, cries <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> Fly, then
cry'd <hi>Thelxinoe,</hi> to the deform'd
Syren that first admitted us, and
bid <hi>Sylvagia</hi> appear, hast her hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
All this while, said <hi>Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
we were in the common-Room,
which put him in mind of that
description of the Syrens habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Iamque adeo scopulos Syrenum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vecta

            </p>
            <p>But when the little Syren, said
he (continuing his relation) was
gone forth, <hi>Thelxinoe</hi> carried us
into her own Apartment, a place
not very illustriously accoutred,
nor yet over meanly set forth.
There hung against the wall a good
fair Looking-Glass, and in the
window were to be seen two dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Combs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the most peculiar Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils
belonging to a Syren. The
Bed (which was the best thing
in the Room, as being a piece
of Furniture of which they make
the greatest use in <hi>Betty-land,</hi>) lay as

               <hi>Vlysses</hi> quoth he, who's that? for
<hi>Eucolpius</hi> knew that she had had
no Husbandman to manure her
ground for many years together,
only day-Labourers that wrought
at so much an hour. But she to
stop <hi>Eucolpius</hi>'s mouth, in a great
rage demanded of him what sort
of Liquor he would have, and
immediately fetcht in half a dozen
Bottles of Stepony, a most bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juice, which as soon as the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
were loose, flew up with so
much violence against the Ceeling,
as if they had bid defiance to the
Clouds, such a shower of spirited
water rain'd upward against the
course of nature: so that a whole
Bottle scarce yielded enough to
wet the bottom of a Glass, yet
would the Syren not ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of her price, which was a
round shilling for every Bottle.
After that she brought in six
more Bottles, which behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

after the same rude manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

with the pleasant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of the Syrens, on a sudden
we heard a great noise in the room
over head as if the Sky had
been falling. Two Shepherds of

for several hours together, with
each two Syrens in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ranted and tore, seeing that

of their Pockets. In this hurly

seeing so fair an opportunity, and

It was now late, cold and

were easily over come by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s Beams, that made the
night almost as clear as day. Being
thus therefore got safe from <hi>Thelx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inoe's</hi>
Habitation, <hi>Eucolpius</hi> thought
it convenient to steer his Course a

<hi>Eumolpus,</hi> we march'd hand in hand
in a full rank for a while uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
But Oh the fickle state

            <p>By the practice of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
said <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> we that
were just going to the Pound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were at the intercession of those
dulcified Sons of Horror (one of
whom swore to the deep pit of
Darkness that he knew <hi>Eucolpius,</hi>
and knew him to be a very Civil
Gentleman, when tho he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen him in his life) with an
Extortion of much Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for so great a favor, let at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
This storm was no sooner
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51868:45"/>
over, but the hazard was forgot,
and a new Ramble concluded on;
at length under the Conduct of
<hi>Eucolpius</hi> we came both into a by-Street,
but there was such a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
silence in the Habitations of
the Syrens, as if all the lower world
had been listning after news in the
upper. O quoth <hi>Eucolpius!</hi> the
Inhabitants of these parts are as
laborious Husbandmen as any be
in <hi>Betty-land:</hi> They work day
and night, and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they sleep so fast now they
are at it. At length coming to a
certain Habitation, where the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the door was not driven
close to the wall, <hi>Eumolpus</hi> made
a shift to get in his hand and put
back the Lock, we were no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
entred and began to extol the
kindness of Fortune, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same way-Wood of the night
that had prosecuted us before, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
us close at the heels, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51868:45"/>
seeing us lawful prize, began to
give order for a second seizure:
But <hi>Eucolpius</hi> knowing the danger
of a second Attachment, bidding
<hi>Eumolpus</hi> follow his example with
his Sword in his hand, being well
seconded by <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a way through the slender Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of those decrepit Mirmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
and being got without the
reach of their rusty Weapons they
never slackned their paces, which
was a good swift Career, till they
were got out of the Dominions of
that nocturnal Bugbear. By and by
making a halt to take both breath
and advise together, now, said
<hi>Eucolpius,</hi> let us return to the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
place from whence we last came:
for this Lord of Mis-rule having
now gone his Rounds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd made
his visits of Enquiry, will be sure
to come no more there. For a
right bred Syren has a way of
Charming these Officers of Justice
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51868:46"/>
and keeping them from wandering
at all hours, and to say truth,
there are few of these nocturnal
<hi>Cerberus</hi>'s that will bark at a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
Habitation, unless he be very
hungry indeed, and have not been
fed for a great while. With this
Resolution, said <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> we tackt
about, and ski<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting through a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
spot of <hi>Betty-land</hi> called <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-
Inn-fields,</hi> we observed almost
at every Gate of those wealthy
Husbandmens Habitations, a poor
labouring man, and a servant Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdess
talking together. They
were generally very serious and
private in their Discourse, tho
it were now near two of the Clock
in the morning, but by what we
over-heard, <hi>Betty-land</hi>- Love was
the main thing they drove at, for
sometimes we could hear the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdess
cry Sunday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;
by and by the poor labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
protested the reality of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51868:46"/>
another was telling a long
story of the Transactions in that
habitation; another was complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that her Farm had been Tilled
and Manured; that Harvest was
at hand, and therefore desired the
poor labourer to take some care
where to inn the Crop. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was delivering to her friends
Candles, cold Meat, and other
bundles of stuff, which she had
purloyned and made up, in as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
room as might be; bidding
her friend be sure to return by such
a night again: certainly, said <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molpus</hi>
to <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> these husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
live here in very great secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that they let their Gates stand
open in such a desert place as this:
O reply'd <hi>Eucolpius!</hi> these Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
tho they be rich, yet
they have so many thieves within
doors, that they never fear those
without: for they within doors
will preserve their Masters sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51868:47"/>
from those without, that it
may fall into their own hands.
Having observ'd these passages we
jog'd on, meeting none upon the
Road, but now and then one, now
and then a couple of rude labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fellows with stout Cudgels in
their hands, looking as if they
would eat us. These were the
very dregs of all <hi>Betty-land</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat
take the greatest pains, and run
through the greatest hazards in
the world to maintain themselves
in Idleness. Coming to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
Habitation we unlockt the
Gate as we had done before, and
then barring it again, went direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into a Room where there was
a small fire, but no other light,
nor any sound of any thing living
in all the Habitation: down sate
<hi>Eucolpius,</hi> down sate <hi>Eumolpus,</hi>
right against the door of the room
expecting what would happen,
when on a sudden we heard 3 or 4
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51868:47"/>
Syrens laughing and toying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make toward the back-door
of the Habitation. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
poping into the Room, and
seeing the glittering of <hi>Eumolpus</hi>'s
Coat (which was richly lac't) by
the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lection of the fire, flew back
again ready to break her Neck,
crying out, the Devil, the Devil,
but <hi>Eumolpus</hi> compassionately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
her, and gently bespeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her soon rid her of fears, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her by the hand into the room,
whom the rest of the Syrens fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
We call'd for more fire
and Lamps that we might see one
another, and after that for such
Liquors as the Habitation would
afford: As for the Syrens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they were not the most A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
that ever were seen, which
made us mind our Liquor rather
than any other of their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Their Voices were none of
the sweetest, yet for a forc't put
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51868:48"/>
they might have serv'd, had we not
been kept waking by another Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
For in the height of our mirth
in comes an ordinary <hi>Betty-land</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
who by his Familiarity seem'd
to claim a kind of propriety in
the whole Habitation: we saw
he would be one of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and therefore we invited him.
He had taken a large doze of the
Syrens Charms, which made his
Tongue as nimble as a new oyl'd
Jack: Between <hi>Eucolpius</hi> and him
past many Discourses, among the
rest, there was one Question sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Farmer, Whether if
one Farmer should rob another,
it were better to bind him, or kill
him to prevent discovery? Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
protect us! cry'd <hi>Eumolpus</hi> to
himself, if this be the Country of
<hi>Betty-land,</hi> surely, quoth he, the
people thereof are meer Salvages,
however the Argument went on.
<hi>Eucolpius</hi> who when he began to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51868:48"/>
be intoxicated with the Syrens
Liquor was very devout, being
for Mercy, the Farmer all for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
this made <hi>Eumolpus</hi> stand
upon his Guard and to have a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
Eye upon the Syrens, and
to hasten the complete Charming
of the Farmer, which was at length
so effectually perform'd by <hi>Eucol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
and <hi>Eumolpus</hi> together, that
he fell into a profound sleep: in
which condition after he had lain
a while, he was at length rouz'd
by the Syrens and hurried to his
Sty like a Swine: After his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
the Syrens vanished, and
<hi>Eumolpus</hi> and <hi>Eucolpius</hi> remain'd
alone, who early in the morning
leaving the Gates of the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
open, and the Syrens fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep,
went their ways to seek
out more secure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efreshments.
Thus you see the meaner sort of
the Inhabitants of <hi>Betty-land,</hi> are
a very wicked sort of people,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51868:49"/>
being no great admirers of Law
or Government: for all Pleasure
is expensive, and they wanting the
support of Extravagance, will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
in their necessity take it
by violence from one another,
sometimes in the street, sometimes
in the high-way; nay, sometimes
they will enter one anothers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
by main force, and rifle, and
what they get they spend all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Syrens with whom they
live in a kind of Community. I
remember, said <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
in <hi>Betty-land</hi> that had
his Castle entred, and much of
his substance taken away; who
thereupon resolving to go in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of the Labourer that had so
spoiled him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f his goods, sent
for me to assist him: we for our
better security took with us one
of the great Rulers of the night,
and with him a certain day-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,
who pretends to know
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51868:49"/>
all the habitations of the Syrens.
The more to be wondred at, as
being in one of the greatest Cities
in all <hi>Betty-land,</hi> and thus accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
we began our progress one
night in the most dead time of all;
I dare say, said <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
above a hundred several Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
of a hundred several Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,
taking a view of every room
in every one of them, where it
was not a little pleasant to see
what feat kind of Enormities night
conceals. We found the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
and the Syrens generally
in bed and asleep together, for the
hardness of their Labour made
them sleep without Opiates: In
some Beds 3 Syrens and one Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
in another place 3 Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
and one Syren; at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Habitation one Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and 2 Syrens, in another 2
Husbandmen and one Syren, in
another two Husbandmen and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51868:50"/>
two Syrens all together: in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
3 Syrens and two Husbandmen,
in another 3 Husbandmen and two
Syrens. <hi>Eucolpius</hi> that had never
seen so strange a mixture of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
before, began to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this were not some Art of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s
Common-Wealth, for, said he,
there was as much Athenian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
as ever that great Law-giver
could possibly allow. The day-Labourer
who was with us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he knew them all or no, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, said <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to do so, and pulling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the head-Geer of one, and
the hair of another: quoth he,
this is <hi>Dol</hi> such a one, and this is
<hi>Kate</hi> such a one, and this is <hi>Nan</hi>
such a one: as if he had been show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us the Tombs at <hi>Westminster</hi> with
a white staff in his hand. And I
believe had the night been a week
lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g, we had had variety of these
O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts. <hi>Eucolpius</hi> when he came
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51868:50"/>
home told <hi>Eumolpus</hi> of his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who lamented nothing more
than his misfortune of missing <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colpius</hi>'s
Company; that night
however it made him restless for
new discoveries, which they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to prosecute the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
The Sun had now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
himself and it was within
an hour of night when <hi>Eucolpius</hi>
and I, said <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> entring into
one of the Gaming-Houses of the
Syrens, went up into a private A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
calling to the chief Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
to bring us a Bowl of her most
charming Liquor; she that brought
it was no sooner sate down by us,
but she began to talk of these
Persons who were the Chiefest
Husbandmen in <hi>Betty-land</hi> in their
time, at so familiar rate that we
wondred how she came by so
great an Acquaintance among the
Nobler sort of Husbandmen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such an ordinary Syren her
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51868:51"/>
self: for she can divison upon their
Descents and Pedigrees, as if she had
been bred in the College of Heralds.
While we were thus taken up with
Enchantments of her Discourse, a
strange lumbring noise invaded
our Ears f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om the stairs which led
into our Apartment: The Syren
when she heard it, flew out of the
Room with the swiftness of a
shooting-Star, clapping the door
fast after her: But we, said <hi>Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
big with Curiosity had a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desire to know the reason of
so much Clutter. By and by,
peeping through the door, we
perceived an old Farmer of <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-land</hi>
coming up upon four Legs
two Natural and two Artificial
(a pair of wooden Crutches)
with which he did so knock and
bepestle the Boards, that a Horse
with 4 Iron shooes would have
been thought to have walkt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Velvet after him, so weak and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51868:51"/>
so decrepit, so old, so worn out
with the Labor of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat Country,
that no greater pain could be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined,
than the pain which he
seemed to endure in his Engine-like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
motion: with much ado at
length he got to the inside of a
Table, and sate him down with
his back against the Wainscot,
opposite to the Chimny: Surely,
said <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> were the seven Wise
Men of <hi>Greece</hi> now alive, it would
puzzle their Understanding to
know the strange and hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this old Farmer. I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
quoth <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> this old Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
had been an industrious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in his time, and now to see a
fertil spot of ground, to behold
a pleasing Prospect, is as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him as the Tillage it self was
formerly. Age unfit for Action
will delight it self in the Memory
of what in Youth it has pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whether we were addicted to Acts

of Honesty or of Villany, Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
sooths the Fancy, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
it with the remembrance of
what a drooping performer has
done: so setling to our peeping
Crannies, we observed a young
Syren come into the Room with
two sable Pots of Enchanting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in her hands, which she set
down before him. The old Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
drank not so lamely as he
went, but freely; and made the
Syren quaff her own Liquor as
freely as himself: she had a Brow
as black as a new Beaver, and her
Cheeks were as ruddy as the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Edges of a new Book. In
a short while betaking her self to
the Chimny, she stood bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and having the Signal gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
(as they draw the Curtain up
from before the Scenes of a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
she drew the Curtain gently
up that was before it, and show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Prospect of a very fair
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51868:52"/>
Garden-plot of Maiden-hair, not
green as in other Countries, but
growing like a kind of black Fern,
or rather a spot of Ground look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Fennel. The Fields about were
imbroidered over with white Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and yellow Pissabeds: but the

Innocency, and had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
plagued with Jealousie, and
consequently could endure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of those Colours, caused her

so at last goes out of the Eye.
The Eye is the Charriot wherein
the Fancy Rides, surveying past
contents, and if that be strong and
juvenile, it will imploy the Body
in something of its former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
how impotent, how unwield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

know, is not at all permitted to
be so much as named in <hi>Betty-land,</hi>
where it is Death to make use of
it: And where the Husbandmen
and Huswifes are guided only by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51868:53"/>
Passion, and follow only the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
of Appetite.</p>
            <p>Again, as there is no Reason,
so there is no Wisdom in <hi>Betty-land:</hi>
they seldom hear of it from

or if they chance to hear
the least sound of it, they count
it as fatal as the Romans did to
hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ravens croak upon the
left hand: like the young People
of <hi>Betty-land,</hi> that when the Bells
ring to the Temple, run to the
Syrens Habitations at <hi>Islington,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that the Bells are hung in
the City to ring them into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Should this Farmer have been
so impotent again, he would not
have been a Rush the wiser, and
therefore 'tis no wonder his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominating
Superiors direct and
govern him as they please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Eucolpius</hi> having thus said,
<hi>Eumolpus</hi> and he took their way
towards a small part of <hi>Betty-land,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:51868:54"/>
near the Temple of St. <hi>Buttolphs-Aldgate,</hi>

Apartments were fair and well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd,
through one of which, as
we passed, said <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> we saw
a Table spread and furnished as if

Secrecy enjoyn'd. In the mean
time, we call'd for a Syren or two,
which were immediately call'd up,
Charming enough; we had no

the Syrens Liquo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, but one of
them began to fall into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsal
of her Misfortunes, that
she was the Daughter of one of
the Priests of <hi>Pan</hi> (for the most
common Huswives of <hi>Betty-land</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Priests of <hi>Pan,</hi> thereby to
gain the greater pity of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:)
that she had been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of doors by the Shepherd,
whom of all others in the Country
she lov'd most intirely. The other
cursed a noble Husbandman of <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-land,</hi>
for being untrue to her;
or else—for a deep Sigh sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rest, but both of them concluded
in, What would you give them?
That they were no common Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,
but seeing us Civil Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
if we pleased to come to
their Habitations, we should not find
them to be Mercenary. But offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

offer to lay your Lips to theirs,
they were presently according to
the Fashion of the Country, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
either for Scarfs, or Gloves,
though at the same time they brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of Wardrobes richer than
those of <hi>Lucullus:</hi> We that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
not a word they said, easily
condol'd with them, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Mountains; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more practicable in <hi>Betty-land</hi>
than lying and dissembling,
Two gifts that a Husbandman of
that Country can no more be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
than without his Plow. In
fine, these two Syrens were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orced
to leave us, being called away by
the Syren Government, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
that the Shepherd was entred,
at whose Devotion the Habitation
and all within it were, being at all
the Expence for his peculiar Fancy;
by and by, the Alarm of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
noise, called us to our peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-holes
of Observation; from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51868:55"/>
whence we discovered in the great
corner Room, where we saw the
Table spread as we first came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
a very fair Collation of Cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Viands, the most part Fowl.
About the Table sate some half a
dozen Brisk Syrens, sitting almost as
they were pictured (saving that they
had other Instruments to use than
Combs and Looking-Glasses) for
their lower parts were hid by the
Table, as they had been under
water; but from the Wast upward,
they were to be seen quite naked,
as in vulgar Signs. All this while
we missed the Shepherd, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
he should neglect the sight
of such fair Prospects as these were,
but by and by we discovered him
by the noise he made under the
Table upon all four, picking up
the Bones which the Syrens threw
down, yelping and snarling like
an Izeland Cur, and biting at the
Legs and Shins of that Syren which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51868:56"/>
threw him down his desired Food.
This violent humor continued all
along the time of Supper, said <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molpus,</hi>
to his Astonishment, which
made him think the Mysteries of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
to be a Bauble, and the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Betty-land Ploughs</hi> in publick
Procession upon sticks by the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Bacchides, to be a <hi>May</hi>-Game:
and yet they appear'd to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but a kind of family <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-land</hi>
-Love, (and there are few
Families without a Cur) for there
was no more harm done, but after
Supper every Syren seem'd to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
as they pleased themselves:
Look ye, said <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> now you
have beheld something more
strange than what you saw before.
Certainly, said <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> the Gods
that only smil'd to see <hi>Mars</hi> and
<hi>Venus</hi> so entangled as they did,
would have laugh'd themselves out
of their Immortality, to have seen
this Extravagant Divertisement.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51868:56"/>
Think you, said <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> this
Shepherd can give any Reason
for this? Surely no other, reply'd
<hi>Eumolpus,</hi> than that of the Poet:

            </p>
            <p>From thence at a later hour,
said <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> we passed to see
the Publick <hi>Academies</hi> and Shools
of the Country, where we found
them altogether for Justing, and
Turnaments, and Running of the
Ring: but in this particular, as
captious one among another, as
Church-Wardens-Wives; for it not
being the Custom of the Country,
for Shepherds to Just one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but only Shepherds with
Shepherdesses, and Shepherdesses
with Shepherds: the Shepherds
will never Just unless the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdesses
will provide Rings, nor
the Shepherdesses can ever be
brought to run a-Tilt, unless the
Shepherds provide Launces. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
if the Parties stand upon it,
there seldom happens any great
Quarrel about that <hi>Punctilio.</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:51868:57"/>
These <hi>Academies</hi> stand open all
night long, and there are some so
accustomed to these Exercises, that
they will hit the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts of

one thing we never perceiv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that when they went to play

            <p>The Noble sort of Syrens are

these, for they being better stockt
with Wealth, carry on higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
which they will bring about
what ever it cost them, or perish
in the Enterprise: They are very
subtle, and not only make use of
all sorts of Deceits and Stratagems
already discovered, but add daily
of their own. They are very
much addicted to Enchantments,
and very skilful in making Amorous
Medicaments. They that would

            <p>The Country of <hi>Betty-land</hi> has
had formerly good Benefactors,
who did very much add to the
Glory and Increase of its Fame.
The first of those was <hi>Solon,</hi> the
great <hi>Athenian Law-giver,</hi> and by
the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> accompted
one of the Seven <hi>Wise-men</hi> of
<hi>Greece,</hi> who was the first that
made it his publick Care to provide
Syrens for the Shepherds of that
Country. The first that dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Temple to <hi>Venus,</hi> the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51868:59"/>
Goddess of <hi>Betty-land</hi> out
of the Games of prostituted Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,
and so great an Esteem the
Grecian part of <hi>Betty-land</hi> had
for those Syrens, that when <hi>Xerx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
invaded <hi>Greece,</hi> the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
being the most polite of all
the Country, were ordered to
make publick Supplication for
the safety of <hi>Greece;</hi> so honor'd
and so Rich grew the Syrens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Ephesians, that they
built several Temples in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Corinthians also gave
them that Respect, that when

peculiar charge of their Prayers
was committed to their Syrens.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> also thought them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Divine Honors, when he
made the same Offering, and us'd
the same Ceremonies to the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<hi>Hernia,</hi> as were usually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to <hi>Ceres</hi> of <hi>Eleasine. Venus</hi>

whose Example it grew in Custom

when they had consumed their
Farms, were wont to compel their
Daughters to turn Syrens for the
future Maintenance of them and
themselves. <hi>Aspacia</hi> was a great
Benefactor to <hi>Betty-land,</hi> for she
filled all <hi>Greece</hi> with Syrens, and
for the Love of her, and for the
Injury which the Megareans did
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in taking some of her young
Syrens from her, <hi>Pericles</hi> began
that fatal and lasting Peloponnesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
War. <hi>Heliogabulus</hi> was a very
great Benefactor, for he had all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51868:60"/>
Conveniences belonging to <hi>Betty-land</hi>-Love
in his own House: He
gave to all the Roman Matrons that
would turn Syrens, not only Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
but Impunity. <hi>Caesar</hi> was
so great a Benefactor, that he was
called the Male for all Females:
<hi>Rhodope</hi> also the great Friend and
Companion of <hi>Aesop,</hi> that made
the Fables, got so much Wealth by
the occupation of a Syren, that she
built a Pyramid accounted the third
wonder of the World: And <hi>Flora</hi>
left the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> her Heir.
Of later times Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> was a
very great Benefactor to <hi>Betty-land,</hi>
who built a most Noble Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
for Syrens at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor
are his Successors less kind, by
whom they are still indulged, only
paying a <hi>Iulio</hi> a week to the
Church, and it is a good Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
to the Priests of <hi>Pan</hi> in that
Country, to have an Allotment
out of the <hi>Bordelli,</hi> to make up
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51868:60"/>
the defects of other Endowments.
As for Example, A Curate-ship
worth twenty Crowns. A Priory
worth 40 Ducats, and 3 Syrens
in the <hi>Bordelli</hi> at 20 <hi>Iulio</hi>'s a week.
Nor are the Venetians less munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Benefactors, from whom they
have all Immunity desirable, nor
are the Syrens less grateful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
considerable Incomes to the
Commonwealth, for they being
the Bulworks of <hi>Christendom</hi> are
allowed all ways imaginable to
support their urgent and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Necessities. <hi>Plato</hi> was also a
great Benefactor to <hi>Betty-land,</hi> for
his Laws were for a Community
of Shepherdesses, among whose
followers we may reckon the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitan
Hereticks, who to avoid the

               </gap>ipes of that Fury, Jealousie,
thought it more Convenient that
the Huswifes of their Country
should be prostituted. Thus we
see how <hi>Betty-land</hi>-Love has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51868:61"/>
and charm'd the wisest
Husbandman in all Ages. There is
a strange Venom in it, and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
Success and Plenty with a
strange Rage, of both which, he

They have such an Awe on the

latter are easily drawn to give
their Appetite a Diversion where
they can trust with so much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
not to yield were to

to break off the Communion of
Secrecy. And they Conjecture
not amiss, that believe that many
a <hi>Mother-Midnight</hi> is the more

there being as much pleasure to sit
privately over a Makeroon and a

as in the Enjoyment
it self; for what can be nearer to
Enjoyment, than to tell the very

               </gap>ue Use, Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
you may better see in <hi>Don
Pedro de Lopez,</hi> an Inhabitant in
that part of <hi>Betty land</hi> called <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
having with a curious Eye
observed such Persons as he judged
fitting to enjoy his Person, at
length plac'd his Affection upon a
Shepherdess in that Country na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Cleandra,</hi> who was easily
perswaded by his Wealth to yield
her self wholly to his disposal:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51868:65"/>
Among the rest of this Shepherds
Acquaintance, was one <hi>Lysarchus,</hi>
whom <hi>Cleandra</hi> no sooner saw, but
she judg'd him worth to bear a
part in that Kindness which she
shewed her own Shepherd. <hi>Lysar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
percieving how things stood,
resolv'd with all Secrecy to manage
his Affairs. <hi>De Lopez</hi> with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Eyes beheld the more than
usual Familiarity between <hi>Lysar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
and <hi>Cleandra,</hi> and resolves to
find out the truth: whereupon he
feign'd a Journy to some other
part of the Country, pretending Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
that would stay himfor some
time, but returning privately the
same night, found <hi>Lysarchus</hi> and
<hi>Cleandra</hi> together, in the most
forbidden place by Friendship in
the whole World; such was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
Shepherds Amazement then,
that he would have slain them
both presently, but upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of his Passion, minding to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51868:65"/>
give them both some time of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
wished for his Boy to
fetch him one of the Priests of
<hi>Pan,</hi> intending after he had fitted
them to Sacrifice them both to that
Deity, being the only horned God
which the Poets mention.</p>
            <p>But to the Application of the
Story, this Shepherd had an old
Nurse, who had been a notable
Syren in her time: who hearing
the Passion of <hi>De Lopez,</hi> and the
Charge which he gave the Boy:
Gets up, follows the Boy over the
Plains, bids him go privately home
to sleep, for she would fetch the
Priest of <hi>Pan</hi> her self, which the
Boy tyred with keeping his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Sheep, readily obey'd; so
coming to a Priest, she borrows
the Habits of his Profession, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
she put them on, and
coming back to the Shepherds
Cottage, she found the Shepherd
with the Instruments of Death in his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51868:66"/>
hand, walking in a furious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the next Apartment where
<hi>Lysarchus</hi> and <hi>Cleandra</hi> lay asleep.
The Shepherd perceiving her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
mistaking her in Disguise for
the Priest, bid her go in, awake
them both, and prepare them for
Sacrifice. The Nurse answered
him, That she would not dispute
the Justice of his Revenge, only
entreated him not to disturb them
till her Return, so entring into the
Chamber, she found the two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Betty-land</hi> Embracing
one another after the Fashion of
the Country: she awaked them, and
acquainted them of the Shepherds
Return, what he had seen, his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Intention: which so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
them, that it almost depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them of their Sences. But,
quoth the Nurse, hear the way
that I propose both to deceive and
satisfie the Shepherd. Here, quoth
she, to <hi>Lysarchus,</hi> take this Habit,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51868:66"/>
and put it on, and then you may
adventure out, for the shepherd
will mistake you for the Priest,
which I Counterfeit. Up gets
<hi>Lysarchus,</hi> while the Nurse laid
her self in the same place; as he
went forth the Shepherd met
him, and only asked him if he had
done what he was sent for? who
reply'd, he had perform'd his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
the Shepherd then entring
into <hi>Cleandra</hi>'s Apartment, False
Shepherdess, quoth he, behold
him here whom you have wronged,
I hope you are sufficiently prepar'd
for Sacrifice. To which, she faintly
answer'd, Alas! dear shepherd,
first let me know my Crime, before
I receive my Punishment. Can
you be Innocent, quoth he, and
yet admit strange Cattle into my
Enclosure? Oh dire mistake, quoth
she! and then uncovering the
Nurses Face, see here the strange
Heiser that Grazes in your Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51868:67"/>
in your Absence I only took
my Nurse a-field with me to bear
me Company. At these words the
Shepherd stood amaz'd with Joy
and Grief; with Grief, to have
unjustly suspected her; with Joy,
to find himself mistaken: which
immediately caus'd him to Embrace
her, &amp; to promise her for the future,
never to harbor an ill Thought of
her. So subtle are these <hi>Betty-land</hi>
Nurses in promoting and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Bettyland-</hi> Love, and deceiving
the poor Shepherds; for as
they are generally very great
Thieves themselves, so they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
value the robbing their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Fruit, the breaking of his
Hedges, and what strange Cattle
seed upon his Tillage: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Betty-land,</hi> especially the
better sort, spend much of their
time in the Fields and Gardens,
which by some of the meaner
Sheph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rds, are kept beautifi'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51868:67"/>
and trim'd, for the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
and Entertainment of all
comers. There also you may
have Collations of all sorts, and
several Varieties of delightful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
but so excessively dear, as if
<hi>Betty-land-</hi> Love and Expence were
both born Twins. And it is most
certainly averred, that the Son of
<hi>Neptune</hi> and Father of <hi>Orion,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
three of the greatest Gods
then in being, at less Charge than
a Shepherd can entertain 3 Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdesses
in one of these Gardens.
For such is the potent Virtue of
Rhenish-Wine and Sugar for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
that tho the Shepherdesses
rose but 2 hours before from a
plentiful Meal, yet you shall see
them fall upon the Junkets of these
places with so much fresh Fury, and
devour with so much Greediness, as
if they had never eaten before, or
that they were not to feed again in
half a year after: To ask the price of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51868:68"/>
anything herein this place, or to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Bill when it is brought up,
is a Crime as inexpiable as the Gods
to swear by <hi>Stix,</hi> and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd;
for <hi>Betty-land</hi> is at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Antipathy with all manner of
Frugality, and the Shepherdesses
(like the Husbandmen of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
that guess at the Fertility of the
Year by the overflowing of <hi>Nile)</hi>
make their chief Conject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res what
manner of Lives they shall lead,
when marryed to their Shepherds,
by the overslowing Prodigality
of the Shepherds Pockets in these
places, so that unless a Shepherd
comes very well provided into
one of these Gardens, he shall find
himself so intreagu'd in a Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
that instead of an Hespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Garden, or the Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>Tempe,</hi> he finds himself in
one of the Labyrinths of <hi>Minos,</hi>
out of which he shall not be able
to find the way, till he has pawn'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51868:68"/>
to the owner his Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to make amends to morrow.
This, if it be discovered among
the Shepherdesses, into what a

               </gap>yer it puts the poor Shepherd,
what Shifts, what Excuses, he is
forced to pump for and borrow
from his wrackt Invention. But
the Shepherdesses laugh and whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and are glad of the Occasion,
for they are sure now he must make
them 3 or 4 Treatments more to
secure his Credit: <hi>Eumolpus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

observ'd a melancholly Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
walking by himself, with so

or that he had been studying for

who made several turns Cheek by

when he would unlock the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of his Lips: but finding him
very frugal of his words, Sir, quoth
he, I have seldom come into a

in his left Palm, and picking

to such young Gallants as

Mony then the Cause, said <hi>Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
that the Leaves look so green?
that the Birds are so merry? or
that the Sun shines so bright? No,
quoth he, but 'tis the Mony in
the Shepherd's Pockets that make

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51868:69"/>
have claw'd my Pockets. I have
been as great a haunter of these
Gardens, as the best of them all,
and when all was a going, I cry'd,
<hi>Sera est in fundo Parsimonia,</hi> and
that cursed Proverb hath left me

I am come here to Imprint the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
of my Folly the deeper into
my Breast by the sight of those
places where my Folly bewitcht
me: Nothing vexes me, but that
I have spent my Fortune upon Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats,
and in adoring such a sort
of Goddesses, that are the most
peccant in the World, especially
as to that abominable Sin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
Ask them but only to
let you have a Child, as the Gods
gave <hi>Hiaereus</hi> for his loving Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
and they plead so many
Inconveniences, as if there were
no Mandrakes or Savine in the
Country, for they generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those Favors, for those that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51868:70"/>
are less bountiful, in that only kind
that they believe it too severe that
a poor Shepherd should empty two
Purses at one time. <hi>Eumolpus</hi> to
gain a further discovery from his
inward Dissatisfaction, invited the
sad Shepherd to drink a Bottle of
Wine in an adjoyning A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eaves
afforded Casements sufficient to

Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st came along a brisk young
Shepherd, so gay and so be-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon'd,
that he seem'd to have a
Nose-Gay (of all the Flowers then
flourishing) upon his Cod-piece,
his Breeches lookt as if they had
been beset with Tulips, as if what
they cover'd conceal'd the same
Spring and lively Vigor as the
Earth that produc'd the natural
Colours: he spoke in Raptures,
for he disdained the very Sun that
gliss'ned upon his Carnations in
comparison of those Suns which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51868:70"/>
were by and by to devour his
Tarts. If a Nightingale chanc'd
to Warble, O Madam! quoth he,
this is Incomparable, but nothing
to the divine Melody of your Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Voice; his officious hand carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Shepherdesses Fan, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he cool'd himself, &amp; sometimes
her, and when he took it from
her Lips, he breath'd out nothing
but Sighs, that <hi>Arabia Faelix</hi> had
lost all her Odors: The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdesses
that Grac't his Company
were like so many <hi>Iris</hi>'s, full as
Gay, and altogether as full of
Tongue, laughing and smiling
they threw their heads about, as
if they had been willing they should
have fallen from their Shoulders,
to have been taken up like their
Gloves; so merry and so wanton,
as if they had never known a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
Thought; so far from
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eming to have never been in
Love, that they seem'd to be the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51868:71"/>
Controllers of Love himself. The
sad Shepherd, at their approach
made them a most Reverend O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beysance,
which they as mildly
return'd, calling him by his name,
but they were no sooner past, but
he laid violent hands upon his own
Hair, with such a passion, as if
he would have pulled off as much
as would have made a Scourge to
have driven them out of the Alley.
These Shepherdesses, quoth he, I
know very well, and they know
me, and good Reason they have;
for, quoth he—casting a grim look
after them—but let that pass.
These are they that are called by
the names of <hi>Precious Ones,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their Youth and Beauty,
and their civil Easiness to receive the
Caress of a Treatment. They go
for great Fortunes, quoth he, but
if the Shepherds their Fathers
could put them off with those
Clothes, the Devil of a Rag more
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51868:71"/>
would they give them. Could
there be but one found among them
that had but a Portion really half
as large as her Swallow, I fear I
should go to my old trade again,
and strive to undo one Taylor more
than I have done: By and by came
another Shepherd with a gang of
another so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of Shepherdesses,
they were as glorious as the former,
but not so young as they, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so Handsom, they seem'd
to move in a dancing posture, and
now and then they would sing half
a dozen Notes of a new Air: in
their Discourse they seem'd to hold
Arguments, and to talk upon
Themes of Love; whatever they
said, it was not for the Shepherd
to reply, but only to listen, bow,
and smile, and make a nod upon me
of those that said nothing. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the sad Shepherd struck to
them as they pass'd along, but when
they were gone, these are they,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51868:72"/>
quoth he, that are called the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
Ones.</hi> They are Witty, but
seldom Rich, which makes them
the more easie of Access: They
look High, and their chief Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
is, when a wealthy Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
will fall into the Trap of
their Admiration, they gull, and
are gull'd, for the Shepherds that
obtain them, never think of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
till they are upon their last
Legs. In short, as it is their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Aim, so they make more Rapes
upon the Purse, than upon the
Heart. By and by another Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,

what they say. Toward the
Evening, and just upon Sun-set,
we heard a couple of Chariots stop
at the Garden-Gate, and strait in

Shepherdesses, the Shepherds huf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
and dinging, the Shepherdes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
flanting and ranting; <hi>Iuno</hi>'s with
<hi>Ganimedes</hi> bearing their Trains,
they did so lowt and stare, that
they clear'd all before them, their
Talk was lowd, and presently the
Husbandman that owned the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
was called for, who came
creeping and cringing to receive
their Commands. These present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enquired what Rarities he had
ready, who presently returned
them a Banquet of hard Names,
that would have puzzled the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

his Obeysance to them, as they
passed along, but they little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. These, quoth he, are the
most ingrateful Shepherdesses of
all living, for when you have
spent all your Estate and all your
Marrow to boot on them, they
think they have received nothing
but their due. The Reason why
they appear in the Dark is, because
they fly the Sun, as the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void

their Faces, more than Rain
the others habits. For these are
they who are called <hi>Besmeared Ones,

are not able to know their own
Faces when they meet them in
their Looking-Glasses. The poor
Shepherds seem to be accompanied
only with the beloved Statues of
their own making, enlivened by
the kindness of the Gods and their

ploughs up their Faces, but

what if it be not, were I an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary,

they go together by the Ears, and
it looks like the Contest between

and Horse-play, first riding

that the Age is so unfortunate to

mad as to let them, but then they
rue it, when they find the young Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes
have been dancing so long that
they can hardly go, for the weight
of their Bellies. This is the Art
that first witches them to kick up

of gesticular and obscene Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Opportunities of pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,

Antick Dancers whose Clothes
have been made streight to their
Limbs, have been sent far off the
Stage by great Shepherdesses to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the strength of Imagination.
They have a Musician too, of whom
they learn half a dozen Lessons on
Virginals, and 3 or 4 sing-Songs by
Rote. A little Musick goes a great
way with them, only to make a
Caterwauling noise, when their
Parents come to see them, and to
show they do not give their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for nothing. Besides all this,
they learn very dextrously to play
the little Thieves for their Bellies,
to Junket in corners, which they
practise afterwards to the no small
Expence of their Espousers, but

Chastity, good Huswifery, or well

            <p>The people of <hi>Betty-land</hi> are

he reviv'd at the sight of her, and
all for the Love of his Mother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Law:
Nay, and the old doting
Shepherd his Father was forced to
quit the pleasure of his old Age
to save the young Fop his Son, O
most unparallel'd Success of a <hi>Betty-land</hi>-Frenzy!
They that put <hi>Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
upon Interrogatories whether
he enjoy'd most satisfaction as a

have put the question to this young
Shepherdess, which she lik't best,

there is scarce a Book in all

            <p>Sterility and Frigidity are two

they do more pester and trouble

of his Body, burnt him to death.
All which in verity was nothing

Hermetical Astrologers, Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

such an Alarm in the world,
that the <hi>Curats, Parish-Clerks,</hi>
and <hi>Sextons,</hi> nay the whole <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
Office</hi> was in an up-roar,
and all joyning together, drew
up a Remonstrance, which they
presented to Death. One of
the Curates in a formal set-Speech,
inform'd his meagre Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of the danger he was in,
how many new Pills, Potions, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Elixirs, Spirits of Salt, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinges,
and Chimical Extractions
these Enemies of his had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to his Destruction. To
commiserate the Ruin of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Families that liv'd by Dust
to Dust, Grave-digging, Bell-tolling,
Chancel-ground, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Isle-ground,
and Belfry-ground.
To pitty the decay of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51868:91"/>
the Civil-Law, should they lose
the Probat of Wills: On the
other side, the people of <hi>Betty-land</hi>
finding that they were now
to be immortal, fell to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Debauchery, Gluttoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
Drinking, Whoring, to the
height of all Excess, laying all
care of Health aside, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needless and frivolous, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
Claps and Pox with
that boldness, as if they had
done it in defiance of Death,
making Lampoons against that
poor. Miscreant, as if he had
not been worthy to wipe their
Shooes. As for Old <hi>Time</hi> with
his Scyth, they bid him go to
Harvest-work, and labor hard
in the Summer, lest he is star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> too were
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51868:91"/>
not a little troubled to hear
these things, and therefore
to understand the truth of
their Practices, they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to take a turn or two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Town. The main
Obstacle was to get into
<hi>Moorfields,</hi> where the chief
heads of the Rebellion liv'd,
for fear of the Prentices.
But time being the master
of Opportunity, bid him
leave that to his Care: so
coming into the Street, they
beheld to their no small A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment,
all the Posts, all
the dead Walls, all the Posterns,
all the Arches so be-plaistered,
so be-smear'd with Bills and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51868:92"/>
printed Papers bidding open
defiance against them, as if
the Bricks and Stone would
sink under their several bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
with the Support and
Enablement of these potent
Sear-Cloths. By and by comes
a Fellow with a Brush and
pot of Past, and his Arms
full of Quarto's, and giving
Death such a shoulder, as
had almost thrown him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kennel, claps up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
brisk Challenge i'th
very teeth of him; Death let
him go as he came, for he
did not like his Company,
and when he was gone fell
to Reading. In the first

place, No Cure no Mony,
Cheek by Jowl by that stood,
At the <hi>Gun</hi> in <hi>Moorfields</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

time the subtler of the two,
gave him kind words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
assuring him that he

time to let these Boasters find
how vainly they contested
with so great a Prince as
he was. But as publick as
