         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

FAITH, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR FRIENDS:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great Work of God in the Sons and Daughters of
Men, is to purifie the Heart, and make clean the
inward, part which is through Faith in his Son;
Faith is the Gift of God, and the work of it is to
purifie the Heart, and cleanse the inside from dead
workes, to serve him the true and living God, in
the newness thereof; this is the great work of God
in and through Faith in his Son, to work out the old Leaven, and mould
into a new Lump, to make the Heart anew, the Mind heavenly, and the
Soul living.</p>
            <p>Oh! the blessed effects of True and Saving Faith; even that Faith
which stands in the Power of God, which as Man and Woman comes
truly to the knowledge of, with the Heart such comes truly to believe
in God, and Confession with the Mouth is made to Salvation, and so
gradually a casting off and forsaking every thing that is Evil, whereby a
learning to do well (by the Teachings of the Grace thorough Faith) comes
more and more to be known, this is the blessed Effects of true and saving
Faith, which true faith thorough the power of it, works a true tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Heart, instead of hardness, and brings to true openness those
that have been shut up, and into a true nearness with the Lord, and one
with another, even such that have been far seperated from him, and that
by Wicked Workes; this is true Faith, that works in the Heart, to the
overcoming of it, which is True and Saving Faith, saves them that were
lost, quickens them that were dead, and brings them in and through the
Strength and Power thereof, to serve the true and living God, in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Life.</p>
            <p>The blessed Effects of this true and saving Faith, is to make Clean,
Pure and Holy, sanctifies throughout both in Body, Soul and Spirit;
makes a new Creature, which brings to a true Knowledge, <hi>What it is to
be in Christ Iesus,</hi> and so the Heart and Mind with the whole Affections,
comes to be set on things that are Heavenly, Everlasting and Eternal:
Oh! the pure change and blessed Alteration that comes to be known
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97184:3"/>
herein and hereby; Man that hath been unclean, is made clean, and
Man and Women that hath been unholy and impure, is made holy and
pure; and so in the Holy Life, Holy Men and Holy Women come to
worship and serve the pure Holy God, in the Newness, Livingness and
Tenderness thereof; and so according to measure, whether more or less,
come with the Blessed Apostle, to say, by living experience; <hi>The Life
that I now live, is by Faith in the Son of God.</hi> Here, <hi>Old things are past
away, and behold all things are become new.</hi> the old words past away,
the bad Actions and vain Conversation put off, which is for Judgment and
Condemnation, which being put off, the Armour of Light, and true and
saving Faith comes to be put on through the blessed Effects thereof.</p>
            <p>So in and thorough this true and saving Faith, that stands in the Power
of God, Gods people come to have their Armour on, whereby and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of which, they are made more then Conquerors, made able to
withstand all the Fiery D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rts of the Devil, and all his Instruments both
within and without, are made able thorough this same Faith with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to leap over a Wall, run through a Troop, and to break that which
is as a Bow of Steel Spiritually, that otherwise, to wit, out of the Faith,
cannot be got over, run through, nor broken: Oh! what is too hard,
for those that are of and in this true and saving Faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the Author unto the</hi> Hebrews <hi>saith, the 11th Chap. Vers. 22th,
having spoken largly of the Fruits and Effects of Faith, saith he,</hi> What
shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of <hi>Gideon,</hi> and of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riak,</hi>
and of <hi>Sampson,</hi> and of <hi>Jephthar,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and also of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
and of the Prophets; who through Faith subdued Kingdomes; wrought
Righteousness; obtained Promises; stopped the Mouths of Lyons; quenched
the violence of Fire; escaped the Edge of the Sword; out of weakness, were
made strong; Women received their Dead raised to Life again; and others
were tortured, not accepting of Deliverance, that they might obtain a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Resurrection; and others had Tryals of Cruel Mockings and Scourgings;
yea, moreover of Bonds and Imprisonment; they were stoned, they were
sawn asunder, were Tempted, were slain with the Sword, they wandered
about in Sheep-Skins, and Goat-Skins, being distitute, afflicted, tormented,
of whom the World was not worthy, they wandered in Desarts and in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
and in Dens and Caves of the Earth, and these all have obtained a
good report through Faith.</p>
            <p>So Dear Friends, Brethren and Sisters, whereever this may come, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom the Salutation of my Life reacheth; try your selves, prove your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97184:3"/>
selves, for that end you may know whether you be in this Faith or not,
whereby all these blessed Effects are wrought and brought to pass, and
many more, to the making perfect throughout, and none to content or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your selves with the word <hi>Faith,</hi> or with the bare <hi>Profession of Faith;</hi>
but carefully mind what Christ Jesus our Lord saith, <hi>If thou have Faith
as a grain of Mustard seed, thou shalt say unto this Mountain, be thou
removed, and it shall be so.</hi> If Faith in this small measure or degree,
through the blessed effects of it, be thus able, or those whose Faith is no more,
thus gain Victory, how much more Victory shall those obtain that keep it
unto the end, for it's those that finish in that same Faith in which they
have begun, that shall be saved, and that the Crown of Life and of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Glory is laid up for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now some may say that are young in the Truth, and that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
may bear hard upon by Temptations,</hi> I thought I had had Faith in
some Measure, however in the least degree, and yet those things stand in my
way, like Mountaines, that I cannot get over as yet, and great Oppositions
and Temptations I meet with, both within and without, that prevail with
me.</p>
            <p>Dear Friend, in much tenderness doth my Soul breath unto the Lord
for thy Deliverance, and in order that thou may be delivered from that
which so oppresses thee in Spirit, or stands in thy way, [mark well what
I say unto thee] thou willest too much, and through thy willing thou
would run too fast, and make too much haste through thy Will, striving to
be out and over things, which is the great cause of hindering thee, or
why thou comes sho<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of obtaining Victory through Faith; and that thou
dost not come to know the blessed Effects or Work of it in thy Heart
and inward part. Remember the Counsel given to <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>Thy
Strength oh Israel, is to stand still:</hi> So true Strength, Ability and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thorough Faith, over and against Enemies both within and without, is in
<hi>standing still,</hi> and being quiet and cool in thy mind; for as the Scriptures
of Truth testifie, it is certainly true, <hi>It's not in him that wills nor runs,
the Battle is not unto the Strong, nor the Race unto the Swift.</hi> And Christ
saith, <hi>Which of you by taking thought can add one Cubit to your Stature?</hi>
So to stand still and patiently wait to receive the true power that the Lord
will give to all in his own time (though not in their's) that patiently
wait for it, that so patience in thee may have its perfect work, that so true
Experience thou may gain of Victory given unto thee, over all the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Enemy through Faith in the Power of God, and so will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97184:4"/>
all those things come to be removed out of thy way that thou stands questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
and reasoning about, and this is true Faith indeed, that gives Victory,
and its known to be so by the blessed Effects of it, and as Christ said,
<hi>This is that which gives Victory, even your Faith;</hi> and this is the way
thorough Faith for all to come to know an Anchoring and Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the sure Rock, through Faith and Hope, that never makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed.</p>
            <p>And now Dear Friends, unto all you whom God in and through Christ
Jesus his Son, hath not only called to believe in his Name, but also to
suffer for Truth and Righteousness sake; Blessed and Happy of the Lord
are all you, and happy shall you be, if you continue unto the end, that
hath a true Knowledge and right Understanding, that your Suffering is
for Truth and Righteousness sake, (that is to say) whose Suffering is for
Christs sake, as those that are his, that he hath Redeemed, and Saved,
and Sanctified by his Blood, Death and Suffering, as those that are not
your own, nor any thing you have or enjoy, (mark well and take good
Notice, <hi>as those</hi>) that your Suffering may be for Christ your Redeemer,
your Saviour, your Shepherd, Counsellor, King, Priest, and Law-giver,
and so for Righteousness, <hi>as those,</hi> that because of the tenderness of
your Consciences cannot do, nor consent to be done, that which is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
Unjust, nor Lawful, according to the righteous Law of God,
and tends to Oppression.</p>
            <p>Blessed and Happy of the pure God are all you whose Suffering is on
this wise and in this manner; for it is not only that any doth suffer,
whether in Body or Goods, that will tend to bring the recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
home, to the comfort of the Heart, and joy of the Soul, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
encouragement in the Suffering; but also that you all know and
be sensible for what you suffer (to wit) to be in the Name, in the Power,
in the Truth, in the Seed Christ, for which you suffer; here is the true
ease, the true peace, the true quietness in Spirit in Suffering this makes
the Yoak easie, and the Burthen light, and the blessed Recompence of
Reward from the Heavenly Hand of the Blessed God cometh, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto all such of an Hundred fold in this Life, and also shall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
Life Everlasting, as Christ Jesus our Lord said unto <hi>Peter, Where
there is a willingness to forsake Father or Mother, Wife or Children, Houses
or Lands for his Name sake, this shall be their Reward.</hi> So Dear Friends,
the Councel and Advice of my Life unto you all, in the Testimony of it is,
that you all be truly careful what you suffer in and for, that none may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97184:4"/>
have only a Name that you live, and be dead; but as those who have Faith
in the just Principle, and are in a Spiritual Travail; for if any one suffer
in Body or Goods, and not in the Truth, that will be a sad comfortless
Suffering.</p>
            <p>So Dear Friends, while as a great Mercy from God, you have yet
Health and Liberty to meet together to Worship and serve him, be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in meeting often together, First day and Week day (Men &amp; Womens
Meetings) and when met, be diligent in waiting upon him, for to receive of
his living power from day to day, and time to time, which is that which
truly Fits, Furnishes and Prepares in every good Word, Work and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
I say, make good use of time every one, in being truly careful how
you spend it, for it's the ill use made of time, or the careless squander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of it, that makes many unfit for a day and time of Tryal, when
called thereunto; remember the ten Virgins they had all Lamps, but five
wanted Oyl, and it's said their Lamps were gone out; it seems they once
did shine, (mark) they were all called unto to prepare, but the five Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
wanted wherewith, and so were left behind, and the door was shut
against them, as to enter into rest, and pertake of Joy, because of their
Unwatchfulness, and Sleepy Sluggardliness in the time they had given them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and although they came calling and crying afterward, it was to no purpose,
the door was shut; it's plain there was a time the door was open, when
the Wise, that had both the Lamps and Oyl entered in; so all be upon your
watch continually, with a care to have Oyl in your Lamps, that an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Place of Rest, where you shall pertake of Joy unspeakable
and full of Glory in your Suffering, as in a House and Habitation of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where none nor nothing can make afraid; that if the Storm or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
Tryal last long, you shall never want for Bread, but it will be
sure, and your Water will never fail; for he for whose Name Sake ye
suffer, will spread your Table, fill your Cup, and maintain your cause;
where your Communion will be sweet with the Lord, and your Unity
and Fellowship will be very comfortable, that you will have and feel,
with all his Faithful Suffering People.</p>
            <p>This is the Counsel and Advice of your Brother, in Bowels of tender
Love, that all who do suffer in oppression for Truth and Righteousness
sake, that it may be on this wise and in this manner, that so cause of great
Encouragement you may all have in and under Suffering, whether in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
or Goods, which I can give in Truth by good experience, (to wit,
<hi>Encouragement to all faithful Sufferers</hi>) who have had my own Goods
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97184:5"/>
spoiled, and my Body Imprisoned time after time, and now am a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
because for Conscience I cannot uphold that great oppression of
Tythes; and the same day and hour I was to go to Prison, were the Spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
carrying away my Goods, for no greater Crime then Worshipping
and Serving the Lord my God; and oh! the <hi>Ioy, Gladness,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi>
that was in my Heart and Soul, that same hour and moment of
time, being I was truly sinsible of the cause wherefore I suffered the
same, being born up in my Understanding, my Joy was unutterable
on this wise, and under this consideration, <hi>That the Lord my God should
not only count me worthy to believe in his Name, but also to suffer for the
same, and in that that Christ Iesus the Son of the Fathers love suffered
all to save and redeem my Soul;</hi> and therefore should not I willingly offer
up all I had and did enjoy, in answer to what God through Christ his
Son had done for me? yea surely, I said in my Heart, <hi>Ile offer up all
freely;</hi> I speak to his Praise and Glory, and the great Encouragement of all
faithful willing Sufferers, whose Suffering on this wise will never be weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
nor tedious unto you, no murmuring nor complaining will take place,
or have room in any such a Heart, as to say or think, <hi>How shall I live?
Or how shall my Wife and Children be maintained? Or my Business carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on?</hi> (not to be void of an honest care in those things) yet not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
because of the Suffering.</p>
            <p>What! is not God Almighty All-sufficient for the Soul? And must
not he be relied upon, through Christ his Son our Lord, for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof? And is not he that is all-sufficient for the Soul, sufficient for
the Body also? (yea assuredly, by living experience can my Soul
say) and is not the Earth the Lord's, and the fulness thereof? And
cannot he take and give according to his Good Will and Pleasure?</p>
            <p>Let all remember the <hi>Patience of Iob,</hi> in his still retaining his Integrity,
in his deep Affliction and Suffering, both in Goods and Body, whose Wife
gave him bad Counsel, in saying, <hi>Wilt thou alwayes retain thine Integrity?
Curse God, and Die:</hi> but he refused it, and reproved her; and suffered
the loss of all his Thousands of Sheep and Camels, and Hundreds of
Oxen; all his Children and Servants; yet the Lord restored him double,
so that it's said, <hi>The latter end of Iob, was far more Happy and Blessed
than the Beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! that the care of all called to suffer may be, to refuse all <hi>Evil
Counsel,</hi> given either by Wife or Husband, Kinsfolk or Relations, that
would perswade any to require the Lord Evil for Good, and desert their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97184:5"/>
Testimony in Suffering, as such that would give Counsel on this wise.

            <p>Oh! what Encouragement hath all the Faithful in Suffering, to trust
the Lord with all they have and do enjoy, rightly to consider, and mind
the <hi>Patience of Iob;</hi> the <hi>Faithfulness of Daniel;</hi> and the <hi>Faith, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
and <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego; Daniel</hi> could
not but open his Window, and Pray to his God, though a Decree
made to the contrary, to cast him into the <hi>Den of Lyons,</hi> the Angel of
whose Presence shut their Mouths, and preserved <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Servant of
the Living God; as the King was made to call him, when he saw his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
            <p>Oh! the great Encouragement that all the Faithful have in Suffering,
for the Kings and Rulers of the Earth with many People, are made to
confess, <hi>We are the People of God indeed;</hi> when they see us to stand faithful
in our Testimony, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> was made to call the three Servants
of the Lord before named, <hi>Come forth ye Servants of the Most High God;</hi>
although before as many now will, (threatned) that, <hi>If they would not
fall down, and Worship the Image he had set up, they should be cast into
the Fiery Furnace, seven times hotter then ever; and who is that God that
shall be able to deliver out of my Hand?</hi> said he; yet as the Lord had
then, so he hath a way now, to deliver all whose Trust and Confidence is
in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beyond the expectation of the Wickedest and Cruellest of Men,
notwithstanding their Fury and Decrees made in their Wills; for <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach,
Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> said, <hi>Be it known unto thee O King, we
will not serve thy Gods, for our God whom we serve is able to deliver us
from the Burning Fiery Furnace; and if not, we are not careful to answer
thee in this matter.</hi> And so because they could not bow to the Kings I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
at the sounding of several sorts of Instruments of Musick, they
were bound, and cast into the Burning Fire, with their <hi>Coats, Hosen,</hi>
and <hi>Hatts;</hi> and the Flame of the Furnace was so great, that those Men
that cast them in, were slain thereby; but not so much as one Hair
of the Head of the three Faithful Servants of the Lord singed, nor the
smell of Fire found on their Cloaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97184:6"/>
Oh! what great Encouragement is here, for all that in any measure
know God, to believe and trust in him in Suffering, whether in Body or
Goods, though never so deep; for hereby it's evident and plain, that the
Lords always had, and hath a true regard to his People, who by the
Angel of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is Presence and Arm of his great Power, the more need they
stood and stand of him, so accordingly he appears, and works their
Deliverance, (according to that saying, <hi>The Rod of the Wicked shall not
always ly upon the back of the Righteous</hi>) and not only so but brings
Plagues and Judgments upon the Heads of the Persecutors and Afflictors
of his faithful Ones; <hi>One Hair of whose Head,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall not
fall to the ground without your Fathers Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although <hi>Herod</hi> the King, the troubler of the Church, then killed
<hi>Iames;</hi> and because it pleased the <hi>Iews,</hi> he took <hi>Peter</hi> also, and put
him in Prison, intending to bring him forth to the People, with Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
intents no doubt; but the same Night before he so intended, although
<hi>Peter</hi> lay bound in Prison with two Chaines betwixt two Soldiers, an
Angel from God came upon him, and loosed his Chains, and caused the
Iron-gate to open of its own accord; and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> they were put
in the Inward Prison, after they had been beat and sore abused, and
their Feet fastened in the Stocks, (mark, in the Inner Prison) where
they Prayed and sang Praises unto God at Midnight; and such was the
wonderful Appearance, of the great Power of the Mighty God, that
caused the Prison Doors to open, that it's said, <hi>The Foundations of the
Prison were shaken,</hi> and when the Jailer awaked, he thought to have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself, seeing the Doors open, supposing the Prisoners had been
fled; but <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Do thy self no harm, we are all here;</hi> and then he
came trembling, when he perceived what was done, and said, <hi>What shall
I do to be Saved?</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> spoke unto him the Word of
the Lord, and bid him, <hi>Believe in the Lord Iesus Christ, and he should be
Saved;</hi> and he and all his House Believed.</p>
            <p>Oh! what great Encouragement is here, for all faithful honest Hearted
Friends, though in and under Suffering, or that yet may be called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to go on in all faithfulness, freely giving up Life and Liberty, and
all into the Lords hand, willing to cast their care and put their Confidence
in him, who hath all power in his own hand, to do and bring to pass what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
seems good in his own Eyes; Oh! how the Wicked many times
in the height of their Wickedness are frustrated, and Gods People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all expectation preserved and delivered, as you your selves have
many times been made living Witnesses; hold it fast Dear Friends in your
Remembrance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97184:6"/>
And you may also see when there is a freely giving up to answer what
the Lord requires, in the faithful performance of the same, thorough the
Might of Gods Power, Peoples Hearts and Consciences are reached,
to the causing of them to tremble, whereby good desires are begotten
and raised, <hi>What Men shall do to be Saved;</hi> though before they have
been Persecutors and Afflictors of Gods People, as you may see by
the <hi>Goaler</hi> afore mentioned, and whose care it is thus to walk and shew
forth a Godly Conversation and Example in doing or suffering, so as to
reach to the Witness of God in Peoples Consciences, though in the
Inner Prison, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> was, they have not only cause to bless
and praise the Holy Name of the Pure God, for accompanying them
by the Angel of his Presence, but also to Sing and make Melody unto
him in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>For now, Dear Friends, and Suffering Brethren, though the Lord our
God see it good so to come to pass, for a tryal of your Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to see how you will trust in him, in the hour of Temptation and
time of Tryal, that Man shall be so far permitted, to take your Goods,
and seperate you from your dearest and nearest Relations, your Dear
Wives and Tender Children, and put you in Prison; now this is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your Joy and Comfort, being sensible of the Cause wherefore you
suffer, Man with all his Power and Strength, Fury and Rage, cannot sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
you from the pure enjoyment of the presence of the Lord; but by it
reacheth unto his Dear Suffering Lambs, though in a Dungeon; which
if it were not so, above all People we were most Miserable; but now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all People we are most Blessed and Happy; Blessed, and Praised,
and Magnified for evermore be the Holy Name, and great Power of our
God, by and thorough which he always did and doth carry through
all his faithful Children and People; for he is for ever worthy of all
Praise, Honour and Glory, unto him alone be it given, both now and for
ever more, Amen.</p>
            <p>And so Dear Friends put on Courage and Boldness, in the Name,
Fear and Power of the Most High, as an Armour, faithfully to follow
your Captain, the Lord Jesus Christ, that will never leave you nor
forsake you, except you first leave him, who will lead in and through the
good and bad report, the Fire and the Water, the sixt and in the seventh
Trouble and Exercise, will also be your Preserver and Upholder, who
upholds all his by his Word and Power: I say Dear Friends, all in
faithfulness follow your Leader whithersoever he goes; for as you with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97184:7"/>
diligence follow him he will bring you thorough; and bring you forth in
his own time; <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> happy are they that patiently wait till it be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though as
great a Tryal as ever any of his People suffered: Yet I say, if you be
stedfast in the Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will still bring you forth and thorough, more
bright and more pure, Holy and Clean; for the fiery Tryal makes so,
concerning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Marvel not concerning the
Fiery Tryal, as though some strange thing had happened: for it's for no
other end, but that you more and more may shine, as the Stars of Heaven
in the Firmament of his Power;</hi> that so a True, Living and Faithful
Testimony, whether in doing or suffering, Body or Goods, by you all,
according to your several Measures, may be born unto the Truth, and
for the pure God, and his Pure, Holy Worship, and against all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and Unrighteousness that is upheld in the World, that the same
may stand, remain, and be left upon record to after Ages and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
how faithful ye were to God in your day as a confirmation unto
their Faith, and as may greatly tend to their Encouragement, as those
faithful Witnesses that have already finished their course in the Faith of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and are gone to their rest, doth greatly tend to
strengthen the Faith, and encourage all those that yet remain, that are
travelling on in the same way.</p>
            <p>That so in that same love, Pure Life, and true tenderness, into which
at first you were begotten, and raised to bear a faithful Testimony for the
Lord, his Name, Truth and Glory, though but in little and small things
when nothing in that day (all keep it in Mind) was too near or dear for
you to part with, that you may all persevere and fi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ish in that in which

the Beginning and the Ending; the same to Day, Yesterday and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
who is from Everlasting to Everlasting, that so the Crown of Life
and of Immortal Glory may be set upon your Heads, that is laid up in
store for all that in faithfulness continue unto the end; unto which the Lord
God of Life by and through the greatness and strength of his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
keep and preserve you all Faithful in Life and unto Death, and in the
